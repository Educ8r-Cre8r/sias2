      "label": "Glowing Light Bulb",
      "fact": "This tiny light bulb is glowing because electricity is flowing through it, which produces light energy! When energy changes from one form to another, like electricity becoming light, we call that energy transformation. This is called **energy transformation** — that's when one type of energy changes into a different type of energy.",

      "fact": "The red wire and metal parts form a circuit that allows electricity to travel in a complete loop to power the light bulb. Without a complete path for electricity to flow, the bulb won't light up! This is called a **circuit** — that's a complete path that electricity travels around.",
      "vocabulary": {

      "label": "Battery Container",
      "fact": "The black container holds a battery that stores chemical energy and converts it into electrical energy to make the circuit work. Batteries are the power source that pushes electricity through wires to light up the bulb! This is called a **battery** — that's a container that stores chemical energy and turns it into electricity.",

      "label": "Light and Heat Glow",
      "fact": "The bright glow you see from the bulb shows that electrical energy is being converted into both light energy and heat energy at the same time. You can feel the bulb is warm because some of the electrical energy becomes thermal energy! This is called **thermal energy** — that's the energy that makes things feel hot or warm.",
      "vocabulary": {
        "term": "Thermal Energy",
        "definition": "The energy that makes things feel hot or warm; it comes from moving particles in matter."
