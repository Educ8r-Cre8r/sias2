      "fact": "The clear bubble skin you see is made possible by surface tension, which is like an invisible elastic layer on water. This tension allows the bubble to hold its shape without popping immediately."

      "fact": "You can see the red and black colors distorted through the bubble because light bends when it passes through curved surfaces. This bending of light is called refraction and helps create the rainbow-like shimmer on bubbles."
