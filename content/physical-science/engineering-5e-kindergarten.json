ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Spark curiosity about how pushes and pulls make things move using the photograph of motorized LEGO machines.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Printed photograph (8.5\" × 11\" or displayed on screen)\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Real classroom objects (toy car, block, ball)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. Display the photograph and ask students to sit in a circle where everyone can see it clearly.\n  2. Ask these discussion questions one at a time, pausing for 2-3 student responses each:\n     - \"What do you see in this picture? What's happening?\"\n     - \"How do you think these machines are moving? What makes them go?\"\n     - \"Do you see anything that looks like it's being pushed or pulled?\"\n     - \"What would happen if we pushed one of these machines really hard? What if we pushed it gently?\"\n  3. As students share ideas, write key words on chart paper (push, pull, move, fast, slow).\n  4. Prediction prompt: \"I'm going to build a simple machine that moves. What do you think will happen if I push it really hard? What if I pull it gently?\"\n  5. Demonstrate by rolling a toy car across the floor—once with a soft push, once with a hard push. Ask: \"Did it move the same way both times?\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become engineers and scientists. We're going to test different pushes and pulls to see how they make things move. Then we'll build our own pushing and pulling machines!\"\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students investigate how different pushes and pulls affect the movement of objects through hands-on exploration.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Toy cars or wheeled objects (4-6 per group)\n  - Wooden blocks or ramps (various heights)\n  - Open floor space or long tables\n  - Chart paper or whiteboards for recording\n  - Masking tape to mark distances\n  - Variety of small objects (blocks, tennis balls, plastic cups)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Setup:** Divide the class into small groups (3-4 students). Assign each group a station with a clear, flat surface (e.g., a table or taped floor area at least 6 feet long).\n  \n  2. **Station 1 - The Push Test:**\n     - Give each group a toy car and masking tape.\n     - Instruct: \"Push your car gently and watch where it stops. Mark that spot with tape.\"\n     - Then: \"Now push the same car really hard. Mark where it stops.\"\n     - Ask students: \"Which push made it go farther? How do you know?\"\n  \n  3. **Station 2 - The Direction Test:**\n     - Place a toy car in the center of a cleared space.\n     - Instruct: \"Push this car forward. Now push it to the side. Now push it backward.\"\n     - Ask: \"Does the car always move the same way? Can you change which way it goes by pushing in different directions?\"\n  \n  4. **Station 3 - The Knock-Over Challenge:**\n     - Set up 3-4 plastic cups in a line.\n     - Instruct: \"Try to knock over a cup with a gentle push. Now try a hard push. What's different?\"\n  \n  5. **Rotation:** After 5-6 minutes, groups rotate to the next station. Repeat until all groups experience all three stations.\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate between stations and ask guiding questions: \"What happened when you pushed gently? What about when you pushed hard? How was it different?\"\n  - Do NOT tell students the answers; instead, direct them to observe and notice.\n  - Help students use comparison language: \"Which went farther?\" \"Which was faster?\"\n  - Encourage students to repeat tests to check their observations.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students observe and verbalize that stronger pushes make objects move farther and faster.\n  - Students notice that the direction of a push changes the direction of motion.\n  - Students understand that different objects respond to the same push in different ways.\n  - Students record data with drawings, tally marks, or simple written observations.\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect observations to formal science concepts.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple illustrations\n  - Toy car for demonstration\n  - Photograph from Engage phase (displayed again)\n  - Picture cards showing pushes and pulls in real life (optional)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n     - Call the class back together and ask each group to share ONE thing they discovered.\n     - Listen for observations about strength, direction, and distance.\n     - Record their ideas on new chart paper titled \"What We Learned About Pushes and Pulls.\"\n  \n  2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n     - Display and explain these terms using simple language and demonstrations:\n  \n  3. **Reconnect to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n     - Show the LEGO machine photograph again.\n     - Point to the motorized vehicle: \"This machine has a motor inside that creates a PUSH. The wheels push against the ground, and it makes the whole machine MOVE.\"\n     - Point to the standing LEGO figures: \"If this machine pushed into these figures with a strong force, they would fall over—just like when you used a hard push on the cup!\"\n     - Ask: \"Can you spot the PUSH in this picture? Can you see how the force makes things MOVE?\"\n  \n  4. **Check for Understanding:**\n     - Ask individual students: \"Show me a push motion with your arms. Now show me a gentle push. Now a strong push. Good! You're showing how the strength of a push changes!\"\n     - Have students mime pushing and pulling while saying the action word aloud.\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Push:** Using force to move something away from you or to move it in a direction. Example: \"When I push this car, it rolls away.\"\n  - **Pull:** Using force to bring something toward you or to drag it. Example: \"When I pull this toy, it comes closer to me.\"\n  - **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or change direction. Example: \"The force of my push made the car go far.\"\n  - **Motion:** Movement—when something changes position and goes from one place to another. Example: \"The car is in motion; it's moving across the table.\"\n  - **Strong/Gentle:** Words to describe the amount of force. A strong push uses more force; a gentle push uses less force.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students can use the words push, pull, force, and motion in simple sentences.\n  - Students understand that stronger forces cause bigger changes in motion.\n  - Students can connect the LEGO machine photograph to the concept of forces causing movement.\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding of pushes and pulls by designing and testing a simple machine that works as intended.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Building supplies: LEGO bricks or cardboard blocks, toy cars, ramps (cardboard or wood), paper tubes, straws\n  - Objects to move: ping pong balls, small blocks, plastic cups, craft pompoms\n  - Masking tape, string (optional for pulling)\n  - Design templates (optional; simple drawings of ramp, car, target)\n  - Chart paper to document designs\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **The Challenge (presented simply):**\n     - \"Now you're going to be engineers! Your job is to build a machine using pushes or pulls to make something move from one spot to another.\"\n     - Show a simple example: a ramp with a toy car at the top. \"If I push this car down the ramp, will it reach that mark? Let's test!\"\n     - Test it together. Ask: \"Did it work? Should I make the ramp higher to make a stronger push? Should I lower it for a gentler push?\"\n  \n  2. **Small Group Design (10 minutes):**\n     - Divide students into pairs or small groups (3-4 students).\n     - Each group gets to choose ONE challenge:\n       - **Challenge A (Ramp Push):** Build a ramp and push a car down it to reach a target line.\n       - **Challenge B (Target Knock):** Design a way to push or pull an object to knock over a cup or hit a target.\n       - **Challenge C (Distance Contest):** Build a simple launcher (straw + paper cup) to push a pompom as far as possible.\n     - Students sketch their plan on paper or verbally describe it to the teacher.\n  \n  3. **Build and Test (5-7 minutes):**\n     - Students build their simple machine using provided materials.\n     - They test it and observe: Did the push or pull work? Did the object move as planned?\n     - If it didn't work, ask: \"What could we change? Should we use a stronger push? Should we change the direction?\"\n     - Students make one adjustment and test again.\n  \n  4. **Share Results:**\n     - Each group briefly demonstrates their machine and explains: \"We used a PUSH/PULL. It made the object MOVE [describe what happened].\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate and ask: \"What kind of force are you using—push or pull?\" \"Is it working the way you planned?\" \"What could you try differently?\"\n  - Help students troubleshoot without solving the problem for them.\n  - Encourage persistence and celebrating \"experiments that didn't work the first time.\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students design and test a simple machine involving a push or pull.\n  - Students observe whether their design works as intended.\n  - Students can explain in simple terms why their machine worked or didn't work based on the force they used.\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of pushes, pulls, and how forces cause motion.\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n     - Observe students during Explore and Elaborate phases. Note whether they:\n       - Use vocabulary (push, pull, force, move) correctly and spontaneously\n       - Make comparisons between gentle and strong pushes\n       - Adjust their approach when something doesn't work\n       - Recognize cause-and-effect (strong push = farther distance)\n\n  2. **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of lesson):**\n     \n     **Option A – Observation & Response:**\n     Show each student a picture or real scenario of a push or pull. Ask:\n     - \"Is this a push or a pull? How do you know?\"\n     - \"If someone pushes harder, what will happen?\"\n     \n     **Option B – Simple Drawing Task:**\n     Provide a half-sheet of paper divided into two boxes:\n     - Box 1: \"Draw a PUSH.\" Students draw.\n     - Box 2: \"Draw a PULL.\" Students draw.\n     - Facilitate a quick conference: \"Tell me about your drawing. What's being pushed/pulled?\"\n     \n     **Option C – Real-World Application:**\n     Ask: \"Show me something in our classroom that you could push. Now show me something you could pull. How would each one move?\"\n\n- **Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n  - Student correctly identifies at least two real examples of pushes and pulls.\n  - Student demonstrates understanding that stronger forces create larger changes in motion.\n  - Student uses the words \"push,\" \"pull,\" or \"force\" to explain why something moved.\n  - Student can predict what will happen if a push or pull is made stronger or weaker.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students demonstrate mastery of K-PS2-1 by conducting informal investigations comparing pushes and pulls on objects.\n  - Students show progress toward K-PS2-2 by recognizing whether their designed machine works as intended.\n  - Student responses reflect understanding of the cause-and-effect relationship between force and motion.\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (for struggling learners):**\n  1. **Reduce complexity:** Provide only two stations in Explore (Push Test and Knock-Over Challenge) instead of three. Give students more time at each station.\n  2. **Provide sentence frames:** Offer word cards or picture cards showing \"push,\" \"pull,\" \"fast,\" \"slow,\" \"far,\" \"near.\" Students can point to the words or repeat them as they work.\n  3. **Pair with a stronger peer:** During Elaborate, pair a struggling student with a more advanced peer. Ask the peer to help describe what's happening while the struggling student tests the machine.\n  4. **Simplify Elaborate task:** Offer only one challenge option (e.g., just the Ramp Push) with pre-built materials that require minimal construction.\n\n- **Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n  1. **Predict and explain:** During Explore, ask: \"If you push it even HARDER, what do you think will happen? Why?\" Encourage them to make predictions before testing.\n  2. **Combine forces:** In Elaborate, challenge them to use BOTH a push AND a pull in their design. Example: \"Can you design a machine that pulls an object up a ramp and then pushes it across a table?\"\n  3. **Measure and compare:** Provide simple measuring tools (string, blocks as units) and ask: \"How far did your gentle push move the car? How far did your strong push move it? Can you compare?\"\n  4. **Design iterations:** Ask advanced students to redesign their machine to make it work BETTER after the first test. \"What would make your machine push/pull even more effectively?\"\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Push and Pull Walk Around Classroom:**\n   - Take students on a \"force hunt\" around the school. Identify real-world examples of pushes and pulls: a door being pushed open, a child pulling a wagon, a pencil being pushed into a cup, a drawer being pulled. Record observations with drawings or words. Create a classroom poster: \"Pushes and Pulls in Our School.\"\n\n2. **Ramp Challenge (Week 2):**\n   - Introduce different ramp heights and surfaces (smooth, bumpy, rough). Hypothesize: \"Will a car go faster down a steep ramp or a gentle ramp?\" Test and record with simple graphs (pictures or tallies showing \"fast,\" \"medium,\" \"slow\"). This extends K-PS2-1 and K-PS2-2.\n\n3. **Design a Playground Machine:**\n   - Show pictures of playground equipment (seesaw, swing, slide). Discuss: \"What pushes or pulls happen on a seesaw? On a swing?\" Have students draw their own pretend playground machine and label the pushes and pulls. This makes the learning relevant to their daily life and reinforces concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes for Teachers\n\n**Classroom Management Tips:**\n- Establish a \"signal\" (e.g., hand raised) to get student attention between stations during Explore.\n- Pre-arrange materials at each station before the lesson to save transition time.\n- Practice rotating between stations with a clear \"timer signal\" so students understand expectations.\n\n**Vocabulary Reinforcement:**\n- Use the chart from Explain phase throughout the week. Point to it when students use (or forget!) vocabulary words.\n- Play a quick game: \"I spy something being pushed!\" to reinforce concepts daily.\n\n**Safety Reminders:**\n- Ensure adequate floor space so students don't run into each other during testing.\n- Remind students that pushes and pulls are for objects, not people—this is not time to push/pull friends!\n- Supervise carefully during Elaborate to ensure materials are used safely.\n\n**Connection to Real Life:**\n- Relate pushes and pulls to students' own experiences: \"You push your tricycle. You pull a wagon. A door gets pushed. A light switch gets pulled.\" This makes science immediately relevant.",
