You can see bubbles or air trapped inside the ice, making it look different from the clear water around it.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image shows the **anchoring phenomenon of states of matter in equilibrium**. The ice cubes (solid water) are slowly melting into liquid water due to heat energy from the surrounding environment. The cloudiness in the ice is caused by air bubbles that became trapped when the water froze quickly. As the ice absorbs thermal energy from the warmer air and water around it, the molecular bonds weaken and the solid ice transforms into liquid water through the process of melting.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **States of Matter**: Water exists in different forms - solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor), depending on temperature and energy.\n\n2. **Heat Transfer**: Thermal energy moves from warmer objects (room temperature air and water) to cooler objects (ice cubes), causing the ice to melt.\n\n3. **Physical Changes**: Melting is a reversible physical change where the substance (water) stays the same, but its form changes from solid to liquid.\n\n4. **Air and Gases**: The cloudy appearance in ice shows that air (a gas) can be trapped in solids when water freezes quickly.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use this image to help students make connections between everyday experiences (ice in drinks) and scientific concepts.

As heat energy is added, these molecules vibrate faster and break free from their fixed positions, allowing them to flow as liquid water.\n\n2. **Zoom Out**: This melting process connects to the larger water cycle system on Earth, where ice in glaciers, snow, and frozen lakes melts to provide fresh water for rivers, streams, and groundwater that supports all living things.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: \"Ice is not the same thing as water.\"\n   **Clarification**: Ice and liquid water are the same substance (H₂O) in different states - only the arrangement and movement of molecules changes.\n\n2. **Misconception**: \"Cold makes ice melt.\"\n   **Clarification**: Heat energy causes ice to melt. Even at room temperature, there is enough thermal energy to melt ice.\n\n3. **Misconception**: \"The bubbles in ice are water turning to gas.\"\n   **Clarification**: The cloudy areas are air bubbles that got trapped when the water froze, not water vapor forming.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation**: 2-PS1-1 - Plan and conduct an investigation to describe and classify different kinds of materials by their observable properties.\n- **Disciplinary Core Idea**: [[NGSS:DCI:2-PS1.A]] - Different kinds of matter exist and many of them can be either solid or liquid, depending on temperature.\n- **Crosscutting Concept**: [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns in the natural world can be observed and used as evidence.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1.

You can see bubbles or air trapped in the ice.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of ice floating in water due to density differences. When water freezes into ice, it expands and becomes less dense than liquid water, causing it to float.

The ice looks very cold and makes the air around it foggy.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image shows **sublimation** - the process where dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) changes directly from a solid to a gas without becoming liquid first. The dramatic \"fog\" effect occurs because the extremely cold carbon dioxide gas (-78.5°C) causes water vapor in the surrounding air to condense into tiny visible water droplets, creating the cloudy appearance.

The ice cubes appear to be different sizes and shapes.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates **phase transitions** - specifically the melting of ice (solid water) into liquid water. The anchoring phenomenon is the change of matter from one state to another due to temperature differences. When ice is placed in warmer water or air, thermal energy transfers from the warmer environment to the colder ice, causing the water molecules in the ice to move faster and break free from their rigid crystal structure, transforming into liquid water.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **States of Matter**: Water exists in three forms - solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor/steam)\n\n2. **Phase Transitions**: Matter can change from one state to another when energy is added or removed\n\n3. **Heat Transfer**: Thermal energy moves from warmer objects to cooler objects until they reach the same temperature\n\n4. **Density and Buoyancy**: Ice floats on water because solid water is less dense than liquid water\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"Think-Pair-Share\" strategy when introducing states of matter. Have students first think individually about examples of solids, liquids, and gases they know, then pair up to discuss, and finally share with the whole class. This builds confidence and activates prior knowledge.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to represent their understanding of states of matter - through drawings, physical demonstrations with their bodies (rigid for solid, flowing for liquid, bouncing for gas), or creating simple charts. This supports different learning preferences and abilities.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** At the molecular level, water molecules in ice are arranged in a rigid, hexagonal crystal structure held together by hydrogen bonds. As thermal energy increases, these molecules vibrate more rapidly until they break free from their fixed positions and begin to flow as liquid water.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This melting process is part of Earth's water cycle, where ice in glaciers, polar ice caps, and seasonal snow melts to feed rivers, lakes, and oceans. This melting ice contributes to sea level changes and weather patterns across the planet.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: \"Ice melts because it gets tired of being cold.\"\n   **Scientific Clarification**: Ice melts because thermal energy from the environment causes water molecules to move faster and change from solid to liquid state.\n\n2. **Misconception**: \"The water disappears when ice melts.\"\n   **Scientific Clarification**: The water doesn't disappear - it changes form from solid ice to liquid water. The same amount of water is still there.\n\n3. **Misconception**: \"All solids sink in liquids.\"\n   **Scientific Clarification**: Ice floats on water because it is less dense than liquid water. Whether something floats or sinks depends on its density compared to the liquid.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation**: 5-PS1-1 - Develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:PS1.A]] - Structure and Properties of Matter\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:PS3.B]] - Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer  \n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]]\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]]\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1.

    "grade5": "## 📸 Photo Description\n\nA clear glass bowl filled with water contains what appears to be dry ice creating dramatic white fog or vapor that spills over the edges. The frozen carbon dioxide is sublimating, changing directly from a solid to a gas without becoming liquid first. This creates a misty, cloud-like effect that flows downward because the cold carbon dioxide gas is denser than the surrounding warm air.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates **sublimation** - the phase change where a solid transforms directly into a gas without passing through the liquid phase. The dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) is absorbing thermal energy from the surrounding water and air, causing it to sublimate at -78.5°C (-109.3°F). The dramatic white \"fog\" is actually a mixture of cold carbon dioxide gas and water vapor that condenses in the air due to the extreme temperature difference. The fog sinks because cold CO₂ gas is denser than warm air, creating the flowing, cascading effect visible in the image.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **States of Matter and Phase Changes**: Matter exists in different states (solid, liquid, gas) and can change between these states when energy is added or removed.\n\n2. **Sublimation**: A specific phase change where solids transform directly into gases without melting into liquids first.\n\n3. **Density and Gas Behavior**: Cold gases are denser than warm gases, causing the carbon dioxide vapor to sink and flow downward like a heavy liquid.\n\n4. **Heat Transfer**: Thermal energy moves from warmer objects (water, air) to cooler objects (dry ice), driving the sublimation process.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use this demonstration to help students distinguish between sublimation and evaporation by comparing dry ice (solid to gas) with regular ice melting and then evaporating (solid to liquid to gas).</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to observe this phenomenon: live demonstration, slow-motion video, and time-lapse photography to accommodate different learning preferences and ensure all students can access the visual information.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n**Zoom In:** At the molecular level, carbon dioxide molecules in the solid dry ice are vibrating more rapidly as they absorb thermal energy. When they gain enough energy, they break free from their solid structure and move into the gas phase, with molecules spreading far apart and moving freely through space.\n\n**Zoom Out:** This same sublimation process occurs naturally in Earth's systems, such as when snow and ice sublimate directly into water vapor in cold, dry climates, contributing to the water cycle. On Mars, the polar ice caps are made of frozen carbon dioxide that sublimates seasonally, creating dramatic atmospheric changes.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **\"The white fog is steam\"** - Students often confuse the visible vapor with water steam. The white fog is actually condensed water vapor in the air caused by the extreme cold, mixed with invisible carbon dioxide gas.\n\n2. **\"Dry ice is just really cold regular ice\"** - Students may think dry ice is frozen water. Dry ice is actually frozen carbon dioxide, a completely different substance that sublimates at much colder temperatures.\n\n3. **\"The fog rises because it's hot\"** - Students might expect all vapors to rise. The CO₂ gas is actually sinking because it's much denser than the surrounding warm air.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** 5-PS1-1: Develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:5-PS1.A]] - Structure and Properties of Matter\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:2-PS1.A]] - Structure and Properties of Matter  \n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Observable patterns in nature guide organization and classification\n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] - Events have causes that generate observable patterns\n- **Science and Engineering Practices:** Developing and Using Models\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1.
