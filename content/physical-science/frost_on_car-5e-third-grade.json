The lesson emphasizes **observation, pattern recognition, and cause-and-effect thinking** that directly support third-grade science practices and critical thinking skills emphasized in the NGSS framework.\n\n*Note to Teacher:* This photograph is ideal for third graders to develop observational skills and reasoning about energy and temperature, even though direct grade-level force/magnetism standards are not the primary focus. The lesson emphasizes the scientific practice of making observations and predictions—core third-grade skills.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Observe and describe** the conditions (temperature, sunlight, time of day) that cause frost to form and disappear on surfaces.\n2. **Make predictions** about where frost will and will not form based on patterns of sunlight and temperature.\n3. **Explain the cause-and-effect relationship** between sunlight energy and the presence or absence of frost using evidence from observations.\n4. **Design and test a simple investigation** to determine how different surfaces or coverings affect frost formation and melting.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of frost on a car surface with morning sunlight.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of frost-covered car\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: ice cubes in a tray (to show frozen water at hand's length)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster. Position students so all can see clearly.\n\n2. **Ask opening discussion questions** (calibrated for third-grade thinking):\n   - \"What do you see covering the car in this picture? What does it look like?\"\n   - \"Why do you think one part of the car (the front) is bright and sunny while other parts are darker or shaded?\"\n   - \"If you touched the white frosty stuff on this car, what do you think would happen? Would it stay the same or change?\"\n   - \"The sun is coming up in the picture. What do you think will happen to the frost as the sun gets higher in the sky?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge:** Ask students, \"Who has seen frost or ice on a car or window in the morning? What happened to it?\" Allow 2-3 students to share briefly.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder if frost forms everywhere on the car the same way, or if some places have more frost than others. Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become Frost Detectives and find out what makes frost appear and disappear.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate frost formation and the effect of sunlight through observation and a hands-on simulation activity.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Clear plastic cups or small containers (6-8 per group)\n- Ice cubes (crushed or whole)\n- Thermometers (one per group, if available; optional)\n- Aluminum foil\n- Black construction paper\n- Clear plastic wrap\n- Tape\n- Paper towels\n- Tray or shallow container to hold cups\n- Access to sunlight (windowsill) or heat source (warm lamp, NOT hot plate)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up the investigation stations** before students arrive. Each group will have a tray with 6-8 cups, each prepared differently:\n   - Cup 1: Ice uncovered, placed in sunlight\n   - Cup 2: Ice uncovered, placed in shade (away from direct light)\n   - Cup 3: Ice covered with aluminum foil, placed in sunlight\n   - Cup 4: Ice covered with black paper, placed in sunlight\n   - Cup 5: Ice covered with clear plastic wrap, placed in sunlight\n   - Cup 6: Ice covered with white paper, placed in sunlight\n\n2. **Provide student directions** (written on chart or read aloud):\n   - \"Look at each cup. What do you observe on the outside of the cup? Is there frost or water?\"\n   - \"Predict: Which cup will still have the most ice after 15 minutes? Which will have the least? Why?\"\n   - \"Record your predictions in your science notebook using words and pictures.\"\n   - \"Check each cup every 5 minutes. Observe and record what you see. Is there frost? Is there water? Did the ice change?\"\n\n3. **How this connects to the photograph:** Explain, \"The frost on the car forms when it's very cold at night. The sun's energy starts to warm things up. In our experiment, we're using cups of ice like tiny frost spots, and we're testing how the sun's energy affects them.\"\n\n4. **What students should record:**\n   - Initial prediction (drawings and words)\n   - Observations at 5-minute intervals (did frost appear, change, or disappear?)\n   - Final description of each cup (how much ice remains, presence of frost or water)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between groups and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the cup in the sun versus the cup in the shade? Which covering protected the ice the best? Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Do **not** tell students the answer; instead, redirect their thinking: \"What did you observe? What do you think that means?\"\n- Help students record observations if they struggle with writing; accept drawings and dictation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that ice in direct sunlight melts faster than ice in shade.\n- Students notice that certain coverings (foil, white paper) slow melting more than others.\n- Students begin to understand that sunlight energy affects the state of water (solid ice → liquid water).\n- Students create a record of their observations with drawings, words, or both.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration; connect findings to the original photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph from Engage phase (displayed again)\n- Optional: real frost or ice sample, if available\n- Word cards or vocabulary poster\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 2-3 groups to share their findings:\n   - \"What did you observe? Which cups changed the most?\"\n   - \"Did your prediction match what actually happened?\"\n   - Create a class data chart showing observations from all groups (sunlight vs. shade, covered vs. uncovered).\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions:**\n\n   - **Frost:** Ice crystals that form when water vapor (invisible water in the air) freezes on a cold surface. It looks like tiny sparkly crystals, like in our photograph.\n   - **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is. The colder it gets, the more likely frost will form.\n   - **Heat energy (or thermal energy):** The energy from the sun and other sources that makes things warmer. Sunlight carries heat energy.\n   - **State of matter:** The form water takes: solid (ice or frost), liquid (water), or gas (invisible water vapor in air).\n   - **Melt:** When a solid (like ice or frost) turns into a liquid (water) because it gets warmer.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Look at the frost photograph again. On which side of the car do you see the most frost? (The shaded side.) On which side is there more sunlight? (The sunny side.) What do you notice?\"\n   - \"The frost melted away where the sun was shining brightest, just like the uncovered ice in our cups melted fastest. The sun's energy is making the frost change from solid to liquid.\"\n   - \"In the morning, before the sun rose, the car was very cold. The air around it had water vapor (invisible water in the air). When the temperature dropped low enough at night, that water vapor froze into frost crystals on the car. As the sun came up and warmed the surface, some of the frost started to melt.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"If it's very cold outside and the sun comes out, what will happen to frost on a car window? Why?\"\n   - Have students turn to a partner and explain (in their own words) why frost melts faster in sunlight than in shade.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Frost:** Ice crystals that form when water vapor freezes on a cold surface.\n- **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is.\n- **Heat energy (thermal energy):** Energy from the sun and other sources that makes things warmer.\n- **State of matter:** The form water is in—solid (ice, frost), liquid (water), or gas (water vapor in air).\n- **Melt:** When a solid turns into a liquid because it gets warmer.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that frost is frozen water that forms on cold surfaces.\n- Students connect sunlight energy to temperature changes.\n- Students can explain (in simple terms) why frost melts in sunlight but remains in shade.\n- Students use vocabulary words in their explanations (frost, heat energy, temperature, melt).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by solving a real-world problem related to frost.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards with the following scenarios (one per group)\n- Drawing paper\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- Optional: small cardboard boxes, fabric scraps, or other craft materials for design thinking\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present a real-world problem:** \"A farmer is worried that frost will damage plants in her garden on cold mornings. She saw how ice in different coverings melted at different speeds in our experiment. Now she wants **your** help. Design a simple solution to protect her plants from frost overnight.\"\n\n2. **Provide scenario cards** (one per group):\n   - **Scenario A:** Design a simple cover to protect tomato plants from frost at night.\n   - **Scenario B:** Choose the best location in a garden to plant delicate flowers so they get morning sunlight quickly (to melt frost).\n   - **Scenario C:** Design a garden layout that uses sunlight wisely to protect plants from late-spring frosts.\n\n3. **Student task:**\n   - Draw or sketch your solution.\n   - Write or explain: \"Why will this protect plants from frost? What did you learn from our ice experiment that helped you design this?\"\n   - Think about: sunlight, heat energy, temperature, and how to keep plants warmer.\n\n4. **Gallery walk (optional):** Post designs around the room. Have students walk around, observe other groups' solutions, and think: \"What's similar? What's different? Why might different solutions work?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate brainstorming by asking: \"What did we learn about how sunlight affects ice? How can we use that to help the farmer?\"\n- Prompt thinking: \"Would covering a plant trap heat? Would leaving it uncovered in sunlight help? Why?\"\n- Validate creative thinking; there are multiple good solutions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply concepts of heat energy, temperature, and sunlight to a real-world scenario.\n- Students draw or describe a solution that reflects their understanding (e.g., using covers, positioning plants in sunny spots, etc.).\n- Students explain their thinking using vocabulary from the lesson (frost, heat energy, sunlight, melt, temperature).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of frost formation, heat energy transfer, and cause-and-effect relationships.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist:** During Explore, note which students accurately recorded observations and made connections to sunlight (e.g., \"Ice in sun melted faster\").\n- **Think-pair-share:** After Explain, listen as students explain to a partner why frost melts in sunlight. Look for use of vocabulary and cause-and-effect reasoning.\n- **Questioning during Elaborate:** Ask, \"How does your design use what we learned about heat energy?\" Listen for evidence of transfer of learning.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with the following (adapt for drawing if needed):\n\n**Frost Detective Exit Ticket**\n\n1. **What is frost?** (Draw and label, or write in your own words.)\n\n2. **Why does frost disappear when the sun comes out?** (Use the word \"energy\" or \"warmth\" in your answer.)\n\n3. **Look at this picture: A frosty car is parked half in sun and half in shade. Where will the frost melt first? Why?** (Circle: **Sunny side / Shady side.** Explain your thinking.)\n\n4. **If you wanted to keep ice from melting in the sun, what would you cover it with? Why?** (Choose or design a cover and explain.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student can identify frost and observe that sunlight affects it (with teacher support).\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student explains that sunlight brings heat energy that melts frost, and can predict where frost will melt first based on sunlight.\n\n✓ **Advanced:** Student applies concepts to new scenarios (e.g., protecting plants, designing a cover) and uses scientific vocabulary accurately and independently.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Review exit tickets and check for evidence of:\n  - Understanding that frost is frozen water (Objective 1)\n  - Predictions based on patterns of sunlight (Objective 2)\n  - Explanations using cause-and-effect (Objective 3)\n  - Ability to design solutions based on heat energy concepts (Objective 4)\n- If 80% of students score \"Proficient\" or \"Advanced\" on the exit ticket, learning objectives were met.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified observation recording:** Provide a template with sentence frames:\n   - \"I see frost on the ____ side of the car.\"\n   - \"The sun is shining on the _____ side.\"\n   - \"The frost ______ (melted / stayed the same) in the sun.\"\n   - Allow drawing instead of writing.\n\n2. **Vocabulary picture cards:** Create a visual reference sheet with pictures of frost, ice, sun, and labels. Students can point to pictures instead of writing words.\n\n3. **Partnered investigation:** Pair struggling students with a strong partner during Explore. The partner helps record observations while both students observe and discuss.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extended investigation:** Have students test additional variables:\n   - What color surface gets warmest in sunlight (black vs. white vs. silver)?\n   - How does wind speed affect frost melting?\n   - How long does it take for frost to form on different materials at night?\n\n2. **Cause-and-effect reasoning:** Ask deeper questions:\n   - \"Why do you think water vapor freezes into frost only on cold surfaces, not in the air?\"\n   - \"If frost forms at night and melts in the morning sun, why doesn't the same thing happen indoors under a lamp?\"\n\n3. **Design challenge:** Challenge students to design and build a prototype \"frost-free greenhouse\" using craft materials that keeps plants warm even on cold mornings.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frost Hunt Observation Log:** Send students home with a simple worksheet asking them to observe frost in their own neighborhood over several mornings (if season is appropriate). They record:\n   - Where did they see frost? (Grass, car, window, etc.)\n   - What time did it disappear?\n   - Was there sunlight? Shade?\n   - Back in class, create a class map showing where frost was spotted and patterns observed.\n\n2. **Water Cycle Connection:** Expand to a multi-day lesson on the water cycle. Use the frost observation to introduce how water moves from solid → liquid → gas. Create a simple diagram showing: \"Water vapor in cold air → freezes into frost on cold surface → sunlight warms it → melts into water → water evaporates back into air.\"\n\n3. **Shadow Investigation:** Extend the lesson by having students trace shadows at different times of day on sunny surfaces (paper, pavement). Predict: \"If frost formed here last night, where would it melt first based on where the sun shines now?\" This connects to sunlight patterns and spatial reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
