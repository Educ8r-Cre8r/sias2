  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: \"Rust and Decay: Understanding Changes in Matter\"\n\n---\n\n## Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Properties of Materials:** Objects show visible changes in color, texture, and structural integrity due to oxidation (rust formation), weathering, and deterioration over time.\n- **Matter and Chemical Change:** When materials like metal and wood interact with air and moisture, they undergo a transformation that changes their observable properties—demonstrating that matter can change form while conserving mass.\n- **Gravity and Weight:** The scattered objects on the wooden surface show how gravity continuously affects all materials on Earth's surface, keeping them grounded.\n- **Evidence of Time and Decay:** The photograph provides tangible evidence that all materials undergo change, breaking down into smaller pieces and displaying different states of deterioration.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**Mystery of the Rusty Treasures: Exploring How Materials Change**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or 90 minutes with flexible scheduling)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-PS1-3: Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties\n  - 5-PS1-4: Conduct an investigation to determine whether the mixing of two or more substances results in new substances\n  - 5-PS2-1: Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Observe and describe the physical properties of materials (color, texture, shape, hardness) before and after they change.\n2. Identify evidence that materials have undergone chemical and physical changes, using specific observations from materials in their environment.\n3. Explain that when two materials combine (like metal with air and water), new materials can form that look and feel different from the original objects.\n4. Use gravity to explain why weathered and corroded objects remain on a surface rather than floating away.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about decay and change by examining the photograph and activating prior knowledge about how materials break down.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image or large printed copy of the photograph\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording \"I Wonder\" statements\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the projector or pass around a printed copy. Ask students to examine it silently for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Launch with mystery language:** \"These objects were left outside for a long time. Something has happened to them. What do you notice?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate discussion with these specific questions:**\n   - \"What colors do you see? What colors might these objects have been when they were brand new?\"\n   - \"Look at the round, bumpy things in the photo. What do you think they are? How are they different from shiny new objects?\"\n   - \"Why do you think some parts are orange-brown and some parts are white or gray?\"\n   - \"If you touched the wood in this picture, what do you think it would feel like compared to fresh wood?\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper under an \"I Wonder\" section. Encourage wild predictions—this builds engagement.\n\n5. **Prediction Prompt:** \"By the end of this lesson, we're going to figure out *why* these materials changed so much. What do you predict happened to make them look like this?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become detectives and test materials ourselves to see how they change. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what happens when materials interact with water and air over time through hands-on observation and testing.\n\n**Materials (per student pair/group of 3):**\n- 2 steel wool pads (or small iron nails)\n- 1 piece of copper wire or old penny\n- 1 wooden craft stick or small wood scrap\n- 4 small clear cups or jars\n- Water (tap water in a pitcher)\n- Paper towels\n- Vinegar (5% acetic acid)\n- Salt (a few pinches)\n- Measuring tape or ruler\n- Observation sheet (provided template below)\n- Magnifying glasses\n- Pencil\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Prepare materials:** Place each test material (steel wool, copper, wood, nail) in a separate cup. Label each cup with the material name and today's date.\n\n2. **Make observations (BEFORE):** Using the magnifying glass, carefully examine each material. On your observation sheet, draw what it looks like and describe:\n   - Color\n   - Texture (smooth, rough, bumpy, shiny)\n   - Any visible damage or changes\n\n3. **Add moisture:** Leave one material dry. Add water to the second cup, vinegar to the third cup, and water + salt to the fourth cup. (Teacher can circulate and guide which material gets which liquid.)\n\n4. **Place in sunlight:** Set all four cups on a sunny windowsill.\n\n5. **Wait and observe:** Over the next 1-2 days (or if this is a 2-session lesson, observe after 24 hours), students will check on materials at specific times (morning, after lunch, end of day). They should:\n   - Sketch any changes in color, texture, or appearance\n   - Record observations in written or drawn form\n   - Note which materials changed the most and which changed the least\n\n6. **Record data:** Use the observation sheet to track changes. If time permits, measure any visible rust deposits or material breakdown.\n\n**Observation Sheet Template:**\n\n| Material | Day 1: Color/Texture | Day 2: Color/Texture | Changes Observed |\n|----------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| Steel Wool (Dry) | | | |\n| Steel Wool (Water) | | | |\n| Copper (Vinegar) | | | |\n| Wood (Salt Water) | | | |\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and prompt students with open-ended questions: \"What do you notice happening to the metal?\" \"Why do you think the wet one might be changing faster than the dry one?\"\n- Ask students to compare wet vs. dry materials without explaining why.\n- Encourage students to touch (safely) and feel the materials, noticing texture changes.\n- Document student observations verbally or ask them to take photos with a tablet/phone if available.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe visible rust (reddish-brown coating) forming on steel wool and nails, especially in wet conditions.\n- Copper may show a blue-green patina (especially in vinegar).\n- Wood may soften or darken, especially in salt water.\n- Dry materials show minimal change.\n- Students realize that *water is involved* in the change process.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student observations to scientific concepts of chemical change, oxidation, and material properties.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or slides with vocabulary\n- Photograph from original lesson\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Simple diagram of rust formation (teacher-created or found)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):** Ask volunteer pairs to share ONE thing they observed that surprised them. Record key observations on chart paper. Highlight surprising findings:\n   - \"Notice how almost all the changes happened when there was *water*!\"\n   - \"The wet materials changed much faster than the dry ones!\"\n   - \"The colors changed, the texture changed—it looks like a whole new material!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):** Using student-friendly language, introduce these terms:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Oxidation:** When a material (usually metal) joins with oxygen in the air and water to create a brand new substance. Think of it like mixing ingredients in a recipe—you start with metal and oxygen, but the result is something completely different (rust).\n   - **Rust:** The reddish-brown coating that forms when steel or iron combines with oxygen and water. It's a *new material* that looks and feels different from the original metal.\n   - **Corrosion:** The gradual wearing away or weakening of a material because of a chemical reaction with its environment (air, water, salt).\n   - **Chemical Change:** When two or more materials combine to form a brand new substance with different properties. Unlike a physical change, you can't easily turn it back into what it was before.\n   - **Properties:** The characteristics of a material, like color, texture, hardness, shininess, or shape.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (3 minutes):** \n   - \"The objects in this photograph have been outside for a very long time. Look at all those bumpy, crusty, orange-brown things. Those are rust and corrosion! The metals and wood have been reacting with water from rain and oxygen from the air.\"\n   - Point out the different stages of rust: shiny orange-brown (new rust) and white-gray (old, weathered rust).\n   - Explain: \"This is a chemical change. The original metal is still there, but it's combined with oxygen and water to create rust.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we took the rust off this object, would we find the original metal underneath? Why or why not?\" (Yes, because rust is on top—it's a new layer, but the metal is still there under it.)\n   - Ask: \"Why did the wet steel wool in your cup rust faster than the dry one?\" (Water speeds up oxidation. Without water, oxidation happens very slowly.)\n   - Ask: \"Why didn't the wooden stick turn into rust?\" (Wood doesn't rust—but it does decay and rot when exposed to moisture. That's a different kind of chemical change.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents should understand that:\n- Materials can undergo *chemical changes* when they interact with their environment.\n- Rust is a new material created when metal, oxygen, and water combine.\n- Water and oxygen are necessary for rust to form.\n- Changes to material properties (color, texture, appearance) are evidence of chemical change.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to a new context by investigating how to slow down or prevent rust—connecting to real-world problem-solving.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4 pre-prepared nails (or steel wool pieces) treated differently:\n  - Nail 1: Coated with oil (or petroleum jelly)\n  - Nail 2: Painted with acrylic paint\n  - Nail 3: Wrapped in plastic wrap\n  - Nail 4: Left exposed (control)\n- Cups of water\n- Observation sheet\n- Optional: Images of rust prevention in the real world (ship paint, car coating, bridge maintenance)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present a Real-World Problem:** \"Engineers and scientists have to solve a BIG problem: How do we keep metal objects from rusting? A bridge made of steel, a ship's anchor, even a bicycle—they all rust! What could we do to stop it?\"\n\n2. **Test Protective Barriers (15 minutes):**\n   - Show students four nails that have been treated differently (oil-coated, painted, wrapped, exposed).\n   - Place each in a cup of water.\n   - Ask: \"Which protective barrier do you think will work best? Why?\"\n   - Have students predict and record their predictions.\n   - Let materials sit for 1-2 days, then compare results.\n\n3. **Guided Reasoning:**\n   - Ask: \"What do all these barriers have in common?\" (They block water and/or oxygen from reaching the metal.)\n   - Ask: \"If rust needs water and oxygen, what's a way we could stop rust?\" (Keep water or oxygen away from the metal!)\n   - Connect to real world: \"This is why ships are painted, why bridges are maintained, and why we oil tools in our garage.\"\n\n4. **Student Application Task:**\n   - Have students draw or write about ONE object they use that might rust or corrode, and suggest ONE way to protect it.\n   - Examples: A bicycle (keep it dry, apply oil), a playground slide (paint it), a garden tool (store it in a dry place).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students toward recognizing that barriers (oil, paint, plastic) prevent water and oxygen from reaching the metal.\n- Ask questions that help them connect to the science, not just the answer: \"What is the barrier doing? What is it keeping away from the metal?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that rust prevention involves blocking water and/or oxygen.\n- Students apply oxidation concepts to real-world situations.\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding by explaining *why* certain methods work.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding through observation, questioning, and a summative task.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Are they making detailed observations? Can they describe properties accurately?\n- Listen to group discussions: Can students explain observations without teacher prompting?\n- Monitor worksheet completion: Are sketches and descriptions detailed and accurate?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (on paper or digital). Ask them to respond to the following (students can write, draw, or both):\n\n1. **Observation Question:** \"Look at this picture of a rusty bicycle. Draw or describe what happened to the metal to make it look this way.\"\n\n2. **Application Question:** \"If you wanted to keep a metal bucket from rusting, what would you do and why?\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary Check:** \"What is oxidation? Use the word 'oxygen' and 'new material' in your answer.\"\n\n4. **Reflection:** \"What was the most surprising thing you learned about how materials change?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Identify oxidation/rust as a chemical change involving metal, oxygen, and water.\n- ✓ Describe how water accelerates rust formation.\n- ✓ Propose realistic rust-prevention strategies based on blocking water/oxygen.\n- ✓ Use vocabulary (oxidation, rust, chemical change, corrosion) appropriately in context.\n- ✓ Observe and record changes to material properties with accuracy and detail.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students should be able to explain in their own words: \"When metal gets wet and exposed to air, it rusts because the metal combines with oxygen and water to make a new material. You can't turn rust back into metal easily, and that makes it a chemical change. We can slow down rusting by keeping water and air away from the metal.\"\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a template with sentence starters: \"I see... The color is... It feels...\" Instead of open-ended sketching, use a checklist of properties (Color: ☐ Orange ☐ Brown ☐ Gray | Texture: ☐ Smooth ☐ Rough ☐ Bumpy).\n\n2. **Paired Investigation:** Assign struggling learners to work with a stronger peer. The peer helps with observation and recording while the struggling learner focuses on touching, examining, and predicting.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create and post a large classroom anchor chart with vocabulary terms, student-friendly definitions, and a visual (photo or drawing) for each. Refer to it frequently and leave it posted throughout the unit.\n\n4. **Guided Questioning During Explain Phase:** Instead of open-ended \"What do you notice?\" ask more specific prompts: \"Is the wet steel wool shinier or duller than before? Is it the same color or different?\" This scaffolds thinking.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Investigate Multiple Variables:** Advanced students can test rust formation under different conditions: cold water vs. warm water, salt water vs. freshwater, exposed to light vs. covered/dark. Have them form a hypothesis and predict which condition will cause the most rust in 24 hours. Chart results and discuss why temperature or light might matter.\n\n2. **Research and Present:** Assign students to research real-world corrosion problems (ship maintenance, bridge longevity, car rust in winter). Have them create a brief presentation explaining the problem and solutions used by engineers.\n\n3. **Calculate and Compare:** Provide measurements of rust formation (e.g., \"Wet nail rust layer is 2mm thick; dry nail has no visible rust\"). Ask students to calculate percentages of change or graph results to show rates of oxidation under different conditions.\n\n4. **Deeper Chemistry:** Introduce the concept of *alloys* (metal mixtures designed to resist rust, like stainless steel). Ask: \"Why would mixing metals together help prevent rust? What properties might be combined?\" This connects to 5-PS1-3 and stretches thinking toward middle school chemistry.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Field Investigation: \"Rust Hunt\"**\n   - Take students on a nature walk or around the school playground to find evidence of rust and corrosion in the real world. Examples: rusty playground equipment, oxidized copper gutters, weathered wood, corroded fences. Have students photograph or sketch what they find and label the materials. Back in class, create a \"Corrosion Evidence\" poster showing different examples and explaining what each one teaches us about how materials change. This extends 5-PS1-3 (identifying materials by properties in the real world).\n\n2. **Design a Rust-Prevention Experiment**\n   - Challenge students to design their own protective coating for a metal nail. Provide supplies: nail polish, vegetable oil, crayons (melted), plastic wrap, aluminum foil, tape, etc. Students test their design by placing the coated nail in water. Measure and compare rust formation after 1 week. Have students present findings and explain whether their barrier successfully blocked water and oxygen. This combines Explore and Elaborate thinking and reinforces understanding of oxidation requirements.\n\n3. **Historical Connection: \"When Did Humans Discover Rust?\"**\n   - Have students research how ancient civilizations (Bronze Age, Iron Age) discovered and worked with metals, and how they dealt with rust and corrosion. Was rust a problem for ancient tools? How did they preserve objects? Students can create a timeline or poster showing the history of rust awareness. This builds content knowledge and connects science to social studies (history of technology).\n\n4. **Literature Link: \"Materials Matter\" Reading**\n   - Provide a leveled non-fiction text about weathering, erosion, or how statues and monuments decay over time. Students read and annotate examples of physical and chemical changes in the real world. Follow with a discussion: \"How is the decay of a marble statue similar to rust on metal? How is it different?\" This supports literacy in science and deepens conceptual understanding.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\n- **Timing Flexibility:** If a 24-hour wait is not feasible, accelerate the process by using warm water or salt water, which speeds oxidation. Rust should be visible within 6-8 hours under these conditions.\n- **Safety:** Supervise the handling of steel wool and nails; remind students not to touch corroded edges (they can be sharp). Wash hands after handling materials.\n- **Real-World Relevance:** On Day 2 or 3, share images or a short video of large-scale corrosion problems (ship hulls, bridges, infrastructure) to emphasize why this science matters.\n- **Connection to 5-PS2-1:** When discussing why objects remain on the wooden surface in the photograph, briefly mention gravity: \"Gravity pulls all these objects down toward Earth, which is why they stay on the wooden dock instead of floating away.\" This reinforces gravitational force concepts.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson fully engages Fifth Grade students in investigating material properties and chemical change, using a compelling photograph as the entry point and hands-on exploration as the core learning experience.",
