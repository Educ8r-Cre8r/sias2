ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the mysterious ice ball and activate prior knowledge about light and clear materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the ice ball (or displayed on screen)\n- Actual ice ball (made the day before—freeze water in a balloon in a freezer, then peel away the balloon)\n- Flashlight or small lamp\n- Darkened corner of classroom (or use a blanket over a table)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph.** Show students the ice ball image on the board or pass around a printed copy. Keep the ice ball hidden for now.\n\n2. **Ask discovery questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is it made of?\" (Students should identify ice/something cold and clear.)\n   - \"Can you see through it? Why do you think we can see inside?\"\n   - \"What do you think is happening with the light in this picture?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen through ice before? What did it look like?\"\n\n3. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"I have something special hidden. I think it might be like the thing in this picture. What do you think will happen if I shine a light on it? Will we be able to see through it?\" (Elicit predictions without confirming yet.)\n\n4. **Reveal the ice ball.** Show students the actual ice ball. Let them touch it (briefly—it's cold!), observe the patterns inside, and notice how it looks different from a regular piece of ice.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to be scientists and investigate how light travels through different things, just like it travels through this ice ball!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how light behaves when it passes through different materials, discovering that some materials allow light through more easily than others.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- 1 ice ball (can share or have 2-3 prepared)\n- 1 flashlight or small LED light\n- 1 white paper sheet\n- 1 opaque plastic cup or piece of foil\n- 1 clear plastic bag or clear plastic sheet\n- Blue tray or shallow container (from photograph setup)\n- Paper towels\n- Observation recording sheet (simple pictorial chart with columns: \"See Through?\" and \"Light Passes Through?\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize groups.** Place students in pairs. Distribute materials evenly.\n\n2. **Give student directions (use simple, step-by-step language):**\n   - \"First, hold your ice ball up to a light. What do you see? Can you see through it? Draw what you see on your paper.\"\n   - \"Now, shine your flashlight through the ice ball from the side. What patterns do you see? Does the light come out the other side?\"\n   - \"Now do the same with white paper. Can you see through it? Does light pass through it? What is different?\"\n   - \"Try the plastic cup. What happens? Can you see light on the other side?\"\n   - \"Finally, try the clear plastic bag. Does light pass through? Is it like the ice or like the paper?\"\n   - \"Put a check mark or draw a picture to show which materials let light pass through.\"\n\n3. **Connection to photograph:** \"Remember the ice ball in the picture? We're testing the same idea—how does light move through things?\"\n\n4. **Documentation:** Students mark on their observation sheets whether they can see through each material and whether light passes through it.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Is this the same as the ice?\" \"Can you see the light?\"\n- Do NOT tell students which materials are transparent/opaque—let them discover through observation.\n- Help with flashlight positioning if needed; keep the focus on observation.\n- Encourage use of words: \"clear,\" \"see through,\" \"dark,\" \"light.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that ice and clear plastic allow light through (patterns visible, light passes through).\n- Students will observe that white paper and opaque cups block or limit light (darker on opposite side).\n- Students will record observations through drawings or check marks.\n- Students will use descriptive language about what they see.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect observations to the science concepts of light transmission and material properties.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Ice ball (from previous phase)\n- Flashlight\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Picture cards showing: transparent/clear objects, opaque objects, translucent objects (simplified for Grade 1)\n- Vocabulary posters (with pictures and simple text)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share what they found: \"What did you observe with the ice ball?\" \"What about the paper?\"\n   - Create a class chart on the board with two columns: \"Light Goes Through\" and \"Light Doesn't Go Through.\"\n   - Record their observations (use drawings or words).\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   \n   **\"Transparent\" (or \"Clear\"):** Materials that let light pass through so we can see through them clearly. (Show ice ball and clear plastic.)\n   \n   **\"Opaque\":** Materials that don't let light pass through. We cannot see through them. (Show paper, cup.)\n   \n   **\"Light\":** Energy we can see. It travels in straight lines and bounces off things.\n   \n   **\"Material\":** What something is made of (ice, paper, plastic).\n   \n   **\"See through\":** When light travels through something and we can see objects on the other side.\n\n3. **Connect back to photograph (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Display the ice ball photograph again.\n   - \"This ice ball is made of ice—a transparent material. Light can travel through ice, so we can see all the patterns inside. That's why this picture is so beautiful!\"\n   - Point out how the ice ball looks different from a solid block of ice or the opaque cup.\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show picture cards of various objects (window, book, plastic wrap, wooden block, frosted glass).\n   - Ask: \"Will light pass through this? Can we see through it?\" Students respond with thumbs up/down or yes/no.\n   - Ask a student to explain one choice: \"Why can we see through a window?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Transparent/Clear** | A material that lets light travel through it so we can see what's on the other side. |\n| **Opaque** | A material that stops light and doesn't let us see through it. |\n| **Light** | Energy that helps us see. It travels in straight lines. |\n| **Material** | What something is made of (like ice, paper, plastic, or wood). |\n| **See Through** | When you can look through something and see the other side. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify materials as \"clear\" or \"not clear\" using observation.\n- Students understand that light travels through some materials but not others.\n- Students can explain in simple words why the ice ball looks the way it does.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts of light transmission and material properties by designing and testing a simple light investigation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Ice balls, flashlights, and materials from Explore phase (or fresh supplies)\n- Additional items to test: colored plastic sheet (clear), frosted plastic, mirror, aluminum foil, wax paper\n- Blue trays\n- Paper for drawings\n- Optional: simple \"light shadow\" outline template\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the challenge:** \"Now that we are experts on light and materials, let's try something new! We have some new materials to test. Predict: do you think this colored plastic will let light through? What about the shiny foil?\"\n\n2. **Predict-Observe-Compare:**\n   - Show a new material (e.g., colored plastic sheet, frosted plastic, or a mirror).\n   - Students predict: Will light pass through? Will we see through it? (Draw or point.)\n   - Students test with a flashlight (same method as Explore).\n   - Students observe and compare to ice ball: \"Is this more like the ice ball or more like the paper?\"\n\n3. **Challenge question:** \"Can you use two materials to make a pattern with light? For example, put the ice ball in front of the light, then put foil behind it. What happens to the shadow?\"\n\n4. **Documentation:** Students draw or write (with support) what they found. \"Which material was most like the ice ball? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide the new materials and ask predictive questions.\n- Facilitate testing; do not reveal answers.\n- Ask: \"How is this like the ice? How is it different?\"\n- Encourage risk-taking: \"It's okay if your prediction was wrong—that's how scientists learn!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply the concept of transparency to new, unfamiliar materials.\n- Students make and test predictions.\n- Students recognize that \"clear\" and \"see through\" can look different (e.g., colored plastic is clear but tinted).\n- Students discover that combining materials creates interesting light effects.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of light transmission and properties of materials.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Are students accurately identifying which materials are transparent vs. opaque?\n- **Questions during Explain:** Can students correctly identify materials from picture cards?\n- **Predictions in Elaborate:** Are students making logical predictions based on what they learned?\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5 minutes, at end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple pictorial exit ticket. Students respond by drawing or pointing:\n\n**Question 1:** \"Show me something that light can pass through. Draw it.\"\n\n**Question 2:** \"Show me something that light cannot pass through. Draw it.\"\n\n**Question 3:** \"Point to the ice ball picture. Why can we see the patterns inside?\" (Teacher reads aloud; student responds verbally or with a drawing.)\n\n**Alternative (for students needing scaffolding):** Use a sorting mat with two columns (\"Light Goes Through\" / \"Light Doesn't Go Through\"). Provide picture cards of common objects; students sort them.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Correctly identify at least 2 transparent materials and 2 opaque materials.\n- ✓ Explain (in simple words) that \"light can go through\" or \"light cannot go through\" a material.\n- ✓ Recognize that the ice ball in the photograph is transparent and that's why we can see inside.\n- ✓ Make a prediction about a new material and test it.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly sort materials into transparent/opaque categories.\n- Students explain that light \"goes through\" or \"stops at\" materials.\n- Students reference the ice ball photograph and describe what they observe.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for students who struggle with concepts or language)\n\n1. **Simplified material list:** Reduce the number of materials tested. Use only ice ball, white paper, and clear plastic. Focus on the most obvious contrast (clear vs. not clear).\n\n2. **Visual supports and non-verbal responses:** Provide picture cards instead of requiring verbal explanations. Students can point, nod, or use thumbs up/down instead of writing or drawing explanations.\n\n3. **Paired investigation with a strong reader/observer:** Assign a peer mentor to work with the student during Explore. The peer holds materials and asks the student to describe what they see: \"Can you see through it?\" The student focuses on observation, not materials management.\n\n4. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only two terms instead of five: \"We can see through it\" and \"We cannot see through it.\" Skip \"transparent,\" \"opaque,\" \"translucent\" in favor of concrete language.\n\n### Challenge (for students who master concepts quickly)\n\n1. **Color and transparency:** Provide colored plastic sheets (blue, red, green). Challenge: \"Does light go through the blue plastic? If light goes through, does it change color?\" Students test and predict what color shadow or light they'll see.\n\n2. **Layering materials:** Challenge: \"What if we stack two materials—paper on top of ice? Does light pass through both? What if we use ice and plastic together?\" Students design and test combinations, recording their findings with drawings.\n\n3. **Introduce translucency:** Show frosted plastic or wax paper. Challenge: \"This lets some light through, but we can't see clearly. Can you find other things in the classroom that are like this?\" Extend thinking: \"Why might we use frosted glass instead of clear glass somewhere?\"\n\n4. **Real-world application:** \"Where in our classroom or home do we use transparent materials? Why do we need light to pass through?\" (Windows, glasses, water bottles.) Students find examples and explain why transparency matters.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Shadow Art with Ice:** Freeze small objects (plastic toys, leaves, or beads) inside ice balls before the lesson. During Elaborate, students shine light on the ice balls and trace the shadows on paper, creating \"ice shadow art.\" Discussion: \"Why can we see the shadow of the object inside? The light has to pass through the ice to make the shadow.\"\n\n2. **Light and Material Walk:** Take students on a classroom \"transparency hunt.\" Students walk around and identify transparent objects (windows, clear containers, plastic sheets) and opaque objects (walls, books, wooden blocks). They place sticky notes on examples and later sort them on a class chart.\n\n3. **Exploration Station (for follow-up lessons):** Set up a light exploration station with a flashlight, ice balls, various materials, and a blue tray. Students rotate in during center time or indoor recess, testing new materials and recording their observations. Change materials weekly to maintain interest.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Success\n\n- **Prep ahead:** Freeze ice balls at least 24 hours in advance (or purchase from a specialty ice vendor). Prepare 2-3 backups in case of melting.\n- **Safety:** Ice is cold—limit hand-holding to 20-30 seconds per student. Provide paper towels for condensation.\n- **Lighting:** Conduct Explore and Elaborate in a darkened area to make light effects more visible. A small blanket over a table works well.\n- **Connection to photograph:** Return to the photograph frequently. Point out specific details: the patterns, the clarity, the light inside. This anchors abstract concepts to concrete observation.\n- **Language scaffolding:** Repeat key vocabulary naturally throughout. Use gestures (hands showing \"light going through\" vs. \"blocked\").\n- **Celebrate observations:** Affirm students' descriptions: \"You noticed the light made a pattern! That's exactly what a scientist would observe!\"",
