Students can observe and describe the transparency of the plastic, the color of the liquid, and how we can see through materials to observe what's inside.\n- **Purpose of Materials and Design:** The container is specifically designed to hold and store liquids safely. Its shape, material, and secure lid demonstrate how materials are chosen based on what they need to do.\n- **States of Matter – Liquids:** The yellow liquid visibly takes the shape of its container, a key observable property that distinguishes liquids from solids and gases.\n- **Testing Materials for Specific Purposes:** The image shows various materials in a car engine bay (hoses, plastic, metal parts). This demonstrates how different materials are selected because they have properties suited to their job—some materials withstand heat, some are flexible, some are strong.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**What's Inside? Exploring Containers and the Materials That Hold Our Liquids**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or three 30-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-PS1-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to describe and classify different kinds of materials by their observable properties.\n  - 2-PS1-2: Analyze data obtained from testing different materials to determine which materials have the properties that are best suited for an intended purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Describe and classify different materials by observing their properties (color, transparency, texture, flexibility, hardness).\n- Compare materials and explain which ones work best for holding liquids based on what they observe.\n- Predict what will happen when a liquid is placed in different types of containers.\n- Record observations about materials using drawings, words, and simple charts.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about containers and what they hold by exploring the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on screen or printed copies (one per pair/small group)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Whiteboard or smartboard\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image or distribute printed copies. Ask students to look closely at what they see. Give them 30 seconds of silent observation time.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (ask 3-4 in this order):**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What catches your eye first?\" (Allow students to describe the yellow liquid and clear container.)\n   - \"What is inside the clear container? How can you tell what's in there if the container is see-through?\" (Guide them to understand that we can see *through* clear materials.)\n   - \"Why do you think someone would use a clear plastic container instead of a metal one to hold this yellow liquid?\" (Elicit ideas about seeing what's inside, safety, purpose.)\n   - \"What other containers do you use at home to hold liquids? What are they made of?\" (Milk jugs, water bottles, cups—connect to their lives.)\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Think about a clear plastic cup, a metal pot, and a cloth towel. If we poured juice into each one, what would happen? Which one would actually hold the juice?\" Write predictions on chart paper. Tell students they'll test this idea today.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great observations! Today, we're going to be material scientists. We'll test different containers to figure out which materials work best for holding liquids, just like that container in the picture.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate which materials hold liquids and which don't by testing a variety of containers.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 5-6 different containers: clear plastic cup, metal tin or aluminum can, small glass jar, cloth drawstring bag, paper cup, plastic bag\n- Water (use food coloring to make it visible)\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Small pitcher or spray bottle for pouring water\n- Observation sheet (provided below) or simple chart paper\n- Pencils/crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Setting Up (5 minutes)**\n1. Organize students into pairs or small groups (3-4 students).\n2. Distribute one observation sheet per pair. Show students the chart with columns: \"Container Name,\" \"Material,\" \"What We Predict,\" and \"What Happened.\"\n3. Explain: \"We're going to pour a tiny bit of water into different containers. Before we pour, we'll guess what will happen. Then we'll write or draw what really happened.\"\n\n**Part 2: Hands-On Investigation (15 minutes)**\n1. **Container #1 (Clear Plastic Cup):** Ask students, \"What do you predict will happen when we pour water into this clear plastic cup?\" (It will hold the water.) Pour a small amount. Ask: \"Did the water stay in? Can you see the water? What's the material?\" Students record: \"YES—water stayed in. I can see through the plastic.\"\n\n2. **Container #2 (Cloth Bag):** Ask, \"Now what will happen with this cloth bag?\" (Some may predict it will hold it; others will guess it leaks.) Pour carefully. Water leaks through. Ask: \"What happened? Why do you think the water went through the cloth?\" Students record: \"NO—water came out. The cloth has tiny holes water can pass through.\"\n\n3. **Container #3 (Metal Tin):** Ask, \"This is metal. Will it hold water?\" (Yes, it's solid.) Pour water. It holds. Ask: \"Can you see through the metal?\" (No.) Students record: \"YES—metal is solid and holds water, but I can't see inside.\"\n\n4. **Container #4 (Paper Cup):** Ask, \"What about this paper cup?\" Pour water slowly. It should hold briefly, then may leak slightly depending on the cup. Students observe and record: \"YES—for now, but water may slowly leak through.\"\n\n5. **Container #5 (Plastic Bag):** Ask, \"Will this plastic bag hold water?\" Pour carefully. The bag holds water because it's flexible plastic. Ask: \"Is this the same as the cloth bag?\" Students record: \"YES—plastic bag holds water because plastic is not holey like cloth.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"What do you notice about this material?\" \"Why do you think the water stayed in (or leaked out)?\" \"How is this container different from the last one?\"\n- Encourage students to touch materials (safely) and describe texture, thickness, and flexibility.\n- Record observations on a large class chart as students work. Do NOT tell them answers—ask them to explain what they observe.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that some materials (plastic, metal, glass) hold liquids while others (cloth, some paper) do not.\n- Students begin to associate properties like being solid, smooth, and non-porous with the ability to hold liquids.\n- Students create a visual or written record showing which containers work and which don't.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and help students understand why materials have different properties and purposes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large class chart with all observations\n- Picture cards or labels for vocabulary (solid, liquid, material, property, flexible, transparent)\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Sample materials (small pieces: plastic, metal, cloth, paper)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask pairs: \"What did you find out? Which containers held the water?\"\n   - Create a class chart together: two columns labeled \"Held Water\" and \"Did Not Hold Water.\"\n   - Mark containers in each column.\n   - Ask: \"What do the containers that held water have in common? What about the ones that didn't?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   Present these terms on a chart with images or physical examples:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Material:** What something is made of (plastic, metal, cloth, paper, glass).\n   - **Property:** How something looks, feels, or acts (color, texture, if it's see-through, if it's hard or soft).\n   - **Solid:** A material that has a definite shape and doesn't flow like water does.\n   - **Liquid:** Something that flows and takes the shape of its container (like water or the yellow liquid in the picture).\n   - **Transparent:** You can see through it clearly (like clear plastic or glass).\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Redisplay the photo. Ask: \"Why did the person use a *clear plastic* container for this yellow liquid in the car engine? What property makes clear plastic a good choice?\"\n   - Guide students: \"It's transparent—we can see what's inside. It's solid—it holds the liquid. Plastic is flexible—it won't break easily.\"\n   - Ask: \"Would a cloth bag work here? Why not?\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"If I want to hold water, should I use plastic or cloth? Why?\"\n   - Have students point to materials in the room and name their properties: \"This desk is hard and solid. These curtains are soft and have tiny spaces.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that materials have observable properties.\n- Students recognize that properties of materials determine what they can be used for.\n- Students can identify transparent vs. non-transparent materials and solid vs. materials with holes.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by choosing the best materials for new purposes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or descriptions of scenarios (see below)\n- Sample material swatches: plastic wrap, aluminum foil, paper towel, cloth, felt, plastic cup pieces\n- Worksheet with scenario questions or chart paper for group work\n- Glue sticks and paper for creating a \"best material\" poster\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Material Sorting Challenge**\n\n1. Present scenarios one at a time:\n   - \"A farmer wants to store milk. Should she use plastic, metal, or cloth? Why?\"\n   - \"A gardener wants to catch rainwater for plants. Should the container be cloth, plastic, or paper? Why?\"\n   - \"You want to make a water balloon. Should you use plastic, metal, or cloth? Why?\"\n\n2. For each scenario, students discuss in pairs and point to or hold up the best material.\n\n3. Ask: \"How did you decide? What property made that material the best choice?\"\n\n**Option B: Design Your Own Container**\n\n1. Show students the original photo again. Explain: \"The yellow liquid in the car engine needs a strong, see-through container that won't leak and can handle being in a hot engine.\"\n\n2. Give groups a new scenario: \"Design a container to hold juice in a lunchbox. What material would you use? Why?\"\n\n3. Students draw or glue together material pieces to create their design and write/label why they chose each material.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Listen to student reasoning. Ask follow-up questions: \"Why did you pick plastic instead of cloth?\" \"What would happen if the container was cloth?\"\n- Affirm connections to properties: \"That's right! You chose plastic because it doesn't have holes and the liquid won't leak out.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply properties of materials to new situations.\n- Students explain their choices using evidence from exploration: \"Plastic works because it held the water and didn't leak.\"\n- Students recognize that the same material works for different purposes if it has the right properties.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students can observe properties of materials and match them to purposes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- During Explore: Observe which students correctly predict and explain what happens with each container. Do they describe properties (solid, transparent, flexible)?\n- During Explain: Listen to student responses when you ask why certain materials worked. Can they reference properties?\n- During Elaborate: Review their choices and explanations for the scenarios.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (paper or digital). Ask them to respond with words, drawings, or both:\n\n1. **\"I tested a [container name/material]. It [held the water / did not hold the water]. I know this because the material is _______.\" (solid, has holes, see-through, etc.)**\n\n2. **\"If you wanted to hold juice, would you use cloth or plastic? Draw or write why you picked that material.\"**\n\n3. **\"Name one property of a material. Give an example of a container that has that property.\"**\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify at least one property of a material (transparency, solidity, flexibility, porosity).\n- ✓ Student explains why a material will or won't hold a liquid by referencing a property.\n- ✓ Student makes a reasonable choice for a container material and provides a reason based on properties.\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary terms (material, property, solid, transparent) with some accuracy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nMost second graders should demonstrate:\n- Recognition that different materials have different properties.\n- Basic understanding that properties determine what a material can be used for.\n- Ability to predict and test whether a material will hold a liquid.\n- Increasing use of descriptive language about materials.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplify Vocabulary:** Focus on observable properties only (see-through/not see-through, holds water/doesn't hold water). Skip formal vocabulary like \"transparent\" initially; use kid-friendly language: \"Can you see through it?\"\n\n2. **Provide a Word Bank:** Give students a chart with pictures and simple labels (plastic, metal, cloth, water, container) during recording. Students can point or circle rather than write.\n\n3. **Pair with a Stronger Reader:** Pair students with peers or place them near the teacher during group share-out. Provide sentence frames: \"The [material] held the water because it is _____.\" or \"The [material] did not hold the water because it has _____.\"\n\n4. **Reduce Number of Containers:** Test only 3 containers instead of 5 (clear plastic, metal, cloth) to reduce cognitive load.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Introduce \"Waterproof\":** Ask advanced students, \"Which materials are waterproof? What does that word mean?\" Have them research or predict what happens if we soak cloth and plastic in water for a longer time. Do properties change?\n\n2. **Multiple Properties:** Ask students to describe materials using 3+ properties simultaneously: \"The plastic cup is clear, hard, and smooth. Because of these properties, it can hold water.\" Introduce comparative language: \"Plastic is more waterproof than cloth.\"\n\n3. **Problem-Solving Extension:** \"If we had a cloth that was treated with a special coating, could it hold water? Why or why not?\" Have them design or hypothesize about new materials.\n\n4. **Real-World Applications:** Ask students to look around the classroom or home and find 5 different containers. Have them identify the material of each and explain why that material was chosen for that purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Material Hunt\" Around the School:** Students take a classroom walk and photograph or sketch 5 different containers they find (water fountain cup, trash bin, teacher's pen holder, etc.). For each, they identify the material and predict whether it could hold water. Create a class poster: \"Containers We Found and What They're Made Of.\"\n\n2. **Mixing and Matching:** Provide students with pictures of different liquids (juice, milk, oil, honey, paint) and different containers (glass jar, plastic cup, metal can, paper bag). Students create matches and explain: \"Juice goes in a plastic cup because the cup is see-through and won't leak.\" Extend by asking: \"Would honey need a different container than juice? Why?\"\n\n3. **Design a Container for a Specific Liquid:** Give students a scenario like \"Design a container to hold paint in an art class\" or \"Design a container to hold a drink on a camping trip.\" They sketch or build a model using craft materials, label the materials used, and explain how the properties of their chosen materials solve the problem. This bridges to 2-PS1-2 (analyzing which materials are best for a purpose).\n\n4. **Heating and Cooling (Preview of 2-PS1-4):** If time and materials allow, conduct a follow-up investigation: \"Does ice melt faster in a plastic cup or a metal cup? Why?\" This introduces how properties can affect what happens to materials, leading to later lessons on heating and cooling.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure water is at room temperature. Supervise tipping/pouring carefully to prevent spills. Have paper towels readily available.\n- **Accessibility:** Provide hand-over-hand support for students with fine motor challenges during pouring and recording.\n- **Visual Supports:** Use the photograph and sample materials throughout the lesson. Second graders are concrete thinkers—seeing and touching materials reinforces learning more than explanation alone.\n- **Pacing:** If students are highly engaged in Explore, extend that phase and shorten Explain. The hands-on experience is the priority.\n- **Connection to Photo:** Return to the original photograph multiple times. Highlight the clear plastic container and ask, \"Why do you think they chose this material?\" This anchors learning to the real-world context.",
