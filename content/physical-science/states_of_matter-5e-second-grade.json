ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the neighborhood landscape with various materials near water.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph (large enough for all students to see)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the image on a large screen or printed poster where all students can see clearly. Point to different objects in the photo: the metal hydrant, plastic traffic cone, concrete sidewalk, grass, and water.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What different things do you see in this picture? Point to something and tell me what it's made of.\"\n   - \"Why do you think the sidewalk is made of hard concrete instead of grass? What would happen if you walked on grass all the time?\"\n   - \"Look at the traffic cone—it's bright orange and plastic. Why do you think it needs to be that color and made of plastic instead of metal like the hydrant?\"\n   - \"Which of these materials would sink in water, and which would float? Why do you think that?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"Today we're going to become material detectives. We're going to test different materials to figure out what makes them special and why people choose to use them in certain places. What material do you think would be best to make a water pipe that lasts a long time?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's find out by testing some materials ourselves, just like engineers do!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate observable properties of various materials through hands-on testing.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small samples of materials in containers or bags: metal object (small bolt or washer), plastic (piece of plastic cup or bag), wood (small block or craft stick), fabric (cotton or wool scrap), ceramic or stone (tile or rock), paper\n- Water in shallow containers or cups\n- Paper towels\n- Magnifying glasses (optional)\n- Clipboards and paper for recording\n- Pencils\n- Chart with columns labeled: \"Material,\" \"Hard or Soft,\" \"Bendy or Stiff,\" \"Stays Dry or Gets Wet\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize into Small Groups:** Divide the class into groups of 3-4 students. Each group receives a set of materials to test.\n\n2. **Student Directions (Teacher reads aloud and demonstrates first test):**\n   - \"We're going to be detectives and test each material. Pick up one material at a time.\"\n   - \"First, feel it with your hands. Is it hard or soft? Write down or draw what you feel.\"\n   - \"Next, try to bend it gently. Does it bend easily, or is it stiff? Draw or write this down.\"\n   - \"Now, we're going to test it with water. Dip it in the water cup for 3 seconds, then take it out. Does it get wet on the inside, or does water stay off it? Use a paper towel to check. Record what you find.\"\n   - \"Write or draw your observations on your chart.\"\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:** As groups work, ask: \"This metal is like the hydrant in the picture. Feel how hard it is. Why would that be good for a water pipe?\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:** \n   - Circulate among groups, observing and asking guiding questions: \"Tell me what you found. Is this material hard or soft? What happens when water touches it?\"\n   - Do NOT tell students the answers; instead, ask them what they observe.\n   - Help students record observations using words or simple drawings if writing is difficult.\n   - Redirect students to focus on observable properties.\n\n5. **Documentation:** Each group completes their chart or record sheet with drawings and/or words describing each material's properties.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students complete observation charts showing properties of at least 4-5 different materials.\n- They discover that materials have different properties: some are hard, some are soft; some are waterproof, some absorb water; some bend, some don't.\n- They notice that the same property (like \"hard\") appears in multiple materials.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and help students make sense of their discoveries by connecting properties to the photograph and real-world uses.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words written and illustrated\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student observation charts from Explore phase\n- Picture cards or real samples of materials (for reinforcement)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Gather the class together. Invite 2-3 groups to share one discovery from their testing.\n   - \"Tell us what you found about the plastic. Was it hard or soft? Did it get wet?\"\n   - Write their observations on a class chart without judgment.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary:** Write each term on chart paper with a simple illustration or example:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Property:** Something that tells us what a material is like. We can see, feel, or test a property. (Example: \"Hard is a property. Soft is a property.\")\n- **Material:** What something is made of. Metal, plastic, wood, fabric, ceramic, and paper are all materials. (Example: \"The cone is made of the material called plastic.\")\n- **Waterproof:** A material that water cannot get inside of. Water stays on top and rolls off. (Example: \"The metal hydrant is waterproof because water doesn't soak into it.\")\n- **Absorbent:** A material that soaks up water. Water goes into it. (Example: \"Paper is absorbent—it gets wet and soaks up water.\")\n- **Flexible:** A material that can bend or move without breaking. (Example: \"Plastic can be flexible—it bends.\")\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph:**\n   - Point to the metal hydrant: \"This is made of metal. From our testing, we found that metal is hard and waterproof. Why is that perfect for a water pipe? What would happen if it was made of absorbent paper instead?\" (Allow student responses.)\n   - Point to the grass: \"Grass is made of plant material. It's soft and absorbent. How does that help prevent the soil from washing away into the water?\"\n   - Point to the plastic cone: \"This cone is plastic. It's flexible and waterproof. Why is that good for a traffic cone that cars might bump into?\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Show me with your hand—is this material flexible?\" (Hold up cloth or plastic.)\n   - Ask: \"If I spilled water on paper, would it be waterproof or absorbent?\" (Students respond.)\n   - Ask: \"Which material from our test would be best for a water pipe? Why?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students understand and can identify at least 3 key material properties (hard, soft, waterproof, absorbent, flexible).\n- They can explain in simple terms why certain materials are used for certain purposes based on those properties.\n- They can point to examples in the classroom or photograph and describe the material and its properties.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of material properties to solve a new problem, deepening their grasp of how properties determine purpose.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or scenarios printed on paper (see scenarios below)\n- Different material samples or pictures of materials\n- Optional: small containers, water, and additional testing materials\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Problem Solving:**\nPresent students with 3 real-world scenarios. Read aloud, show a picture, or act out each one. Students work in pairs or small groups to solve the problem.\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"You need to make a rain jacket. Which material would you choose: plastic, paper, or fabric? Why?\"\n- Students choose the material and explain using properties they discovered.\n- Expected answer: Plastic or waterproof fabric because they are waterproof and water won't soak through.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"You're building a playground. What would you use for the ground where children play: concrete, grass, or metal? Why?\"\n- Students choose and explain.\n- Expected answer: Grass or soft material because it's soft and cushions falls. Hard concrete could hurt children.\n\n**Scenario 3:** \"You need to build a mailbox that will last outside in rain and sun for many years. Would you use plastic, paper, or metal? Why?\"\n- Students choose and explain.\n- Expected answer: Metal or plastic because they are waterproof and hard, so they won't get soggy or break easily.\n\n**Application Activity:**\nStudents draw or write about one material from their testing and explain where they would use it and why. Example: \"I would use plastic for a bucket because plastic is waterproof. Water won't leak through it.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion without giving away the answer.\n- Ask: \"Why did you choose that material? What property makes it good for this job?\"\n- Listen for student reasoning about properties, not just guessing.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply knowledge of properties to justify choices in real-world scenarios.\n- They write or draw explanations that connect material properties to function.\n- They demonstrate understanding that engineers and designers choose materials based on what properties they need.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of material properties and their ability to connect properties to purposes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Did students accurately test materials and record observations?\n- Questioning during Explain: Can students identify properties and use vocabulary correctly?\n- Responses during Elaborate: Do students justify material choices using properties they discovered?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\n**Option A (For students who can write):**\nShow a material (e.g., a metal spoon) and ask students to write or draw answers to these questions:\n1. \"What is this material made of?\"\n2. \"What are two properties of this material?\" (Example: hard and waterproof)\n3. \"What could you use it for, and why?\" (Example: \"A spoon for eating because it's hard and doesn't break in water.\")\n\n**Option B (For students who need pictures):**\nShow students three materials (hard plastic, soft fabric, metal) and ask them to:\n- Point to which one is flexible.\n- Point to which one is hard.\n- Draw or tell you one thing you could make with the material that is waterproof.\n\n**Option C (Interview Format for struggling learners):**\nAsk one-on-one:\n- \"Feel this. Is it hard or soft?\"\n- \"What is it made of?\"\n- \"Why would this be good for a ___?\" (Fill in a simple object.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student can identify at least 2 properties of a material correctly.\n- Student can name or recognize at least 1 material type from their testing.\n- Student can give a simple reason why a material would be used for a purpose based on one property (e.g., \"because it's hard\" or \"because water doesn't soak in\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding of material properties through observations, explanations, and applications.\n- They show growth in vocabulary use and ability to explain simple cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., \"The cone is plastic because plastic is flexible and won't break\").\n- Evidence of learning is captured through exit tickets, drawings, and teacher observations.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Focus:** Concentrate on just 2-3 key properties (hard/soft, wet/dry) instead of all five. Use consistent picture symbols alongside words so students build visual memory.\n\n2. **Paired Testing:** Pair struggling students with a strong partner during Explore. The partner helps with recording while the struggling student focuses on observing and describing what they see and feel.\n\n3. **Sentence Stems for Explanation:** Provide sentence starters for exit tickets:\n   - \"This material is _____ (hard/soft).\"\n   - \"It gets _____ (wet/dry) in water.\"\n   - \"I would use it for _____ because _____.\"\n   - Students can fill in blanks or copy and point to pictures.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Property Prediction:** Before testing, have advanced students predict what they think will happen to each material when tested with water. After testing, they compare predictions to results and write or draw an explanation of why they were right or wrong.\n\n2. **Design a New Material:** Challenge students to combine or modify materials to create something with specific properties. Example: \"How could you make something that is soft AND waterproof?\" Allow them to experiment with fabric + plastic wrap, paper + wax coating, etc.\n\n3. **Connecting to Engineering:** Introduce the idea of \"material choice matters.\" Give them a more complex scenario: \"An engineer is building a bridge over a river. It needs to be strong, not rust in water, and last 50 years. Should they use metal, plastic, or wood? Explain why using what you know about material properties.\" Students write a detailed response.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Materials Hunt Around School:** Take students on a guided walk around the school or classroom. Ask them to find and identify materials they tested (metal, plastic, wood, fabric, ceramic, paper). Have them record where they found it and explain why that material makes sense for that location. Return to class and create a class poster titled \"Where We Found Our Materials.\"\n\n2. **Waterproof Challenge:** Give students a small object (toy, book, snack) and various materials (plastic bag, paper, fabric, aluminum foil). Challenge them to wrap and protect the object so it stays dry when dipped in water for 5 seconds. Test which wrapping works best. Discuss: Which material property made the difference? This connects to real-world applications like waterproof packaging.\n\n3. **Create a Material Properties Poster:** Students choose one material from their testing (or a new one: rubber, leather, foil, etc.). They draw the material, write or copy its name, and illustrate or describe 3-4 of its properties. Create a classroom display titled \"Our Material Properties Museum\" where each poster showcases a different material. This reinforces vocabulary and classification.",
