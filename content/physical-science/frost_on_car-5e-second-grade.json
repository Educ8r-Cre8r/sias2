ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of frost on the car (frost_on_car.jpg) or printed copies\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or document camera so all students can see clearly. Point out the frost crystals sparkling in the sunlight.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see covering the car in this picture? What does it look like?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the car looks so sparkly and icy in the morning?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this on your car or house window? What was it?\"\n   - \"Do you think that sparkly stuff is the same as the water in your water bottle? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** Ask students, \"If we brought this frosty car into a warm garage, or if the sun warmed it up, what do you think would happen to all those sparkly ice crystals? Where would they go?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper under \"Our Predictions\" so you can revisit them later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become scientists and investigate frost! We'll figure out what frost really is and what happens when we warm it up.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Ice cubes (frozen water)\n- Several small cups or containers\n- Warm water (from a thermos; teacher-prepared)\n- Cold water (from a refrigerator or ice bath)\n- Paper towels\n- Observation sheets (template provided below)\n- Thermometers (optional, for older second graders or advanced learners)\n- Small objects that can be cooled: plastic spoons, metal spoons, rubber bands, paper clips\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Observing Ice (Frozen Water)**\n\n1. **Distribute an ice cube** to each pair of students in a small cup. Ask them to observe it closely for 2 minutes before touching it.\n\n   **Student Directions:**\n   - Look at the ice cube. What color is it? Is it shiny or dull? Is it smooth or bumpy?\n   - Carefully touch the ice cube with your finger. How does it feel? Use words like \"cold,\" \"hard,\" \"wet,\" or \"smooth.\"\n   - What do you think ice is made of? (Guide them: \"Ice is frozen water!\")\n   - Draw what your ice cube looks like on your observation sheet.\n\n2. **Place the ice cube in warm water** (prepared by the teacher in advance). Have students watch and record what happens over 5-10 minutes.\n\n   **Student Directions:**\n   - Watch your ice cube carefully. What is happening?\n   - Do you see water dripping or pooling in the cup? Where is the ice going?\n   - Touch the water in the cup. How does it feel different from the ice?\n   - Draw or write what you observe on your sheet.\n\n**Part B: Testing Materials in Cold Water**\n\n1. **Distribute small objects** (plastic spoon, metal spoon, rubber band, paper clip) and ask students to place them in cold water (ice bath set up by the teacher).\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - Put each object in the cold water for 2 minutes.\n   - Take it out and feel it. Did it get cold? Very cold or a little cold?\n   - Does this object feel cold like the ice cube did?\n   - Talk with your partner: Which materials get the coldest?\n\n3. **Record observations** on the observation sheet by drawing or circling pictures of materials that felt \"very cold\" versus \"a little cold.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice happening?\" \"Is the ice still a solid, or is it changing?\" \"Can you describe what you're seeing?\" Avoid telling them the answer; let them discover through observation.\n- Manage the warm water carefully for safety; handle all heating yourself.\n- Encourage students to use descriptive words and compare observations with a partner.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that ice (frozen water) melts when warmed and becomes liquid water again.\n- Students describe the properties of ice: hard, cold, smooth, shiny.\n- Students discover that different materials get cold at different rates or to different degrees.\n- Students record observations through drawings and simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms written large\n- The frost photograph (displayed again)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Small hand lens (magnifying glasses) for close-up viewing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask pairs to share one observation from their exploration: \"What did you notice when you put the ice in warm water?\"\n   - Record responses on chart paper (e.g., \"The ice got smaller,\" \"It turned into water,\" \"It felt wet\").\n   - Celebrate use of descriptive words.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   \n   Display and define these terms using student-friendly language:\n\n   - **Frost:** Ice crystals that form on surfaces when water in the air freezes. Frost is frozen water, just like ice cubes, but it grows in a feathery pattern.\n   - **Freeze:** When a liquid (like water) gets very cold and turns into a solid (like ice or frost).\n   - **Melt:** When a solid (like ice or frost) gets warm and turns back into a liquid (like water).\n   - **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is. We use a thermometer to measure it.\n   - **Reversible Change:** A change that can be undone. Freezing water into ice is reversible—you can melt it back into water again!\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the frost photograph again.\n   - \"This sparkly coating is frost—frozen water, just like your ice cubes! The frost formed because it was very, very cold outside, and water in the air froze solid on the car.\"\n   - \"What do you think happened to that frost when the sun came up and warmed the car?\" (Guide them to predict it melted, becoming water again.)\n   - \"That's a reversible change—the water froze into frost, and when it got warm, it melted back into water. It reversed!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Is frost the same thing as ice? What's the same? What's different?\" (Frost is made of ice crystals and forms from water vapor; ice cubes are frozen liquid water. Both are solid. Both melt when warmed.)\n   - Ask: \"If we left frost on a warm car, would it disappear? Why?\" (Yes, it would melt or evaporate and turn back into water or water vapor.)\n\n**Vocabulary Chart (displayed in classroom):**\n\n| Term | Kid-Friendly Definition |\n|------|------------------------|\n| **Frost** | Tiny ice crystals that form on cold surfaces when water in the air freezes |\n| **Freeze** | When water gets so cold it turns into ice or frost |\n| **Melt** | When ice or frost gets warm and turns back into water |\n| **Temperature** | How hot or cold something is |\n| **Reversible Change** | A change that can be undone (like water freezing into ice and melting back) |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that frost is frozen water, similar to ice cubes.\n- Students can explain that heating (warming) causes frost or ice to melt back into water.\n- Students recognize that freezing and melting are reversible changes.\n- Students use vocabulary terms in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Water in cups (for each pair)\n- Freezer access or ice bath with salt\n- Thermometers (if available)\n- Spray bottle filled with water\n- Cold outdoor surface or freezer\n- Observation sheets for new investigation\n- Index cards for predictions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**\"Can We Make Frost?\" Investigation**\n\n1. **Pose the Challenge:** \"Now that we know frost is frozen water from the air, can we make frost in our classroom?\"\n\n2. **Student Prediction (3 minutes):**\n   - \"What would we need to do to make water freeze into ice or frost?\" \n   - Have students draw or write a prediction on an index card. (Expected predictions: \"Make it cold,\" \"Put it in a freezer,\" \"Make it very, very cold.\")\n\n3. **Guided Investigation (10 minutes):**\n   \n   **Option A (if freezer access is available):**\n   - Students place a cup of water in a freezer for 15-20 minutes while you continue the lesson.\n   - Spray water on a cold surface (outside if it's below freezing, or on ice) and observe if frost or ice forms.\n   - Check the cup in the freezer and observe the ice forming.\n\n   **Option B (if no freezer):**\n   - Create an ice bath by filling a large container with ice and adding salt.\n   - Place a cup of water in the ice bath.\n   - Use a thermometer to show students the temperature dropping.\n   - Observe condensation and frost forming on the outside of the cold cup.\n\n4. **Student Observations:**\n   - \"What happened to the water? Did it freeze? How long did it take?\"\n   - \"Can we reverse this change? What would we need to do?\" (Warm it up to melt it back.)\n   - Record observations on the investigation sheet.\n\n5. **Real-World Connection (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Frost forms on cars on cold nights because the air temperature drops below freezing, and water in the air freezes on the cold surface. When the sun comes up and warms the car, the frost melts—the change reverses!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the investigation without giving answers.\n- Ask: \"What do you notice? Is it the same as the ice cube you watched melt? How is it different?\"\n- Help students see the connection between their ice cube melting and frost on a car.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that freezing is the opposite of melting.\n- Students understand that cold temperatures cause water to freeze and warm temperatures cause it to melt.\n- Students apply the concept of reversible change to a real-world phenomenon (frost formation and disappearance).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observation of student descriptions during Engage phase (Can they use descriptive words?)\n- Review of observation sheets from Explore phase (Did they record what they saw?)\n- Listen to student responses during the Explain phase vocabulary check (Do they use terms correctly?)\n- Watch student predictions and investigations during Elaborate (Do they apply their learning?)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal or written/drawn). Ask them to respond to **all three** of these prompts:\n\n1. **\"What is frost? Draw or write what frost is.\"**\n   - Success Criteria: Student identifies frost as frozen water or ice crystals. Drawing or writing shows understanding (e.g., \"Frost is ice,\" \"Frozen water on cars\").\n\n2. **\"What happens to frost when the sun warms it up?\"**\n   - Success Criteria: Student explains that frost melts or turns into water. Acceptable responses: \"It melts,\" \"It turns to water,\" \"It disappears and becomes water.\"\n\n3. **\"Is freezing water into ice a change that can be reversed? Why or why not?\"**\n   - Success Criteria: Student answers \"Yes\" and provides a reason like \"You can melt it back into water\" or \"When it gets warm, it changes back.\"\n\n**Alternative Assessment (if written exit tickets are too challenging):**\nConduct a quick verbal check-in with 4-5 students using the same questions. Record responses on a checklist.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 80% of students correctly identify frost as frozen water.\n- At least 80% of students predict that warming causes frost to melt or disappear.\n- At least 75% of students recognize that freezing is a reversible change.\n- Students use vocabulary terms (freeze, melt, reversible) in their responses.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Sentence Frames for Explanations:**\n   Provide students with sentence starters to help them articulate their thinking:\n   - \"Frost is _______________.\"\n   - \"When we add heat, the frost will _______________.\"\n   - \"Freezing water into ice is reversible because _______________.\"\n\n2. **Simplified Observation Sheets:**\n   Use picture-based observation sheets with checkboxes or simple drawings instead of writing. For example, a sheet with images of ice, water, and frost, and students circle which ones are \"cold\" or \"solid.\"\n\n3. **Hands-On Partner Support:**\n   Pair struggling learners with more confident peers during Explore activities. Assign specific roles: one student observes while the other records by drawing.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Temperature Measurement:**\n   Have advanced students use thermometers to measure and record temperatures of ice, cold water, and warm water. Create a simple temperature chart showing which temperature causes freezing and which causes melting.\n\n2. **Predict the Order of Melting:**\n   Provide three different-sized ice cubes or frost samples and ask students to predict which will melt fastest and why. Have them test and explain their results using concepts of surface area and heat transfer.\n\n3. **Extend to Evaporation:**\n   Challenge students to predict what happens to water after it melts from frost. Discuss that water can also evaporate into the air as an invisible gas, and that frost actually forms from water vapor in the air. Set up a simple demonstration of water evaporating from a dish left in a warm place.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frost Hunt Walk:**\n   On a cold morning, take students on a brief outdoor walk to observe frost on various surfaces (grass, car windows, metal fences, leaves). Have them sketch or photograph different frost patterns and discuss why frost forms on some surfaces more than others. This connects to real-world observation and the concept that frost forms on cold surfaces when the air contains moisture.\n\n2. **Reversible vs. Irreversible Changes Sorting Activity:**\n   Provide pictures or real examples of various changes (ice melting, paper burning, chocolate melting, toast browning, water freezing, cooking an egg, salt dissolving in water, frost disappearing). Have students sort them into \"Can Be Reversed\" and \"Cannot Be Reversed\" categories. Discuss why freezing/melting are reversible but cooking is not.\n\n3. **Home Frost Observation Journal:**\n   Send students home with a simple one-page observation sheet and ask them to observe and draw frost (if it's available in their area and season) or ice on a car window, window pane, or other surface over the course of a week. Have them draw what they see on day 1 and day 3, and write a caption explaining what happened. Bring sheets back to class and create a \"Frost Collection\" display.\n\n---",
