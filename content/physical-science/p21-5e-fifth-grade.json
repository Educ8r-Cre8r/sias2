Energy, Work, and Power Machines**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-PS3-1: Use models to describe that energy in animals' food (used for body repair, growth, motion, and to maintain body warmth) was once energy from the sun.\n  - 5-PS2-1: Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\nStudents will be able to...\n1. Explain how energy from fuel is converted into motion in an engine.\n2. Identify the main parts of an engine and describe what work each part does.\n3. Describe how forces inside an engine create movement and power.\n4. Compare energy transformations in engines to energy use in living things.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of engine printed large (24\" × 36\") OR projected on screen\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Timer\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Hook (3 minutes):** Project or display the large engine photograph. Ask students to look silently for 30 seconds without talking. Then ask:\n\n   > \"What do you notice? What do you wonder about?\"\n\n2. **Guided Discussion (7–10 minutes):** Ask students these specific questions:\n   - **Question 1:** \"What do you think all these metal parts are doing inside the engine?\" (Activate prior knowledge of machines)\n   - **Question 2:** \"If you've ridden in a car, you know it moves very fast. Where does that energy come from?\" (Connect to energy concept)\n   - **Question 3:** \"Look at all the hoses and tubes. Why do you think a car engine needs so many different parts working together?\" (Encourage systems thinking)\n   - **Question 4:** \"Have you ever felt the hood of a car after it's been running? Why do you think it's so hot?\" (Introduce thermal energy without naming it yet)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt (2 minutes):** On chart paper, write: *\"How does squeezing liquid (fuel) turn into pushing and pulling that makes the car go?\"* Explain that today, students will investigate this mystery using a simple model.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to build a tiny model engine to see how fuel energy becomes movement—just like in a real car engine!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- 1 empty plastic syringe (10 mL or 20 mL, no needle)\n- 1 length of clear plastic tubing (small diameter, 12–18 inches)\n- 1 small foam or plastic cup (8 oz)\n- 1 rubber band\n- Warm water (about 2 cups per group)\n- 1 piece of clay or modeling compound\n- Tape\n- 1 balloon\n- 1 piece of thick straw (optional, for pivot point)\n- Towels for spills\n\n**Setup Note:** The syringe will act as the \"engine cylinder,\" and students will demonstrate how pressure (like combustion in a real engine) creates force and movement.\n\n**Activity: \"Build a Simple Pressure-Powered Machine\"**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Assemble the syringe system (5 minutes):**\n   - Fill the syringe plunger halfway with warm water.\n   - Attach one end of the tubing tightly to the tip of the syringe (use clay or tape to secure if needed).\n   - Insert the other end of the tubing into an inflated balloon tied off at the neck, OR place the tubing into a small cup of water.\n   - Secure all connections so they don't leak.\n\n2. **Test the system (5 minutes):**\n   - Slowly push the syringe plunger down. Observe what happens:\n     - Does the balloon expand?\n     - Does water move through the tube?\n     - What forces are you feeling as you push?\n   - Record observations in a chart with columns: *What I pushed* / *What I felt* / *What moved*\n\n3. **Explore force and distance (5 minutes):**\n   - Push the plunger gently and slowly. Record what happens.\n   - Push the plunger hard and fast. Record what happens.\n   - Try pushing halfway, then all the way. Does the balloon inflate more when you push harder?\n\n4. **Connect to the engine (5 minutes):**\n   - Look at the engine photograph again. Discuss with your partner:\n     - Where is the \"plunger\" in a real engine?\n     - What pushes the plunger in a real engine? (fuel burning—provide hint if needed)\n     - What is being pushed through the \"tubes\" in a real engine? (Refer back to visible hoses)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"What made the balloon bigger?\"* and *\"If you pushed harder, what happened?\"*\n- Do **not** explain causation; let students discover through doing.\n- Prevent frustration by helping with tubing connections, but let students predict outcomes.\n- Encourage use of comparative language: *\"faster,\" \"stronger,\" \"bigger\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that pushing force creates movement or pressure in another location.\n- Students observe that harder/faster pushing creates more noticeable effects.\n- Students record clear before-and-after observations.\n- Students begin to connect the syringe action to engine cylinder action.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Engine photograph (displayed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Simple diagram of engine cycle (4 images showing: fuel enters, fuel ignites, pressure pushes down, exhaust leaves) — teacher-drawn or printed\n- Syringe demonstration model (on hand for re-demonstration)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2–3 pairs to share their discoveries:\n     - *\"What happened when you pushed the plunger?\"*\n     - *\"What was the difference between pushing gently and pushing hard?\"*\n   - Record student language on chart paper. Affirm use of words like *force*, *push*, *movement*, *pressure*.\n\n2. **Mini-Lecture with Visuals (8–10 minutes):**\n   \n   Use the engine photo and simple 4-step cycle diagram. Say:\n\n   > \"In a real car engine, something similar happens, but instead of you pushing a syringe, fuel burns really fast. When fuel burns, it creates a tiny explosion that pushes super hard—like your hard syringe push, but much stronger. This pushing force moves metal parts called pistons (point to cylinder in photo). The pistons move up and down very fast—hundreds of times per second! All those movements work together to turn the wheels and move the car.\"\n\n   - **Point to visible parts** as you speak: cylinders, hoses, metal surfaces.\n   - **Emphasize:** *\"The engine converts chemical energy [in fuel] into mechanical energy [movement].\"*\n\n3. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - **Thumbs up, sideways, or down:** \"Show me if you understand how pushing on the syringe is like burning fuel in an engine.\"\n   - **Think-Pair-Share:** \"Turn to a partner. In one sentence, explain what work the syringe plunger did.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Energy** | The ability to do work or make things move. (Fuel has energy; moving things have energy.) |\n| **Force** | A push or pull that can move something or change how it moves. (You applied force when you pushed the syringe.) |\n| **Fuel** | Material that stores energy and can be burned to release that energy. (Cars use gasoline; your body uses food.) |\n| **Piston** | A metal rod inside an engine that moves up and down, pushed by burning fuel. (Like your syringe plunger.) |\n| **Mechanical Energy** | Energy of movement. (When the syringe plunger moves, it has mechanical energy.) |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the main parts of the engine in the photo.\n- Students understand that burning fuel creates a force.\n- Students recognize that force causes movement.\n- Students can make a comparison between the syringe model and a real engine.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Engine photograph\n- Index cards with scenarios (see below)\n- Optional: toy cars, ramps, weights\n- Whiteboard or paper for quick sketches\n\n**Activity: \"Energy Detectives: Compare Engines and Living Things\"**\n\nThis activity explicitly connects to NGSS 5-PS3-1 (energy from food/sun).\n\n1. **Scenario Cards (10 minutes):**\n   - Divide class into pairs. Give each pair a scenario card. Options:\n\n     **Card A:** *\"A race car zooms down the track very fast. Where did that energy come from? Trace it back as far as you can.\"* \n     (Expected thinking: Fuel → burning → force → motion. But where did the fuel come from? From ancient plants/algae → stored sun energy.)\n\n     **Card B:** *\"You ate breakfast before school. How is your energy like the car's fuel energy? How is it different?\"* \n     (Expected thinking: Both convert stored energy into movement. Your food came from plants/animals. Plants got energy from the sun.)\n\n     **Card C:** *\"An engine gets very hot and needs cooling tubes. A running person also gets hot and sweats. What do they have in common?\"* \n     (Expected thinking: Both convert energy, some becomes heat. Both need to cool down.)\n\n   - Have pairs **discuss and sketch** their answer on an index card.\n\n2. **Gallery Walk (3 minutes):**\n   - Post all scenario responses around the room.\n   - Have students walk and read others' responses.\n\n3. **Whole-Class Discussion (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: *\"What did you notice? How is an engine like a living thing?\"* \n   - Affirm responses connecting energy conversion: both take in fuel/food, convert it to movement and heat, and need to manage waste/cooling.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask follow-up questions that push thinking: *\"Where did that food come from? Where did that fuel come from?\"*\n- Guide students to recognize that both originally trace back to the sun's energy.\n- Validate all reasonable thinking, even if incomplete.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students articulate connections between engine energy and biological energy (eating food, physical activity).\n- Students begin to understand that energy comes from different sources but follows similar transformation patterns.\n- Students provide evidence (drawn or written) of their thinking.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During lesson):**\n- **Syringe exploration observations:** Check recorded data for evidence that students applied force and observed effects.\n- **Think-Pair-Share responses:** Listen for accurate language (force, movement, pushing, energy).\n- **Thumbs check:** Visual confirmation of comprehension of syringe-to-engine comparison.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5–10 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (index card or slip). Students respond to **all three** of these prompts:\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Sketch a simple engine cylinder with a piston. Label where the fuel burns and show the direction the piston moves.\n\n2. **Explain in words:** How is burning fuel in a car engine similar to what happened when you pushed your syringe plunger?\n\n3. **Challenge question:** If you pushed the syringe plunger twice as hard, what would happen to the balloon (or water)? Why?\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Student can identify/sketch a piston and fuel location in an engine.\n✓ Student uses language connecting force (pushing) to movement.\n✓ Student recognizes that greater force creates greater effect.\n✓ Student makes at least one valid comparison between model and real engine.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Exit tickets should show accurate sketches and explanations.\n- Students should use vocabulary (force, fuel, energy, piston, movement) accurately in written or verbal responses.\n- Responses to the \"challenge question\" indicate whether students understand proportional relationships between force and effect.\n- Review scenario card discussions for evidence of energy transformation understanding.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for students who struggle)\n\n1. **Simplified syringe task:** \n   - Reduce the activity to just pushing and observing balloon inflation. Provide a sentence frame: *\"When I pushed _____, the balloon _____.\"* \n   - Skip the tubing; have students push directly into a balloon taped to the syringe.\n\n2. **Vocabulary support:** \n   - Provide a word bank with pictures for the exit ticket: (force, fuel, piston, energy, push, movement).\n   - Allow students to match definitions to words rather than write descriptions.\n\n3. **Peer partnering:** \n   - Pair struggling readers/writers with stronger peers during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n   - Encourage verbal explanations instead of written ones for exit ticket.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Multi-stage investigation:** \n   - Ask: *\"What if you had two syringes connected? How would the force change?\"* Have students design and test a two-syringe system.\n\n2. **Deeper energy connections:** \n   - Provide a challenge scenario: *\"If a car engine wastes energy as heat, where does that heat go? How is it managed?\"* (Hint: cooling system visible in photo.) \n   - Have students research and report on real-world cooling systems.\n\n3. **Mathematical extension:** \n   - Have students measure syringe volume pushed versus balloon inflation, creating a simple graph or ratio: *Force applied → Distance balloon expands*.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Real-World Engine Walk (Take-Home or Field Activity):**\n   - Have families visit a car dealership, mechanic shop, or online (YouTube) and observe a real engine. \n   - Students draw and label the parts they see, comparing to the photograph and their syringe model.\n   - Write a reflection: *\"Which parts of the real engine did you recognize from the photograph? What surprised you?\"*\n\n2. **Energy Transformation Poster Project:**\n   - Students create a visual sequence showing energy transformation: Sun → Fuel (chemical energy) → Burning (thermal energy) → Movement (mechanical energy) → Heat (thermal energy released).\n   - Repeat the sequence for food energy in living things. Display both side-by-side to show comparison.\n\n3. **Classroom \"Fuel Burn\" Simulation (Supervised, Safe):**\n   - Using a candle, match, or heat source (with strict safety protocols and adult supervision), show a small, controlled burn and measure the heat with a thermometer.\n   - Connect observation to engine combustion: *\"This tiny flame produced heat. In an engine, many fuel explosions happen every second, creating much more heat and force.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Syringe sourcing:** Ask a school nurse, pharmacy, or medical supply company for 10 mL syringes (needles removed/never included). Many donate these.\n- **Safety first:** Warm water should be warm to touch, not hot. No boiling water. Ensure no leaks onto electrical outlets.\n- **Timing flexibility:** If students engage deeply in Explore, extend that phase. The Elaborate phase can be shortened or moved to Day 2.\n- **Real-world connection:** Many Fifth Graders have ridden in cars. Activate this experience repeatedly: *\"Remember when you felt the engine's rumble?\"* or *\"Remember when the hood was hot after a long drive?\"*\n- **Photograph value:** Refer back to the engine photo at least 5 times during the lesson. Students need repeated visual anchoring to abstract concepts.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson solidly grounds abstract energy and force concepts in hands-on experience and real-world context, meeting NGSS expectations for Fifth Grade Physical Science while maintaining high engagement and developmentally appropriate language.",
