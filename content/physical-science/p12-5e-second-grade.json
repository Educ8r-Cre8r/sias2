Let's Explore Vibrations!**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-PS1-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to describe and classify different kinds of materials by their observable properties.\n  - 2-PS1-2: Analyze data obtained from testing different materials to determine which materials have the properties that are best suited for an intended purpose.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Observe and describe how different materials vibrate to make sound.\n2. Classify instruments based on what materials they are made from and the sounds they produce.\n3. Explain that sound is made when objects vibrate and that different materials make different sounds.\n4. Test and compare which materials make the best sound makers.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the brass band performing on stage.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph projected on screen or printed for whole-group viewing\n- Audio recording of brass instruments (optional; 30–60 seconds of trumpets, trombones, or tuba playing)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image of the student brass band on the board or pass around printed copies. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation before asking questions.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (Calibrated to Second Grade):**\n   - \"What do you notice the students in the red and blue shirts are holding?\" (Accept: instruments, tubes, shiny things, musical things.)\n   - \"Look at their mouths. What do you think they are doing with those instruments?\" (Accept: blowing, playing, making sound, making music.)\n   - \"Why do you think some of these instruments are bigger than others?\" (Accept: to make different sounds, because bigger = louder, etc.)\n   - \"If you could pick one of these instruments to play, which one would you choose, and why?\" (Open-ended; builds ownership and curiosity.)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what makes these instruments sound so loud and fun? Let's find out today how instruments make sound!\"\n\n4. **Show Optional Audio Clip:** Play 30–60 seconds of brass band music. Ask: \"Can you hear how different each instrument sounds? Some are high, some are low, some are loud. What do you think is inside these instruments that makes them different?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be like scientists and test different materials to see which ones can make the best sounds, just like the musicians in this picture!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity that mimics how instruments produce sound.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small rubber bands (assorted sizes: thin, thick, small, large)\n- Wooden rulers or wooden paint sticks\n- Paper cups (different sizes: small, medium, large)\n- Cardboard tubes (paper towel rolls, wrapping paper tubes)\n- Wooden spoons\n- Aluminum foil\n- Plastic bottles (small, empty, clean)\n- Water (for optional experiments)\n- Rice or dried beans\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording observations\n- Student science journals or paper for drawings/notes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set Up Stations:** Arrange materials into 4–5 exploration stations around the classroom. Each station focuses on a different material or method:\n   - **Station 1 – Rubber Band Vibrations:** Rubber bands of different thicknesses stretched across a ruler or wooden stick\n   - **Station 2 – Shaker Makers:** Empty plastic bottles, paper cups, and containers with rice/beans inside\n   - **Station 3 – Striker Sounds:** Cardboard tubes, wooden spoons, and rulers that can be tapped on tables\n   - **Station 4 – Bottle Sounds:** Plastic bottles filled with water at different levels\n\n2. **Student Directions (Read Aloud and Post Visually):**\n   - \"You are going to visit each station and test the materials to see what sounds they make.\"\n   - \"At each station, follow these steps:\n     1. Look carefully at the materials.\n     2. Try playing or using the materials to make a sound. Feel with your fingers—do they vibrate?\n     3. Describe the sound: Is it loud or quiet? High or low?\n     4. Draw and write (or dictate) what you discovered in your science journal.\"\n   - \"Use your ears to listen carefully and your hands to gently feel the vibrations.\"\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:** Remind students: \"Just like the musicians in the picture, you are going to make sounds using different things. Some instruments are made from metal (like trumpets), some from wood, and some from other materials. Let's see what sounds different materials make!\"\n\n4. **What Students Record:**\n   - **Draw:** Quick sketches of what they're testing\n   - **Describe:** Use provided sentence starters: \"This material sounds ___.\" \"When I ___, it vibrates.\" \"The sound is loud/quiet/high/low.\"\n   - **Feel:** Physically touch and note if they feel vibrations\n\n5. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate to each station (spend 3–4 minutes per student/small group)\n   - Ask guiding questions (not leading): \"What do you notice?\" \"Does it feel like anything is shaking?\" \"How would you describe that sound?\"\n   - Encourage students to compare: \"How is this sound different from the sound at the last station?\"\n   - Do NOT tell them the \"right\" answer; let them discover through play and observation\n   - Listen for vocabulary emergence (loud, quiet, high, low, shake, vibrate) and affirm it\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that different materials make different sounds\n- Students begin to notice vibrations when they touch objects producing sound\n- Students generate descriptions of sounds (loud/quiet, high/low)\n- Students see patterns: thicker rubber bands may make lower sounds; shaking containers with different fillings make different sounds\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Photograph (display again)\n- Markers\n- Audio clips or a real instrument (trumpet, drum, or rubber band) for demonstration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - Gather students in a circle or on the carpet\n   - Ask 3–4 volunteers to share one discovery from their stations\n   - Accept all responses: \"Maya found that a thick rubber band makes a lower sound than a thin one. That's a great observation!\"\n   - Record observations on chart paper in a visible list or simple chart\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (with Second Grade-Friendly Definitions):**\n   Create a visual anchor chart with pictures/drawings alongside words:\n\n   - **Vibration:** \"When something shakes back and forth really, really fast—so fast your eyes can't see it, but your fingers can feel it. Vibrations make sound!\"\n   - **Sound:** \"Energy that travels from something that is vibrating. Your ears hear sounds!\"\n   - **Material:** \"What something is made from—like metal, wood, plastic, or paper. Different materials sound different.\"\n   - **Loud/Quiet:** \"Loud means the sound is strong and easy to hear. Quiet means the sound is soft and hard to hear.\"\n   - **High/Low:** \"High sounds are like a whistle or bell. Low sounds are like a drum or bass.\"\n\n3. **Make Connections Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Point to the brass instruments: \"These shiny tubes are made of metal. When the musicians blow air into them, the metal vibrates—shakes really fast—and makes sound!\"\n   - Point to different instruments: \"A small trumpet makes higher sounds. A big tuba makes lower sounds. Why? Because the bigger instrument vibrates differently!\"\n   - \"The louder sounds come from bigger instruments and stronger vibrations.\"\n\n4. **Live Demonstration (Choose One):**\n   - **Option A:** Pluck a rubber band stretched on a ruler and have students watch the rubber band vibrate while listening. Ask: \"Can you see it shaking? Can you hear the sound?\"\n   - **Option B:** Play a short audio clip of the brass band photo's music and point out different sounds: \"Hear that low sound? That's probably a tuba. Hear that bright, high sound? That's the trumpet!\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"What did you discover about vibrations at your station?\" (Formative)\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think a big rubber band and a small rubber band make different sounds?\" (Formative—listen for mention of vibration)\n   - Thumbs up/sideways/down: \"Do you understand that vibrations make sound?\" (Quick pulse check)\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart (Create and Display):**\n\n| Word | Student-Friendly Definition | Picture/Example |\n|------|--------------------------|---|\n| **Vibration** | When something shakes back and forth really fast to make sound | Drawing of a rubber band shaking |\n| **Sound** | Energy that travels from vibrating things that we hear with our ears | Sound waves or ear icon |\n| **Material** | What something is made from (metal, wood, plastic, paper) | Pictures of different materials |\n| **Loud** | Strong sound that is easy to hear | Megaphone or speaker |\n| **Quiet** | Soft sound that is hard to hear | Whisper or small bell |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word \"vibration\" or \"shakes\" to explain sound\n- Students identify materials in instruments and connect material to sound quality\n- Students distinguish between loud/quiet and high/low sounds\n- Students explain (in simple terms) that vibrations make sound\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing and testing their own simple sound makers.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Empty plastic bottles or paper cups (one per student or pair)\n- Various fill options: rice, dried beans, sand, small pasta, water, pebbles\n- Rubber bands\n- Tape or craft glue\n- Aluminum foil\n- Markers for decorating\n- \"Instrument Design Sheet\" (simple template with: Draw your design, List your materials, Describe the sound)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Challenge Introduction (Read Aloud):**\n   - \"Now that we know vibrations make sound, let's design our own instrument! You're going to be an instrument maker, just like the people who made the brass instruments in the picture.\"\n   - \"Your challenge: Use the materials at your table to make an instrument that makes a sound. You can fill a cup with something, stretch rubber bands, tap things—whatever you want! But here's the rule: You must be able to describe what material you used and what sound it makes.\"\n\n2. **Student Steps:**\n   - **Choose materials:** Students select 2–3 materials they want to test\n   - **Create:** Build a simple sound maker (e.g., fill a cup with rice and cover it; stretch rubber bands on a stick; tap a metal spoon on different things)\n   - **Test:** Play their instrument and listen to the sound\n   - **Describe:** Draw or write a label: \"This sounds ___\" or \"I used ___ to make a ___ sound\"\n   - **Compare (Optional):** Share with a partner and talk about whose sounds are louder, higher, different\n\n3. **Connection to Real Instruments:**\n   - Ask: \"Do you think the trumpet player in the picture used rubber bands or rice to make sound?\" (No—they blew air!)\n   - \"But the idea is the same: vibrations make the sound. The musician's breath vibrates the metal, and that makes the sound travel to our ears.\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Facilitate access to materials; help students safely secure or fill containers\n   - Ask discovery questions: \"What happens if you add more rice?\" \"What happens if you use smaller rubber bands?\"\n   - Celebrate creative designs and sounds: \"You made a really interesting low sound!\"\n   - Encourage students to listen to each other's instruments and notice differences\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students create a functioning sound maker\n   - Students explain (verbally or with a drawing) what material they used and describe the sound\n   - Students recognize that their design mimics how real instruments work\n   - Students compare their instruments and note differences in sound based on materials and design choices\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of vibrations, materials, and sound production.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n   - **Observation Checklist** (use during Explore and Elaborate phases):\n     - ☐ Student tests materials and describes sounds (loud/quiet, high/low)\n     - ☐ Student notices vibrations when touching sound-making objects\n     - ☐ Student uses vocabulary: vibration, material, sound, loud, quiet\n     - ☐ Student explains connection between vibrations and sound (in simple terms)\n\n2. **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson 2):**\n   \n   **Option A – Drawing + Sentence (Kindergarten/Early Grade 2):**\n   - \"Draw a picture of something that vibrates to make sound.\"\n   - \"Write or tell me: What makes the sound? _______________\"\n   \n   **Option B – Short Response (Grade 2 On-Level):**\n   - Show a picture of a drum, trumpet, or rubber band\n   - Ask: \"What has to happen for this to make a sound?\"\n   - Accept answers like: \"It vibrates,\" \"It shakes,\" \"Something hits it,\" etc.\n\n   **Option C – Compare & Explain (Grade 2 Advanced):**\n   - \"Look at the instruments in the picture. A trumpet is smaller than a tuba. How do you think their sounds are different? Why?\"\n   - Accept: \"The trumpet is smaller so it vibrates differently and makes a higher sound\" or similar explanations\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n   - **All students should:** Identify that vibrations make sound; describe a sound they created using simple language (loud/quiet, high/low); identify materials in instruments\n   - **Most students should:** Explain that different materials make different sounds; make a connection between their exploration and the photograph\n   - **Some students should:** Design a two-material instrument and predict which will sound louder based on material properties\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that vibrations = sound\n- Students classify and describe sounds based on observations\n- Students connect materials to sound properties\n- Students apply learning to a new context (their own instrument design)\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Station Setup:** Reduce the number of materials at each station to 2–3 core items. Pre-select only the most obviously different sounds (e.g., large vs. small rubber bands; plastic bottle with rice vs. empty)\n   \n2. **Sentence Starters & Visuals:** Provide a card with picture + word choices:\n   - \"This sound is: ☐ LOUD ☐ QUIET\"\n   - \"I felt: ☐ Vibrations ☐ No vibrations\"\n   - Allow students to point and circle rather than write\n\n3. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair with a stronger communicator; let partner ask the guiding questions while struggling learner observes and responds\n\n4. **Vocabulary Pre-Teaching:** Introduce \"vibration,\" \"loud,\" and \"quiet\" in a 5-minute mini-lesson the day before (show video of visible vibrations—like a speaker with water droplets)\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-Material Design:** Challenge students to create an instrument using at least 3 different materials and explain why they chose each one. Example: \"I used a plastic bottle filled with beans AND rubber bands because I wanted both shaker sounds and a plucking sound.\"\n\n2. **Sound Comparison & Prediction:** Provide prediction sheets:\n   - \"Predict: Will a bottle filled with rice or a bottle filled with water sound louder? Why?\"\n   - Test and record whether prediction was correct\n   - Extend: \"What if we added more rice? How would that change the sound?\"\n\n3. **Instrument Research Connection:** Provide pictures of 2–3 real instruments and ask students to sort them by material (metal, wood) and predict whether they make high or low sounds based on size and material. Have them listen to an audio clip and check predictions.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rubber Band Guitar:** Stretch rubber bands of different thicknesses across a shoebox or plastic container. Have students pluck them, observe vibrations, and notice how thickness changes pitch. Create a class \"band\" and play simple songs together.\n\n2. **Water Xylophone:** Fill glass bottles or drinking glasses with different amounts of water. Tap with wooden spoons to create different pitches. Create a simple melody (e.g., \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\") and perform as a class. Connect to the brass band: \"We made different pitches with water, just like trumpets and tubas make different pitches!\"\n\n3. **Sound Walk:** Take students on a \"listening walk\" around the school or playground. Record or list all the sounds they hear (footsteps, wind, birds, etc.). Sort sounds by loud/quiet and high/low. Discuss: \"What is vibrating to make each sound?\" This reinforces that vibrations are everywhere and connects to real-world science.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Supervise use of small items (beans, rice) to ensure they are not eaten. Ensure water bottles are sealed tightly.\n- **Pacing:** If students need more time in Explore, reduce Elaborate time and save instrument design for a follow-up session.\n- **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Keep the chart posted for reference during all phases and throughout subsequent lessons.\n- **Real Instrument Connection:** If possible, borrow a trumpet, trombone, or drum from the music teacher and demonstrate live vibrations to students. This directly connects to the photograph.\n- **Assessment Balance:** Use observations and exit tickets equally; don't over-rely on writing since second graders have variable writing skills.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson honors the concrete, hands-on learning style of second graders while building foundational understanding of vibrations, materials, and sound energy—all grounded in the real-world context of the student brass band photograph.",
