ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by analyzing the photograph of the student jumping over the cone obstacle.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on projector or printed copies (one per pair of students)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: slow-motion video of a jump (30 seconds) if available\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and introduce the photograph.** Show the image on a projector or distribute printed copies to pairs of students. Ask students to observe silently for 15 seconds, then turn to a partner and describe what they see.\n\n2. **Facilitate group discussion** using these specific questions:\n   - *What do you think the student is trying to do in this picture?* (Listen for: jump over the cone, clear the obstacle, jump high)\n   - *What made the student able to jump that high? What gave the student the energy to do it?* (Listen for: muscles, running, food, their body)\n   - *Do you think the student would have jumped as high if they had walked slowly toward the cone instead of running? Why or why not?* (This activates thinking about speed and energy.)\n   - *What would happen if we made the cone taller? How would that change what the student needs to do?* (Bridges to prediction and testing.)\n\n3. **Prediction and Wonder Prompt:** Ask students to write or sketch a prediction: *\"If the student ran even faster toward the cone, what do you think would happen to their jump? Would they jump higher or lower? Why?\"* Display predictions on chart paper without judgment. This creates curiosity about the relationship between speed and energy.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become scientists and test if running faster really does help us jump higher. Let's explore this in our own way!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (25-30 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the relationship between running speed and jumping ability through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 orange traffic cone per group (or substitute: stacked blocks, tape mark on wall, low hurdle, or rolled-up towel)\n- Measuring tape or meter stick\n- Stopwatch or smartphone timer (teacher-led timing)\n- Masking tape and marker for marking distances\n- Observation/data recording sheet (see below)\n- Open gymnasium or large outdoor space (or hallway)\n- Optional: colored tape to mark \"slow zone,\" \"medium zone,\" and \"fast zone\" at different distances from the cone\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide students into groups of 3-4.** Assign roles: **Jumper, Observer, Recorder, Distance Marker.**\n\n2. **Set up the course:** Each group marks a starting line 15 feet from their cone using tape. Mark three additional zones at 10 feet, 12 feet, and 15 feet (for \"slow,\" \"medium,\" and \"fast\" approach speeds).\n\n3. **Explain the investigation:** \"Each person in your group will jump over the cone THREE times using different running speeds:\n   - **Trial 1 (Slow):** Start at the 10-foot mark and jog slowly toward the cone.\n   - **Trial 2 (Medium):** Start at the 12-foot mark and run at a medium pace toward the cone.\n   - **Trial 3 (Fast):** Start at the 15-foot mark and run as fast as you safely can toward the cone.\n   \n   For each trial, observe: *Did the jumper clear the cone? How far did they travel after jumping over it?*\"\n\n4. **Student recording:** Provide a simple data table:\n\n   | Trial | Starting Distance | Speed Level | Cleared Cone? (Yes/No) | How Far Beyond Cone? |\n   |-------|-------------------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n   | 1     | 10 feet          | Slow       |                        |                      |\n   | 2     | 12 feet          | Medium     |                        |                      |\n   | 3     | 15 feet          | Fast       |                        |                      |\n\n5. **Safety guidelines:** Model a safe jump first. Emphasize landing with bent knees and looking where they're landing. Remind students: \"We're scientists, not stunt performers—safety first!\"\n\n6. **Data collection:** As each student jumps, the **Observer** watches carefully and the **Recorder** marks whether the cone was cleared and estimates the landing distance (paces work well for this age).\n\n7. **All group members take a turn** as the jumper while others observe and record.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask clarifying questions: *\"Why do you think the fast run helped you jump higher?\"* or *\"What do you notice about your landings at different speeds?\"*\n- Ensure safety; do not provide answers, but prompt observation: *\"Look at your data table—what pattern do you see?\"*\n- Help groups stay focused on data collection without judgment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will discover that faster approach speeds correlate with higher/longer jumps or more successful clears.\n- Data tables will show patterns (though some variation is normal due to individual differences).\n- Students will begin articulating ideas like \"I had more energy when I ran faster\" or \"Running fast made me go higher.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18-22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts using student observations and the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Energy and Speed vocabulary anchor chart (teacher-created, see below)\n- Optional: simple ball and ramp demonstration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore:** Ask 2-3 groups to share their data and observations:\n   - *\"What did you notice about your jumps at different speeds?\"*\n   - *\"Was there a difference between slow, medium, and fast? Describe it.\"*\n   - Record patterns on chart paper (e.g., \"Fast runs = higher jumps,\" \"More speed = farther landing\").\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions using a chart anchor:\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Connection to Jump Activity** |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Speed** | How fast something is moving (how quickly it changes position) | The faster you run toward the cone, the greater your speed. |\n   | **Energy** | The ability to do work or cause change (the \"power\" to make things move or change) | Your muscles use energy from food to run and jump. |\n   | **Kinetic Energy** | The energy of motion—energy something has because it is moving | When you run fast, you have MORE kinetic energy than when you walk. |\n   | **Force** | A push or a pull that causes something to move or change direction | Your legs push against the ground to make you run and jump. |\n   | **Gravity** | A force that pulls objects toward Earth | Gravity pulls you down; you must push hard to jump up against gravity. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph and Explore activity:**\n   - Display the jumping photo again. Point to the student mid-jump. Say: *\"This student ran fast toward the cone. That means their body had a lot of kinetic energy. The faster you move, the more kinetic energy you have. That's why running speed helps you jump higher!\"*\n   - Revisit the prediction chart: *\"Let's check your predictions. Did the students who ran faster jump higher? Yes! That proves that **speed and energy are connected.**\"*\n\n4. **Check for understanding** using a think-pair-share:\n   - **Think:** \"If I rolled a ball slowly down a ramp, would it have a lot of kinetic energy or a little? Why?\"\n   - **Pair:** Turn to a partner and discuss.\n   - **Share:** Ask 2-3 pairs to share aloud. Clarify: *\"A slow-moving ball has less kinetic energy. A fast-moving ball has MORE kinetic energy.\"*\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Speed:** How fast something is moving.\n- **Energy:** The ability to do work or cause change (make things move).\n- **Kinetic Energy:** Energy that something has because it is moving.\n- **Force:** A push or a pull that makes something move or change direction.\n- **Gravity:** The force that pulls things toward Earth.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define speed, energy, and kinetic energy in their own words.\n- Students can explain that faster-moving objects have more kinetic energy.\n- Students can connect their jump data to the concept of kinetic energy.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18-22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of speed and energy to design and conduct a new investigation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Same as Explore phase (cones, measuring tape, masking tape)\n- **Alternative obstacles:** Adjustable hurdles, stacked books, or cones at different heights\n- Data recording sheet (new)\n- Rulers or meter sticks to measure cone/obstacle heights\n- Optional: stopwatch for measuring approach time\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-world connection:** Begin with a scenario: *\"In track and field, athletes need to decide: Should I run faster to clear a higher hurdle, or should I practice a better jump technique? Let's test this with our own obstacle course.\"*\n\n2. **Challenge task:** *\"Now that we know that speed and energy are connected, we're going to test: What happens when we change the HEIGHT of the obstacle? Does a taller cone require more energy (speed) to clear?\"*\n\n3. **New investigation design:**\n   - Keep the running distance constant (e.g., always start 15 feet away).\n   - Vary the obstacle height:\n     - **Trial 1:** Cone at normal height (about 12 inches).\n     - **Trial 2:** Cone at increased height (stack blocks or adjust hurdle to ~18 inches).\n     - **Trial 3:** Cone at greater height (~24 inches, if safe and age-appropriate).\n   \n4. **Prediction and data collection:** Before each trial, ask: *\"Do you think you'll need to run faster to clear this taller cone? Why?\" Students record predictions, then test and record results in a new table:\n\n   | Obstacle Height | Predicted: Need More Speed? (Yes/No) | Actual: Cleared? (Yes/No) | What I Observed |\n   |---|---|---|---|\n   | 12 inches (normal) |  |  |  |\n   | 18 inches (taller) |  |  |  |\n   | 24 inches (tallest) |  |  |  |\n\n5. **Student reflection:** After completing the trials, have students answer:\n   - *\"What did you learn about the relationship between obstacle height, speed, and energy?\"*\n   - *\"If an obstacle got taller, did you need more energy (faster speed) to clear it? Why?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the investigation without directing outcomes.\n- Ask probing questions: *\"What changed between trials? What stayed the same? What caused the difference in your ability to clear the obstacle?\"*\n- Help students see that greater obstacles require more energy (greater speed or more powerful jumping technique).\n- Ensure safety; spot students if needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that taller obstacles require more kinetic energy (faster approaches or greater effort) to clear.\n- Students apply their understanding of speed, energy, and force to a new scenario.\n- Students can articulate cause-and-effect: \"Taller obstacle → more energy needed → faster running → more kinetic energy.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of the relationship between speed, energy, and motion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative assessment throughout the lesson:**\n   - **During Engage:** Monitor predictions and listen to student reasoning about speed and height.\n   - **During Explore:** Review data tables for accuracy and observe student explanations of results.\n   - **During Explain:** Use think-pair-share responses to check vocabulary understanding.\n   - **During Elaborate:** Observe student predictions about taller obstacles and listen to their reflections on energy needs.\n\n2. **Exit Ticket Assessment** (administer at end of lesson, written or verbal):\n   \n   Students respond to the following three questions (choose format based on grade level—drawings, sentences, or short answers):\n   \n   - **Question 1 (Speed and Energy):** \"If you run FAST toward an obstacle, do you have more kinetic energy or less kinetic energy than if you walked slowly? Draw or explain.\"\n   \n   - **Question 2 (Prediction and Reasoning):** \"A student tries to jump over a very tall cone. They run slowly. Do you think they will clear the cone? Why or why not? Use what you know about speed and energy.\"\n   \n   - **Question 3 (Real-world application):** \"A basketball player takes a jump shot. Why do they run fast toward the basket instead of walking slowly? Explain using the word 'energy.'\"\n\n3. **Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n   - ✓ Student correctly identifies that faster speed = more kinetic energy.\n   - ✓ Student can explain or predict how speed affects the ability to jump higher or clear an obstacle.\n   - ✓ Student uses vocabulary (speed, energy, kinetic energy, force) appropriately in responses.\n   - ✓ Student applies understanding to a new scenario (e.g., why athletes run fast in sports).\n\n4. **Data analysis from Explore and Elaborate phases:**\n   - Review student data tables for patterns: Do most students show a correlation between faster approach speed and successful clears?\n   - Analyze student observations: Do they attribute outcomes to energy and speed?\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit ticket responses demonstrate understanding of the speed-energy relationship.\n- Data tables show clear patterns (most students clear obstacles when approaching faster).\n- Student explanations connect speed, kinetic energy, and motion outcomes.\n- Students successfully predict outcomes for new scenarios based on their learning.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Provide a simplified data table** with pictures and yes/no checkboxes instead of written responses. Example:\n   - ☐ Cleared cone at slow speed?\n   - ☐ Cleared cone at medium speed?\n   - ☐ Cleared cone at fast speed?\n\n2. **Pre-teach vocabulary** using real objects and demonstrations. Before Explain phase, show a rolling ball at different speeds and ask: *\"Is this ball moving fast or slow? Does it have a lot of energy or a little energy?\"* Use concrete language and repeat key terms.\n\n3. **Assign a peer buddy** for the Explore phase. Pair a struggling student with a strong reader/observer who can help with data recording and provide verbal explanations. The struggling student remains the jumper or observer, ensuring active participation.\n\n4. **Use a shorter running distance** and lower obstacle height for students who need extra confidence. Celebrate successful clears to build momentum.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Introduce the concept of \"potential energy.\"** After the lesson, challenge advanced students: *\"When you jump high into the air, you have both kinetic energy (moving up) AND potential energy (height above ground). Which type of energy helps you clear the tallest cone? Why both?\"* Have them design an experiment to test different jump techniques (straight jump, running jump, standing jump).\n\n2. **Measure and calculate speed.** Provide advanced students with a stopwatch and measuring tape. Ask: *\"Can you measure how fast you ran toward the cone? Use the distance you ran and the time it took. Fast = distance ÷ time.\"* Create a chart comparing speed (in feet per second) to obstacle-clearing success.\n\n3. **Design a real-world application challenge.** Present a scenario: *\"A skateboarder needs to jump over a gap in a skate park. The gap is 5 feet wide. What advice would you give them about speed and energy to clear it safely? Draw a diagram and explain.\"* Students apply their understanding to an authentic scenario.\n\n4. **Extend to Newton's Laws:** Advanced students can explore: *\"To jump high, you push down on the ground. The ground pushes back up on you. This is Newton's Third Law: for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. How does this explain your jump?\"*\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Olympic Athletes Investigation:** Show short video clips of high jumpers, long jumpers, or pole vaulters in action. Have students analyze: *\"How do these athletes use speed and energy to achieve their goals? What makes their approach different from your jump? Why do they take so many steps before jumping?\"* Have students write or draw comparisons between their jump experiment and Olympic athletes' techniques.\n\n2. **Energy in Other Sports:** Create a \"Speed and Energy in Sports\" chart where students brainstorm different sports and answer: *\"Does this sport require fast speed to succeed? Why? What role does energy play?\"* Include basketball (fast dribbling), baseball (fast pitching), swimming (fast strokes), soccer (fast running), and tennis (fast ball). Extend by having students pick one sport and explain how athletes use kinetic energy to perform.\n\n3. **Design a Ramp Experiment:** Provide students with ramps, balls, and obstacles (similar cones, cups, or blocks). Challenge: *\"Build a ramp that launches a ball fast enough to knock over an obstacle at the bottom. Test different ramp heights. How does increasing the ramp height change the ball's speed and energy?\"* Students record data and compare to their jumping results: *\"How is this similar to running faster before a jump?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Summary of NGSS Alignment\n\nThis lesson directly addresses **4-PS3-1** (relating speed to energy) and **4-PS3-3** (predicting outcomes when energy changes during interactions) by having students:\n- Gather evidence that faster-moving students have more kinetic energy and can clear obstacles more effectively.\n- Make predictions about how changes in speed affect jumping ability.\n- Use their observations to construct explanations of the speed-energy relationship in the context of athletic motion.\n\nThe hands-on, data-driven approach ensures students move from curiosity through structured investigation to deep conceptual understanding of fundamental physics principles.",
