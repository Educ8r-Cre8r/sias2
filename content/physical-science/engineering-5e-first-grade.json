Build a simple motorized structure using building blocks and a motor.\n2. Observe and describe how vibrations from a moving motor create sounds and make materials shake.\n3. Plan and test changes to their machine to make it vibrate or sound different.\n4. Use a motorized device to communicate a message (e.g., buzz code, rhythm pattern).\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how machines make sounds and vibrate.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Photograph displayed on screen or printed large\n  - One working motorized LEGO structure (if available) with motor running, OR a video of the machine in motion\n  - A simple motor or vibrating toy (battery-operated) to demonstrate\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. Display the photograph and ask students to sit in a circle where they can see it clearly.\n  2. Ask: \"What do you see in this picture? What are all these different pieces?\"\n  3. If possible, show a working motorized toy or LEGO machine running (with sound). Let students feel it vibrating.\n  4. Ask specific questions:\n     - \"Does it feel bumpy or shaky? What do you feel?\"\n     - \"Do you hear any sounds? Where is the sound coming from?\"\n     - \"What do you think makes it move and shake like that?\"\n     - \"Could we build something like this? What would we use?\"\n  5. Have students make a prediction: \"If we built a machine with a motor, what would it do? What sounds might it make?\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become engineers and build our own sound machines. We'll discover how motors make things vibrate and create cool sounds!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate how motors cause vibration and sound through hands-on building and testing.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - LEGO bricks or building blocks (per small group of 2-3 students): at least 20-30 pieces\n  - Battery-powered motors (simple hobby motors or LEGO motors with batteries), 1 per group\n  - Black connectors or axles to attach motors\n  - Foam pieces, craft foam, or foam packing peanuts (optional, for adding to structures)\n  - Chart paper or large paper for each group\n  - Crayons or markers\n  - Safety goggles (optional, but recommended)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Setup:** Divide the class into small groups (2-3 students per group). Give each group a motor, battery pack, and basic LEGO/building blocks.\n  2. **Step 1 - Build a Base (5 minutes):**\n     - \"Build a simple flat base using your blocks—make it sturdy so it won't tip over.\"\n     - Show a simple example: a rectangular base with the motor attached to one side.\n  3. **Step 2 - Attach the Motor (3 minutes):**\n     - Teacher helps each group securely attach the motor to their base using connectors/axles.\n     - Demonstrate clearly once for the whole class first.\n  4. **Step 3 - Test and Observe (7 minutes):**\n     - \"Turn on your motor. What happens? Does it shake? Do you feel it vibrate?\"\n     - \"What do you hear? Is it making sound? What kind of sound?\"\n     - Circulate and encourage students to describe what they observe.\n  5. **Step 4 - Add Something to Make More Vibration (5 minutes):**\n     - \"Now add foam pieces, blocks, or other materials to the top of your motor. What happens now?\"\n     - \"Does it shake more? Does the sound change? Does it feel different?\"\n  6. **Documentation:**\n     - Have each group draw or write (with teacher help) what they observed: \"Our motor made ____ sound. It felt _____. When we added ____, it ______.\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Facilitate motor setup and safety.\n  - Ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice? How is it moving? Where does the shaking come from?\"\n  - Encourage students to feel the vibrations and describe what they hear and feel.\n  - Do NOT tell them the answer—let them discover through observation.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students discover that motors spin and create vibrations.\n  - Students observe that vibrations can create sound.\n  - Students notice that adding materials to the vibrating motor changes the intensity or quality of vibration and sound.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to science concepts.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper with key vocabulary written out\n  - One working motorized structure\n  - Picture cards or real objects (spring, tuning fork, drum) showing vibrating things\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n     - Call on each group to share their observations: \"What did your motor do? What did you hear? What happened when you added something?\"\n     - Record key words they use on a chart (shake, vibrate, sound, noise, buzz, etc.).\n  2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n     - Use the working motorized device to demonstrate while introducing terms.\n     - **Vibration:** \"When something shakes back and forth really, really fast, we call that a vibration. Look at this motor—it's vibrating!\"\n     - **Motor:** \"A motor is a machine that spins around. Our motor spins really fast and makes the whole structure shake.\"\n     - **Sound:** \"When things vibrate, they push air and make sound waves. That's how we hear sounds!\"\n     - **Energy:** \"The motor uses energy from the battery to make things move and vibrate.\"\n  3. **Connection Back to Photograph and Explore (3 minutes):**\n     - \"Look at the picture again. Those machines have motors just like yours. The motors make them vibrate, and that's why they might make sounds. The person who designed this also added wheels and bird heads—cool ideas!\"\n  4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n     - Ask: \"Can someone show me with their body how a vibration looks?\" (Students wiggle or shake.)\n     - Ask: \"If I turn on this motor, what will happen?\" (Students predict together.)\n     - Turn it on briefly. \"You were right! The vibration makes sound!\"\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Vibration:** Fast shaking back and forth (show with hands or body).\n  - **Motor:** A machine that spins very fast using electricity.\n  - **Sound:** Something we hear that happens when things vibrate.\n  - **Energy:** The power that makes things move and work.\n  - **Vibrating Materials:** Things that shake and create vibrations.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students can name and describe vibration, motor, and sound.\n  - Students understand that motors create vibrations that make sound.\n  - Students can explain where the sound came from in their experiment.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding by building a machine to \"communicate\" using vibrations and sound patterns.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Same motorized bases from Explore phase\n  - Additional LEGO pieces (10-15 per group)\n  - Foam packing peanuts, craft foam, or foam cups\n  - Optional: bells, small wooden dowels, or craft sticks\n  - Chart paper showing simple \"buzz codes\" (e.g., one buzz = yes, two buzzes = no)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Introduction (2 minutes):**\n     - \"Engineers use motors and vibrations to send messages! For example, a phone buzzes to tell you someone is calling. A doorbell buzzes. Let's make our own message machine!\"\n  2. **Design Challenge (12 minutes):**\n     - \"Your job: Add something to your motor machine so it can send a simple message using buzzes or sounds.\"\n     - Possible examples:\n       - Add foam shapes that will buzz loudly when the motor runs.\n       - Stack blocks on top so they rattle.\n       - Attach a small bell or piece of foam that vibrates.\n     - Teacher models one simple addition first (e.g., stacking foam blocks on the vibrating motor).\n     - Circulate and guide: \"What happens when you add that? Does it make a different sound? Is that better for sending a message?\"\n  3. **Testing Communication (6 minutes):**\n     - Once groups have added their modifications, have them demonstrate their \"machine message.\"\n     - Simple code activity: \"One buzz means 'Hello!' Two buzzes mean 'Yes!' Can your partner guess what you're saying?\"\n     - Groups take turns sending a \"message\" with their machine, and another group tries to count or identify the pattern.\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Guide students to think about what makes a good \"signal\" (clear, loud, repeatable).\n  - Ask: \"Does your message sound different from before? Can your partner understand it?\"\n  - Facilitate peer sharing and celebration of designs.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students modify their machine by adding materials that change the sound/vibration.\n  - Students test and refine their design based on whether it communicates clearly.\n  - Students experience vibrations as a way to send messages using patterns and sounds.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of vibration, sound, and simple machine design.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n  - Observe students during Explore: Can they describe vibrations and sounds they observe?\n  - Listen to group discussions: Do they use vocabulary like \"vibration,\" \"motor,\" \"sound\"?\n  - Watch during Elaborate: Do they test and adjust their design based on results?\n\n  **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes at end of Day 2):**\n  \n  Present each student with a short exit task. Choose one format based on your class:\n  \n  **Option A (Drawing + Oral Response):**\n  - Show students a picture of a simple motor running.\n  - Ask: \"Draw what happens when the motor turns on. What does it do?\"\n  - Follow up orally: \"Why does it make sound? What's vibrating?\"\n  \n  **Option B (Written/Dictated Response):**\n  - Provide sentence frames:\n    - \"When the motor turns on, it ___________.\"\n    - \"The vibration makes a sound because ___________.\"\n    - \"We used _____________ to change the sound.\"\n  \n  **Option C (Performance Assessment):**\n  - Have each student activate a motorized structure and describe one thing it does (e.g., \"It vibrates,\" \"It makes noise,\" \"It shakes the blocks\").\n  - Ask one follow-up question: \"How did the motor make that happen?\"\n\n  **Success Criteria:**\n  - ✓ Students can observe and describe vibration in a motorized device.\n  - ✓ Students can explain that vibration makes sound.\n  - ✓ Students can name at least one material they used in their design.\n  - ✓ Students understand that they can test and change their machine.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Most students (80%+) can describe a vibration and relate it to sound.\n  - Most students can name the motor as the part that makes things vibrate.\n  - Students show evidence of testing and adjusting their design (Elaborate phase).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n1. **Simplified Building Task:** Provide pre-assembled motor bases. Students only add foam or materials to the top, focusing on observation rather than construction.\n2. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:** Use picture cards and real objects (spring, tuning fork) alongside vocabulary. Repeat key terms frequently and allow gesture/body responses instead of verbal ones.\n3. **Guided Questioning:** Use yes/no or either/or questions (\"Does it shake or stay still?\" \"Do you hear a sound or is it quiet?\") to support response formation.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n1. **Multi-Motor Design:** Challenge students to combine two motors or create a more complex structure with multiple vibrating sections. Have them predict how it will sound different and test their prediction.\n2. **Pattern Communication:** Introduce a more complex \"message code\" (three different patterns = different letters or words). Have students design a machine that can clearly send these distinct signals.\n3. **Material Investigation:** Ask: \"Which material (foam, plastic, wood, metal) makes the loudest sound when vibrated? Test different materials and graph your results.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Sound Scavenger Hunt:** Send students around the classroom or school to find things that vibrate and make sound (electric pencil sharpener, fan, bell, buzzer, alarm clock). Have them list or draw what vibrates and what sound it makes. Connect back to motors and vibration.\n\n2. **Vibration Art:** Place paper or thin foam on top of a vibrating motor with markers nearby. As the motor vibrates, it creates random patterns. Students can make predictions about what the pattern will look like before turning on the motor, then compare to the actual result.\n\n3. **Communication Design Challenge (Extended):** Over multiple days, have students design and build an elaborate \"message machine\" that uses vibration/sound to send messages across the classroom. Introduce more complex \"codes\" and have students create instruction cards showing their code. Invite other classes to \"decode\" the messages.\n\n4. **Classroom Vibration Audit:** Ask students to listen carefully and identify all the sounds they hear in one day that come from vibrations (bell, buzzer, phone, keyboard clicks, fan). Create a class chart or poster showing \"Sounds from Vibrations Around Us.\"",
