ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about sound and energy using the photograph of the school marching band.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital display of the photograph (large enough for whole class to see)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Speaker or sound system to play a short brass band audio clip (15 seconds)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Hook:** Show the photograph on screen or printed large. Say: *\"Look carefully at this photograph. What do you notice these students are doing? Why do you think they're holding their instruments up to their mouths?\"*\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (posed one at a time, allowing 30-60 seconds for think-pair-share before whole-class discussion):**\n   - *\"What do you think happens inside these instruments when a musician blows into them?\"*\n   - *\"Where does the sound come from? Is it made inside the instrument or somewhere else?\"*\n   - *\"If you were standing in the audience, how would you know the sound got to you? What energy had to travel?\"*\n   - *\"Why do different instruments sound different if they're all made of metal?\"*\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** *\"I wonder: Can we make sound without using an instrument? What's the simplest way to create a sound? What do all sounds need to happen?\"* Record student wonderings on chart paper.\n\n4. **Optional Sound Hook:** Play a 15-second clip of brass instruments. Ask: *\"How do you think the musicians made that sound? Let's investigate!\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to discover the hidden secret behind every sound—we're going to find out what's really happening inside instruments and in the air around us.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how vibrations create sound through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 rubber band (various sizes if possible—thick and thin)\n- 1 empty shoe box or tissue box\n- 1 ruler or wooden craft stick\n- 1 small bowl of water\n- 1 spoon\n- 1 balloon (inflated, tied closed)\n- 1 sheet of paper\n- Sand or salt (approximately 2 tablespoons per group)\n- 1 tuning fork or metal ruler (if available; optional but recommended)\n- Paper towels\n- Student investigation sheet (template provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Rubber Band Vibration Discovery (8-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Student Directions:**\n   - *\"Stretch a rubber band tightly across the opening of your box. Make sure it's tight and doesn't move.\"*\n   - *\"Pluck the rubber band gently, like a guitar string. Listen to the sound it makes.\"*\n   - *\"Now—here's the trick—while the rubber band is still vibrating, quickly place your finger on top of it very gently. What do you feel? Write what you observe on your sheet.\"*\n   - *\"Pluck it again, but this time pluck it HARD. Do you feel more vibration? Does the sound change? Record your observations.\"*\n   - *\"Try plucking a thick rubber band, then a thin one. Which vibrates differently? How does the sound change?\"*\n\n2. **What Students Should Record:**\n   - Drawing of vibrations they felt\n   - Descriptive words for sounds (loud, soft, high, low, fast vibrations, slow vibrations)\n   - Comparison between thick and thin rubber bands\n   - *Answer this question: \"Where is the energy coming from when I pluck the rubber band?\"*\n\n**Part B: Visualizing Vibrations (8-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Student Directions:**\n   - *\"Sprinkle a small pinch of salt onto your inflated balloon.\"*\n   - *\"Hold the balloon loosely in your hands. Now, make a low humming sound near the balloon's surface. Watch the salt carefully.\"*\n   - *\"What happens to the salt? Why do you think it's moving?\"*\n   - *\"Try changing your humming pitch (go higher, then lower). Does the salt move differently?\"*\n   - *\"Now hold the balloon against your throat while you hum. Can you feel the vibrations? Can you see the salt moving?\"*\n\n2. **What Students Should Record:**\n   - Description of salt movement\n   - Drawing or description of pattern changes when pitch changes\n   - *Answer this: \"Is the sound making the salt move, or is something else causing it?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group; ask guiding questions without answering: *\"What are you feeling? Describe the motion you see. Is the rubber band still or moving? What happens to the sound when the vibrations stop?\"*\n- Do NOT explain vibrations yet—let students observe and wonder.\n- Manage materials and encourage safe handling.\n- If a group finishes early, challenge them: *\"Can you make a higher sound and a lower sound with the same rubber band? What did you do differently?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that vibrating objects create sound.\n- Students feel vibrations with their fingers (tactile discovery).\n- Students see that movement/motion is connected to sound production.\n- Students notice that changing the force or material changes the sound.\n- Students make informal connections: *\"When it moves fast, the sound changes\"* or *\"The harder I pluck, the more it shakes.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts; connect back to the photograph and student discoveries.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of marching band (displayed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Vocabulary cards (handmade or printed)\n- Student vocabulary recording sheet or notebook\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 groups to share one key observation: *\"What did you discover about what creates sound?\"*\n   - Record their observations on chart paper using their exact words first, then label with scientific terms.\n   - Example: Student says *\"The rubber band was moving really fast,\"* → Label: *\"Vibration\"*\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Explanation (8-10 minutes):**\n\n   *\"You all discovered something really important today. Every single sound—the music in that photograph, my voice right now, the school bell—comes from the same thing: **vibrations.** Let me explain what you discovered.\"*\n\n   - **Use the photograph:** Point to the musicians. *\"When these musicians blow air into their instruments, what are they doing? [Students respond.] They're making the air inside move back and forth VERY quickly. That back-and-forth motion—that's a vibration. And vibrations create sound.\"*\n\n   - **Connect to exploration:** *\"Just like you felt the rubber band moving when you plucked it, the air inside a trumpet is vibrating. You can't see the vibrations easily because air is invisible, but the sound is proof that vibration is happening.\"*\n\n   - **Introduce key concept:** *\"Here's the important idea: Sound needs THREE things:*\n     1. *A vibration (something moving back and forth)*\n     2. *Energy (force that makes it start vibrating—like when you plucked the rubber band)*\n     3. *A material to vibrate (could be rubber, metal, air, water, or your vocal cords)*\n     \n     *Without all three, there is no sound.\"*\n\n3. **Vocabulary Introduction (3-5 minutes):**\n\n   Present each term with a student-friendly definition and a gesture or visual:\n\n   - **Vibration:** Quick back-and-forth movement. *[Make a wiggling motion with your hands.]* *\"Vibrations are so fast we can barely see them, but we can feel them and hear the sound they make.\"*\n\n   - **Energy:** The power to make something move or change. *\"You used energy from your muscles when you plucked the rubber band. That energy made it vibrate.\"*\n\n   - **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or change direction. *\"Your finger pushing the rubber band down is a force. It creates energy that makes vibrations.\"*\n\n   - **Sound wave:** A vibration that travels through a material (like air, water, or metal) and reaches our ears. *\"Sound travels invisibly through the air to reach you.\"*\n\n   - **Pitch:** Whether a sound is high or low. *\"A small rubber band vibrates faster and makes a higher pitch. A thicker rubber band vibrates slower and makes a lower pitch.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2-3 minutes):**\n\n   Ask quick questions:\n   - *\"Show me with your hand what a vibration looks like.\"* [Students wiggle fingers.]\n   - *\"If there are NO vibrations, is there sound?\"* [Students say: \"No.\"]\n   - *\"Where did the sound come from when you plucked the rubber band?\"* [Students point to the rubber band or say \"the vibrations.\"]\n   - *\"Why do the trumpets in the photograph sound different from the trombones?\"* [Guide them: \"Maybe the metal vibrates differently? Maybe the size is different?\"]\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Card (on chart paper for reference):**\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|-----|\n| **Vibration** | Fast back-and-forth movement that creates sound |\n| **Energy** | The power to make something move |\n| **Force** | A push or pull that starts movement |\n| **Sound Wave** | A vibration that travels through air, water, or materials to reach our ears |\n| **Pitch** | How high or low a sound is |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word \"vibration\" to explain how sound is made.\n- Students understand that sound requires energy and motion.\n- Students can point to the photograph and explain: *\"The air inside the trumpet is vibrating, and that's making the sound.\"*\n- Students connect their tactile experience (feeling vibrations) to the invisible concept (sound traveling through air).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to a new context and deepen understanding of how different materials affect sound.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Assorted containers: plastic cup, metal can, glass jar, wooden block, foam cup\n- Rubber bands of different thicknesses\n- Tuning fork (if available) or metal ruler\n- Water bowl\n- Straws\n- Student investigation sheet: \"Material Exploration\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Investigation: How Do Different Materials Change Sound?**\n\n1. **Challenge Question:** *\"We know vibrations make sound. But here's a question: Do different materials vibrate the same way? Let's test!\"*\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n\n   **Part A: Material Sound Test**\n   - *\"We're going to test how different materials sound when they vibrate. You'll stretch a rubber band around each container (or use the same rubber band and test it on each). Pluck the rubber band each time. Listen to the sound. Record whether the sound is high or low, loud or soft.\"*\n\n   *Student table:*\n   | Material | High or Low? | Loud or Soft? | Why do you think this happened? |\n   |----------|---|---|---|\n   | Plastic cup | | | |\n   | Metal can | | | |\n   | Glass jar | | | |\n   | Foam cup | | | |\n\n   - *\"Now think: Did the vibrations change, or did the material around the vibrations change? What difference did the material make?\"*\n\n   **Part B: Pitch Challenge (if time allows)**\n   - *\"Can you make a rubber band produce three different pitches? How did you do it? [Students might: stretch it tighter/looser, pluck it harder/softer, use thicker/thinner rubber bands.] Draw or write what you did.\"*\n\n3. **Real-World Connection:**\n\n   Return to the photograph. *\"Look at all these different instruments—trombones, trumpets, saxophones. They're all made of metal, but they sound completely different. Why? [Guide students: different shapes, different sizes, different thicknesses.] The shape and size of the material affect how the air inside vibrates. That's why each instrument has its own unique sound!\"*\n\n4. **Application Question for Thinking:**\n   - *\"If you wanted to play a really HIGH note on a trumpet, would you make the air vibrations faster or slower?\"* [Faster] *\"How would a musician do that?\"* [Make the lips vibrate faster, change the shape of the instrument opening, etc.]\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: *\"What did you observe? Is the material affecting the sound? How?\"*\n- Push thinking: *\"What if we made this even tighter/looser? What would happen?\"*\n- Connect observations back to the photograph and explanation phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that material properties (hardness, thickness, shape) affect sound quality and pitch.\n- Students apply the concept: *\"The shape of the trumpet controls the vibrations, so that's why it sounds like that.\"*\n- Students develop deeper understanding that vibrations are the foundation, but the material matters too.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of sound, vibration, energy, and force.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** During Explore and Elaborate phases, observe and note:\n  - Does the student identify vibration as the source of sound?\n  - Can the student explain the connection between force and vibration?\n  - Does the student use vocabulary (vibration, energy, force, sound wave) appropriately?\n  - Can the student predict how changing materials or force will change sound?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) – Administer at end of Session 2:**\n\n*Provide each student with an exit ticket (can be on paper or digital). Read questions aloud; students may draw, write, or both.*\n\n**Question 1 (Understanding of vibrations):**\n*\"Look at this picture of a musician playing a trumpet. Draw or write: What is happening inside the trumpet to make sound? What's moving?\"*\n\n**Question 2 (Energy and force connection):**\n*\"If you pluck a rubber band VERY HARD versus very gently, what happens to the sound? Why?\"*\n\n**Question 3 (Application/Synthesis):**\n*\"A student wants to make a sound that is HIGH and LOUD. What would they need to do with their rubber band or instrument? Explain your thinking.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Advanced |\n|----------|---|---|---|\n| **Vibration Concept** | Student mentions movement but not vibration | Student clearly states vibrations create sound | Student explains vibrations AND connects to material properties |\n| **Energy/Force** | Student identifies that something needs to happen | Student explains force creates vibrations | Student predicts how changing force changes vibration quality |\n| **Application** | Student attempts answer but reasoning is unclear | Student applies concept with clear reasoning | Student predicts multiple variables and explains cause-and-effect |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- **Proficient students** can explain: *\"Sound comes from vibrations. When I pluck the rubber band, I use force. That force makes the rubber band vibrate fast. The vibrations travel through the air, and that's the sound I hear.\"*\n\n- **Advanced students** can add: *\"Thicker rubber bands vibrate slower and make lower sounds. Thinner ones vibrate faster and make higher sounds. If I pluck harder, the vibrations are stronger and the sound is louder.\"*\n\n- **All students** can identify vibration as essential to sound production and demonstrate understanding through drawings, descriptions, or models.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Reduced Vocabulary Load:** Provide a word bank with pictures on the exit ticket. Students can point to or circle vocabulary words rather than generating them independently. Example: pictures of vibration, energy, force with labels.\n\n2. **Guided Exploration:** Pair a struggling learner with a proficient peer during Explore phase. Assign the peer the role of \"observer\" (records what they see) while the struggling learner handles materials. Rotate roles.\n\n3. **Simpler Exit Ticket:** Use primarily drawing/labeling format instead of written explanation. Provide sentence starters: *\"Sound is made by ____. The rubber band made a sound because ____. When I plucked harder, ____.\"*\n\n4. **Tactile/Multi-Sensory Emphasis:** Emphasize feeling vibrations throughout. Have student place hand on speaker playing music, throat while humming, or tuning fork vibrating to cement the tactile connection before abstract explanations.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Complex Prediction:** *\"If you had a rubber band stretched across a very large box and a very small box, which would make a higher sound? Why? Test your prediction and explain the result.\"* (Guides them to understand resonance and volume/pitch changes based on air space.)\n\n2. **Material Investigation Extension:** Provide additional materials (string, metal wire, plastic cord) and challenge: *\"Which material vibrates best? How do you know? Create a ranking from most vibrations to fewest.\"*\n\n3. **Connection to Real Instruments:** *\"Research one instrument from the photograph. Find out what material it's made from and WHY. How does the material choice affect the sound?\"* (Builds research skills and deepens science understanding.)\n\n4. **Pitch Manipulation Challenge:** *\"Can you make your rubber band produce the note C, then D, then E (or use relative descriptions like 'low, medium, high')? How did you adjust the vibrations each time?\"* (Bridges to music and deepens quantitative thinking.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Homemade Instrument Design Challenge:**\n   - *\"Design and build your own simple instrument using classroom materials (boxes, rubber bands, straws, plastic bottles, water). Your instrument must produce at least 2 different pitches. Test it, measure the vibrations if possible (using rice on top), and bring it in to share. Explain how your design creates vibrations and how you controlled the pitch.\"*\n   - Connects to: NGSS 5-PS3-1 (energy in motion), design thinking, real-world application\n\n2. **Sound Wave Visualization Project:**\n   - Provide access to a free app or website that shows sound waves visually (e.g., Audacity free software, or simple wave visualization tools). Students can:\n     - Record themselves humming at different pitches and see the wave patterns\n     - Compare the visual waves to their predictions\n     - Draw conclusions: *\"When I hummed high, the waves looked ____. When I hummed low, the waves looked ____.\"*\n   - Connects to: Data representation, pattern recognition, technology integration\n\n3. **Community Sound Scavenger Hunt:**\n   - *\"Go around your home or classroom with a list. Find 5 sounds. For each sound, write: What vibrated to make this sound? Was it fast vibrations (high sound) or slow vibrations (low sound)? How much force was used (gentle or forceful)? Create a poster or presentation showing your findings.\"*\n   - Example: Doorbell (metal vibrating fast = high pitch), footsteps (floor vibrating with force), water running (fast vibrations in liquid), etc.\n   - Connects to: Real-world application, observation skills, communication\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety Reminder:** Ensure students don't pull rubber bands so tightly that they snap. Review proper material handling before Explore phase.\n- **Pacing:** Adjust timing based on your group. Some classes may need more time for Explore; others may move quickly to Elaborate.\n- **Sound Sensitivity:** Some students may have auditory sensitivities. Offer alternatives like feeling vibrations on a speaker or table rather than listening directly to high-pitched sounds.\n- **Connection to Music:** If your school has a music teacher, consider co-teaching or sharing this lesson. Musicians can demonstrate on real instruments during the Explain phase (highly engaging!).\n- **Real Instrument Option:** If possible, borrow a trumpet, trombone, or saxophone from the music room. During Explain, demonstrate how a musician controls vibrations by changing embouchure (mouth position) or valve positions. Students can feel vibrations near the instrument (safely!).\n\n---\n\nThis lesson takes students from observable phenomena (the photograph of musicians) → hands-on discovery (feeling and seeing vibrations) → formal concepts (vibration, energy, force) → real-world application (why instruments sound different). The 5E flow ensures deep, scaffolded learning appropriate for Fifth Grade.",
