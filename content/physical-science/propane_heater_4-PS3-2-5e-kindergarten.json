ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about heat, light, and energy by examining the glowing heater photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the propane heater with red-orange glowing elements\n- Optional: A flashlight or small safe lamp to demonstrate glow (do NOT use actual heater)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording student ideas\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a large printed image. Dim the classroom lights slightly to mimic the photograph's dramatic lighting effect if possible.\n\n2. **Pose opening question:** \"What do you see in this picture? What is making it glow red and orange?\"\n\n3. **Ask curiosity-building questions:**\n   - \"Why do you think this thing is glowing? What's happening inside?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen something glow like this? When?\"\n   - \"Is the glow hot or cold? How do you think you know?\"\n   - \"What do you think would happen if you put your hand near this glow?\" (Discuss safety—we don't touch!)\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today we're going to discover how heat makes things glow. Before we start, can you show me with your hands: Is a glow hot or cold? Can you make a warm motion?\"\n\n5. **Record student predictions** on chart paper. Use drawings, words, or both.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Now let's do some safe experiments to figure out how heat makes light. We'll use the sun and other tools to explore.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how heat and light interact with different materials through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Sunny window or bright outdoor area\n- 5–6 thermometers (analog dial or large-number digital ones)\n- Small black paper squares (construction paper)\n- Small white paper squares\n- Small squares of aluminum foil\n- Small pieces of transparent plastic (clear food wrap or page protectors)\n- Small pieces of dark fabric or felt\n- Dark box or cardboard cube with one transparent side (optional: pre-made)\n- Paper towels for recording\n- Clipboards (1 per pair of students)\n- Camera or smartphone to document findings\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station-Based Exploration (Divide class into 2–3 groups; rotate stations)**\n\n**Station 1: Light and Heat Through Materials**\n- Students place different materials (white paper, black paper, foil, plastic, fabric) on a sunny windowsill or in direct sunlight.\n- They place a thermometer under or near each material.\n- After 5 minutes, they carefully touch each material (with teacher supervision) and describe: \"Is it hot or cold?\"\n- Encourage descriptions: \"This one is very warm!\" \"This one is still cool!\"\n- **Document:** Teacher helps students draw or mark which materials got the hottest.\n\n**Station 2: The Dark Box Heat Trap**\n- Place a dark box in sunlight with a clear plastic side facing the sun.\n- Place thermometers inside and outside the box.\n- Discuss: \"Why do you think it's hotter inside the box?\"\n- **Hypothesis-building:** Guide students: \"Does the clear material let heat in? Can heat get back out?\"\n\n**Station 3: Light Through Different Materials**\n- Shine a flashlight through transparent, translucent, and opaque materials.\n- Students observe which materials let light through, which block it, and which let some through.\n- **Record:** Draw pictures showing \"light comes through\" vs. \"light doesn't come through.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions without giving answers: \"What do you notice? Is that material warming up? Why might that be?\"\n- Help students feel safe materials carefully (temperature check yourself first).\n- Encourage specific vocabulary: \"That material is letting light through—can you see the light?\" \"The heat is building up inside the box.\"\n- Take photos of student predictions and findings.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that dark materials absorb more heat.\n- Students observe that transparent materials let light and heat pass through.\n- Students make the connection: glow = heat + light moving through space.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and connect discoveries to the heater photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple drawings\n- The original heater photograph displayed again\n- Picture cards showing: sun, lamp, fire, glow stick (various light/heat sources)\n- Kindergarten-friendly reference chart\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather students in a circle. Ask each station group to share one discovery:\n   - \"What did you learn about dark materials?\"\n   - \"What surprised you about the clear box?\"\n   - \"Which material let the most light through?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with Kindergarten-friendly definitions:**\n\n   - **Heat:** Energy that makes things warm. When you feel warm, heat is moving into you.\n   - **Light:** Energy that we can see. It travels through space and helps us see things. It comes from hot things like the sun and from glowing things.\n   - **Glow:** When something gets so hot that it makes light. The heater in the picture glows red-orange because it's very hot.\n   - **Energy:** The power to make things move, get warm, or light up.\n   - **Absorb:** To take in or soak up. Dark materials absorb (soak up) more heat from the sun.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Remember the picture of the red-orange glow? That's a heater getting very, very hot. The heat is so strong that it makes light—it glows! That's the same idea we explored with our materials and the sun.\"\n   - Point to the glowing parts: \"This is what happens when something gets very hot. It makes light.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Can you show me with your body: Are you glowing like the heater? How would you need to feel to glow?\" (Prompt: \"Very hot!\")\n   - \"Which material did we find keeps heat in the most?\" (Dark materials, box)\n   - \"If the sun is hot and makes light, how is that like the heater in the picture?\"\n\n**Vocabulary Chart (Display in classroom):**\n| Word | Picture | Simple Definition |\n|------|---------|-------------------|\n| **Heat** | Sun, flame | Makes things warm |\n| **Light** | Glow, sun rays | We can see it; travels through space |\n| **Glow** | Red heater, fire | Super hot things that make light |\n| **Energy** | Lightning bolt, sun | Power to make things warm, move, or light up |\n| **Absorb** | Dark fabric on sun | Takes in and holds heat |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary words to describe what they observed.\n- Students make connections: sun = heat + light; heater = heat + light.\n- Students explain why dark materials got hotter (they absorb energy).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply heat and light concepts to a design challenge inspired by the heater image.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheets of paper or cardboard\n- White, black, and colored construction paper\n- Aluminum foil, plastic wrap, dark fabric, straw, blocks\n- Tape, glue stick, scissors\n- Small thermometers\n- Sunny location or strong lamp\n- Design worksheet (teacher-created, simple line drawings for labeling)\n\n**Activity: Design a Shade Structure to Keep a Spot Cool**\n\n**Challenge (inspired by K-PS3-2):** \"The heater makes light and heat that glow bright. But sometimes we want to **block heat and light** to keep things cool. Can you build a shade or shelter to keep a thermometer from getting too hot in the sun?\"\n\n**Student Steps:**\n1. **Discuss:** \"What keeps heat and light out? What did we learn?\"\n   - Dark materials, thick materials, foil that bounces light\n2. **Plan:** Students sketch their idea on paper—what materials will they use to block heat?\n3. **Build:** Provide time for students to construct a simple shade structure over a thermometer placed in sunlight.\n   - Ideas: folding dark paper into a tent, wrapping foil around the thermometer, layering materials\n4. **Test:** After 10 minutes in the sun, check: Did your thermometer stay cooler than one in the open?\n5. **Compare:** Place two thermometers side by side—one in shade, one in sun.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide without building for them: \"Tell me your idea. What material will you try first?\"\n- Ask reflective questions: \"Is your structure blocking the light? How can you tell?\"\n- Celebrate all attempts: \"You used foil because it bounces light away—that's thinking like an engineer!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply understanding that dark and reflective materials reduce heat absorption.\n- Students recognize that blocking light helps reduce warmth.\n- Students demonstrate design thinking: try, observe, adjust.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of heat, light, and energy concepts.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Do students describe temperature changes? Do they make observations about light passing through materials?\n- **Listen during group share-out:** Do students use newly learned vocabulary? Can they connect discoveries to the heater photo?\n- **Watch during Elaborate:** Do students apply concepts to the design challenge? Do they adjust their structure based on results?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (choose one or combine):**\n\n**Option A: Picture Sort & Label**\n- Show four pictures: (1) sun, (2) glow stick, (3) lamp, (4) ice cube\n- Ask: \"Which of these make heat and light like the heater in our picture?\"\n- Students point to or circle the correct ones\n- **Success criteria:** Students correctly identify 3 of 4 heat/light sources\n\n**Option B: Observation Drawing**\n- Provide a simple drawing of the sun shining on two objects: one wrapped in dark paper, one wrapped in white paper\n- Ask: \"Draw which one will get hotter. Why?\"\n- **Success criteria:** Student shows dark material and can explain (even with simple words or drawings) that dark holds more heat\n\n**Option C: Verbal Assessment (for small groups or individuals)**\n- Ask: \"The heater in our picture glows red-orange. Why does it glow?\"\n- Expected responses: \"Because it's hot,\" \"Heat makes light,\" \"When something is very hot, it makes light\"\n- **Success criteria:** Student makes connection between heat and light/glow\n\n**Option D: Hands-On Demonstration**\n- Place a thermometer in sunlight and one in shade\n- Ask: \"Which one will show a higher number? Why?\"\n- **Success criteria:** Student correctly predicts and explains that sunlight brings heat energy\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes (Overall):**\n- **90% of students** can identify heat and light as forms of energy\n- **85% of students** can explain that dark materials absorb more heat\n- **80% of students** can make a connection between the heater photograph and concepts learned (sun, heat, light, glow)\n- **Majority of students** use vocabulary words (heat, light, glow, energy) in context\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary focus:** Use only 2–3 key terms (heat, light, glow) instead of all five. Repeat them consistently and attach them to a visual anchor chart with pictures.\n\n2. **Hands-on thermometer use:** Pair struggling students with a confident peer during Explore stations. Let them be the \"thermometer reader\" while the partner records, then switch roles. Use large, easy-to-read thermometers only.\n\n3. **Concrete comparisons:** During Explain, use actual objects rather than pictures: \"Feel this dark paper—it got hot in the sun. Feel this white paper—it's cooler. Why?\" Use physical demonstration rather than asking students to imagine.\n\n4. **Simplified design challenge:** For Elaborate, provide pre-cut materials and a template structure (e.g., a paper plate with materials already outlined). Students choose which materials to attach rather than designing from scratch.\n\n5. **Frequent check-ins:** Use yes/no or thumbs up/down questions: \"Is the sun hot? Is the heater hot? Do they both make light?\" rather than open-ended questions.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Multi-variable investigation:** Have advanced students test **three variables:** dark vs. light materials, thick vs. thin materials, and shiny vs. dull materials. Create a simple chart to compare results: \"Which combination keeps the most heat out?\"\n\n2. **Heat transfer explanation:** Ask: \"How does the heater in the picture work? Where does its heat go? Does heat travel through the air?\" Provide a simple answer framework and encourage scientific thinking.\n\n3. **Real-world connection project:** \"Design a sun shelter for the playground. Draw it and label materials. Explain why each material helps keep kids cool.\"\n\n4. **Energy source research:** Ask students to find 3–5 pictures of things that give off heat and light in your classroom or at home. Make a poster: \"Heat and Light Around Us.\" Present to class.\n\n5. **Prediction refinement:** After the Elaborate phase, ask: \"If we made your shade structure three times thicker, what would happen to the thermometer reading? How do you know?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Heater Science Scavenger Hunt:** Provide a classroom scavenger hunt where students find items that **make heat** (lamp, sunny window, oven—teacher must point out, not touch) and items that **block heat** (shade, dark cloth, hat). Create a simple checklist with pictures. Students check off what they find and explain to a friend why each item is on the list.\n\n2. **Sun Journal (Multi-Day):** Over one week, students observe the sun's warmth and light at different times of day. Each day, they draw or mark on a calendar: \"Sun is hot and bright,\" \"Sun is warm but not as bright,\" \"Sun is not here.\" Discuss: \"When is the sun most powerful?\" This connects to K-PS3-1 (observations of sunlight's effect on Earth).\n\n3. **Make a Glowing Model:** Provide battery-powered LED lights and dark paper or tissue tubes. Students create a \"glow model\" by taping the light inside a tube and wrapping it with different materials (foil, dark tissue, clear plastic). They observe which materials let the glow show through best. Display in a dark corner of the classroom and discuss: \"This light is like the heater in our picture—it makes a glow!\"\n\n4. **Hot and Cold Sort:** Gather pictures of warm things (sun, fire, heater, hot chocolate, soup) and cool things (ice, snow, fan, cold water, freezer). Students sort and create a classroom chart: \"Things That Give Heat and Light\" vs. \"Things That Are Cold.\" Discuss how heat and light go together but cold is different.\n\n5. **Parent Letter & Home Exploration:** Send a simple letter home asking families to observe one heat/light source at home (lamp, oven door, heater, sunny window) with their child. Students draw what they saw and bring back to share in a class \"Heat and Light Gallery Walk.\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Classroom Tips\n\n- **Safety first:** Never allow students to touch the actual heater or any real heat source. Use pictures, demonstrations, and thermometers as safe alternatives.\n- **Preparation:** Test thermometers in your sunny location before the lesson to ensure they work and show clear temperature changes.\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Kindergarteners learn through repetition. Use the same words and anchor chart throughout all five phases. Repeat at the start of the second session.\n- **Connection to prior knowledge:** Ask at the start: \"When you feel warm, is that heat? Is that energy?\" Many students have felt the sun; anchor new concepts to their experiences.\n- **Flexibility:** If weather doesn't permit sunny Explore stations, use a strong lamp (LED or halogen—check wattage) in a dark corner. The concept remains the same.\n- **Visual documentation:** Take photos of student work during each phase. This provides evidence of learning and creates a digital lesson story you can share with families.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly uses the propane heater photograph to build authentic curiosity about energy, heat, and light while keeping all activities age-appropriate and safe for Kindergarten learners.**",
