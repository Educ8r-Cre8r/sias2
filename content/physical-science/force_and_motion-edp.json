  "content": "### Visible Elements in Photo\n\n- A student in a red shirt mid-jump over an orange cone placed on grass\n- A white line or tape on the ground (likely a starting or landing marker)\n- Outdoor school grounds with a building, parked cars, and other students in the background\n- Flat, open grassy area suitable for movement activities\n- The cone positioned as a low obstacle to clear\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n\n- **From the cone and jump setup**: Students need a way to measure, practice, or improve their jumping distance or height over a barrier (the cone represents an obstacle or target).\n- **From the white line on ground**: A baseline or measurement system is needed to track performance (distance traveled, consistency, etc.).\n- **From outdoor setting with multiple observers**: This is a group activity where fair testing and repeatability matter—suggesting a need to design fair test conditions or measurement tools.\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2:**  \n*Design a jumping game* where you make a safe obstacle out of blocks, sticks, or rope that kids can jump over. Test it: Can everyone jump over it? Is it too hard or too easy? Fix your obstacle so it's just right for your friends.\n\n**3-5:**  \n*Design a fair jumping-distance test station* that measures how far each student can jump over a 12-inch-tall obstacle. Your design must include: (1) a clearly marked starting line, (2) a consistent obstacle height, (3) a way to measure distance to the nearest inch, and (4) instructions so any student can run the test the same way every time. Test with at least 5 students and record results. Can you improve the design so measurements are more accurate?\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis photo shows an *existing activity* (jumping) but no clear *measurement or testing system*. Students must first identify what's hard to track fairly (Is the jump consistent? How do we measure? Is the obstacle the right height?), then design a solution. This makes **Ask** the natural entry point—before imagining or building anything, they need to define what problem their design solves.\n\n### Suggested Materials\n\n- Foam cones or PVC pipes (obstacles)\n- Measuring tape or yard stick\n- Chalk or tape (ground markers)\n- Clipboard and paper (record sheet)\n- Blocks or stacked boxes (adjustable height)\n\n### Estimated Time\n\n**40–60 minutes** (single session for K-2; may extend to two 30-minute sessions for 3-5 with multiple test trials and design iteration)\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.A** (defining and delimiting engineering problems) by asking students to identify variables that affect fair testing and fairness in measurement—core practices in both physical science and engineering.",
