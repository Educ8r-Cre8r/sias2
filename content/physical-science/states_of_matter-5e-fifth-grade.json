This directly connects to understanding how matter changes form.\n- **Properties of Materials:** The concrete, grass, metal fire hydrant, and traffic cone each have distinct observable properties (hardness, color, flexibility, density) that can be identified and compared based on how they interact with their environment.\n- **Matter Conservation:** The water visible in the canal represents matter that exists in the environment. Students can explore how water cycles through different forms and locations while the total amount of matter remains constant.\n- **Gravitational Force:** Objects in the photograph (hydrant, cone, water) all exist in relationship to Earth's downward gravitational pull. Water flows toward the lowest point (the canal), demonstrating that gravity pulls objects downward.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Water Everywhere: Exploring Matter, Properties, and Gravity in Our Community**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 50-minute sessions (or one 90-minute block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-PS1-1 (Develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen)\n  - 5-PS1-3 (Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties)\n  - 5-PS2-1 (Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Observe and describe the properties of different materials (solid, liquid) visible in the photograph and classify them based on observable characteristics.\n2. Explain how gravity pulls water and objects downward, using evidence from the photograph.\n3. Conduct measurements and observations to identify different materials by their properties and record findings in a data table.\n4. Develop a simple model showing how matter exists in different forms (liquid water, solid objects) and how gravitational force affects their position in the environment.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the different materials and water visible in the photograph while activating prior knowledge about matter and gravity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital copy of the photograph (large display)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student observation sheets (one per student)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph on a screen or printed large format where all students can see clearly.\n\n2. Allow 30-45 seconds of silent observation. Ask students to notice as many different things as they can.\n\n3. Pose these discussion questions in sequence, giving 1-2 minutes for think-pair-share before whole-group discussion:\n   - \"What different **types of materials** do you see in this picture? How are they different from each other?\" (Expected: concrete, grass, metal, water, plastic/rubber cone)\n   - \"Where is the water in this picture, and why do you think it's in that location?\" (Expected: in the canal, lower ground level; gravity pulls it down)\n   - \"If you touched these different objects—the metal hydrant, the concrete, the water, the grass—what do you think would feel different about them? What **properties** would be different?\" (Expected: hard vs. soft, wet vs. dry, smooth vs. rough, flexible vs. rigid)\n   - \"Why do you think someone put that orange cone and the 'Do Not Enter' sign by the water?\" (Expected: warning, safety, something about the water or area is important to manage)\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if all these materials are made of the same 'stuff' (matter), why do they look and feel so different? And why does the water end up in that low spot by itself—does it always flow to the lowest place?\"\n\n5. Record student predictions and questions on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate the different materials in this picture and discover why water and objects move the way they do.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate material properties hands-on and observe how objects and water respond to gravity through direct experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 5-6 different materials in containers/samples: water (cup), concrete block or tile, grass clipping, metal object (bolt or nail), plastic (cup or spoon), rubber (eraser or band)\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Scale or balance (if available)\n- 5-10 small objects of different weights (marble, cotton ball, metal washer, plastic button, etc.)\n- Ramps made from books and wooden boards (2-3 ramps at different angles)\n- Observation/Data recording sheet (template provided below)\n- Containers for water\n- Paper towels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Material Properties Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. Organize students into 4-5 small groups. Assign each group 1-2 materials from the photograph to investigate.\n\n2. Provide each group with their assigned material(s) and a data sheet with these columns:\n   - *Material Name*\n   - *Color*\n   - *Texture (smooth, rough, bumpy, etc.)*\n   - *Flexibility (can it bend?)*\n   - *Hardness (does it dent or scratch easily?)*\n   - *Other observable properties*\n\n3. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Observe your material carefully. Touch it, look at it, smell it (if safe). Do not taste. Record everything you notice in your data table.\"\n   - \"Compare your material to at least two others in the room. How is it similar? How is it different?\"\n   - \"Draw a picture of your material in the box at the bottom of your sheet.\"\n\n4. Teacher circulates, asking prompts without giving answers:\n   - \"What do you notice about the texture?\"\n   - \"Is it hard or soft? How do you know?\"\n   - \"If you tried to bend it, what happened?\"\n\n**Part B: Gravity and Motion Investigation (13 minutes)**\n\n1. Set up 2-3 ramps at the front/center of the room where students can gather.\n\n2. Divide students into two groups to rotate between Part A data recording and the ramp activity.\n\n3. **Student Directions for Ramp Activity:**\n   - \"Pick a small object from the collection. Before you place it on the ramp, predict: Which direction will it roll? Will it go up or down?\"\n   - \"Place your object on the ramp and observe what happens. Record the direction it moved in the table.\"\n   - \"Try objects of different weights. Does a heavier object move differently than a lighter one? Does it always move in the same direction?\"\n   - \"Now try the ramp at different angles (steeper and shallower). Does the angle change which direction things move?\"\n\n4. **Critical Question for students to record:** \"In every test, which direction did objects move? Why do you think they ALWAYS move in that direction?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Facilitate smooth transitions between groups\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What direction did it go?\" \"Will it always go that way?\" \"Why might that be?\"\n- Do NOT say \"gravity pulls things down\" yet—let students observe and wonder\n- Ensure all students get 10+ minutes at the ramps\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Completed data sheets with properties of 2-3 materials\n- Observations that objects consistently roll/fall downward on ramps\n- Initial understanding that different materials have different properties\n- Recognition that objects move in a predictable direction (downward)\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal scientific vocabulary and explain the concepts of material properties and gravitational force based on student observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary written large\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Simple diagram showing particles in solids vs. liquids (prepared in advance or drawn during lesson)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their material observations: \"What properties did you record for your material?\"\n   - Record responses on a class comparison chart on the board\n   - Ask: \"Looking at our chart, what materials are similar? What's different?\"\n\n2. **Ramp Activity Share-Out (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Which direction did your objects move every single time?\" (Answer: downward/toward the ground)\n   - \"Did that ever change, no matter which object you used?\" (Answer: No—always downward)\n   - \"What might be causing that?\" (Guide toward: a force pulling things toward Earth)\n\n3. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   \n   Present these terms with student-friendly definitions. Write each on chart paper and keep posted:\n\n   - **Property:** Something you can observe or measure about a material that describes what it's like (how it looks, feels, acts). *Example: Smoothness, hardness, color, and whether something can bend are all properties.*\n   \n   - **Matter:** Everything around us that takes up space and has weight. *Example: Water, concrete, metal, grass, and air are all matter.*\n   \n   - **Solid:** A kind of matter that keeps its shape. You can hold it in your hand and it won't change shape. *Example: The concrete, the hydrant, the cone.*\n   \n   - **Liquid:** A kind of matter that takes the shape of whatever container holds it. It can flow and move. *Example: Water in the canal.*\n   \n   - **Gravity:** A force that pulls objects toward Earth. It always pulls downward. *Example: When you drop a ball, gravity pulls it to the ground.*\n\n4. **Connect Back to Photograph and Exploration (2 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"Look at the water in this picture. It's a **liquid**—it takes the shape of the canal. Why is it in the canal and not on top of the grass? **Gravity** pulls it downward to the lowest place.\"\n   - Point to the hydrant and cone: \"These are **solids**. They keep their shape. But if the hydrant or cone fell, **gravity** would pull them down just like it did with your objects on the ramp.\"\n   - \"The **properties** you observed—like whether something is hard or soft, smooth or rough—help us know what material something is made of.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding (embedded):**\n   - Ask quick true/false statements:\n     - \"Gravity pulls things upward.\" (False—it pulls downward)\n     - \"Water is a solid.\" (False—it's a liquid)\n     - \"Color is a property of a material.\" (True)\n   - Ask students to thumbs up/down/sideways for each, and address misconceptions on the spot.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Property** | Something you can see or feel about a material that tells you what it's like (color, texture, hardness, flexibility) |\n| **Matter** | Everything in the world that takes up space and has weight—solids, liquids, and gases |\n| **Solid** | A kind of matter that keeps its own shape and doesn't change unless you change it |\n| **Liquid** | A kind of matter that flows and takes the shape of its container; water is the most common liquid |\n| **Gravity** | A force that pulls everything on Earth downward toward the ground |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that different materials have observable properties\n- Students recognize that water is a liquid and solids like concrete and metal are different states of matter\n- Students understand that gravity is a force pulling objects downward\n- Students can use vocabulary to describe what they observed in the Explore phase\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of material properties and gravity to solve a real-world problem inspired by the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The photograph (displayed)\n- Design Challenge worksheet (template below)\n- Variety of materials: paper, plastic cups, aluminum foil, wooden sticks, tape, rubber bands, small rocks, cotton balls\n- Water in containers (or access to water source)\n- Buckets or trays to contain water\n- Newspaper or plastic sheeting (for spill protection)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Design Challenge: \"Help Keep the Water Safe\"**\n\nIntroduce the context: \"In the photograph, there's a warning sign and traffic cone by the water. Why? Maybe the area is under construction, or maybe we need to protect people or the environment. Your job is to use what you learned about **properties of materials** and **gravity** to design a barrier or protection system.\"\n\n1. **Challenge Brief (2 minutes):**\n   - \"You are an engineer. Water is flowing downhill (remember gravity?) toward an area where people walk. Your task: **Design a barrier or system using the materials provided that will help protect or manage this water flow.**\"\n   - \"You can build a small dam, a barrier, a channel to direct water, or a warning system—be creative!\"\n   - \"You must use at least THREE different materials and explain WHY you chose each material based on its **properties**.\"\n\n2. **Student Design Process (14 minutes):**\n\n   - Organize students in pairs or small groups (3 max)\n   - Provide Design Challenge worksheet:\n     ```\n     DESIGN CHALLENGE: Water Safety Barrier\n     \n     Our Design Idea:\n     [Space for sketch]\n     \n     Materials We Will Use:\n     1. _____________ because it is _______________ (property)\n     2. _____________ because it is _______________ (property)\n     3. _____________ because it is _______________ (property)\n     \n     Why will our design work? (Remember: gravity pulls water downward)\n     _______________________________________________\n     \n     How will we test it?\n     _______________________________________________\n     ```\n\n   - **Student Directions:**\n     - \"Sketch your design idea first. Label the materials you'll use.\"\n     - \"For each material, write down WHY you picked it. Is it waterproof? Strong? Flexible?\"\n     - \"Build your design using the materials provided.\"\n     - \"Test it with water. Does it work the way you predicted?\"\n\n3. **Quick Gallery Walk / Peer Feedback (2 minutes):**\n   - If time allows, have students briefly view other designs and give one piece of positive feedback: \"I like how you used _____ because it is _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask clarifying questions: \"Why did you choose that material?\" \"How will gravity affect your design?\" \"What properties does that material have?\"\n- Encourage problem-solving if first design doesn't work: \"What could you change? Would a different material work better?\"\n- Facilitate water testing safely (use trays, newspaper for containment)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design a functional barrier or system using multiple materials\n- Students articulate reasons for material choices based on observable properties\n- Students demonstrate understanding that gravity pulls water downward and can plan for that force\n- Students can test their designs and refine them based on results\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of material properties, states of matter, and gravitational force through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Are students accurately recording material properties? Can they identify similarities and differences?\n- Observation during ramp activity: Do students recognize that objects always move downward? Can they connect this to gravity?\n- Listen during Explain phase: Do students use vocabulary (solid, liquid, property, gravity) correctly when answering questions?\n- Observation during Elaborate phase: Do students explain material choices using properties? Can they predict how gravity will affect their design?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative) - Administer at end of lesson or start of Day 2 (5 minutes):**\n\nStudents respond to the following (written or oral, depending on writing level):\n\n1. **Look at this photograph. Describe three different materials you see and one property of each.**\n   - Example: \"I see concrete. It is hard.\"\n   - (Student writes or tells 3 materials and properties)\n\n2. **Why is the water in the low spot (the canal) and not on top of the grass?**\n   - (Student should reference \"gravity pulls it down\" or similar concept)\n\n3. **If you were to design a wall to hold back water, what material would you use—wood, plastic, or metal—and why?**\n   - (Student should name a material and explain a property that makes it suitable: waterproof, strong, hard, etc.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- **Proficient:** Student identifies 3+ materials with accurate properties; explains water location using gravity concept; chooses material with sound reasoning based on properties.\n- **Developing:** Student identifies 2 materials with mostly accurate properties; mentions \"it goes down\" but doesn't clearly link to gravity; material choice has partial reasoning.\n- **Beginning:** Student identifies 1 material vaguely; does not explain water location; material choice lacks reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can identify and describe properties of at least 2 materials correctly\n- 75%+ of students recognize that gravity pulls objects and water downward\n- 70%+ of students can make a design choice based on material properties and explain their reasoning\n- Students demonstrate growth in vocabulary use (property, gravity, solid, liquid, matter)\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Scaffolded Observation Sheet:** Provide a template with pictures of materials and sentence frames:\n   - \"This material is _________ (color).\"\n   - \"It feels ___________ (texture word: rough, smooth, bumpy, etc.).\"\n   - \"I can / cannot bend it.\" (Circle one)\n   - This reduces cognitive load while still building observation skills.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Word Wall with Pictures:** Display key terms (property, solid, liquid, gravity) with illustrations. Allow students to point to or reference visuals during discussions rather than relying on verbal memory alone.\n\n3. **Simplified Ramp Activity:** Provide pre-made ramps at only one or two angles. Use only 3-4 objects of varying weights so students can focus on the direction of motion rather than comparing variables. Use a data sheet with checkboxes instead of open-ended recording.\n\n4. **Design Challenge Support:** Pre-select 3 materials for student groups (e.g., \"Use plastic wrap, tape, and sticks\"). Provide a partially completed design worksheet with word banks for properties.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Particle Model Introduction:** Introduce the idea that all matter is made of tiny particles by showing a simple diagram. Ask: \"If solids and liquids are made of the same particles, why do they act differently? Can you design an experiment to test if a solid can become a liquid?\" (This bridges toward 5-PS1-1.)\n\n2. **Gravity Investigation Extension:** Ask: \"Does gravity pull the same on light objects and heavy objects? Design an experiment to test this with objects of very different weights on the ramps.\" Have them collect and graph data showing that all objects accelerate downward regardless of weight.\n\n3. **Advanced Design Challenge:** Challenge students to design a *reversible* system—one that can hold water back but also allow it to be released in a controlled way. Ask them to explain how they'd use material properties AND gravity to accomplish both functions.\n\n4. **Cross-Disciplinary Connection:** Have advanced students research real-world water management systems (dams, levees, canals). Present findings on how engineers use material properties and understand gravity to build these structures.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Properties Detective\" Scavenger Hunt:** Students tour the classroom and school grounds finding 5-6 different materials (a tile, a plant leaf, metal equipment, plastic, fabric, etc.). They measure, describe, and photograph each, then create a \"Material Properties Field Guide\" poster comparing all findings. This extends 5-PS1-3 (identifying materials by properties).\n\n2. **States of Water Cycle Model:** Using the photograph as inspiration, students create a diagram or physical model showing water in different states (solid ice, liquid water, water vapor/gas). They label each state and draw arrows showing how gravity and heat cause water to change form and move through the environment. This connects to understanding that matter doesn't disappear—it changes form (foundational for 5-PS1-2).\n\n3. **Gravitational Force in Sports & Motion:** Students observe videos of sports or playground activities (basketball, sliding down a slide, water fountains). They identify places where gravity is acting downward and make predictions about how to adjust or change the activity to work with or against gravity. For example: \"If you throw a ball up, gravity pulls it down. What if you threw it on the moon where gravity is weaker?\" This deepens understanding of 5-PS2-1 and connects to real-world contexts.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- Day 1 can include Engage, Explore (Part A), and Explain phases (approximately 50 minutes).\n- Day 2 can include Explore (Part B), Elaborate, and Evaluate (approximately 50 minutes).\n- If a full 90-minute block is available, conduct all phases in one session with a 5-minute stretch/transition break midway.\n- Safety: When using water, ensure trays/containers are used to prevent slipping. Monitor students near water sources.\n- The photograph is an excellent reference point throughout the lesson—point to it frequently to anchor vocabulary and concepts to concrete, visible examples.",
