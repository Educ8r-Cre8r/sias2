Observe and describe the different materials found in sand and beach environments using their senses.\n2. Sort objects by their physical properties (size, color, shape, or texture).\n3. Predict and test how push and pull forces move different materials in sand.\n4. Communicate their observations using words and pictures.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph of beach sand mixture\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Marker\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it where all students can see clearly. Say: \"Look at this special picture! It shows something from the beach. What do you see?\"\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What different things do you see mixed together in this picture?\" (Let students name: sand, shells, rocks, stones, pebbles)\n   - \"Why do you think there are so many different colors?\" (Accept all answers: sun, water, different rocks, different shells)\n   - \"Have you ever played in sand? What did it feel like?\" (Activate sensory prior knowledge)\n   - \"If you pushed this pile of sand with your hand, what do you think would happen?\" (Predict movement)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Say: \"I wonder... if we push the sand, does it move the same way as the shells? Let's find out together!\"\n\n4. **Record student observations** on chart paper with pictures and words.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to make our own beach mix so we can explore just like real scientists!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 shallow plastic tray or cookie sheet per pair of students\n- Uncooked sand (or kinetic sand if available) - 1 cup per tray\n- Small shells (craft shells), small pebbles, and dried pasta pieces (to substitute for shells if needed) - mixed together\n- Craft sticks or plastic spoons\n- Feather or small paintbrush (for pushing lightly)\n- Chart or recording sheet with three boxes labeled \"Push It,\" \"Pull It,\" \"Watch It Move\"\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Sit with your partner. Look at the tray in front of you. It has sand with shells and rocks mixed in it—just like the picture!\"\n\n2. \"First, feel the sand. Is it smooth? Bumpy? Soft? Tell your partner what it feels like.\" (Explore texture)\n\n3. **Push Investigation:** \"Use your stick to PUSH the sand and shells slowly, then harder. Watch what moves. What happens to the sand? What happens to the shells? Do they move the same way?\"\n   - Record on chart: Draw or write what moved.\n\n4. **Pull Investigation:** \"Now try PULLING the sand and shells toward you with your stick. Is it the same as pushing? Different?\"\n   - Record on chart: Draw or write what moved.\n\n5. **Light Touch Investigation:** \"Use the feather to barely touch the sand and shells. What happens? Does the feather move the sand or shells?\"\n   - Record on chart: Draw what happened.\n\n6. **Sorting Activity:** \"Can you pick out all the shells and put them in one pile? Can you pick out all the pebbles? Put the sand in another pile. What's easier to pick out? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Which is easier to push?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Do NOT give answers; instead, encourage students to observe and try again.\n- Facilitate peer talk: \"Tell your partner what you discovered.\"\n- Take photos of students exploring for documentation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will discover that sand moves more easily than shells or pebbles.\n- Students will notice that different amounts of force (push/pull) create different results.\n- Students will observe that some materials are easier to separate than others.\n- Students will record observations in drawings and simple words.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Beach sand mixture in a large shallow bin (for demonstration)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary posted\n- Student-made recordings from Explore phase\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Picture cards showing \"push,\" \"pull,\" \"force\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 student pairs to share what they discovered: \"What did you learn about pushing the sand? About the shells?\"\n   - Display their recordings on the wall.\n   - Say: \"You all made great discoveries!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):** Use simple definitions and demonstrate with the sand mixture:\n\n   - **\"Sand\"** – tiny pieces of rock and shell mixed together (show in tray)\n   - **\"Push\"** – to move something away from you (demonstrate gently pushing sand)\n   - **\"Pull\"** – to move something toward you (demonstrate gently pulling sand)\n   - **\"Force\"** – the strength you use when you push or pull (use your hands to show light and strong forces)\n   - **\"Properties\"** – things we notice about objects, like color, size, shape, and how they feel\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photo: \"This beach sand has so many different materials with different properties. See all the colors? See the different shapes?\"\n   - \"When waves push and pull the sand on the beach, the shells and rocks move too—just like you did with your sticks!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Play a quick game: Say \"PUSH!\" and students mime pushing sand. Say \"PULL!\" and students mime pulling sand.\n   - Ask: \"What's the difference between sand and shells?\" (Expect: shells are bigger, harder, don't move as easily)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Sand** | Tiny pieces of rocks and shells all mixed together |\n| **Push** | To move something away from you with force |\n| **Pull** | To move something toward you with force |\n| **Force** | The strength you use to push or pull something |\n| **Properties** | Things you can see, feel, or notice about an object (like color, size, shape, or texture) |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will use the terms \"push,\" \"pull,\" and \"force\" in context.\n- Students will understand that different materials have different properties.\n- Students will connect their hands-on discoveries to the formal vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small cups or containers (one per student)\n- Sand mixture (same as before)\n- Plastic spoons or craft sticks\n- A \"Challenge Card\" with illustrated tasks\n- Optional: Small toy cars, balls, or blocks to roll through sand\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**\"Force Challenge: Can You Move It?\"**\n\n1. **Present the Challenge:** \"Now we have a new job! I'm going to give you challenges. You decide: Do you need to PUSH or PULL? Do you need a strong force or a light force?\"\n\n2. **Challenge Tasks (choose 2-3 based on time and student interest):**\n   - \"Make a path through the sand by pulling your stick. Can you make a straight line? A curvy line?\"\n   - \"Push the sand so hard it flies out of the tray. Now push it so gently it doesn't move. What's the difference?\" (Light vs. strong force)\n   - \"Roll this ball through the sand. Does it move easily? Why or why not?\" (Introduces friction concept informally)\n   - \"Can you find all the shells by only using pulling motions?\" (Apply force concept)\n   - \"Make a pile of sand. Push it down hard. Pull it apart. What happens?\" (Force changes shape)\n\n3. **Real-World Connection:** \"Waves at the beach are like a big push and pull force! They move sand and shells all the time. The sun also helps by warming the sand. Have you seen how hot sand gets on a sunny day at the beach?\"\n\n4. **Student Reflection:** \"Show me with your body: How do you PUSH? How do you PULL? Which one takes more strength for you?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask: \"What force did you use? Why did you choose a push or pull?\"\n- Encourage problem-solving: \"What happens if you try it a different way?\"\n- Take anecdotal notes on student understanding of force concepts.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that different forces create different results.\n- Students will apply push/pull vocabulary to new situations.\n- Students will begin to understand that force strength matters.\n- Students will make real-world connections to the beach environment.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces and material properties.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n\n- Observe students during Explore and Elaborate phases. Check:\n  - Do they use \"push\" and \"pull\" vocabulary correctly?\n  - Do they predict before testing?\n  - Do they notice differences in how materials move?\n  - Can they explain why sand moves differently than shells?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\n**Choose ONE assessment method based on student ability:**\n\n**Option 1 (Drawing):** \"Draw the beach sand. Show me pushing the sand with a stick. Draw an arrow to show which way it moves.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Verbal):** Ask individual students: \"If I push the sand gently, what happens? If I push it hard, what happens? Why is it different?\"\n\n**Option 3 (Acting):** \"Show me how you would push sand at the beach. Now show me how you would pull it. Are they the same or different?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies push or pull motion\n- ✓ Student observes that force strength affects movement\n- ✓ Student notices that sand and shells move differently\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary \"push,\" \"pull,\" or \"force\" at least once\n- ✓ Student makes a connection to real beach experiences\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most students will demonstrate understanding of push and pull as directional forces.\n- Students will recognize that different amounts of force produce different results.\n- Students will understand that materials with different properties behave differently when forces are applied.\n- Students will be able to describe observations using pictures and simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Pair students with a stronger peer** during Explore phase. Assign the peer as the \"teacher\" to model observations.\n\n2. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on only \"PUSH\" and \"PULL.\" Save \"force\" and \"properties\" for small group practice later.\n\n3. **Provide concrete visual aids:** Use picture cards showing push/pull actions. Point to the card when introducing each concept. Allow extended time to repeat the physical motions (students often learn through movement).\n\n4. **Simplify the Explore task:** Give struggling students only the push investigation first; add pull later. Use larger shells and pebbles (easier to see movement).\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Introduce \"direction\" vocabulary:** \"Does the sand move the same way when you push it to the right versus to the left? Create a map of where the sand moved with different pushes.\"\n\n2. **Predict and explain:** \"Before you push, predict: Will the shell move? Will the sand move? Now test. Were you right? Why do you think you were right/wrong?\" (Encourages scientific reasoning)\n\n3. **Experiment with variables:** \"We pushed with a stick. What if you pushed with a feather? Your hand? Your foot? Which force is strongest? Why?\" (Introduces comparative thinking)\n\n4. **Connect to waves:** \"Waves at the beach push and pull the sand over and over. What would happen if we kept pushing and pulling the sand many, many times? Let's find out!\" (Leads to understanding of change over time)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Beach in a Bottle\":** Students layer sand, shells, and pebbles in a clear plastic bottle with water. Seal it. Shake it gently (push/pull water inside). Observe how the materials move in liquid. Discuss: \"Does water push and pull differently than our sticks?\"\n\n2. **\"Sand Sensory Exploration\":** Provide trays with different types of sand (coarse, fine, colored) and different shells. Students compare textures and properties: \"Which sand is rougher? Which shells are prettier? Can we sort them by size?\" (Deepens understanding of properties)\n\n3. **\"Beach Visit Journal\":** Send home a simple drawing template. Ask families to visit a beach, park, or sandbox with their child. Students observe and draw: \"What pushes and pulls the sand? (wind, water, people). What do you feel?\" Bring back drawings to share. (Connects learning to real world and family engagement)\n\n---\n\n## Reflection & Notes for Teacher\n\n**This lesson leverages Kindergarteners' natural curiosity about hands-on materials while building foundational understanding of forces (push/pull) and material properties.** The photograph of mixed beach materials provides an authentic, relatable context. Students move from sensory exploration → discovering how forces affect different materials → applying concepts to new challenges.\n\n**Key teaching moves:**\n- Let them explore BEFORE naming vocabulary\n- Use the beach/ocean theme throughout (familiar to most children)\n- Repeat push/pull motions frequently; kinesthetic learners thrive\n- Ask \"what did you notice?\" rather than \"do you understand?\"\n\nThis lesson directly addresses K-PS2-1 (comparing effects of different strengths and directions of pushes/pulls) and connects to K-PS3-1 through the beach environment and sun discussion, even though the focus remains on physical forces.",
