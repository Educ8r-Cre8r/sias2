ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest about how electricity creates light and activate prior knowledge about seeing in the dark.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the circuit (projected or printed)\n- Flashlight\n- Dark cloth or towel\n- Small object (toy, ball, or book)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Hook students with a light mystery:** Darken the classroom slightly using blinds or a dark cloth. Place a small toy on a table where students can barely see it.\n\n2. **Pose the initial question:** \"Can anyone see this toy clearly? What's different when the light is off versus when it's on?\" Let students observe for 15-20 seconds.\n\n3. **Turn on the classroom lights or shine a flashlight on the toy** and ask:\n   - \"What happened? Can you see it better now?\"\n   - \"Where is the light coming from?\" (Point to the light source.)\n   - \"Do we need light to see things?\"\n\n4. **Show the circuit photograph** and say: \"This is a special tool that makes light using electricity. The wires and metal parts inside carry electricity, and when they work together, they light up a bulb—just like our classroom lights!\"\n\n5. **Wonder prompt:** \"Have you ever wondered how a flashlight or lamp makes light? Today, we're going to explore how electricity and wires work together to create light so we can see in the dark!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an investigation to see how we can build our own light using a battery and wires, just like the picture shows.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate simple circuits and discover that a complete loop of wires and a power source creates light.\n\n**Materials (per student pair or small group):**\n- 1 AA battery\n- 1 battery holder (or tape to secure battery)\n- 2 copper wires (15-20 inches each, stripped at ends)\n- 1 small LED light bulb or incandescent bulb in a socket\n- 1 light bulb holder (or tape)\n- Paper and crayons for recording\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (simplified for 1st grade):**\n\n1. \"Look at your materials. We have a battery (the power), wires (the path), and a light bulb (what we want to light up).\"\n\n2. \"Let's try to make the light turn on. Touch one wire to the + (plus) end of the battery and one wire to the – (minus) end of the battery.\"\n\n3. \"Now touch both wires to different sides of the light bulb socket. What happens?\"\n\n4. **If the light turns on:** \"Wonderful! The electricity traveled from the battery through the wires into the light bulb. That's called a circuit!\"\n\n5. **If the light doesn't turn on:** \"That's okay! Let's try again. Make sure the wires touch both the battery and the bulb tightly. Sometimes it takes a few tries.\"\n\n6. \"Now, let's break the circuit. Lift one wire away from the battery. What happens to the light?\" (It goes out.)\n\n7. \"Put the wire back. Does the light come back on?\" (Yes, the circuit is complete again.)\n\n8. **Recording:** Ask students to draw a picture of their circuit in action and label the battery, wires, and light bulb. Younger students may simply draw and circle the parts that are glowing.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to each group and ask guiding questions: \"Is your light on or off? What do you think is happening?\" \n- Do **not** tell students how to wire the circuit; allow them to experiment.\n- If a circuit isn't working, ask: \"Are the wires touching the battery? Are they touching the bulb? Let's check together.\"\n- Celebrate effort and discovery, not just success.\n- Take photos or notes of successful circuits to reference later.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students successfully light up a bulb and observe the brightness increase in the dark area of the circuit.\n- Students recognize that breaking the circuit (lifting a wire) turns off the light.\n- Students understand that a complete path is needed for electricity to flow and light to turn on.\n- Students create a visual record of their circuit.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts, connecting exploration to the photograph and scientific understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Circuit photograph (enlarged or projected)\n- Large diagram or poster showing a simple circuit (battery, wires, bulb, switch)\n- The circuit setups students built (for reference)\n- Flashlight or lamp for demonstration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations from the Explore phase:** Ask 2-3 students to show their circuits and describe what happened. Affirm their discoveries: \"You found out that light needs a complete path, just like the circuits in the photo!\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary and concepts using student-friendly language:**\n\n   - **Electricity:** Invisible energy that flows through wires and powers lights and machines.\n   - **Circuit:** A path that electricity travels along. It has to be complete (no breaks) for electricity to flow.\n   - **Battery:** The power source that gives electricity to the circuit.\n   - **Light:** Energy that comes out of the bulb and helps us see things.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the colored wires: \"See all these colored wires? They're the pathways for electricity, just like the wires you used.\"\n   - Point to the terminals (the metal parts at the terminal block): \"These metal pieces are where the wires connect. Electricity flows through them, just like in your circuit.\"\n   - Point to the light bulb area: \"When electricity reaches the bulb, it lights up and glows so we can see in the dark!\"\n\n4. **Demonstrate a real-world connection:**\n   - Show a flashlight or turn on a classroom lamp.\n   - \"This lamp has electricity flowing through wires inside, creating light. Just like your circuits!\"\n   - Ask: \"What other things in our classroom use electricity to make light?\" (Ceiling lights, computer screens, etc.)\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I break the circuit by unplugging a lamp, what happens to the light?\" (It goes off.)\n   - Ask: \"Why do we need light?\" (To see things in the dark, to see colors, to know where things are.)\n   - Invite students to turn their circuits on and off while you observe and affirm their understanding.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Electricity:** Invisible energy that flows through wires and powers lights and other things.\n- **Circuit:** A complete loop that electricity travels through.\n- **Battery:** The part that gives power to the electricity.\n- **Light:** Brightness that comes from a bulb and helps us see.\n- **Wires:** Thin metal paths that carry electricity.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students use vocabulary terms (electricity, circuit, battery, light) when describing their observations.\n- Students explain that electricity travels through wires and creates light in the bulb.\n- Students connect their circuit to real-world examples (lamps, flashlights, classroom lights).\n- Students demonstrate understanding that a complete circuit is needed for light to work.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a simple light system that could help someone see in a dark place.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student circuits from Explore phase\n- Aluminum foil\n- Cardboard tubes or boxes (paper towel tubes, small boxes)\n- Scissors (teacher-supervised or pre-cut)\n- Tape\n- Optional: bells, buzzers, or sound-making devices for advanced students\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present a real-world challenge:** \"A cave explorer needs light to see inside a dark cave. Can you design a simple system using your circuit that could help them?\"\n\n2. **Give students a design task:**\n   - \"Use your circuit and the materials here to create a 'cave light' that could shine into a dark place.\"\n   - \"You can wrap aluminum foil around your bulb to direct the light.\"\n   - \"You can attach your circuit to a cardboard tube to make it look like a flashlight.\"\n   - \"Make sure your circuit still works—the light should still turn on and off!\"\n\n3. **Step-by-step student directions:**\n   - Take your working circuit from before.\n   - Decide: Do you want to make a flashlight, a headlamp, or a light to put on a cave wall?\n   - Use tape and cardboard/foil to attach your circuit to your design.\n   - Test your design: Does the light still work? Can you see better in the dark with it?\n   - Draw a picture of your design and label where the light comes from.\n\n4. **Optional challenge for advanced students:** \"Can you create a way to turn your light on and off without breaking the circuit? You could try adding a simple switch by taping a wire that you can move to touch and not touch the battery.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Ask students: \"How does your design help someone in a dark place?\"\n- Encourage creativity: \"That's an interesting way to hold your circuit!\"\n- Support problem-solving: \"Your light isn't turning on. Let's check if the wires are touching both the battery and the bulb.\"\n- Document student designs with photos.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students create a functioning circuit-based light system.\n- Students explain how their design helps solve the problem of seeing in darkness.\n- Students articulate the connection between electricity, circuits, and light.\n- Students demonstrate how a complete circuit is necessary for their design to work.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of circuits, electricity, and how light helps us see.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observe during Explore:** Watch for students who successfully create a circuit and understand that breaking it turns off the light.\n- **Listen during Explain:** Note student vocabulary use and their ability to connect the photograph to their own circuits.\n- **Observe during Elaborate:** Assess whether students can apply circuit concepts to a new design challenge.\n\n**Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nShow students the circuit photograph again and ask them to respond (drawing + words, or just drawing for students who are not yet writing):\n\n1. \"What helps the light bulb turn on in this picture?\" \n   - **Success:** Student identifies electricity, battery, wires, or \"complete circuit.\"\n\n2. \"Why is light important?\"\n   - **Success:** Student explains that light helps us see or helps us see in the dark.\n\n3. \"Draw a picture of a place where we need light to see. Label what creates the light.\"\n   - **Success:** Student draws a dark place (bedroom, cave, night) and identifies a light source (lamp, flashlight, sun).\n\n**Summative Assessment:**\n\nGive students a simple circuit diagram (drawn or printed) with the battery, wires, and bulb. Ask:\n- \"Will the light turn on? Why or why not?\"\n- Students should recognize if the circuit is complete or has a break.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Student can identify the parts of a simple circuit (battery, wires, bulb).  \n✓ Student explains that electricity travels through wires to make light.  \n✓ Student understands that a complete circuit is needed for light to turn on.  \n✓ Student can apply circuit knowledge to a real-world problem (needing light in darkness).  \n✓ Student uses vocabulary: electricity, circuit, battery, light, wires.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-assembled circuit stations:** Set up 1-2 working circuits before the lesson. Have struggling students observe and explore how the circuit works (turning it on/off, pointing out parts) before attempting to build their own. This builds confidence and understanding.\n\n2. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use repeated, consistent language: \"The battery gives power. The wires carry the power. The light shows it's working!\" Avoid overwhelming students with too many terms at once.\n\n3. **Hands-on guidance:** Pair struggling students with a peer or the teacher during the Explore phase. Model how to gently touch the wires to the battery and bulb. Physically guide their hands if needed (with permission), but narrate what you're doing: \"We're making a path for the electricity.\"\n\n**Challenge (Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Design a switch:** Challenge advanced students to add a simple paper clip or aluminum foil switch to their circuit during the Elaborate phase. They can experiment with creating a break in the circuit that they can control (without unplugging wires each time). Ask: \"Can you design a way to turn the light on and off using just one hand?\"\n\n2. **Series vs. parallel circuits:** If students successfully build one working circuit, introduce the idea of adding a second bulb. Ask: \"What happens if we add another light bulb? Does it stay as bright? Why?\" (Simple observation of brightness changes, no deep explanation needed for 1st grade.)\n\n3. **Research extension:** Encourage students to draw or photograph examples of circuits they see in their home (lamps, flashlights, toys). Bring examples to share with the class and label the parts: battery, wires, light source.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Light in Nature:** Take students on a nature walk and identify natural sources of light (sun, reflections in water, glow-in-the-dark organisms if available). Compare natural light to the light created by their circuits. Create a class chart: \"Things That Make Light\" (sun, bulbs, fire, stars, etc.).\n\n2. **Shadow Exploration:** Use the circuits students built to create shadows. Dim the classroom lights, turn on a student's circuit bulb, and place objects in front of the light. Observe and discuss how shadows form. Ask: \"Why do we see shadows? What is a shadow?\" Connect to 1-PS4-2 by exploring how light reveals objects and how blocking light creates darkness.\n\n3. **Circuit Relay Game:** Set up 4-5 simple circuits around the classroom. Divide students into teams. Each team must go to a circuit station, light the bulb, describe what they see, and then pass the circuit to the next station. This reinforces vocabulary and understanding in a fun, movement-based context.\n\n---",
