Identify and describe the forces of gravity and friction acting on a moving object.\n2. Explain how different surface materials affect the motion of a wheeled object.\n3. Collect and record observations comparing how objects move across varying terrain types.\n4. Use evidence from investigations to support an argument about why objects move differently on different surfaces.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about forces and motion using the photograph of the robot in nature.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the robot on the grass and stone surface\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks or paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image on the board or display it on a document camera. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation time.\n\n2. **Initial Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about where this robot is sitting? Describe the different surfaces it's on.\"\n   - \"If this robot were to move forward, do you think it would roll more easily on the grassy area or on the rocky stone? Why do you think that?\"\n   - \"What would need to happen to make this robot move across these surfaces?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the robot might move faster on one surface than another?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I'm wondering: Would this robot need more force to roll through soft soil, over hard rock, or through grass? Let's investigate!\"\n\n4. **Record Prior Knowledge:** Ask students to write or draw one prediction about which surface would be hardest for the robot to move across and why.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's build our own rolling robots and test them on different surfaces to find out!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how different surfaces affect the motion of wheeled objects through hands-on testing.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Small rolling object or toy with wheels (e.g., toy car, marble roller, wooden block with dowel axles, or even a simple ball with tape markers)\n- 4-5 different surface materials in shallow containers or trays (examples: sand, soil, grass/turf sample, smooth tile or laminate, crumpled aluminum foil or textured plastic)\n- Ruler or meter stick\n- Stopwatch or timer\n- Small ramp or incline (wood board or cardboard propped at a slight angle—15-20 degrees)\n- Data recording sheet (see template below)\n- Safety glasses (optional but recommended)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud; write steps on board):**\n\n1. **Set Up Your Test Track:** Place your first surface material in a shallow tray. Make sure it's flat and stable.\n\n2. **Release Your Robot:** Position your rolling object at the top of your small ramp. Release it (don't push) and let it roll across the surface.\n\n3. **Measure the Distance:** Using a ruler, measure how far the object rolled before stopping. Record this distance.\n\n4. **Time the Motion (Optional Extension):** For older/advanced students: time how long it takes the object to stop rolling. Record the time.\n\n5. **Repeat:** Test the same object on at least 4 different surface materials, measuring the distance each time.\n\n6. **Observe and Record:** For each surface, write or draw:\n   - The surface name\n   - How the object moved (smoothly? with bumps? slowly? quickly?)\n   - The distance it rolled\n   - Whether you felt resistance (friction) as it moved\n\n**Data Recording Sheet Template:**\n\n| Surface Material | Description of Movement | Distance Rolled (cm) | Observations |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Surface 1 | | | |\n| Surface 2 | | | |\n| Surface 3 | | | |\n| Surface 4 | | | |\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: *\"What do you notice about what's happening?\"* and *\"How is this surface different from the last one?\"* \n- Avoid telling students which surface will result in longer distances; let them discover it.\n- Encourage precise measurements and detailed descriptions of motion.\n- Help students troubleshoot if their object isn't rolling properly; adjust the ramp angle if needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students discover that smoother surfaces allow objects to roll farther than rough or uneven surfaces.\n- Students observe that softer materials (sand, soil, grass) create more resistance and shorter distances than hard, smooth surfaces.\n- Students collect quantitative data (distance measurements) and qualitative observations (how the motion looked and felt).\n- Students begin to think about why friction affects motion differently on different surfaces.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to force and motion concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Completed data sheets from Explore phase\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of robot (displayed again)\n- Visual aids: diagrams showing friction force and gravity\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their findings: \"Which surface let your object roll the farthest? Which surface stopped it quickly?\"\n   - Create a class chart on the board listing surfaces and distances. Identify patterns together.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   \n   Use student-friendly definitions and connect each to what students just observed:\n\n   - **Force:** A push or pull that can make something move, stop, or change direction. (Connection: \"When you released your object down the ramp, gravity was a pulling force.\")\n   \n   - **Gravity:** The force that pulls all objects toward Earth. It always pulls downward. (Connection: \"This is why your rolling object came down the ramp and didn't float away!\")\n   \n   - **Friction:** A force that occurs when two surfaces rub together and slows down or stops motion. (Connection: \"The rough sand created more friction than the smooth tile, so your object stopped faster on sand.\")\n   \n   - **Resistance:** How much a surface pushes back against a moving object. (Connection: \"Grass and soil had more resistance than the smooth tile.\")\n   \n   - **Motion:** The act of moving or changing position. (Connection: \"Your rolling object showed motion until friction stopped it.\")\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Display the robot image again.\n   - Ask: \"Now that we understand friction and gravity, why might this robot need special wheels designed a certain way to move across both grass and stone?\"\n   - Guide students to see that the robot must overcome different amounts of friction on different surfaces.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding Strategy:**\n   - Use thumbs up/middle/down signal: \"Show me with your thumb if you can explain why an object rolls farther on smooth surfaces than bumpy ones.\"\n   - Ask 2-3 students to explain in their own words.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|---|---|\n| **Force** | A push or pull that changes how something moves. |\n| **Gravity** | The force that pulls everything down toward Earth. |\n| **Friction** | The force that happens when two surfaces rub together and makes things slow down or stop. |\n| **Resistance** | The push-back from a surface that makes motion harder. |\n| **Motion** | When something is moving or changing position. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can define force, gravity, and friction in their own words.\n- Students understand that friction varies depending on surface material properties.\n- Students can point to evidence from their exploration that connects to these terms.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of forces and friction to a new context and think about real-world applications.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small rolling objects or toy cars\n- 3-4 pre-made \"obstacle course\" stations (simple: a ramp leading to different surfaces, a curved path with obstacles)\n- Challenge cards with scenarios (see below)\n- Rulers and recording sheets\n- Optional: wheeled robot toy or programmable robot (if available) to demonstrate\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge Scenario Cards (Read aloud; assign one per group):**\n\n- **Challenge 1:** \"A delivery robot needs to travel from a smooth warehouse floor to a grassy outdoor area. Predict: Where will friction be greatest? How will the robot need to change to handle both surfaces?\"\n\n- **Challenge 2:** \"Design the best surface for a robot toy to travel quickly across. What materials would you choose? Why?\"\n\n- **Challenge 3:** \"A robot explorer is sent to sandy Mars. How might the friction on sand affect its movement differently than on Earth's rocks?\"\n\n**Activity Directions:**\n\n1. **Assign each group a Challenge Card.**\n2. **Test and Predict:** Groups use their rolling object to test surfaces and think about the scenario.\n3. **Design or Redesign:** Can students suggest modifications to wheels, weight, or power to help a robot move better on their assigned surface?\n4. **Explain Using Evidence:** Groups record their thinking on a worksheet:\n   - *What did we observe?*\n   - *What surface caused the most friction?*\n   - *What could a robot designer do to help the robot move better on this surface?*\n\n**Real-World Connection:**\nBriefly share: \"Real robots like Mars rovers and autonomous delivery robots are designed with specific wheels and weights to handle the surfaces they'll encounter. Engineers test different materials to reduce friction or handle rough terrain, just like we did!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Observe which students are making connections between their data and the real-world scenarios.\n- Ask probing questions: *\"Why do you think engineers would choose that wheel design?\"* or *\"How does friction affect your answer?\"*\n- Encourage students to refer back to their Explore data as evidence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students apply friction and gravity concepts to new situations.\n- Students understand that surface properties affect how objects (and robots) move.\n- Students can explain and defend their thinking using evidence from investigations.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces, motion, and how surface materials affect movement.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student descriptions during Explore: Are they noticing differences in motion across surfaces?\n- Listen to vocabulary use during Explain: Can students use \"friction,\" \"gravity,\" and \"force\" correctly?\n- Review Elaborate responses: Do students connect surface properties to real-world applications?\n\n**Exit Ticket or Summative Assessment (Administer at end of Day 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a sheet containing the following:\n\n**Question 1 (Multiple Choice):**\n\"Which surface would allow a rolling robot to move the farthest before stopping?\"\n- A) Soft sand\n- B) Crumpled aluminum foil\n- C) Smooth tile or plastic\n- D) Loose grass\n\n*Correct Answer: C*\n\n**Question 2 (Short Answer):**\n\"Explain why a robot might stop faster on sandy soil than on smooth tile. Use the word 'friction' in your answer.\"\n\n*Expected Response:* \"Sand has more friction than smooth tile because the rough surface creates more resistance, which slows down and stops the rolling robot faster.\"\n\n**Question 3 (Draw and Label):**\n\"Draw a robot rolling down a ramp. Label the forces acting on it: gravity (pointing down) and friction (at the wheels/ground contact).\"\n\n*Expected Response:* Student drawing should show downward arrow for gravity and arrow at contact point showing friction opposing motion.\n\n**Question 4 (Application):**\n\"If you were designing a robot to clean sidewalks in your town, would you want your robot's wheels to have high friction or low friction with the concrete? Explain your thinking.\"\n\n*Expected Response:* High friction (traction), so the robot can grip the surface and move without slipping. OR Low friction if you want it to slide smoothly without resistance.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies the smoothest surface as allowing the longest distance (Question 1).\n- ✓ Student uses the term \"friction\" and explains its role in stopping the object (Question 2).\n- ✓ Student's drawing accurately labels gravity and friction (Question 3).\n- ✓ Student provides a reasonable explanation for a real-world application (Question 4).\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Evidence to Look For |\n|---|---|\n| Identify and describe forces of gravity and friction | Exit Ticket Q2 & Q3; Explain phase thumbs check |\n| Explain how surfaces affect motion | Exit Ticket Q1, Q2, Q4; Elaborate responses |\n| Collect and record observations | Explore data sheet completeness and accuracy |\n| Use evidence to support arguments | Elaborate written responses; Exit Ticket Q4 |\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Data Sheet:** Provide a pre-made data sheet with pictures of surfaces and simple checkboxes (e.g., \"Did it roll far?\" Yes/No) instead of requiring measurements and written descriptions. Allow students to draw pictures instead of writing.\n\n2. **Partner with a Peer:** Pair struggling readers/writers with a more proficient student. One can handle measurement while the other records observations, or one can read cards aloud.\n\n3. **Pre-Teach Vocabulary:** Before the Explain phase, show photos or tactile examples of each surface and say the vocabulary words aloud several times. Create a word wall with pictures and definitions. During explanations, use the words repeatedly and point to visuals.\n\n4. **Scaffolded Exit Ticket:** Provide the exit ticket with word banks, sentence starters (\"Friction is... because...\"), or multiple-choice questions instead of open-ended responses. Allow verbal responses instead of written ones if needed.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Quantitative Analysis:** Ask advanced students to graph their Explore data (distance vs. surface type) and calculate averages or compare friction coefficients if wheels have different materials. Challenge them to predict which surface has the highest friction based on surface texture observations.\n\n2. **Design a Solution:** Have students design a wheeled robot or device that could move effectively across ALL surfaces tested. What modifications would they make? (e.g., larger wheels, different materials, adjustable weight). Ask them to sketch and label their design with explanations.\n\n3. **Extended Research:** Provide articles or videos about real Mars rovers or autonomous delivery robots. Ask: \"How do engineers account for friction when designing robots for different environments? What evidence supports their design choices?\" Have them create a comparison chart.\n\n4. **Variable Investigation:** Challenge students to test additional variables, such as \"Does the angle of the ramp affect how far the object travels on different surfaces?\" or \"How does the weight of the rolling object change friction?\" Have them design and conduct their own investigation.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Robot Racetrack Engineering Project:** Students design and build a racetrack out of paper towel tubes, cardboard, tape, and different materials (sand, grass clippings, smooth plastic). They test a rolling object (or toy car/robot) on their track and measure which section is fastest/slowest. They then redesign to make their robot faster overall. This connects engineering design with force concepts.\n\n2. **Friction in Sports:** Research or discuss how friction affects sports equipment (e.g., Why do sneakers have different tread patterns than ice skates? How do bicycle tires grip the road? Why do swimmers wear special suits?). Have students investigate one sport and present findings.\n\n3. **Hands-On: Build a Wheel Design Challenge:** Provide clay, straws, and paper wheels with different textures (sandpaper, construction paper, plastic wrap, foil). Students design and test wheels to see which creates the least friction on a smooth surface and most friction on a rough surface. This deepens understanding of material properties and friction.\n\n4. **Citizen Science: Test Real Surfaces at School:** Take students outdoors with toy cars/rolling objects. Test movement on: playground concrete, mulch, grass, dirt paths, asphalt. Record distances and observations. Create a class graph showing real-world friction data from your campus.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wear safety glasses during rolling tests (small objects could pop or bounce unexpectedly). Keep testing areas clear of hazards.\n- **Material Sourcing:** Use craft materials or recycled items for surfaces (aluminum foil, sandpaper, grass sod, etc.). Dollar stores often have inexpensive toy cars.\n- **Pacing:** If students struggle with measurements, prioritize qualitative observations (how the motion looks/feels) over exact distances.\n- **Connection to Gravity:** Use this lesson to reinforce 5-PS2-1 by explicitly pointing out that gravity pulls the object down the ramp and the wheels contact the ground due to gravity's pull.\n- **Photographs:** The robot image is excellent for anchoring abstract concepts. Return to it multiple times throughout the lesson.",
