ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by connecting sunlight to the solar panels in the photograph and activate curiosity about how light works.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of solar panels (or display on screen)\n- A small flashlight or sunny window in the classroom\n- A yellow or blue object (crayon, paper, or toy)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph of solar panels on a screen or projector. Point to the blue panels on the rooftop.\n2. Ask students: *\"What do you see in this picture? What color are these panels? Where is the sunlight coming from?\"*\n3. Explain that these special blue panels catch sunlight and use it to make electricity to power the buildings and homes we can see behind them.\n4. Show students a blue object (like a blue crayon) in the classroom. Shine a flashlight on it and say: *\"This blue object catches light just like these panels do. But what happens when we put something dark in front of the light?\"* Block the light with your hand.\n5. Ask: *\"Did the light disappear? Where did it go? Can you see in the dark, or do we need light to see things?\"*\n6. Invite predictions: *\"Today we're going to investigate how light helps us see and how different materials catch light in different ways. Let's be light scientists!\"*\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's explore this mystery by doing some investigations with light and different materials.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how light interacts with different materials through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Flashlights or task lighting (enough for small groups or pairs)\n- A variety of materials: white paper, dark/black paper, aluminum foil, tissue paper, construction paper in different colors (blue, yellow, red), plastic cups (clear, translucent, opaque)\n- Small objects: plastic toys, blocks, crayons\n- A dark corner, hallway, or corner created with a blanket/cover (optional but ideal)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording observations\n- Crayons or markers for drawing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Light and Darkness (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide the class into pairs or small groups of 3.\n2. If available, take students to a darker area (a hallway corner, closet, or shaded room corner). If not possible, have one student close their eyes while a partner holds up an object.\n3. Ask: *\"Can you see the object when it's dark? What do you notice?\"*\n4. Turn on a flashlight aimed at the object. Ask: *\"Can you see it now? What changed?\"*\n5. Have students take turns with the flashlight, shining it on different objects around the room or in their investigation station.\n6. Facilitate observation: *\"The light helps us see! We need light to see things in the dark.\"*\n7. Have each student draw a picture of something they could see with light but couldn't see in the dark on a small sheet of paper.\n\n**Part 2: Materials and Light (12 minutes)**\n\n1. Set up investigation stations with materials arranged in small piles: white paper, black paper, aluminum foil, tissue paper, and different colored paper.\n2. Provide each pair with a flashlight.\n3. Direct students: *\"Shine your flashlight on each material. Watch what happens to the light. Does it bounce off? Does it go through? Does it get dark?\"*\n4. Model with one material first: Hold a sheet of white paper in front of the flashlight. *\"See how the light bounces back and makes it bright? The white paper catches the light!\"* Then show black paper: *\"This black paper doesn't bounce light back as much. It looks darker.\"*\n5. Have students investigate each material, shining the flashlight on it and observing.\n6. Ask them to sort the materials into two piles: *\"Which ones catch light and look bright?\" and \"Which ones don't catch as much light and look darker?\"*\n7. Have students draw or color the materials they investigated on a simple chart, using crayons to show whether each material caught light (bright) or didn't catch much light (dark).\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate and ask clarifying questions: *\"What do you see? Is the light bouncing back or going through? Does this remind you of the blue panels in the picture?\"* Avoid telling students answers—guide them to observe.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students should discover that:\n- Light is needed to see objects\n- Some materials (light-colored, reflective surfaces) bounce light back and appear bright\n- Some materials (dark, non-reflective surfaces) absorb light and appear darker\n- This is similar to how the solar panels catch sunlight\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (16 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and help students make sense of their observations through guided discussion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Photograph of solar panels (displayed again)\n- Student drawings/charts from Explore phase\n- Picture cards showing light sources (sun, flashlight, light bulb, fire)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (6 minutes):** \n   - Gather students in a circle. Ask: *\"What did you discover when you shined the flashlight on different materials? Show us your drawings.\"*\n   - Have 3-4 students share what they found. Write key words on chart paper as they speak.\n   - Highlight observations: \"You noticed that some materials were bright and some were dark!\" \"The light needed to bounce back to your eyes so you could see!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Display the solar panel photograph again. Point to the panels and the sun.\n   - **Light:** Energy from the sun or a lamp that helps us see. *Point to the bright sun in the photograph.* \"This is light from the sun. Light travels to Earth and helps us see.\"\n   - **Light Source:** Something that makes light, like the sun, a flashlight, or a light bulb. *Show picture cards of light sources.* \"The sun is a light source. Flashlights are light sources.\"\n   - **Bright:** When a lot of light bounces back to our eyes from a material. *Point to the blue panels.* \"These panels are bright because they catch light from the sun.\"\n   - **Dark:** When not much light bounces back because the material absorbs the light. *Point to the black roof behind the panels.* \"This dark roof doesn't bounce back as much light.\"\n   - **Energy:** The power to do work. *Explain simply:* \"The sun's light energy travels to these solar panels. The panels catch that energy and use it to power homes—that's energy doing work!\"\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph and Investigation (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to the solar panels again. *\"Remember how we found that some materials caught light? These blue panels catch light from the sun, just like your white paper caught the flashlight! The sun's light energy travels down to Earth. These special panels catch that energy and turn it into electricity to power the buildings in the city.\"*\n   - *\"You were light scientists! You discovered how light bounces off some materials and gets absorbed by others. The people who built these panels knew this too—they made them blue because blue catches a lot of light energy from the sun!\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (1 minute):**\n   - Quick question: *\"Can we see things in the dark without a light source?\" (No)* \n   - *\"What did you notice when you shined a flashlight on white paper versus black paper?\"* (White was brighter; black was darker)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Light:** Energy from the sun, a flashlight, or a lamp that travels to our eyes and helps us see things.\n- **Light Source:** Something that makes or gives off light, like the sun, a flashlight, or a light bulb.\n- **Bright:** Something looks bright when a lot of light bounces back from it to our eyes.\n- **Dark:** Something looks dark when it doesn't bounce much light back—it absorbs the light instead.\n- **Energy:** The power to make something work or do something. Sunlight is a type of energy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students should understand that:\n- We need light from a source to see things\n- Different materials interact with light in different ways\n- Light is a form of energy that comes from sources like the sun\n- Solar panels catch light energy from the sun to do useful work\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by predicting which materials would be best for catching light and designing a simple reflector.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Aluminum foil pieces (pre-cut into small sheets, 4x4 inches)\n- White paper pieces (4x4 inches)\n- Black construction paper pieces (4x4 inches)\n- Tape (painter's or masking tape)\n- Small flashlights or a consistent light source (lamp, sunny window)\n- Small white objects to illuminate (paper cups, small cardboard boxes)\n- Index cards for predictions\n- Crayons/markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Prediction and Reasoning (5 minutes)**\n\n1. Display three materials again: aluminum foil, white paper, and black paper.\n2. Ask: *\"If we wanted to catch light energy from the sun like the solar panels do, which material would work best? Why do you think so?\"*\n3. Have students point to or hold up the material they think catches the most light.\n4. Ask 2-3 students: *\"Why did you pick that one? What did you see in our investigation?\"*\n5. Guide them to reasoning: *\"The white and shiny materials bounced light back the most, right? That's because they reflect—or bounce—light really well.\"*\n\n**Part 2: Build a Light Catcher (13 minutes)**\n\n1. Explain: *\"Solar panels are made to catch light and use its energy. Let's make a simple light catcher and see which material works best!\"*\n2. Divide students into three groups (or use rotation if you have fewer materials).\n3. Give each group one material: aluminum foil, white paper, or black paper.\n4. Tape the material to a small cup or box so it stands up facing a light source (flashlight or sunny window).\n5. Have students predict: *\"Will this material catch the light and make the area bright, or will it stay dark?\"* Draw or write their prediction on an index card.\n6. Shine a flashlight at each material (or place each in sunlight) and observe which one lights up the brightest area or reflects the most light.\n7. Have students record what they observed: *\"Which material caught the most light? Which caught the least?\"*\n8. Discuss: *\"The foil and white paper caught more light—they reflected it! The black paper didn't catch as much. That's why the solar panels are blue and shiny—to catch a lot of sunlight energy!\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:** Facilitate predictions without judgment. Ask guiding questions: *\"What did we learn about aluminum foil in the investigation? Is it light-colored or dark?\"* Allow students to discover the answer through their test.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students can predict which material catches the most light based on prior observations\n- Students understand that reflective materials (shiny, light-colored) catch more light than dark, non-reflective ones\n- Students apply this understanding to explain why solar panels are designed the way they are\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light sources, how light interacts with materials, and the purpose of solar panels.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Can students identify when light is present/absent and observe material differences?\n- Drawings and charts: Do they accurately represent bright vs. dark materials?\n- Verbal responses: Can they explain why some materials catch light better?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (5 minutes at end of Session 2):**\n\nAdminister one of the following options based on your class level:\n\n**Option 1: Draw and Label**\nProvide a simple worksheet with three boxes:\n- Box 1: Draw a light source (sun or flashlight).\n- Box 2: Draw something you can see when light shines on it.\n- Box 3: Draw something that catches light well (bright) and something that doesn't (dark).\n\n**Option 2: Answer Simple Questions (Teacher-directed or written)**\n1. *\"What do we need to see things in the dark?\"* (Light / a light source)\n2. *\"If I shine a flashlight on white paper, will it be bright or dark? Why?\"* (Bright, because white paper bounces light back)\n3. *\"Look at the solar panel picture. Why do you think they are blue and shiny instead of black?\"* (To catch more light from the sun)\n\n**Option 3: Demonstration**\nHold up a flashlight and an object. Ask the student: \n- *\"Can I see this object in the dark?\"* (Have them observe)\n- *\"Now watch me shine the light on it. What changed?\"*\n- *\"Which of these two materials [white paper and black paper] would be better at catching sunlight like the solar panels?\"* (Student points or explains)\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- Student can identify that light is needed to see in darkness.\n- Student can describe or show that some materials catch/reflect light better than others.\n- Student can make a connection between their investigation and how solar panels work (catching light energy).\n- Student uses vocabulary: light source, bright, dark, energy (with support as needed).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Most first graders should demonstrate understanding that light is necessary to see objects and that different materials interact differently with light. Advanced students may explain the concept of reflection or energy transformation; students needing support may simply observe and identify light vs. dark.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for students struggling with the concepts):**\n\n1. **Reduce Material Choices:** Instead of multiple materials, focus on only two contrasting options (white paper vs. black paper). This reduces cognitive load and makes the difference more obvious.\n\n2. **Use Physical Demonstrations:** Pair student investigations with your own large, visible demonstration using a bright flashlight and large material samples. Narrate what you see: *\"Look! The white catches lots of light—it's bright! Now look at the black—it doesn't shine back as much.\"* This scaffolds vocabulary and observation.\n\n3. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Use a picture-only exit ticket where students point to or circle the material that catches the most light, rather than writing or drawing. Provide the vocabulary orally: *\"Is this bright or dark?\"*\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate Angles:** Have students explore what happens when they angle the material at different angles to the light. Ask: *\"Does the light catch better when the panel is straight toward the sun, or at an angle?\"* Connect to why solar panels are often tilted on real roofs.\n\n2. **Extended Application:** Show a picture of a lighthouse, a mirror, or reflective clothing. Ask: *\"How do you think bright, reflective materials are used in these things? Why would we want to catch or bounce light in these situations?\"*\n\n3. **Energy Connection:** Introduce the idea that the sun's light energy travels 93 million miles to reach Earth. Ask: *\"If the sun is so far away, how do these tiny panels catch enough energy? What does the blue and shiny material help them do?\"* This bridges to the concept that reflecting/concentrating light helps capture more energy.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Solar Oven Exploration:** On a sunny day, build a simple solar cooker using a box, aluminum foil (reflective material), and plastic wrap. Place a small snack inside (chocolate, marshmallow) and let students observe that the sun's light energy creates heat. Discuss: *\"The solar panels catch light energy. This solar oven catches light energy and turns it into heat! Both use light from the sun to do work.\"*\n\n2. **Shadow and Light Investigation:** Take students outside on a sunny day. Have them observe their shadows, shadows of objects, and notice that shadows appear where light is blocked. Ask: *\"A shadow is a place where light is blocked, right? Where the sun's light can reach, it's bright. Where the light can't reach, it's dark—a shadow!\"* This deepens understanding of light interaction with materials.\n\n3. **Design a \"Light Catcher\" at Home:** Send home a simple activity sheet asking families to find materials at home that catch light really well (a mirror, aluminum foil, white paper, shiny objects) and materials that don't catch much light (dark cloth, black paper). Have students bring pictures or the materials back to create a classroom \"Light Catcher Collection\" and discuss why each material is included.",
