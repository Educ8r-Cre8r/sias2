ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of floating foam/bubbles.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of bubble/foam floating on water (displayed via projector, interactive board, or printed large format)\n- Small water table or clear plastic bins with water (one per group of 4-5 students)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Show the image of the floating bubble structure on water. Ask students to gather around and observe carefully for 30 seconds in silence.\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe it to a friend.\"\n   - \"Why do you think this fluffy, bubbly thing is not sinking into the water? What's holding it up?\"\n   - \"Have you ever blown bubbles in a bath or played with bubbles? What happened to them?\"\n   - \"Do you think if we made something fluffy and bubbly, would it float like this one?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \n   - \"I wonder... what would happen if we made our own bubbly boat and put it in water? Would it float or sink?\"\n   - Encourage students to share predictions: \"Thumbs up if you think it will float; thumbs down if you think it will sink; sideways if you're not sure!\"\n\n4. **Record Wonder Questions:** Write 2-3 student predictions on chart paper to revisit during the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's discover the answer together! We're going to build our own floating structures and test them in water to see what makes things float.\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate floating through hands-on material exploration and simple boat building.\n\n**Materials (per student pair or small group):**\n- Small clear plastic cups or shallow containers filled with water (one per group)\n- Bubble wrap, styrofoam packing peanuts, or crumpled newspaper (at least 3-4 small pieces per group)\n- Small wooden blocks, plastic toys, and heavy objects (metal washers, rocks) for comparison\n- Plastic spoons for pushing objects\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Tray under each water container to catch spills\n- Observation sheet (see below) with simple drawings for recording\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Setup:** Divide students into pairs or small groups of 3-4. Assign each group to a water station.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n   - **Step 1:** \"Look at the things on your table. Which ones do you think will float? Place each object gently on the water one at a time.\"\n   - **Step 2:** \"Watch carefully. Does it stay on top (float) or go down (sink)? Show me with your hands: hold them up for float, push them down for sink.\"\n   - **Step 3:** \"Now let's try the bubbly materials. Drop a piece of bubble wrap on the water. What happens? Gently push it with your spoon. Does it move?\"\n   - **Step 4:** \"Make a tiny raft: Put a piece of foam in the water. Can you balance a small toy on top? Does the foam still float with something on it?\"\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:**\n   - \"Remember the picture we saw? It was full of bubbles and air. We're testing things with air in them now. The bubbles and foam in the picture are like the materials you're using.\"\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Students draw or mark on an observation sheet: circle the pictures of things that floated, cross out things that sank.\n   - Teacher or aide writes brief labels: \"Bubble wrap floated!\" \"Rock sank!\"\n\n5. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n   - Avoid telling students what will float; let them discover through testing.\n   - Encourage gentle handling and safe water play.\n   - Prompt observations: \"Watch the bubbles in the foam—can you see the tiny air holes?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that foam, bubble wrap, and lightweight materials float.\n- Students observe that heavy materials (rocks, metal) sink.\n- Students begin to notice that things full of air or bubbles stay on top of water.\n- Groups complete a simple observation record showing which items floated.\n\n---\n\n## 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple drawings/icons\n- The original photograph displayed again\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase (to review as a group)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - Gather students in a circle. Invite 2-3 groups to share what they discovered: \"Show us one thing that floated. Why do you think it floated?\"\n   - Record key observations on chart paper: \"Foam floated,\" \"Bubble wrap floated,\" \"Rocks sank.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (with student-friendly definitions and visual demonstrations):\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Visual/Example** |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Float** | Staying on top of water without sinking down. | Show a piece of foam on water; have it stay up. |\n   | **Sink** | Going down into the water and not floating. | Gently drop a rock into water; it goes down. |\n   | **Air** | The invisible thing we breathe. It is very light and helps things float. | Point to bubble wrap: \"See all these tiny air pockets? They help it float.\" |\n   | **Bubble** | A tiny pocket of air wrapped in a thin layer of water or soap. | Show a bubble floating in the air; pop it gently. |\n\n3. **Connection Back to Photograph:**\n   - \"Look at this picture again. See all the bubbly, foamy stuff? It's full of air, just like the bubble wrap you tested. That's why it floats on the water!\"\n   - Point to the bubbles in the photo: \"These tiny bubbles are filled with air. Air is very, very light. Light things float!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - **Quick Response Activity:** \"I'm going to say something. If it's true, clap once. If it's false, stay silent.\"\n     - \"Bubble wrap has air inside it.\" (clap)\n     - \"Rocks float on water.\" (silent)\n     - \"Foam is light and floats.\" (clap)\n   - **Thumbs Check:** \"Show me thumbs up if you understand why bubbles float, thumbs sideways if you're not sure yet.\"\n\n**Vocabulary Display:** Create a word wall poster with pictures for each term. Leave it displayed throughout the unit.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the terms \"float,\" \"sink,\" and \"air\" in context.\n- Students can explain that air helps things float.\n- Students connect the floating materials they tested to the photograph.\n- Most students demonstrate understanding through response activities.\n\n---\n\n## 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing and testing a floating vessel.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Small foam trays or styrofoam pieces (approximately 4\" × 4\")\n- Markers or paint\n- Small plastic cups, caps, or foam bits to decorate/customize\n- Tape (masking or painter's tape)\n- Water table or basin filled with water\n- Optional: small toy passengers (figurines, blocks) to add to boats\n- Newspaper or towels for drying\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Design Challenge Introduction:**\n   - \"Now that we know foam and bubbles float, let's design our own floating boat! You can make it look however you want. Will it be a passenger boat? A cargo boat? A silly boat?\"\n\n2. **Boat-Building Steps:**\n   - **Step 1:** \"Decorate your foam tray using markers. Give your boat a name!\"\n   - **Step 2:** \"You can tape a small cup to the foam to make a cabin, or add other foam pieces to make your boat special.\"\n   - **Step 3:** \"Carefully place your boat in the water. Does it float?\"\n   - **Step 4:** \"Gently push your boat with your finger or a spoon. Does it move? Can you make it go fast or slow?\"\n\n3. **Extension Challenge (for students who finish early):**\n   - \"Can you add a small toy passenger to your boat and still have it float? Try it!\"\n   - \"Can you push your boat gently to make it move in a circle? A straight line?\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Facilitate boat decorating and assembly.\n   - Encourage creativity: \"There's no wrong way to design your boat!\"\n   - Ask inquiry questions during water testing: \"What happens when you push it hard vs. gently? Does it move differently?\"\n   - Document success with photos or quick anecdotal notes.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each student creates a floating boat that successfully stays on water.\n- Students observe and describe how their boats move when gently pushed.\n- Students show confidence in designing, testing, and modifying their boats.\n- Students can explain: \"My boat floats because it's made of foam, and foam has air in it.\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding through observation, discussion, and simple performance tasks.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist** (use during Explore and Elaborate phases):\n  - ☐ Student correctly identifies floating vs. sinking materials\n  - ☐ Student uses vocabulary: \"float,\" \"sink,\" \"air,\" \"bubble\"\n  - ☐ Student makes predictions before testing\n  - ☐ Student explains that air helps things float\n\n- **Questioning Strategy:**\n  - During Elaborate: \"Why did your boat float? What's inside it that keeps it up?\"\n  - Listen for responses that mention: air, bubbles, foam, light, not heavy.\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket/Lesson Closure):**\n\nConduct a brief individual or small-group interview using these questions:\n\n1. **Picture Sort Task:** Show 4-5 pictures/objects (bubble wrap, rock, sponge, feather, toy boat). Ask: \"Which ones float? Which ones sink?\" Have students point or sort into two piles.\n\n2. **Explanation Question:** \"Why do you think bubbles and foam float on water?\" Accept answers like:\n   - \"They have air inside.\"\n   - \"They're not heavy.\"\n   - \"The air keeps them up.\"\n   - \"Bubbles help them float.\"\n\n3. **Application Question:** \"If you wanted to make something float on water, what would you use?\" (Accept: foam, bubbles, light things, sponge, bubble wrap, etc.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies 3+ floating materials\n- ✓ Student explains that air/bubbles help things float\n- ✓ Student successfully built and tested a floating boat\n- ✓ Student uses academic vocabulary (float, sink, air, bubble) at least once\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Keep observation notes and photos of student boats for portfolios.\n- Note which students need additional support or challenge.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Pre-Labeled Observation Sheet:** Provide a sheet with pictures of objects already drawn. Students simply circle or mark \"float\" or \"sink\" after testing, rather than drawing independently.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Picture Cards:** Create flashcard-style visuals pairing the word with a clear image. Have students touch and repeat vocabulary during the Explain phase. Partner these students with a peer buddy during Explore.\n\n3. **Simplified Boat Design:** Provide pre-made foam boats (already assembled). Students only decorate and test, skipping the building steps. This reduces fine motor demands while maintaining conceptual engagement.\n\n4. **One-on-One Questioning:** After activities, sit with students who struggled and use guiding questions: \"Is the foam light or heavy? Does light or heavy things float?\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Predict, Test, and Explain Sequence:** Ask: \"Before you test each object, write or draw your prediction. After testing, explain why you were right or wrong.\" This deepens metacognitive thinking.\n\n2. **Multi-Material Boat Design:** Provide foam, bubble wrap, and newspaper. Challenge: \"Design a boat that uses all three materials. Which part floats best? Why?\" This requires comparison and reasoning.\n\n3. **Load Test Challenge:** \"Your boat must float while carrying as many small rocks as possible without sinking. How many can you add?\" This introduces the concept of weight capacity in an inquiry-based way.\n\n4. **Observation Journaling:** Have students create a simple picture book: \"My Floating Discoveries.\" Each page shows one material with a sentence: \"The ____ floats because ____.\" This extends writing and deepens explanations.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Sink or Float Game (Indoor or Outdoor Water Table):**\n   - Gather various classroom objects (plastic spoon, cork, rubber duck, pencil, sponge, toy car). Place them in a water table.\n   - Students predict which float/sink, then test them.\n   - Create a class chart: \"Things That Float\" vs. \"Things That Sink.\"\n   - Can be repeated over multiple days with new objects.\n\n2. **Bubble Painting:**\n   - Mix bubble solution with a few drops of washable paint.\n   - Blow bubbles onto paper with a straw.\n   - Bubbles pop and leave colorful circle prints.\n   - Discuss: \"Where did the air go? Why did the bubbles pop?\"\n   - Combines art with air/bubble concept reinforcement.\n\n3. **Float and Race Challenge:**\n   - Create a simple water \"track\" (long shallow bin or trough).\n   - Students design foam boats with names, then race them by blowing gently or using a fan/straw.\n   - Record which boat floats best and fastest.\n   - Discuss: \"Does a lighter boat move faster? Why?\"\n\n4. **Home Connection Activity (Optional Homework):**\n   - Send home a simple note: \"Try the float test at home during bath time! Show a grown-up what floats and what sinks. Draw a picture of one floating thing and bring it back to school.\"\n   - Students return with drawings or photos of floating items from home (bath toys, sponges, washcloths, etc.).\n   - Share during morning meeting: \"My toy boat floats because it's hollow and light!\"\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThis lesson uses the captivating photograph of floating foam bubbles to anchor a kinesthetic, discovery-based investigation of floating. Students move through the 5E cycle by observing the photograph, testing materials in water, learning vocabulary in context, designing their own floating boats, and demonstrating understanding through observation, interview, and application. The lesson is highly visual, hands-on, and appropriate for Kindergarten's need for concrete, multi-sensory learning experiences.",
