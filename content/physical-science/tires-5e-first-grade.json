ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of tires.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital display of the tire photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: An actual tire or toy vehicle with wheels (to show real examples)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or as a printed poster. Ask students to gather around and simply look for 10–15 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is it?\"\n   - \"Why do you think tires have all these bumpy lines on them?\" (Point to the tread pattern.)\n   - \"Have you ever touched a tire? What did it feel like?\"\n   - \"Do you think a smooth, slippery surface and a bumpy tire surface would feel the same, or different? Why?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we made sounds with different kinds of surfaces—bumpy ones like tires and smooth ones like plastic. Which would sound different?\"\n\n4. **Record student observations** and wonderings on chart paper (teacher scribes for first graders).\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be tire scientists. We'll touch different textures, make sounds with them, and see how light makes the bumpy parts easier to see.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate vibrations and sounds using different textured materials, and observe how light reveals texture.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Rubber texture sample (piece of rubber, toy tire, or tire tread tape if available)\n- Smooth plastic object (plastic cup, plastic lid, or smooth toy block)\n- Sandpaper (medium grit)\n- Small bells, spoons, or wooden blocks for striking\n- Flashlight or lamp\n- Chart or paper for recording observations\n- Pencils or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Sound and Vibration (10–12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into small groups** (3–4 per group).\n\n2. **Distribute materials:** Each group receives one bumpy surface (rubber/tire piece), one smooth surface (plastic), and a striking tool (spoon or wooden block).\n\n3. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Gently tap or roll the rubber (bumpy) surface with your tool. Listen to the sound.\"\n   - \"Now tap or roll the smooth plastic with the same tool. Listen carefully.\"\n   - \"Do they sound the same or different? Record what you hear by drawing the sound (wiggle lines for bumpy, straight lines for smooth).\"\n   - \"Try rubbing your finger on each surface. Feel how they vibrate differently.\"\n\n4. **Teacher facilitation:** Walk around and ask students:\n   - \"What sound do you hear when you tap the bumpy surface?\"\n   - \"Does the smooth surface vibrate the same way?\"\n   - \"Which one made a louder or quieter sound?\"\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:** Students discover that bumpy surfaces make different sounds than smooth surfaces, and that tapping or rolling creates vibrations they can feel and hear.\n\n**Part 2: Light and Texture (8–10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Dim the classroom lights slightly** or use a darkened corner if available.\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Look at the bumpy tire picture in normal light. What do you see?\"\n   - \"Now shine the flashlight on a bumpy surface (tire sample or textured object). Move the light slowly across it.\"\n   - \"How does the light help you see the bumpy parts?\"\n   - \"What happens when light hits the bumps? (Shadows appear; bumps look 3D.)\"\n\n3. **Record or draw:** Students sketch what the bumpy surface looks like with light on it.\n\n4. **Expected Student Outcomes:** Students observe that light reveals texture and creates shadows on bumpy surfaces, helping them see the three-dimensional shape.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Tire photograph (large display)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- Real tire sample or high-quality images\n- Student notebooks or worksheets with simple diagrams\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5–7 minutes):**\n   - Invite each group to share 1–2 discoveries: \"What did you learn about bumpy vs. smooth surfaces?\"\n   - Record student observations on a class chart: \"Bumpy surfaces...\" and \"Smooth surfaces...\"\n\n2. **Key Vocabulary Lesson (8–10 minutes):**\n   \n   **Texture:** How something feels on the outside—bumpy, smooth, rough, or slippery.\n   \n   **Tread:** The bumpy pattern on a tire that helps it grip the road and not slip.\n   \n   **Vibration:** Quick back-and-forth shaking that we can feel and that makes sound.\n   \n   **Sound:** Vibrations traveling through the air that our ears can hear.\n   \n   **Light:** Energy that helps us see things; it bounces off surfaces and enters our eyes.\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph:**\n   - Point to the tire tread in the image: \"This is called tread. See all the bumpy lines? Those bumps are the texture.\"\n   - \"Tire makers design bumpy tread so tires don't slip on wet or icy roads.\"\n   - \"When light shines on the tread (like sunlight in this picture), we can see the bumps create shadows, which helps us understand the tire's shape.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think tires need bumps instead of being smooth?\"\n   - Ask: \"What happens when light hits a bumpy tire? Does it look different than a smooth ball?\"\n   - Observe student responses and clarify as needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students understand that texture matters, that bumpy surfaces vibrate and sound differently, and that light helps us see surface features.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by exploring real-world connections and designing their own investigations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Various textured objects from classroom: pencil, eraser, wooden block, foam piece, plastic toy, carpet sample, sandpaper\n- Spoons or wooden sticks for striking\n- Flashlights\n- Recording sheets (pictures of objects with space to write observations)\n- Optional: toy vehicles with wheels of different treads\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Texture Hunt and Sound Investigation (Recommended for first grade)**\n\n1. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Look around the classroom. Find three objects with different textures: one bumpy, one smooth, one in between.\"\n   - \"Tap each object gently with a spoon. Listen to the sound each one makes.\"\n   - \"Draw the object and write or draw what sound it made.\"\n   - \"If you found a bumpy object, shine a flashlight on it. Can you see the bumps better with light?\"\n\n2. **Real-world connection:**\n   - \"Tires on cars and bikes have bumpy tread so they don't slip. What other things have bumpy surfaces to help them work better?\" (Soles of shoes, skateboard grip tape, playground equipment, etc.)\n\n3. **Expected Student Outcomes:** Students apply texture and sound concepts to familiar classroom objects and begin to see why bumpy surfaces are designed into many real-world items.\n\n**Option B: Design a \"Grip Test\" (For more advanced exploration)**\n\n1. **Set up a simple ramp** (book propped on a block).\n\n2. **Challenge:** \"Roll a smooth toy and a textured toy (or apply sandpaper to one) down the ramp. Which stops faster? Which has better grip?\"\n\n3. **Connect to tires:** \"Tires need good grip so cars can stop safely. Bumpy tread helps with that grip.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of texture, sound, vibration, and light concepts.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student participation during Explore phase: Are they discovering sound and texture differences?\n- Listen to group discussions: Can they describe what they feel and hear?\n- Monitor light exploration: Do they recognize that light reveals bumpy surfaces?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple worksheet or ask these verbal questions:\n\n1. **\"Look at the tire picture again. Use your finger to trace the bumpy lines. Why does a tire need bumps?\"**\n   - Success: Student points to tread and gives a reason (to grip, so it doesn't slip, to hold the road).\n\n2. **\"If you tap a bumpy tire and a smooth ball, do they sound the same? Why or why not?\"**\n   - Success: Student explains that bumpy objects vibrate differently and make different sounds.\n\n3. **\"When we shine a light on a bumpy surface, what do we see?\"**\n   - Success: Student describes seeing bumps better, shadows, or a 3D shape.\n\n4. **\"Draw a bumpy surface and a smooth surface. Label which one is which.\"**\n   - Success: Student accurately represents texture in drawings.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students demonstrate understanding that:\n- Texture (bumpy vs. smooth) affects sound and vibration.\n- Light helps us see texture and shape.\n- Tire tread is a bumpy texture designed for a purpose (grip, safety).\n- Vibrations create sound.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Provide tactile experiences first:** Let students touch bumpy and smooth objects in their hands before making sounds or using light. Use real tire samples, sandpaper, and plastic.\n\n2. **Use simpler vocabulary:** Focus on \"bumpy\" and \"smooth\" rather than \"texture\" and \"tread.\" Say \"bumpy tire\" and \"smooth plastic\" repeatedly.\n\n3. **Scaffolded observation:** Ask closed-ended questions: \"Does this feel bumpy or smooth?\" or \"Do you hear a loud sound or a quiet sound?\" rather than open-ended wonderings.\n\n4. **Pair students:** Pair struggling students with stronger readers/observers to share observations.\n\n**Challenge (For advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extend to prediction and experimentation:** \"If we made a tire smoother and smoother, what would happen to the sound it makes? How would it grip the road differently?\" Have students predict and test with materials.\n\n2. **Explore more complex textures:** Provide a range of objects with varying degrees of roughness (fine sandpaper, coarse sandpaper, rubber, plastic, felt) and challenge students to order them from smoothest to bumpiest, then explain how each might perform in different situations.\n\n3. **Real-world application:** Research or discuss: \"Where else do we see bumpy designs?\" (Cleats on shoes, bike tires, skateboard grip tape, stair treads.) Have them draw or write about another bumpy object and why it's bumpy.\n\n4. **Sound investigation:** Introduce the concept of pitch: \"Does a bumpy surface make a higher or lower sound than a smooth one?\" Let them experiment and compare.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Tire Tread Rubbings:** Provide paper and crayons. Students make rubbings of tire tread, shoe soles, and other textured surfaces. Create a classroom \"texture museum\" displaying rubbings labeled with predictions about what each surface is used for.\n\n2. **Sound Sorting Game:** Set up a table with various textured objects hidden in paper bags (bumpy, smooth, rough, slippery). Students feel each without looking and predict: \"Will this make a loud sound or quiet sound when I tap it?\" Then reveal and test predictions.\n\n3. **Design a Better Tire:** Provide clay or playdough and have students create their own \"tire\" with a texture they think would work well. Discuss: \"Why did you make it bumpy/smooth? What does your tire need to do?\" (Connect to engineering and design thinking.)\n\n4. **Light and Shadow Exploration:** Set up a \"shadow station\" with a strong flashlight and various textured objects. Students explore how light creates different shadows on bumpy vs. smooth surfaces and draw or photograph results.\n\n5. **Classroom Book:** Create a class book titled *\"Bumpy and Smooth: Textures Around Our School.\"* Each student contributes one page with a picture of a textured object from school (playground, gym, classroom) and writes or dictates why that texture is important.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson strongly emphasizes observational skills and concrete, tactile learning—essential for first grade.\n- Students in grade 1 are developing phonemic awareness and early writing skills; keep written responses brief and support with drawings.\n- Safety reminder: Ensure tire samples are clean and safe; avoid sharp edges or rust.\n- The connection between texture, sound, and light keeps the lesson grounded in the photograph while meeting PS standards for vibration/sound and light/materials interactions.",
