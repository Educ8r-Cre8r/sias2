  "content": "# Engineering Design Challenge: Water Infrastructure & Erosion Control\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n\n- A blue metal water valve or utility box (marked with orange/yellow cap and signage) embedded in grass near a sidewalk\n- An orange and white traffic cone positioned on grass adjacent to a body of water\n- A concrete sidewalk/pathway on the left\n- A grassy embankment sloping toward the water on the right\n- A body of water (canal or retention pond) with visible water line and erosion at the bank edge\n- A wooden stake or post driven into the ground near the cone\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n\n- **From the erosion visible at the water's edge + the traffic cone placement**: The embankment is experiencing water erosion, and the cone signals a hazard or active maintenance zone. The utility box may control water flow, suggesting this is a managed water system (canal, stormwater, or drainage infrastructure).\n- **From the wooden stake + cone positioning**: Someone has attempted a temporary fix or is monitoring the erosion problem, implying the slope needs stabilization.\n- **From the sidewalk proximity to the water**: This is a public or residential area where erosion threatens infrastructure safety.\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2: Build a Soil Stopper**\n\nYour job is to **design a wall or fence that stops the dirt from washing into the water**. Use sticks, grass, small rocks, or clay to build a barrier on a slope. Test it by slowly pouring water down the slope. Does your barrier hold the soil in place? Can you make it stronger?\n\n---\n\n**3-5: Design an Embankment Stabilization System**\n\n**The Problem**: Water flow is eroding the grassy slope next to a canal, threatening nearby infrastructure.\n\n**Your Challenge**: Design and build a structure using natural and recycled materials (grass, sticks, stakes, cloth, sand, gravel, or cardboard) that:\n- Reduces soil loss when water flows down a tilted surface (your \"slope\")\n- Costs less than $5 in materials\n- Can be installed without heavy equipment\n- Remains stable for at least 3 simulated rainstorms (water poured from a pitcher)\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n- Measure and record soil loss before and after your design (weigh collected sediment or count particles).\n- Your barrier must not block water drainage entirely.\n- Sketch your design and explain why you chose those materials.\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis phase fits because the photo shows a *real-world problem* (visible erosion and a utility valve at risk) without showing a solution in place. Students must first understand *why* erosion is happening and *who* it affects (the municipality, people using the sidewalk, the ecosystem) before jumping to fixes. This grounds the engineering work in authentic need rather than abstract design.\n\n### Suggested Materials\n\n- Grass clippings or sod\n- Wooden stakes or dowels\n- Gravel and sand\n- Burlap or landscape fabric scraps\n- Cardboard or newspaper\n- Small branches or twigs\n- Soil or clay\n- Pitcher or spray bottle (for testing water flow)\n\n### Estimated Time\n\n- **K-2**: 40–50 minutes (design + 2–3 test rounds)\n- **3-5**: Two 45-minute sessions (Day 1: problem exploration, design, and build; Day 2: testing, measurement, redesign, and documentation)\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.A (defining engineering problems)** and **ETS1.B (developing possible solutions)** by having students identify a community infrastructure problem from a real photograph and prototype solutions with measurable outcomes that reflect actual practices in civil engineering and environmental management.",
