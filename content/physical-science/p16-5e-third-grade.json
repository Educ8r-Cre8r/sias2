ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph while introducing the concept of friction through real-world observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the salad with fried chicken\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Two small objects: one smooth (marble or small plastic ball) and one textured (small block of sandpaper or a Velcro patch)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph** (2 minutes): Project the image on the board or pass around printed copies. Ask students to look carefully at the different parts of the meal.\n\n2. **Engagement Questions** (8-10 minutes): Facilitate discussion with these specific questions:\n   - \"Look at the smooth, green lettuce and the bumpy, golden fried chicken. Which one do you think would slide across a table faster if you pushed it gently? Why?\"\n   - \"Feel these two objects I'm holding—one is smooth, one is bumpy. If I pushed them both on the table, which would go farther before stopping?\"\n   - \"Have you ever slipped on a smooth floor or struggled to slide on a bumpy carpet? What was different about each?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the bumpy fried chicken stays put on the plate, but a smooth olive would probably roll away?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt** (2-3 minutes): Say: \"I wonder if all bumpy things slide the same way, or if the bumps matter. Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be scientists and test how bumpy and smooth surfaces affect how things move. This special force that stops things from sliding easily is called friction, and we're going to investigate it!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover the relationship between surface texture and friction through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per pair/small group):**\n- 1 smooth surface (laminated paper, plastic sheet, or ceramic tile)\n- 1 rough surface (sandpaper, textured adhesive-backed paper, or fabric)\n- 1 smooth object to slide (marble, small wooden block, or button—no sharp edges)\n- Small ruler or measuring tape\n- Masking tape\n- Chart for recording data (pre-made by teacher)\n- Optional: ramp made from a folder or cardboard strip tilted on a book\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"With your partner, set up your smooth surface (like the plastic) on the table in front of you. Make a starting line with masking tape.\"\n\n2. \"Place your small object (the marble or button) at the starting line. Push it gently with the same amount of force each time. (Hint: Use your finger to give it a small push—not too hard!) How far does it slide before it stops? Measure with your ruler and write the distance on your chart.\"\n\n3. \"Repeat this two more times. Each time, use the same amount of push. What do you notice? Does it go the same distance each time?\"\n\n4. \"Now, replace the smooth surface with the rough/bumpy surface (sandpaper). Set the object at the starting line again.\"\n\n5. \"Push the object with the same gentle push you used before. How far does it slide this time? Measure and record.\"\n\n6. \"Do this two more times. Compare: Did the object slide farther on the smooth or bumpy surface?\"\n\n7. \"On your chart, draw or write: Which surface made your object slide the farthest? Which surface stopped it quickly?\"\n\n**How This Connects to the Photograph:**\n\"Just like the smooth lettuce and bumpy fried chicken in our picture, we tested smooth and bumpy surfaces. The bumpy surface acted like a stopping force, just like the bumpy chicken coating keeps the food from sliding off the plate!\"\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Distance the object slid on smooth surface (3 trials)\n- Distance the object slid on rough surface (3 trials)\n- A drawing or sentence: \"The smooth surface made the object slide ___ farther/less than the bumpy surface.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, observing their technique.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Are you pushing with the same force each time? How do you know?\" \n- Do NOT tell them which surface will win—let them discover it.\n- If groups finish early, ask: \"What if you used an even rougher surface? What would happen?\"\n- Ensure they're using consistent pushing force (this is the key variable).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should observe that the smooth surface allows the object to slide farther.\n- They should notice that the bumpy surface creates more resistance (friction) and stops the object sooner.\n- They should record measurements that show a clear difference.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to the concept of friction using the photograph and their data.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with recorded class data\n- Photograph of the salad displayed again\n- Word cards: \"Friction,\" \"Smooth,\" \"Rough,\" \"Force\"\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out** (8-10 minutes):\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their findings: \"What did you discover? Which surface made your object slide farther?\"\n   - Record their data on a large chart visible to all students.\n   - Ask: \"Did everyone get the same results? Why do you think that happened?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary** (5 minutes):\n   Say: \"You discovered something that scientists call **friction**. Friction is a special force that stops things from sliding easily. It happens when two surfaces rub against each other.\"\n\n3. **Key Vocabulary (Third Grade-Friendly Definitions):**\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Friction** | A force that slows things down when they slide across a surface |\n   | **Smooth** | A surface with no bumps; things slide easily on it |\n   | **Rough/Bumpy** | A surface with bumps; it creates more friction and stops things faster |\n   | **Force** | A push or pull that makes things move or stop |\n   | **Surface Texture** | How bumpy or smooth something feels |\n\n4. **Connect Back to the Photograph** (4-5 minutes):\n   - Point to the fried chicken: \"The bumpy coating creates friction. That's why it doesn't slide off the plate easily!\"\n   - Point to the lettuce: \"The smooth lettuce has less friction, so if you tilted the plate, it would slide faster than the chicken.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the chef put a bumpy coating on the chicken instead of a smooth one?\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding**:\n   Ask students to show thumbs up/middle/down to this question:\n   - \"If I gave a smooth ball and a bumpy ball the same push on a rug, which would stop first?\"\n   - Clarify any misconceptions: \"The bumpy ball experiences MORE friction from the rug, so it stops sooner.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define friction in their own words.\n- They understand that bumpy surfaces create more friction than smooth surfaces.\n- They connect their experiment to real-world objects (like food on a plate).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of friction to a new context and make predictions about real-world scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Varied materials (different textured papers, fabric, plastic wrap, aluminum foil)\n- Small rolling objects (marbles, buttons, or blocks)\n- Ramps (folders or cardboard strips tilted on books of varying heights)\n- Optional: pictures of real-world scenarios (stairs, playground slides, basketball court)\n- Prediction sheet with drawings\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: \"Design the Best Slide\" (Recommended)**\n\n1. Say: \"Imagine you're designing a playground slide. You want it to be safe, but also fun! If the slide is too slippery, kids go too fast. If it's too bumpy, they get stuck. Let's test different surfaces to find the best one.\"\n\n2. Provide students with 3-4 different material surfaces (smooth plastic, textured paper, fabric, etc.).\n\n3. \"Test each surface on your ramp. Roll your marble down and measure how far it goes. Which surface would make a good playground slide? Why?\"\n\n4. Students record: \"The BEST playground slide would be made of _______ because _______.\"\n\n5. Discuss as a class: \"Real playgrounds use smooth metal or plastic, but they're slightly bumpy so kids don't go TOO fast. Scientists and engineers think about friction when they design things!\"\n\n**Option B: \"Friction in Your Classroom\"**\n\n1. Ask students to hunt for examples of friction and no friction in the classroom:\n   - Smooth tile floors (low friction)\n   - Carpeted areas (high friction)\n   - Polished desks (low friction)\n   - Rubber-soled shoes (high friction)\n\n2. Students draw or list: \"Places with lots of friction\" and \"Places with less friction.\"\n\n3. Discuss: \"Why would a classroom have carpet in some places and tile in others?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to think about PURPOSE: Why does friction matter in different places?\n- Ask: \"If we wanted people to walk safely, would we use a smooth or bumpy floor?\"\n- Encourage predictions: \"If we made the surface EVEN bumpier, what would happen?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply friction concepts to design or real-world scenarios.\n- They make evidence-based predictions about how changing texture affects friction.\n- They begin to understand that friction can be good (safety) or \"bad\" (slowing us down when we want to go fast).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of friction and the relationship between surface texture and motion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore: Are they using consistent force? Recording accurate measurements?\n- Listen to explanations during Explain: Can they use the word \"friction\" correctly?\n- Monitor Elaborate: Do predictions show understanding of the concept?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment** (5 minutes):\n\nProvide each student with a simple assessment sheet with these questions/tasks:\n\n1. **Picture Task**: Show a drawing of three surfaces (smooth, slightly bumpy, very bumpy). \"Which surface would have the MOST friction? Circle it.\"\n\n2. **Prediction Question**: \"If you pushed a toy car on a smooth kitchen table and then on a bumpy rug, which would stop first?\" (Multiple choice: Table / Rug / They're the same)\n   - Follow-up: \"Why?\" (1-2 sentence explanation in their own words)\n\n3. **Application Question**: \"Why do soccer cleats have bumpy bottoms instead of smooth bottoms?\" (Accept answers showing understanding that bumps = more friction = better grip)\n\n4. **Drawing Task**: \"Draw a place where friction is helpful. Label it.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Correctly identifies that rough/bumpy surfaces create more friction\n- ✓ Predicts motion based on surface texture\n- ✓ Uses the word \"friction\" appropriately\n- ✓ Explains at least one real-world application (safety, grip, etc.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can identify rough surfaces as having more friction.\n- Most students can make a reasonable prediction about how texture affects motion.\n- Students show growing understanding that friction is useful in daily life.\n- Struggling students may need visual reminders or re-demonstration but can identify basic concepts.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce Variables**: Provide only TWO surfaces (smooth plastic and sandpaper). Remove the need to test multiple trials initially; start with one trial per surface, then repeat if successful.\n\n2. **Scaffolded Recording**: Give students a pre-filled chart with drawings of each surface. They only need to circle which one went farther or draw a simple bar graph (✓✓✓ vs. ✓✓) instead of writing measurements.\n\n3. **Hand-Over-Hand Guidance**: During Explore, sit with the pair and demonstrate the pushing motion together. Use a consistent cue like \"Push on the count of three\" to help them match their force.\n\n4. **Vocabulary Support**: Provide a picture word wall with \"Friction,\" \"Smooth,\" \"Rough\" with visual examples they can reference during the lesson.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Quantitative Prediction**: \"If the smooth surface made the marble go 24 cm, predict how far it will go on a surface that's twice as rough. Test your prediction and see how close you were!\"\n\n2. **Variables Investigation**: \"What if we changed the SIZE of the marble? Or tilted the surface at different angles? Would friction still work the same way? Design an experiment to test.\"\n\n3. **Real-World Problem Solving**: \"Skateboard parks have bumpy surfaces in some areas and smooth in others. Where would YOU put each type and why? Sketch your design and explain your thinking.\"\n\n4. **Friction in Nature**: \"Some animals have bumpy feet pads (like geckos). Others have smooth hooves (like horses). Research why different animals have different surfaces on their feet.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Friction Around Us\" Walk and Observe**:\n   Take students on a short walk around the school (hallway, gym, cafeteria, playground) with clipboards. Have them photograph or sketch surfaces and label them as \"High Friction,\" \"Low Friction,\" or \"Medium Friction.\" Back in class, create a class display or poster: \"Where is Friction in Our School?\"\n\n2. **Friction Challenge Game**:\n   Set up stations where students race small objects (toy cars, blocks) across different surfaces. Can they predict which will win? Time them with a stopwatch for a slightly more complex measurement activity.\n\n3. **Design a Safety Surface**:\n   Give students a real-world problem: \"The cafeteria floor is too slippery near the kitchen. Design a surface that would make it safer. Draw your design and explain why friction is important here.\"\n\n4. **Sticky Note Sorting**:\n   Place sticky notes with pictures of different surfaces and objects around the room (ice skating, basketball court, skateboard, bathroom tile, playground equipment, etc.). Have students sort them into \"High Friction\" and \"Low Friction\" and explain their choices.\n\n5. **Make a Friction Texture Book**:\n   Create a tactile book where pages have different textures (sandpaper, plastic, felt, foil). Students predict friction for each and record their observations.\n\n---\n\n## Final Teacher Notes\n\nThis lesson uses the concrete, observable differences in the photograph (smooth lettuce vs. bumpy fried chicken) as an entry point to the abstract concept of friction. Third graders learn best when they can SEE and FEEL the difference, then quantify it through simple measurement. The progression from observation → hands-on experiment → vocabulary → real-world application scaffolds their thinking perfectly.\n\n**Key Teaching Tips:**\n- Emphasize that students are **testing** the same force on different surfaces, not comparing different forces.\n- Use consistent language: \"friction makes things slow down\" rather than overly complex explanations.\n- Return to the photograph repeatedly—it anchors their learning in a visual they can relate to food and safety.\n- Celebrate their data even if it's messy; Third graders are just learning to collect evidence systematically.",
