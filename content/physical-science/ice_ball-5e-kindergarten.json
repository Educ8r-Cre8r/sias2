  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Ice Ball Investigation\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **States of Matter (Solid):** The frozen ice ball is a solid with a definite shape, visible through the clear, hard frozen water. Students can observe that solids don't flow or change shape easily.\n- **Effects of Temperature on Materials:** The ice demonstrates how water changes when it becomes very cold. Students can infer that the ice was created by freezing liquid water.\n- **Properties of Objects:** The ice ball has observable properties—it is smooth, hard, clear, and cold. These properties are different from liquid water or steam.\n- **Heat and Energy Transfer:** The visible frost patterns on the ice ball show where moisture from warmer air has interacted with the cold surface, demonstrating energy exchange.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**The Amazing Ice Ball: Exploring Cold and Solid Water**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 75–90 minutes (can be split into two 40-45 minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - K-PS3-1: Make observations to determine the effect of sunlight on Earth's surface\n  - K-PS3-2: Use tools and materials to design and build a structure that will reduce the warming effect of sunlight on an area\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Observe and describe** the properties of ice (cold, hard, clear, smooth) using their senses (except taste).\n2. **Make predictions** about what happens to ice when it is left in different locations (warm vs. cool areas).\n3. **Recognize that ice is frozen water** and that it melts when it gets warm.\n4. **Design a simple shelter or structure** to protect ice from sunlight and keep it cold longer.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the mysterious ice ball and activate prior knowledge about cold and freezing.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large photograph of ice ball (printed or displayed on screen)\n- Real ice ball or ice sphere (prepared in advance; can use water balloons frozen overnight or purchase novelty ice spheres)\n- Blue tray or plate (as shown in photo)\n- Paper towels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph.** Show the image of the ice ball on the blue tray and ask students to gather close (carpet time works well).\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions:**\n   - *\"What do you see in this picture? What is it?\"*\n   - *\"What color is it? Is it clear or cloudy?\"*\n   - *\"Do you think this is hard or soft? Why?\"*\n   - *\"Have you ever touched ice before? What does ice feel like?\"*\n\n3. **Introduce the real ice ball.** Slowly bring out a real ice ball (wrapped in a paper towel). Pass it around carefully so each child can hold it briefly and feel how cold it is. (Allow 2–3 seconds of contact; supervise carefully to avoid discomfort.)\n\n4. **Make a prediction prompt:** *\"I wonder what will happen to this ice ball if we leave it here in our warm classroom. Do you think it will stay the same, get bigger, get smaller, or disappear? Show me with your hands—big or small?\"*\n\n5. **Record predictions on a chart** with simple drawings or words (e.g., \"It stays,\" \"It melts,\" \"It gets smaller\").\n\n**Transition:** *\"Great thinking! Now let's investigate what actually happens to our ice ball. We're going to be ice scientists!\"*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students hands-on investigate how ice changes in different conditions and observe the effects of warmth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4–5 ice balls (frozen in advance; one per small group or pair)\n- Paper towels\n- Blue trays or shallow containers (as in photo)\n- Thermometers (optional, for older kindergarteners)\n- Plastic spoons\n- Timer or sand timer\n- Chart paper and markers for recording\n- Sunny windowsill area and shaded area (or classroom center)\n- Optional: ice melt observation sheets with simple pictures (sun = hot, shade = cool)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up two observation stations:**\n   - **Station A (Warm/Sunny):** Place an ice ball on a tray near a sunny windowsill or under a warm lamp.\n   - **Station B (Cool/Shaded):** Place an ice ball on a tray in a shaded, cool area of the classroom.\n\n2. **Divide students into two groups.** Each group starts at one station.\n\n3. **Give simple directions:**\n   - *\"Look at the ice ball. What do you see? Is it changing?\"*\n   - *\"Touch the tray under the ice—is it wet or dry?\"*\n   - *\"Watch what happens over the next few minutes.\"*\n   - *\"If you see water, use a spoon to scoop it. Where did the water come from?\"*\n\n4. **Students observe for 10–15 minutes,** rotating between stations if time allows. Have them mark a simple chart:\n   - Draw a picture of the ice ball at the start.\n   - Circle whether it's in the sun or shade.\n   - Draw a picture of what they see after 10 minutes.\n\n5. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask guiding questions:\n   - *\"Is the ice changing? How?\"*\n   - *\"Where is it warmer—here or there?\"*\n   - *\"What happened to the solid ice?\"*\n   - **Do not say \"it melted\"—let students discover this language in Explain.**\n\n6. **Expected student outcomes:**\n   - Ice in the warm/sunny area will melt faster and produce visible water pooling on the tray.\n   - Ice in the cool/shaded area will melt more slowly or remain mostly solid.\n   - Students will notice wetness and dripping.\n   - Students will begin to connect warmth with the ice's changes.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize concepts after hands-on discovery.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- The photograph (reference again)\n- Ice ball samples (partially melted from Explore)\n- Picture cards showing sun, ice, water, etc.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather for whole-group discussion.** Have students sit in a circle with the partially melted ice balls visible.\n\n2. **Share observations from Explore:**\n   - *\"What did you notice about the ice in the sunny spot?\"*\n   - *\"What about the ice in the shade?\"*\n   - *\"Where is the water coming from?\"*\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** (write on chart; use pictures):\n\n   | **Vocabulary** | **Kindergarten-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Ice** | Frozen water that is very cold and hard. |\n   | **Melt** | When ice gets warm and turns into water. |\n   | **Solid** | Something hard that keeps its shape, like ice. |\n   | **Sunlight/Warmth** | The sun's heat that makes things warm. |\n   | **Temperature** | How hot or cold something is. |\n\n4. **Make connections back to the photograph:**\n   - *\"This is what our ice ball looked like at the start—clear and solid.\"*\n   - *\"It was sitting in this blue tray, just like ours.\"*\n   - *\"Notice the frost on the ice—that's water vapor from the air that stuck to the cold ice.\"*\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Hold up a piece of ice. *\"Is this a solid or liquid?\"* (Solid.)\n   - *\"What will happen if we leave it in the sun?\"* (It will melt.)\n   - *\"What will it turn into?\"* (Water.)\n\n6. **Expected student outcomes:**\n   - Students understand that ice is frozen water.\n   - Students recognize that warmth and sunlight cause ice to melt.\n   - Students use the word \"melt\" correctly.\n   - Students distinguish between solid ice and liquid water.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their learning by designing a structure to protect ice from sunlight and heat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Ice balls (fresh, unmelted)\n- Blue trays\n- Building/shelter materials:\n  - White paper or white cloth (reflects sun)\n  - Cardboard boxes\n  - Aluminum foil\n  - Construction paper\n  - Foam cups or coolers\n  - Tape, stickers, markers\n- Optional: small parasols or umbrellas (toy size)\n- Observation sheet (simple pictures with labels)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Challenge statement:** *\"Ice melts when it's warm and sunny. Can you design a shelter or house for the ice ball to keep it safe from the sun and keep it cold longer? What materials could help?\"*\n\n2. **Brainstorm together:**\n   - *\"What keeps us cool? Shade! Can we make shade for the ice?\"*\n   - *\"What color reflects heat? White!\"*\n   - *\"What could we use as a roof or cover?\"*\n   - Accept all ideas without judgment.\n\n3. **Provide building materials.** Divide students into small groups (3–4 per group).\n\n4. **Students design and build a shelter** around or over an ice ball. Encourage creativity:\n   - A \"fort\" made from a box with a hole for the ice\n   - A paper tent over the ice\n   - A foil-wrapped \"sleeping bag\" for the ice\n   - An umbrella or shade cloth canopy\n\n5. **Place all structures in a warm, sunny location** (or near a lamp). Predict: *\"Which ice ball will stay frozen the longest?\"*\n\n6. **Observe after 15–20 minutes:**\n   - Which structures protected the ice best?\n   - Which ice melted the fastest?\n   - Why do students think that happened?\n\n7. **Teacher role:** \n   - Facilitate without solving problems for students.\n   - Ask: *\"What could we change to make it better?\"*\n   - Encourage testing and tinkering.\n\n8. **Expected student outcomes:**\n   - Students recognize that shade, white/light colors, and coverings slow ice melting.\n   - Students design with a purpose (protection from heat).\n   - Students test their designs and observe results.\n   - Students begin to understand that design matters.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of states of matter, heat effects, and design thinking.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore and Elaborate:\n  - ☐ Student uses sensory language to describe ice (cold, hard, smooth, clear)\n  - ☐ Student makes observations about ice melting\n  - ☐ Student uses word \"melt\" or \"melted\" correctly\n  - ☐ Student connects warmth/sun to ice changes\n  - ☐ Student attempts to design a shelter with protective intent\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nChoose one or combine multiple:\n\n1. **Picture sorting:** Show images of ice, water, and other objects. *\"Point to the ice. Point to the water. Which one melted?\"*\n\n2. **Verbal response:** Ask each student individually:\n   - *\"What is ice made of?\"* (Frozen water.)\n   - *\"What happens when ice gets warm?\"* (It melts.)\n   - *\"What could you put over ice to keep it cold?\"* (Shade, white cloth, etc.)\n\n3. **Simple drawing:** *\"Draw the ice ball from our picture. Now draw what happened to it after it sat in the warm classroom.\"*\n\n4. **Demonstration:** Show a piece of ice. *\"Show me with your hands what the ice will do in the sun.\"* (Students mime melting/dripping motion.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies ice as frozen water.\n- ✓ Student explains that warmth/sunlight causes ice to melt.\n- ✓ Student demonstrates understanding that materials/design can reduce melting.\n- ✓ Student uses descriptive words for ice properties.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80–90% of students will accurately describe ice as cold and hard.\n- 75–85% of students will explain that sun/warmth melts ice.\n- 70–80% of students will recognize that shade or coverings slow melting.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**SUPPORT (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Sensory-focused exploration:** Allow more time for students to touch and hold ice (with supervision) before abstract observation. Use high-contrast, simple images and fewer vocabulary words. Focus only on \"ice\" and \"water.\"\n\n2. **Hand-over-hand guidance:** For building the shelter, provide a model structure first (e.g., a box with a lid already made). Ask students to place materials on it or decorate it, rather than designing from scratch.\n\n3. **Simplified questioning:** Ask yes/no questions instead of open-ended ones:\n   - *\"Is ice cold?\"* (Yes.)\n   - *\"Does the sun make ice warm?\"* (Yes.)\n   - *\"Will the ice melt?\"* (Yes.)\n\n4. **Buddy system:** Pair struggling students with confident peers during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n\n---\n\n**CHALLENGE (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Predict and test:** Have students make specific predictions about melt rates:\n   - *\"Will the ice in the box melt in 5 minutes or 10 minutes?\"*\n   - Provide simple timers; let them measure melt time and compare results.\n\n2. **Material investigation:** Provide multiple material options and ask: *\"Which material is the best at protecting ice? Why do you think so?\"* Challenge them to test two different coverings.\n\n3. **Temperature exploration:** If thermometers are available, have students check the temperature near the sheltered ice vs. the uncovered ice. Ask: *\"Which area is cooler?\"*\n\n4. **Engineering redesign:** After the first shelter melts, ask: *\"If we could redesign this shelter to be even better, what would we change? Why?\"*\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Freezing Exploration (Follow-up Lesson):**\n   - Reverse the process! Place cups of water in the freezer overnight.\n   - Ask: *\"How can we turn water back into ice?\"* (Freeze it with cold.)\n   - Observe the process over several days. Introduce the idea that cold temperatures make ice form.\n   - Connect to natural contexts: *\"In winter, puddles freeze. In summer, they melt.\"*\n\n2. **Real-World Application: Ice Cream Science**\n   - Make simple ice cream or popsicles in small cups using ice, salt, and cream.\n   - Students observe ice melting as they make a treat.\n   - Discuss: *\"Why does ice keep ice cream cold?\"* Reinforce heat transfer concepts.\n   - Food safety note: Use food-grade materials only; supervise closely.\n\n3. **Water Cycle Connection (if time allows):**\n   - Create a simple water cycle demonstration:\n     - Freeze water (ice formation—solid).\n     - Let ice melt (melting—liquid water).\n     - Place water in sunlight and cover with a plastic bag to see condensation (gas—water vapor).\n   - Use simple vocabulary: *\"Ice → Water → Air.\"*\n   - Relate to evaporation, condensation, and the cycle.\n\n4. **Shelter Design Challenge (Outdoor Application):**\n   - On a warm day, take shelters outside. Protect real ice balls from actual sunlight.\n   - Make it a competition: *\"Which shelter keeps ice the coldest?\"*\n   - Discuss real-world applications: *\"How do we keep things cold in summer? (Shade, ice boxes, coolers.)\"*\n\n5. **Art Connection: Frozen Fractals**\n   - Observe the frost patterns and crystal formations on the ice ball from the photograph.\n   - Create frost patterns with white paint or salt on dark paper.\n   - Discuss: *\"Where do these patterns come from?\"* (Cold air + moisture creating crystals.)\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Safety:** Always supervise ice handling. Kindergarteners should hold ice for only a few seconds to avoid discomfort or pain. Provide paper towels immediately after.\n- **Preparation:** Freeze ice balls 24 hours in advance. Use silicone molds, water balloons, or purchase novelty ice spheres.\n- **Timing:** This lesson naturally spans 2 days. Day 1: Engage + Explore. Day 2: Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate.\n- **Vocabulary building:** Use the photograph repeatedly throughout the lesson to anchor learning visually.\n- **Connection to NGSS:** This lesson directly addresses K-PS3-1 (observation of sunlight effects) and K-PS3-2 (designing structures to reduce warming). It builds foundational understanding of heat, temperature, and material properties.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is concrete, hands-on, and deeply rooted in observable phenomena from the photograph. Kindergarteners will develop genuine curiosity about ice, water, and heat through sensory exploration and purposeful design challenges.",
