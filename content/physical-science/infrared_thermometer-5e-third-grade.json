ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about temperature and heat using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the infrared thermometer on the brick surface (projected or printed large)\n- Chart paper and marker\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or as a printed poster where all students can see clearly. Point to the thermometer and ask: *\"What do you think this tool is doing?\"* Allow 2–3 student responses without judgment.\n\n2. **Ask discovery questions** (pause for 5–10 seconds of thinking time after each):\n   - *\"This special thermometer is pointing at the bricks, but it's not touching them. What do you think it's measuring?\"*\n   - *\"The thermometer shows 113.5 degrees. What does that number tell us?\"*\n   - *\"Why do you think the brick might be so hot? Look at the shadows on the ground—what does that tell you about the sun?\"*\n   - *\"If we measured a shady brick right next to this sunny brick, what do you predict would happen?\"*\n\n3. **Create a Wonder Chart:** Write student predictions and questions on chart paper. Examples: *\"Is the thermometer hot?\" \"Why can it tell temperature without touching?\" \"What's the coldest thing in our room?\"*\n\n4. **Hook statement:** *\"Today, we're going to become Heat Detectives. We're going to use a special thermometer—just like the one in this picture—to hunt for the warmest and coolest places in our classroom. We'll be scientists finding evidence about heat and energy!\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Let's start our investigation by making predictions about where heat might be hiding in our classroom.\"*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate temperature variations in the classroom and discover factors that affect heat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 non-contact infrared thermometer (or 2–3 if available for groups) OR standard classroom thermometers if infrared unavailable\n- Worksheet with 6 picture boxes showing different classroom locations (sunny windowsill, shaded corner, near heater/vent, classroom door, inside a dark closet, near a light)\n- Pencils\n- Small sticky notes (optional, for labeling)\n- Data collection sheet with simple table: Location | Predicted Temperature (hot/warm/cool/cold) | Actual Temperature | Why?\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Model one measurement:** Before students begin, demonstrate how to use the thermometer safely. Show how to point it at a surface (not a person), wait for the reading to stabilize, and read the number. Emphasize: *\"We never point this at eyes. We point it at things like walls, windows, and desks.\"*\n\n2. **Assign Heat Detective locations:** Divide students into pairs or groups of 3. Assign each group 1–2 different classroom locations to investigate:\n   - Sunny windowsill\n   - Shaded corner away from windows\n   - Near a heating vent or air return\n   - Outside the classroom door (in hallway)\n   - Near a lamp or light source\n   - Inside a closed cabinet or dark area\n\n3. **Student investigation steps:**\n   - Make a **prediction** for each location: *\"Do you think this spot will be hot, warm, cool, or cold? Why?\"* (Record on worksheet)\n   - **Measure the temperature** at the assigned location using the thermometer.\n   - **Record the actual temperature number** on the data sheet.\n   - **Discuss with your partner:** *\"Was your prediction right? Why do you think this spot is hotter or cooler?\"*\n   - **Draw or describe** what might make that location warmer or cooler (e.g., \"Sun shines here,\" \"This is in shadow,\" \"Hot air comes from the vent\").\n\n4. **Circulate and listen:** The teacher moves between groups, asking guiding questions:\n   - *\"What are you noticing? Is this spot as hot as you thought?\"*\n   - *\"What could be making this place warm/cool? Look around—do you see any clues?\"*\n   - *\"Does this place have sunlight? A heater nearby? Is it in shadow?\"*\n   - **Do NOT tell students** why places are warm or cool; help them observe and wonder instead.\n\n**Teacher Role:** Facilitate without giving answers. Ask questions that direct student attention to observable clues (sunlight, shadows, vents, windows, etc.). Ensure safe thermometer use. Help students record data accurately.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students collect temperature data from multiple classroom locations.\n- Students make simple observations about what might affect temperature (sunlight, shade, vents, etc.).\n- Students record predictions and compare them to actual measurements, noticing surprises or confirmations.\n- Data sheet shows 4–6 locations with predicted and actual temperatures.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to the science of heat and thermal energy.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words written out\n- Completed data sheets from Explore phase\n- Simple diagram showing sunlight → brick → heat (draw on board or use poster)\n- The original photograph\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather as a whole group** around the compiled data from all Heat Detective teams.\n\n2. **Share findings together:**\n   - Call on groups to report their temperature measurements.\n   - Create a class \"hottest to coolest\" list on the board.\n   - Ask: *\"Which locations were warmest? Which were coolest? What did all the warm places have in common? What about the cool places?\"*\n   - Guide students to notice patterns: *\"Sunny spots are warmer. Shady spots are cooler. Places near heaters are warmer.\"*\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** using student-friendly language and the photograph as reference:\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition | Example from Our Investigation |\n   |------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n   | **Temperature** | How hot or cold something is; we measure it with numbers. | The brick on the photograph was 113.5 degrees—that's very hot! |\n   | **Heat** or **Thermal Energy** | The energy that makes things warm. It comes from sunlight, fires, heaters, and lights. | The sun's heat made the brick in the picture warm. |\n   | **Sunlight** | Light and energy that come from the sun. | The sunny windowsill in our room was warmer because sunlight shines on it. |\n   | **Absorb** | To take in or soak up. Dark and solid things absorb heat. | The dark brick in the photo absorbed (took in) the sun's heat, so it became very hot. |\n   | **Thermometer** | A tool that measures temperature and shows the number on a screen or scale. | The infrared thermometer in the photo can measure heat without touching anything. |\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - *\"Remember the thermometer pointing at the brick? That brick was so hot because the sun was shining on it all day. The brick absorbed the sun's heat energy. The thermometer showed us that heat with a number—113.5 degrees!\"*\n   - *\"In our classroom, we found that sunny spots were hotter and shady spots were cooler. That's because sunlight brings heat energy, just like in the photo.\"*\n\n5. **Check for understanding using a simple strategy:**\n   - **Think-Pair-Share:** Ask *\"Why do you think a black car gets hotter in the sun than a silver car?\"* Students think, discuss with a partner, then share ideas. Listen for use of vocabulary: \"absorb,\" \"heat,\" \"sunlight,\" \"dark.\"\n   - Ask yes/no verification questions: *\"Is a thermometer a tool that measures temperature? Does sunlight bring heat energy? Do shady places have less heat than sunny places?\"*\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (to display):**\n- **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is (measured with numbers).\n- **Heat/Thermal Energy:** The energy that makes things warm.\n- **Sunlight:** Light and energy from the sun.\n- **Absorb:** To take in or soak up heat.\n- **Thermometer:** A tool that measures and shows temperature.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary words (temperature, heat, sunlight, absorb) to describe their observations.\n- Students explain that sunlight carries heat energy.\n- Students recognize that dark or solid materials absorb heat more readily.\n- Students understand that a thermometer measures temperature using numbers.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply heat energy concepts to a new scenario and deepen understanding through prediction and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4–5 different materials or objects: black construction paper, white construction paper, aluminum foil, a plastic cup, a wooden block\n- Thermometer(s)\n- Sunny windowsill or lamp providing consistent light\n- Timer or stopwatch\n- Worksheet: \"Will It Get Hot?\" with prediction and observation columns\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce a new challenge:** *\"Now that we're Heat Detectives, we have a mystery. We're going to find out which materials absorb heat the fastest. Which materials will get the hottest when sunlight shines on them?\"*\n\n2. **Make predictions:** Show students the 4–5 materials. Ask each student to predict (on their worksheet or verbal share): *\"Which material do you think will get the hottest? Why? Which will stay coolest? Why?\"*\n   - Prompt thinking: *\"Is it dark or light? Is it shiny or dull? What color is it?\"*\n\n3. **Conduct a fair test:**\n   - Place all materials in the same sunny location (windowsill or under a lamp).\n   - Measure the temperature of each material at the start (0 minutes).\n   - Wait 10–15 minutes.\n   - Measure the temperature of each material again.\n   - Record which one got hottest and which stayed coolest.\n\n4. **Discuss findings:**\n   - *\"Which material absorbed the most heat? Which absorbed the least? Why do you think that is?\"*\n   - *\"Did your prediction match what really happened? What surprised you?\"*\n   - Connect to real world: *\"Why do you think people wear dark clothes in winter and light clothes in summer? Why are car covers often white or silver?\"*\n\n5. **Create a class conclusion:** *\"Dark, solid materials absorb heat from sunlight more than light or shiny materials do. This is why dark things get hotter in the sun!\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:** Facilitate the fair test (keep conditions the same for all materials). Ask students to explain *why* they think certain materials absorbed more heat. Validate all observations and connect to heat energy concepts. Help students articulate that material properties (color, texture) affect how much heat is absorbed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students predict which materials will absorb the most heat based on observable properties (color, texture).\n- Students measure and compare temperatures of different materials.\n- Students explain that dark materials absorb more heat than light materials.\n- Students apply the concept of heat absorption to real-world examples (clothing, vehicle covers).\n- Students show understanding that heat energy from sunlight can be transferred to different materials at different rates.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of temperature, heat energy, and factors affecting thermal changes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Monitor student predictions and observations. Do they notice relationships between sunlight, shadows, and temperature?\n- **Listen during Explain:** Do students use vocabulary words (temperature, heat, thermometer, sunlight, absorb) when discussing their findings?\n- **Observe during Elaborate:** Can students make reasonable predictions about which materials will absorb heat? Do they explain their reasoning using concepts learned?\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (paper or digital) with 3 questions:\n\n1. **Show a picture of a sunny beach and ask:** *\"Why do you think the sand feels hot on your feet at the beach? Use the word 'heat' or 'absorb' in your answer.\"*\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student mentions heat or thermal energy, sunlight, or absorption. Example: *\"The sand absorbs the sun's heat, so it gets very hot.\"*\n\n2. **Ask:** *\"If you put a thermometer in a dark closet and another thermometer in a sunny window, which one would show a higher number? Why?\"*\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student correctly identifies the sunny window as warmer and gives a reason related to sunlight or heat. Example: *\"The sunny window because sunlight brings heat.\"*\n\n3. **Ask:** *\"What is a thermometer? What does it do?\"*\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student identifies the thermometer as a tool that measures temperature. Example: *\"It measures how hot or cold something is and shows a number.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 2 out of 3 exit ticket questions answered with understanding of heat concepts.\n- Student uses or understands vocabulary: temperature, heat, thermometer, sunlight, absorb.\n- Student makes simple cause-and-effect connections (e.g., sunlight → heat → warm objects).\n- Student applies learning to new scenarios (beach sand, different locations).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified data collection:** Provide a picture-based data sheet instead of writing. Students circle or point to: hot, warm, cool, or cold for each location (no numbers required). Teacher or aide records actual temperatures.\n\n2. **Paired investigation:** Always pair struggling students with a strong partner or adult. The partner/adult reads the thermometer; the student predicts and makes observations using guiding questions: *\"Is this place sunny or shady?\" \"Do you feel warm or cool here?\"*\n\n3. **Vocabulary support:** Create a visual vocabulary anchor chart with pictures and words. Point to words during discussion. Use consistent language repeatedly (e.g., always say \"heat energy\" not just \"heat\" to reinforce the concept).\n\n---\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Quantitative analysis:** Ask advanced students to calculate the *difference* between predicted and actual temperatures, or the temperature *change* over 15 minutes during the Elaborate phase. Ask: *\"Which material heated up the fastest? How many degrees hotter did it get?\"*\n\n2. **Investigate variables:** Have advanced students design their own fair test. Example: *\"What happens to temperature if we cover a sunny spot with shade cloth for part of the time? Does temperature stay the same or change?\"* Guide them to control variables and make predictions.\n\n3. **Real-world research:** Ask: *\"Why do houses in hot climates have light-colored roofs? Research and explain using what you learned about absorption.\"* Students can draw a diagram showing why light colors reflect heat and dark colors absorb it.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Thermal Image Gallery Walk:** Collect infrared images of different objects and spaces (simple drawings or real photos). Create a classroom \"gallery\" where students visit each image, predict the temperature based on the object (e.g., ice cream vs. sidewalk), and record predictions. Compare predictions to actual data. Reinforce that different materials have different temperatures.\n\n2. **Shadow Study Project:** Have students trace shadows in the classroom at different times of day (morning, midday, afternoon). Measure temperatures in shadowed areas vs. sunny areas at each time. Create a chart showing how temperature changes as the sun moves. Connect to sunlight's role in heating.\n\n3. **Home Heat Detective:** Send home a simple \"Temperature Hunt\" sheet for families. Students measure temperatures at home in 4 locations (bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, outside). They create a bar graph comparing indoor and outdoor temperatures and explain why they're different. Share findings in class and compare across households.\n\n---\n\n### Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **If you don't have an infrared thermometer:** Standard liquid or digital thermometers work fine. While they require contact with objects, students can still observe temperature differences across locations and notice patterns related to sunlight and materials.\n- **Safety:** Emphasize that thermometers are tools, not toys. Students should never put them in mouths or point them at faces. Model correct use once before investigating.\n- **Timing:** If your school day is limited, split this into two sessions: Engage + Explore on Day 1, Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2.\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Use the same terms consistently throughout the lesson. Write them on the board and refer back to them often.\n- **Celebrate curiosity:** This lesson naturally generates lots of student questions. Honor them! Say: *\"That's a great question—let's investigate that!\" or \"We'll explore that idea when we become even better Heat Detectives.\"*",
