Describe how vibrations from a force (like breath or striking) create sound.\n2. Explain that sound travels as energy waves through air.\n3. Predict how changing the force applied to an object affects the sound it produces.\n4. Compare the sounds made by different objects and materials.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about sound and musical instruments.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (or projected image) of brass band students performing\n- Audio recording of brass instruments playing (30 seconds; download from YouTube or school music library)\n- Small handheld drum or tambourine\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the large photo of the brass band performing on stage. Ask students to sit in a circle so all can see clearly.\n\n2. **Play a Sound Clip:** Before revealing the photo's context, play a 20-30 second audio clip of a brass band or trumpet solo. Ask: *\"What do you hear?\"*\n\n3. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What instruments do you see in this picture? Can you name any?\"\n   - \"Do you think these instruments make sounds the same way, or different ways?\"\n   - \"What do you think has to happen inside the instrument to make a loud sound?\"\n   - \"What do you think is happening when the musician blows into the trumpet?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what has to happen inside an instrument to make the sound travel all the way to the back of the room so everyone can hear it. What do YOU wonder?\"\n\n5. **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Pass around the small drum. Let 2-3 students tap it gently and then firmly. Ask: \"Did you notice a difference? Which tap made more sound? Why do you think that happened?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to be scientists and discover how sounds get made—just like in this band picture. We'll experiment with making vibrations, and you'll see how vibrations create sound!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how forces create vibrations and vibrations create sound.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 rubber band\n- 1 small tin can or plastic cup\n- 1 wooden ruler or craft stick\n- 1 small piece of rice or dried beans (about 10-15 pieces)\n- 1 sheet of white paper\n- 1 tuning fork (or substitute: metal spoon)\n- Water in a small dish\n- Plastic wrap\n- Optional: aluminum foil, different rubber bands (different thicknesses)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station 1: Vibration Viewer**\n\n1. Stretch a rubber band tightly across the opening of a tin can or plastic cup.\n2. Place a small piece of plastic wrap loosely over the rubber band (do NOT tape it).\n3. Sprinkle 8-10 grains of rice onto the plastic wrap.\n4. Pluck the rubber band gently, then harder, and observe what happens to the rice.\n5. Record on your \"Sound Scientist Sheet\" (provided): *Does the rice move? Does it move MORE when you pluck harder or softer?*\n\n**Station 2: Ruler Vibrations**\n\n1. Place a ruler flat on a table so that half of it hangs off the edge.\n2. Hold the table end down firmly.\n3. Press down on the free end and let it go—it will vibrate up and down.\n4. Listen to the sound it makes.\n5. Try pressing down harder, then softer. Record: *Does the sound change? Is it louder or softer when you push harder?*\n\n**Station 3: Tuning Fork Explorer**\n\n1. Strike the tuning fork gently against a soft object (rubber mallet or rubber ball—NOT hard surfaces).\n2. Quickly dip the vibrating fork into water and observe.\n3. Listen to the sound closely.\n4. Strike it again and hold it near your ear (carefully—not inside!).\n5. Record: *What did you see happen in the water? Did the fork feel like it was moving?*\n\n**Station 4: Cup Speaker**\n\n1. Poke a small hole in the bottom of a cup.\n2. Thread a string through the hole and tie a knot inside so it doesn't pull through.\n3. Hold the cup to your ear while a partner gently plucks the string.\n4. Experiment with plucking softly and hard.\n5. Record: *Could you hear the sound better in the cup? Did harder plucking make a bigger sound?*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to each station and ask guiding questions: *\"What did you observe? Did the vibrations get bigger or smaller when you used more force?\"* Do NOT tell students vibrations cause sound—let them discover it.\n- Ensure students record observations, not just drawings.\n- Encourage students to try variations: *\"What if you use a thicker rubber band?\" \"What if you press the ruler down more?\"*\n- Redirect students focused on \"fun\" back to observations: *\"Yes, that IS fun! What happened to the sound when you did that?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe that:\n  - Rice bounces/moves when rubber band vibrates\n  - Ruler makes sound when it vibrates up and down\n  - Tuning fork creates ripples in water (visible vibration)\n  - More force = bigger vibrations = louder sound\n  - Vibrations seem connected to sound production\n- Students record descriptions and simple drawings showing relationships between force, vibration, and sound.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to the photograph and sound concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph again\n- Chart paper and markers (or whiteboard)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures (optional)\n- Audio clip of trumpet again (brief)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 groups to share ONE observation from their station.\n   - Record observations on chart paper under headings: *\"What Moved?\"* *\"What We Heard\"* *\"What Made It Happen\"*\n   - Guide students toward pattern recognition: *\"I notice that in EVERY station, something was moving really fast. What was moving?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   Use the photograph and a simple demonstration to introduce each term.\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   \n   - **Vibration**: When something moves back and forth super fast, over and over. (Demonstration: pluck a ruler again; students watch it wobble.)\n   \n   - **Force**: A push or a pull that makes something move or change. (Ask: \"What force did you use when you pushed the ruler? What force does the trumpet player use?\" *Answer: breath/air pressure*)\n   \n   - **Sound Wave**: Invisible energy that travels through the air from a vibrating object. It moves away from the source like ripples in water. (Draw ripples on board.)\n   \n   - **Energy**: The ability to make something move or change. Sound is a type of energy.\n   \n   - **Amplitude**: How big the vibrations are. BIG vibrations = LOUDER sound. Small vibrations = SOFTER sound. (Show with hand: small wiggle vs. big wiggle)\n\n3. **Connect to Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Show the brass band photo again.\n   - Point to a trumpet player: *\"When the musician blows into the trumpet, that breath is a FORCE. The force makes a part inside the trumpet vibrate very fast. Those vibrations create SOUND WAVES that travel through the air to your ears. Look at all these musicians making vibrations at the same time—their SOUND WAVES mix together!\"*\n   - Play the trumpet audio again: *\"You're hearing sound waves created by vibrations!\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If I blow gently into a trumpet, what do you predict will happen to the vibrations—will they be big or small? Will the sound be loud or soft?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"When that drummer in the back strikes the bass drum HARD, what's the force doing? What does that force create?\"*\n   - Listen for student responses using new vocabulary.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Chart** (posted in room):\n\n| Term | Definition | Picture/Example |\n|------|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Vibration** | Something moving back and forth very fast | Ruler wobbling up and down |\n| **Force** | A push or pull that makes things move | Breath into trumpet; tap on drum |\n| **Sound Wave** | Invisible energy traveling through air from vibrations | Ripples in water |\n| **Energy** | The ability to make something move or change | Heat from sun; movement of musicians |\n| **Amplitude** | How big the vibrations are (affects loudness) | Small shake = quiet; big shake = loud |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students use the word \"vibration\" to explain how sound is made.\n- Students understand that force causes vibrations.\n- Students recognize that bigger vibrations = louder sound.\n- Students can point to the photograph and explain what's creating sound waves.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply vibration and force concepts to a real-world challenge and make predictions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4 identical glasses or cups\n- Water\n- Spoon\n- Ruler (from earlier)\n- Rubber bands (various thicknesses)\n- String\n- Optional: straws, wooden dowels\n\n**Activity: Sound Scientist Challenge**\n\n**Scenario:** *\"A third-grade band just started at your school! But the instruments are being delivered in a mystery box, and the students can't LOOK inside—they can only LISTEN. Can you help them figure out which instruments are in the box by predicting what sounds they'll make?\"*\n\n**Part 1: Predict (5 minutes)**\n\nDisplay the materials (rubber bands, ruler, glass, water, spoon). Explain:\n*\"We're going to make different vibrations using these materials. Your job is to PREDICT: Which one do you think will make the LOUDEST sound? Which one will make the QUIETEST sound? Why?\"*\n\n- Have students discuss with a partner and record one prediction.\n- Ask 2-3 students to share reasoning (listen for cause-and-effect thinking).\n\n**Part 2: Test & Compare (8 minutes)**\n\nDemonstrate or allow groups to test:\n\n1. **Rubber Band Thickness**: Pluck a thin rubber band, then a thick one. *Which vibrates faster? Which sounds higher or lower?*\n\n2. **Water Glass**: Strike a glass filled with a small amount of water with a spoon, then a glass with more water. *Does the amount of water change the sound?*\n\n3. **Ruler Depth**: Press the ruler down a little bit and let go; then press it down a LOT more and let go. *Which one vibrates bigger? Which is louder?*\n\n- Have students record observations about which made louder/softer sounds.\n\n**Part 3: Real-World Application (4 minutes)**\n\n*\"Now think about the musicians in that brass band photo. If a trumpet player wanted to play a REALLY LOUD note for the finale, what would they have to do?\"*\n\n- Expected answer: Blow harder, create bigger vibrations with more force.\n\n*\"And if they wanted to play softly during a sad part of the song?\"*\n\n- Expected answer: Blow gently, create smaller vibrations with less force.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Ask questions rather than give answers: *\"What do you notice about the sound?\" \"Did the force change the vibration?\"*\n- Guide students to understand that controlling force = controlling volume.\n- Connect each test back to the photograph: *\"The trumpet player is doing something like this—using breath force to create vibrations.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students apply force concepts to predict sound outcomes.\n- Students recognize that thicker rubber bands, more water, and bigger ruler movements create different sounds.\n- Students explain that musicians control volume by changing the force they apply.\n- Students use vocabulary from Explain phase in new contexts.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of vibrations, force, and sound.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore stations: Are they noticing relationships between force and vibration?\n- Listen to vocabulary use during group share-out: Are they using \"vibration,\" \"force,\" \"sound wave\" correctly?\n- Review student recordings from Explore: Do they show cause-and-effect thinking?\n\n**Summative Assessment: \"Sound Detective\" Exit Ticket**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (1 page) with these items:\n\n**Question 1 (Multiple Choice):**\n*When you pluck a rubber band hard, what happens?*\n- A) The rubber band vibrates slowly and quietly\n- B) The rubber band vibrates fast and big, and makes a loud sound\n- C) The rubber band doesn't vibrate at all\n- D) The rubber band vibrates, but sound doesn't travel\n\n**Question 2 (Short Answer with Picture):**\n*Draw a trumpet player taking a deep breath and blowing hard into the trumpet. Label where the vibrations happen and draw an arrow showing where the sound wave goes.*\n\n**Question 3 (Application):**\n*A drummer wants to make a LOUD boom on the bass drum. Should the drummer hit the drum gently or HIT IT HARD? Explain why, using the word \"force\" or \"vibration.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- **Proficient:** Student selects correct answer in Q1, draws vibrations in instrument and sound waves traveling outward in Q2, and explains in Q3 using \"force\" or \"vibration\" and cause-effect reasoning.\n- **Developing:** Student may select correct answer in Q1, draw trumpet but unclear about vibration location in Q2, and provides partial explanation in Q3 without full vocabulary use.\n- **Beginning:** Student struggles with multiple-choice, drawings lack connection to vibration/sound, minimal explanation in Q3.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- 80%+ of students correctly identify the relationship between force and sound volume.\n- Students can draw and label vibrations and sound waves.\n- Students can explain (in writing or speech) how musicians use force to control sound.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Cards:** Provide picture cards with single words and images (Vibration = picture of shaking object; Force = picture of push/pull arrow). Students can reference during activities and assessments.\n\n2. **Partner Investigations:** Pair struggling students with confident peers during Explore stations. The partner can model recording observations while the student focuses on the sensory experience and asking \"why\" questions.\n\n3. **Sentence Starters for Explanations:** Provide frames for verbal or written responses:\n   - *\"When I pushed hard, the _____ vibrated and made a _____ sound.\"*\n   - *\"The force was _____ (big/small), so the sound was _____ (loud/quiet).\"*\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Pitch Investigation:** Introduce the concept of pitch by having advanced students investigate how CHANGING the material (not just force) affects sound. Example: *\"Compare the sound of a thin rubber band to a thick rubber band plucked with the same force. What's different? Why?\"* This introduces the idea that vibration SPEED (frequency) affects pitch, not just loudness.\n\n2. **Design Challenge:** *\"Design a musical instrument using only materials from the classroom (paper cups, rubber bands, straws, water). Your instrument must be able to make both a LOUD sound and a SOFT sound by changing force, and it must make at least TWO different pitches.\"* Students apply force and vibration concepts to design and build.\n\n3. **Explain Sound Reflection:** Ask: *\"When the band plays on stage, where does the sound go? Can sound bounce? Do you think the walls help make the sound louder?\"* Introduce the idea that sound can reflect off hard surfaces—a bridge to Wave properties in later grades.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom Instrument Orchestra:** Students create simple instruments (rubber band guitars on boxes, water-glass xylophones, paper-cup drums, straw flutes). Organize a mini-concert where students control volume by adjusting force and explain their results to the class. *(Reinforces: force, vibration, sound energy; engages kinesthetic and musical learners)*\n\n2. **Sound Wave Investigation Chart:** Create a class chart documenting different sounds students find around the school (cafeteria, hallway, playground). For each sound, students record: *What is vibrating? How hard is it vibrating? Is it loud or soft? Why?* *(Reinforces: applying concepts to real world; observational skills)*\n\n3. **Musician Interview Project:** Invite a school band or orchestra member (or show a video interview) to demonstrate their instrument. Students ask: *\"What force do you use to make your sound?\" \"How do you make it louder?\" \"How do you make it softer?\"* Students document answers using vocabulary from the lesson. *(Reinforces: real-world application; community connection; vocabulary use)*\n\n4. **Vibration Art:** Students use tuning forks or singing bowls to vibrate paint or salt on paper, creating visual representations of vibrations and sound waves. *(Multi-sensory reinforcement; artistic expression)*\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety Reminders:** Ensure tuning forks are struck gently (not on hard surfaces) to avoid damage. Water activities should use small amounts; have towels nearby. Rubber bands should be inspected for tears before use.\n\n- **Classroom Management:** Explore stations may be loud! Set a \"sound signal\" (hand raise, bell) to pause investigations when you need attention. Remind students: *\"Scientists listen carefully to their data—that means we listen to the sounds we're making to learn from them!\"*\n\n- **Vocabulary Support:** Post the vocabulary chart throughout the lesson and reference it repeatedly. Third graders benefit from seeing, hearing, and saying words multiple times.\n\n- **Real-World Connection:** The brass band photograph is your anchor throughout. Return to it frequently: *\"Remember those musicians? Today we figured out how THEY make their sounds!\"*\n\n- **Assessment Flexibility:** If students struggle with written exit tickets, allow verbal responses or drawings with verbal explanations. The goal is understanding, not writing proficiency.",
