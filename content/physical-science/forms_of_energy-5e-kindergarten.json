ENGAGE (10-12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the train and car.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph printed or displayed on screen (large enough for all students to see clearly)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** by projecting it on the board or showing a large printed version. Allow students 30 seconds of quiet observation.\n\n2. **Ask specific discussion questions calibrated to kindergarten level:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Point to the big thing and the small thing.\"\n   - \"Which one do you think would be easier for you to push with your hand—the train or the car?\"\n   - \"What makes the train move? What makes the car move?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a real train or car? Tell your neighbor about it.\"\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder which one needs a bigger push to move it. Let's find out!\" Record student predictions on chart paper with simple drawings or words.\n\n4. **Notice:** Highlight that both vehicles have engines that push them, but they are different sizes.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to test pushes with our own toy trains and cars to see which one needs a stronger push!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how different strengths of pushes affect the motion of toy vehicles.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small toy train (lightweight)\n- Small toy car (lightweight, similar size to train)\n- Wooden blocks or tape to create a starting line\n- Open floor space (at least 10 feet)\n- Paper towel tubes or foam tubes (optional, for making pushes)\n- Chart paper and markers for recording\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Sit in a circle on the floor with your toy vehicle.\"\n\n2. \"Place your toy train or car on the starting line made with blocks.\"\n\n3. \"Give your toy a gentle push with one finger. Watch where it stops. That's a soft push!\"\n\n4. \"Move your toy back to the starting line.\"\n\n5. \"Now give your toy a medium push with your whole hand. Watch how far it goes. That's a bigger push!\"\n\n6. \"Move your toy back to the starting line one more time.\"\n\n7. \"Give your toy the biggest push you can with your hand. See how far it zooms! That's a strong push!\"\n\n8. \"Do the same thing with the other vehicle (train or car) so you can compare.\"\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** \"Just like the train in the picture needs a big engine to push it, we're testing what happens when we use different strengths of pushes on our toys.\"\n\n**What Students Should Record/Document:**\n- Teacher or paraprofessional marks on paper where each toy stops after a soft, medium, and strong push (use tape lines or chalk on floor).\n- Students draw three simple pictures showing soft, medium, and strong pushes.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and observe, asking guiding questions: \"Did the soft push move your car far? Which push made it go the farthest?\"\n- Avoid telling students the answer; let them discover through hands-on experience.\n- Assist with marking distances without judgment.\n- Help students recognize the pattern: stronger push = farther or faster motion.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that a stronger push moves their toy farther or faster than a weaker push.\n- Students recognize that the direction of the push matters—pushing straight ahead moves the toy forward.\n- Most students will be able to rank their three pushes from softest to strongest.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration; connect observations back to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper\n- Student drawings from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Gather students in a circle. Ask:\n   - \"Show your pictures! Who wants to tell us what you found out?\"\n   - \"Which push made your toy go the farthest—the soft one, medium one, or strong one?\"\n   - Validate all responses and create a class tally: \"It looks like most of us found that the strong push moved our toys the farthest!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary:**\n   - **Push:** A force that moves something forward or away from you. (Show with hand motion.)\n   - **Pull:** A force that moves something toward you. (Show pulling motion—not used in this investigation, but acknowledge it.)\n   - **Strong:** A push or pull with a lot of power that moves things far or fast.\n   - **Soft (or Gentle):** A push or pull with not much power that moves things just a little bit.\n   - **Force:** The strength of a push or pull. (Say: \"Force is what makes things move!\")\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph:**\n   - \"Look at the train again. The train is REALLY big and heavy. It needs a very strong force to move—a big diesel engine! That's why the train's engine is so powerful.\"\n   - \"The car is smaller. It needs less of a strong force, but it still needs an engine to push it.\"\n   - \"You used your hand to push your toys. Your hand gave a force. The train's engine gives a much bigger force.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your hands: What does a soft push look like? Now show me a strong push!\"\n   - \"If I want my toy to go really far, should I use a soft push or a strong push?\"\n   - Do a quick thumbs-up/thumbs-down response: \"A stronger push makes things move faster—thumbs up if you agree!\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Push:** A force that moves something forward or away from you\n- **Strong:** Having a lot of power; a strong push moves things far or fast\n- **Soft (or Gentle):** Having little power; a soft push moves things just a little\n- **Force:** The strength of a push or pull that makes things move\n- **Motion:** Moving from one place to another\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word \"push\" and \"force\" correctly in simple sentences.\n- Students can demonstrate a soft push vs. a strong push with their bodies.\n- Students understand that stronger pushes move objects farther or faster.\n- Students see the connection between the powerful train engine and a strong push.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by testing pushes in new contexts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Toy trains and cars (same as Explore)\n- Small obstacles (blocks, books, stuffed animals placed in a line at varying distances)\n- Open floor space\n- Chart paper with simple drawings of different \"missions\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**New Challenge Scenario:**\n\"Now that we know about soft, medium, and strong pushes, let's try a NEW challenge! We have some blocks in the way. Your job is to choose which push strength will make your toy stop exactly at the block—not before it, not past it. Just right!\"\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. Set up 2-3 blocks at different distances from the starting line (for example, 3 feet away, 6 feet away).\n\n2. \"Point to which block you want your toy to stop at.\"\n\n3. \"Now think: Do you need a soft push, a medium push, or a strong push to make your toy stop at that block?\"\n\n4. \"Try it! Did your toy stop where you wanted? If not, try again and adjust your push.\"\n\n5. \"This time, try to stop your toy at a DIFFERENT block. Can you do it?\"\n\n**Real-World Connection:**\n\"When drivers of cars and trains need to stop, they use brakes. That's like the opposite of a push—it's a force that slows things down. But first, they had to use a push to get moving!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask: \"Why do you think you need a medium push this time instead of a strong push?\"\n- Encourage problem-solving: \"If your car went too far, what could you do differently?\"\n- Celebrate attempts: \"You predicted a soft push, and it worked! Nice prediction!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students begin to predict which push strength is needed to achieve a specific result.\n- Students adjust their force (strength of push) based on the distance to the target.\n- Students show improved coordination and intentionality in their pushes.\n- Students can explain simple cause-and-effect: \"I used a strong push, so my car went far.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pushes, forces, and motion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore and Elaborate phases for:\n  - Can they intentionally vary the strength of their push?\n  - Do they recognize the pattern (stronger push = farther/faster motion)?\n  - Can they use the words \"push\" and \"strong\" in context?\n- Ask individual students: \"Why did your toy stop there?\" and listen for cause-and-effect reasoning.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nConduct a simple, playful assessment:\n\n1. **Physical Demonstration:** \"Show me with your hand what a soft push looks like. Now show me a strong push. Great!\"\n\n2. **Comparison Question:** \"I have two pushes for you to watch. Watch me push this toy gently. Now watch me push this toy hard. Which push made the toy go farther?\"\n\n3. **Application Question:** \"If you wanted your toy train to go across the whole room, would you use a soft push or a strong push? Why?\"\n\n4. **Drawing Assessment (Optional, for documentation):**\n   - Students draw one picture: \"My toy getting a strong push\" or \"My toy moving far.\"\n   - Or, they arrange pictures in order: soft push → medium push → strong push.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Can perform pushes with varying strengths (soft, medium, strong)\n- ✓ Observe and state that a stronger push moves an object farther or faster\n- ✓ Use the word \"push\" or \"force\" when explaining motion\n- ✓ Predict which push strength is needed to reach a target\n- ✓ Make a connection between the train's engine and the concept of force/push\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most kindergarteners will successfully show different push strengths.\n- Most will recognize the pattern that stronger pushes move toys farther.\n- Some may use the words \"push\" and \"strong\" spontaneously.\n- Early finishers can attempt the obstacle course challenge multiple times with different vehicles.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Paired Exploration:** Pair students with a peer or paraprofessional during Explore phase so they have a model to observe and verbal guidance (\"Now try a medium push—use your whole hand!\").\n\n2. **Reduce Variables:** Provide only toy cars (not trains) to simplify comparison, or use only soft and strong pushes (not three levels) to reduce cognitive load.\n\n3. **Tactile Guidance:** Gently guide the student's hand through a soft push and a strong push to help them feel the difference in force before they try independently.\n\n4. **Pre-Teaching Vocabulary:** Use the words \"push,\" \"soft,\" and \"strong\" throughout the day in other contexts (e.g., during transitions: \"Use a soft push to close your cubby gently\").\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-Vehicle Comparison:** Challenge students to predict and test: \"Will a light toy car need a softer push than a heavier toy truck to go the same distance? Let's find out!\" (Requires comparing two variables: push strength and object mass.)\n\n2. **Obstacle Course Design:** \"Can you build your own obstacle course with blocks and make your toy stop exactly where you want it to stop? You get to decide where the blocks go!\"\n\n3. **Pull Investigation:** Introduce pulls using a toy on a string: \"We learned about pushes. Now let's try PULLS! Does a strong pull work the same way as a strong push?\" (Connects to real-world experience: pulling a wagon, opening a door, etc.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Push and Pull\" Nature Walk & Scavenger Hunt:** Take students outside to find examples of pushes and pulls in the environment. Look for:\n   - Doors that push open\n   - Doors that pull open\n   - Playground equipment that requires a push (slide, swing)\n   - Wagon or cart that requires a pull\n   - Children pushing or pulling each other (in games like follow-the-leader)\n   \n   Return to classroom and draw or discuss what they observed.\n\n2. **Building Design Challenge – \"Race Track Challenge\":** Provide cardboard tubes, ramps, and blocks. Students design a \"race track\" where they predict which type of push (soft, medium, or strong) will make a toy car travel the farthest. They test, adjust the track, and try again. This extends K-PS2-2 (design solutions to change motion).\n\n3. **Sing and Move – \"Push and Pull\" Movement Song:** Teach a simple song to the tune of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" (or similar):\n   - *\"Push, push, push it forward, / Watch it roll and go so far! / Soft push moves it just a bit, / Strong push makes it zoom and zip! / Push, push, push it forward, / See what pushes really do!\"*\n   \n   Have students act out soft and strong pushes as they sing. Use props (toy cars) to demonstrate. This reinforces vocabulary through kinesthetic and musical learning.\n\n---",
