When the skateboarder pushes off and moves across the smooth concrete surface, they gain speed (momentum builds). Their leg muscles do work to overcome friction and propel their body forward. At the lip of the ramp, their forward motion and speed cause them to leave the ground and become airborne. Gravity then pulls them back down. For young learners, the key observable is: **moving things have energy, and faster-moving things have MORE energy.**\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Movement and Speed:** Objects move at different speeds. This skateboarder is moving very fast, which we can see by how high they jump.\n\n* **Forces in Action:** A push (from legs) makes the skateboard and person move. The ground pushes back on the skateboard (friction), which helps the rider go fast.\n\n* **Gravity:** After jumping high, the skateboarder comes back down because Earth pulls everything toward it.\n\n* **Energy Transfer:** The skateboarder's muscles create energy that makes the skateboard move. That moving energy helps them jump high.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFor Kindergarteners, avoid the term \"kinetic energy\" directly—instead, use observable language: \"When things move really fast, they have a LOT of power!\" Connect to students' own bodies: \"When YOU run fast, YOU have power too!\" Use actions and movement to make the concept concrete rather than abstract.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Provide photographs, slow-motion videos, and hand motions to show fast vs. slow movement. Some students may not relate to skateboarding, so show other examples of fast movement (running, sliding, rolling).\n\n**Multiple Means of Action & Expression:** Allow students to demonstrate fast/slow movement with their bodies instead of only answering verbally.

    "firstgrade": "# Kinetic Energy in Motion: A First Grade Science Lesson\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nA skateboarder in a white helmet and turquoise shirt is jumping high into the air at a skate park. The skateboard is flying below them, separated from their body. You can see concrete ramps, curves, and flat areas in the background where skaters practice tricks.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** An object (the skateboard) in motion continues to move even after separating from the person who was moving it.\n\n**Why This Happens:** When the skateboarder pushes off the skateboard to jump, they give the board energy to move. The skateboard keeps rolling forward because of **inertia**—objects that are moving want to keep moving in the same direction until something stops them (like friction or hitting a wall). The skater's body goes up into the air because they pushed down and away from the board, but the board continues forward along the ground.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Motion:** Objects move in different ways. The skateboard rolls along the ground while the skater moves up and through the air.\n\n* **Energy Transfer:** When the skater pushes on the skateboard, they pass their energy to it, making it move faster.\n\n* **Forces and Movement:** The skater's legs push down (force) to make both themselves and the skateboard move.\n\n* **Inertia:** Once something is moving, it keeps moving unless a force stops it.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFor first graders, avoid using the word \"inertia\" directly in instruction. Instead, use language like \"things that are moving keep moving\" and \"things at rest like to stay at rest.\" Use simple, repeated demonstrations with rolling balls and toy cars to build this intuitive understanding before introducing the concept name.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple means of engagement by setting up a hands-on skateboard or rolling object station where students can physically push toys and observe what happens. Use a visual anchor chart with photos showing objects at rest and in motion. Allow students to respond to discussion questions through movement (jumping to show \"yes,\" staying still to show \"no\") as well as through verbal responses, supporting kinesthetic and auditory learners.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** K-PS2-1\nRepresent and explain the motion of objects using evidence, with teacher guidance, that things can move in different ways.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-PS2.A|PS2.A: Forces and Motion]]\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns|Patterns]]\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect|Cause and Effect]]\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1.

If someone put a wall in front of the skateboard, what do you think would happen to it? (Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 2)\n\n4. How is the skater's movement different from the skateboard's movement? (Bloom's: Compare | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Motion:** When something moves from one place to another.\n\n* **Energy:** The power to make things move or change.\n\n* **Force:** A push or a pull that makes something move or stop.\n\n* **Skateboard:** A board with wheels that rolls and can carry a person.\n\n* **Inertia:** The way things that are moving keep moving, and things that are still like to stay still (use simpler language: \"things like to keep doing what they're already doing\").\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rolling Toys Exploration Station:** Set up ramps and flat areas with toy cars, balls, and rolling objects. Have students roll toys and observe how far they travel. Ask: \"What made it stop?\" This builds understanding of motion and forces through hands-on play.\n\n2. **Push and Go Game:** Mark a starting line and finish line on the gym floor or outdoor area. Give students toy cars or balls to push gently, then watch how far they travel before stopping. Compare which objects traveled farther and discuss why (surface type, size, weight).\n\n3. **Human Motion Freeze Dance:** Play music and have students move and jump. When the music stops, they freeze in place. Discuss: \"Your body was moving, but now it stopped because you used a force (your muscles) to stop. Things that are moving can be stopped by forces!\"\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Things That Go* by Rob Colson (explores movement and vehicles)\n- *The Little Blue Truck* by Alice Schertle (motion and transportation)\n- *Motion* by Lola M.

    "secondgrade": "# Second Grade Science Lesson: Kinetic Energy in Motion\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\nA skateboarder is jumping into the air on a concrete skate park, balancing on their skateboard while their arms are spread wide for balance. The skateboard is below them, moving through the air. Other people are watching in the background, and you can see ramps and curved concrete features designed for skateboarding tricks.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** A moving skateboard has energy that allows it to keep rolling, and a person's push-off creates motion.\n\n**Why This Happens:** When the skateboarder pushes off with their feet, they transfer energy into the skateboard and themselves. This energy of motion is called kinetic energy. Objects that are moving have kinetic energy. The faster something moves, the more kinetic energy it has. Even while the skateboarder is in the air, both they and the skateboard are still moving because the energy they built up keeps them going until friction and gravity slow them down.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Motion and Speed:** Things can move fast or slow. The skateboard and skateboarder are moving through space. We can describe how fast they're moving by observing how far they travel.\n\n* **Energy and Force:** A push (force) from the skateboarder's legs creates motion. This push transfers energy to make things move. Moving objects have kinetic energy—the energy of motion.\n\n* **Gravity:** Gravity pulls everything toward Earth. That's why the skateboarder comes back down after jumping. Gravity affects all moving objects.\n\n* **Friction:** Friction is a force that slows things down. It happens when surfaces rub together. Friction between the skateboard wheels and the ground eventually stops the skateboard from rolling.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching kinetic energy to second graders, use the phrase \"energy of motion\" rather than the abstract term \"kinetic energy\" alone. Have students physically demonstrate the concept by running and stopping—they can feel the energy in their bodies and how it takes effort to slow down. This embodied learning makes the concept concrete and memorable.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nTo support diverse learners, provide multiple means of representation: show slow-motion videos of skateboarding, use visual diagrams with arrows showing movement direction, and allow students to physically act out motion concepts. For students with mobility differences, they can draw pictures of moving objects or use toys to demonstrate the same concepts. Offer choices in how students express their understanding—through movement, drawing, writing, or verbal explanation.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 2-PS1-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to describe and classify different kinds of materials by their observable properties.\n\n**Related Performance Expectation:** K-PS2-1: Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that vibrations make sound and that vibrations can make objects move.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-PS1.A]]—Different kinds of matter exist and can be described in different ways\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-PS2.A]]—Objects can move in different ways, such as straight, zigzag, round, back-and-forth, and fast and slow\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]]—Simple cause and effect relationships (push causes motion)\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]]—Energy can be transferred in various ways\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What made the skateboard start moving?** (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why do you think the skateboarder comes back down to the ground after jumping?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If the skate park had sand instead of concrete on the ground, what would happen to the skateboard? Why?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n4. **How could we make the skateboard go faster or slower? What would we need to do?** (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Kinetic Energy:** The energy that something has when it is moving.\n\n* **Motion:** The action of moving or changing position.\n\n* **Friction:** A force that slows things down when two surfaces rub together.\n\n* **Gravity:** An invisible force that pulls objects toward the ground.\n\n* **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or change direction.\n\n* **Speed:** How fast something is moving.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Moving Objects Investigation:** Give students toy cars, balls, and blocks on a smooth floor. Have them push each object and observe which ones move the farthest. Ask: \"What made some objects move more than others? Did they all slow down? Why?\" This connects to friction and kinetic energy transfer.\n\n2. **Ramp Race:** Create simple ramps from cardboard and wood blocks. Have students roll different objects down the ramps and measure how far they travel using string or tape. Ask students to predict which object will go the farthest before slowing down. Discuss how the ramp's angle and height affect the object's speed and distance.\n\n3. **Freeze Dance Energy Game:** Play music and have students dance and move (demonstrating kinetic energy). When the music stops, they must freeze quickly. Afterward, discuss: \"When we were dancing, did we have energy of motion? What stopped our movement? How does friction help us stop?\" This helps students feel kinetic energy in their own bodies.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Push and Pull* by Lola M.

    "fourthgrade": "# Kinetic Energy in Motion: A Fourth Grade Science Lesson\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nA skateboarder in protective gear launches into the air while performing a trick at a concrete skate park. The skateboard separates from the rider's feet mid-jump, showing the moment when energy is transferred from the moving skateboarder to the skateboard. Other people and park structures are visible in the background on a sunny day.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** *How does a skateboarder launch into the air and why does the skateboard fly separately?*\n\n**The Science Behind It:** When the skateboarder pushes down and pulls up on the skateboard, they transfer their body's **kinetic energy** (energy of motion) to the skateboard. As the rider jumps, they and the board are moving forward together. At the moment of takeoff, the skateboarder's legs push the board downward and backward, creating an upward force that propels the rider into the air. Because of **inertia**—an object's tendency to keep moving in the same direction—the skateboard continues moving forward while the rider launches upward, causing them to separate. The skateboard has kinetic energy that keeps it moving even after leaving the rider's feet.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Kinetic Energy:** Energy that an object has because it is moving. The faster or heavier an object moves, the more kinetic energy it has. In this image, both the skateboarder and skateboard have kinetic energy.\n\n2. **Force and Motion:** A force (push or pull) is needed to change how something moves. The skateboarder applies force to the skateboard by pushing down and pulling up, which changes the direction of motion and launches both the rider and board into the air.\n\n3. **Inertia:** Objects in motion tend to stay in motion unless a force stops them. The skateboard keeps moving forward in the same direction even after the rider leaves it, because nothing is stopping it.\n\n4. **Energy Transfer:** Energy can move from one object to another. When the skateboarder pushes on the skateboard, they transfer some of their body's energy to the board.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFourth graders learn best through observable, hands-on experiences with motion. Before discussing the skateboarding image, have students predict and test what happens when they push a toy car or skateboard with different amounts of force.

They roll toy skateboards, toy cars, or balls down the ramps and measure how far they travel. Students predict how changing the ramp height changes the object's speed and kinetic energy, then test their predictions. This directly models how the skateboarder's push creates motion.\n\n2. **Energy Transfer Game:** Set up a \"skateboard station\" (or use toy boards) where students practice transferring energy by pushing toy skateboards of different weights with varying amounts of force. They measure the distance each skateboard travels and create a chart showing the relationship between force applied and distance traveled, building understanding of kinetic energy.\n\n3. **Design a Skateboard Park:** Students work in small groups to design their own skate park using a large piece of paper or digital tool. They must include at least three different structures (ramps, jumps, rails) and write or draw explanations of how kinetic energy would help a skateboarder perform tricks on each structure. This combines engineering design with energy concepts.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *What is Energy?* by Mary Wissinger (an introduction to different types of energy including kinetic energy)\n- *Motion* by David Adler (explores speed, force, and how objects move)\n- *Push and Pull* by David Evans (introduces forces and how they affect motion)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"What is Kinetic Energy? | National Geographic Kids,\"** explains kinetic energy using real-world examples and animations: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2hFHruRpqQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2hFHruRpqQ)\n\n- **\"Ramp It Up: Forces and Motion,\"** PBS Learning Media video showing how forces create motion through a skateboard ramp experiment: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hYB1J5k98Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hYB1J5k98Q)",
    "fifthgrade": "# Kinetic Energy in Motion: A Fifth Grade Science Lesson\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a skateboarder launching into the air at a concrete skate park, with their skateboard flying beneath them. The skateboarder is wearing safety gear—a white helmet—and is captured mid-jump above the ground. The concrete park features various ramps and curved surfaces that help riders build and use speed.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** *Motion and Energy Transfer in Skateboarding*\n\nThis image captures a skateboarder demonstrating **kinetic energy**—the energy of motion. Here's what's happening scientifically: As the skateboarder rides down the curved ramp, gravity pulls them downward, converting potential energy (stored energy from height) into kinetic energy (energy of movement). The faster they move, the more kinetic energy they have. When they reach the bottom and push upward, they launch into the air. At the peak of their jump, some of their kinetic energy has been converted back to potential energy (height), and their skateboard continues moving forward due to inertia—the tendency of objects to keep moving unless a force stops them. This visible, dramatic moment makes abstract physics concepts concrete and observable for young learners.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n- **Kinetic Energy:** Energy that objects have when they are moving. The faster an object moves or the heavier it is, the more kinetic energy it has.\n\n- **Potential Energy:** Stored energy based on an object's position or height. Objects at the top of a ramp have more potential energy than objects at the bottom.\n\n- **Energy Transformation:** Energy can change from one form to another (potential to kinetic, kinetic to potential) but is never lost—only transferred.\n\n- **Inertia and Newton's First Law of Motion:** Objects in motion tend to stay in motion, and objects at rest tend to stay at rest, unless acted upon by an outside force (like gravity, friction, or air resistance).\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nStudents often struggle to \"see\" energy because it's invisible. This skateboarding image is powerful because students can observe the *effects* of kinetic and potential energy—the motion, the height, the speed. Encourage students to slow down the action mentally: \"What happens at the bottom of the ramp? What happens at the top?\" This helps them track energy transformations across time.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**For Multiple Means of Representation:** Provide both visual (the skateboarding image) and kinesthetic learning by having students physically model the ramp using their bodies (crouching low = potential energy; jumping high = kinetic energy conversion). For students who need additional scaffolding, create a labeled diagram showing energy at three points: top of ramp, bottom of ramp, and mid-air.\n\n**For Multiple Means of Engagement:** Connect skateboarding to students' interests (sports, extreme activities, YouTube culture). Allow choice in how students demonstrate understanding—some might create animations, others might build a small ramp and measure distances, and others might write explanations.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n5-PS2-1: Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-PS2.A]]: Forces and Motion\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-PS2.B]]: Types of Interactions\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]]\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]]\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]]\n\n**Science and Engineering Practices:**\n- Developing and Using Models\n- Analyzing and Interpreting Data\n- Constructing Explanations\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What forces are acting on the skateboarder when they are in the air?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why does the skateboarder move faster at the bottom of the ramp than at the top? Use the words \"potential energy\" and \"kinetic energy\" in your answer.** (Bloom's: Explain | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If the skateboarder were heavier, how might that change how high they could jump or how far they could travel? Why?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n4. **How could friction (like from the wheels on the concrete) and air resistance affect the skateboarder's motion? What would happen if there were no friction at all?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n- **Kinetic Energy:** The energy of motion—energy that something has because it is moving.\n- **Potential Energy:** Stored energy that an object has because of its position or height above the ground.\n- **Inertia:** The tendency of an object to keep doing what it is already doing (keep moving or stay still) unless a force changes it.\n- **Force:** A push or pull that can change how an object moves, stops, or changes direction.\n- **Gravity:** The force that pulls objects toward Earth, always pulling downward.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Build a Marble Ramp Experiment:** Students construct ramps from foam tubes, cardboard, or PVC pipe at different angles. They release marbles from the same height on each ramp and measure how far the marble travels after leaving the ramp. This directly models the energy transformations in the skateboarding image and allows quantitative data collection.\n\n2. **Energy Transformation Carousel Walk:** Create four stations around the classroom, each showing a different scenario (a ball rolling down a hill, a pendulum swinging, water flowing downhill, a person jumping). At each station, students identify where potential energy is highest, where kinetic energy is highest, and draw arrows showing energy transformation. This builds conceptual understanding across multiple contexts.\n\n3. **Design a Safer Skate Park:** Challenge students to analyze the skateboard park image and propose design changes to make it safer while still allowing skateboarders to convert potential energy into kinetic energy effectively. Students might discuss curve angles, padding placement, and size of ramps—integrating physics with engineering design thinking.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Energy* by Susan Minden (National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Science) — A foundational, highly illustrated introduction to energy in everyday contexts.\n- *Forces and Motion* by DK Findout — Clear photographs and diagrams showing energy and motion in sports and play.\n- *The Skateboard Mom and Other Parenting Disasters* by Catherine Clark (for older fifth graders) — A fun narrative connecting sports and physics.\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"Energy Transformation: Skateboarding\"** by Crash Course Kids (3:45) — Clear explanation of kinetic and potential energy using skateboarding as the primary example.

Safety is paramount—ensure students understand that skateboarding requires protection and skill, and that this is a lesson about the *physics*, not an invitation to attempt tricks."
