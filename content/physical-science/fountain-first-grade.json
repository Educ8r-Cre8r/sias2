The fountain looks frozen with white ice hanging from it like long teeth.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe **Anchoring Phenomenon** is the freezing of moving water in a fountain during cold weather. This occurs when the air temperature drops below 32°F (0°C), causing the liquid water to change states from liquid to solid (ice). The continuous flow of water creates layered ice formations as each drop freezes upon contact with the already-frozen surfaces, building up icicles and ice sheets over time.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **States of Matter** - Water can be liquid (flowing) or solid (ice) depending on temperature\n2. **Temperature Effects** - Cold air makes water freeze and turn into ice\n3. **Water Cycle in Action** - Water moves from liquid to solid state when it gets very cold\n4. **Gravity** - Water falls down from the fountain because gravity pulls it toward the ground\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use concrete examples from students' daily lives, like ice cubes in drinks or puddles freezing outside, to help them connect to the concept of water changing from liquid to solid.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to explore states of matter through hands-on activities like ice melting experiments, drawing observations, and acting out water molecules moving differently in liquid vs. solid states.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** At the tiny level we can't see, water molecules slow down and stick together tightly when it gets cold, forming the solid structure we call ice.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This frozen fountain is part of the larger water cycle where water changes between liquid, solid, and gas all around our planet - in clouds, rivers, lakes, and even in our own backyards.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"Ice is not water anymore\"\n   **Clarification:** Ice is still water, just in a different form - like how the same person can stand up or sit down but is still the same person.\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"Only big things like fountains can freeze\"\n   **Clarification:** Any water can freeze when it gets cold enough - drops, puddles, or even the water in a cup.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** K-PS1-1 - Plan and conduct an investigation to describe and classify different kinds of materials by their observable properties\n- **Disciplinary Core Idea:** [[NGSS:DCI:PS1.A]] - Structure and Properties of Matter\n- **Crosscutting Concept:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns in the natural world can be observed and used as evidence\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you think made the water in the fountain turn into ice? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n2. Where else have you seen water turn into ice? (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n3. What do you predict will happen to this ice when the weather gets warm? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n4. How is this frozen fountain the same as and different from an ice cube? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Freeze:** When water gets so cold it turns hard like ice\n* **Liquid:** Something that flows and takes the shape of its container, like water\n* **Solid:** Something that keeps its shape and doesn't flow, like ice\n* **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is\n* **Icicle:** A long piece of ice that hangs down when dripping water freezes\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- Water Is Water by Miranda Paul\n- The Magic School Bus Wet All Over by Joanna Cole\n- What Is the Water Cycle? by Robin Johnson\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- \"States of Matter for Kids\" - Simple explanation of solid, liquid, and gas with fun animations (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjUp6PmOcgY)\n- \"Water Cycle Song\" - Catchy educational song about how water changes and moves (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncORPosDrjI)",
