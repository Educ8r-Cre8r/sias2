The backhoe's bucket and arm demonstrate how forces in different directions create different types of motion.\n- **Properties of Materials:** The photograph shows various materials being moved and manipulated—soil, rocks, gravel, and metal machinery—each with different observable properties (hardness, weight, texture) that affect how they respond to forces.\n- **Simple Machines:** The backhoe is a complex tool made of many parts (bucket, arm, hydraulic cylinders) that work together as simple machines (levers) to lift, push, and move heavy loads that would be impossible to move by hand alone.\n- **Work and Effort:** The machinery demonstrates how tools help us do work more efficiently. Without the backhoe, moving piles of soil and rock would require much greater human effort.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Diggers and Lifters: How Machines Help Us Move Heavy Things**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90 minutes total (two 45-minute sessions, or three 30-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** 2-PS1-1, 2-PS1-2\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Describe observable properties of different materials (soil, rocks, sand, gravel) and predict how difficult each would be to move by hand.\n- Plan and conduct an investigation comparing how different materials respond to pushes and pulls.\n- Classify materials based on properties that determine whether they are easy or hard to move.\n- Explain why machines like backhoes are useful tools for moving materials that are too heavy for people to lift by hand.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate prior knowledge about forces, materials, and the role of machines by exploring the photograph and students' real-world observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (printed or displayed digitally)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Short 30-second video clip of a backhoe in action (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Introduce:** Show students the photograph of the backhoe and construction site. Ask them to look carefully without talking for 15-20 seconds. Then ask:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What machines do you notice?\"\n   - \"What is the big yellow machine doing? Why do you think someone needs this machine?\"\n   - \"What kinds of things is the machine moving? Can you describe what those materials look like?\" (Prompt them to notice soil, rocks, gravel, sand piles.)\n   - \"If you tried to move that big pile of soil by yourself using just your hands, what would happen? Would it be easy or hard? Why?\"\n\n2. **Wonder and Predict:** Introduce a prediction prompt:\n   - \"I wonder: What are the differences between moving sand, rocks, and soil? Which would be easiest to push with your hands? Which would be hardest? Why do you think so?\"\n   - Record student predictions on chart paper with their names.\n\n3. **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Ask:\n   - \"Has anyone ever played in sand or dirt? What did it feel like? Was it heavy? Easy to move?\"\n   - \"Can you think of other times you've pushed or pulled something heavy? What happened?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's find out more about these different materials by doing our own experiments to see which ones are easiest and hardest to move!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (25-30 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how different materials respond to pushes and pulls, and develop evidence that some materials are easier to move than others.\n\n**Materials per student group (groups of 3-4):**\n- 4 small clear containers or cups\n- Samples of different materials: sandbox sand, garden soil (or potting soil), gravel, and small rocks or pebbles\n- 4 shallow trays or aluminum pans (about 6\"×8\")\n- Wooden spoons or craft sticks for pushing\n- Small toy cars, blocks, or wooden boards\n- Hand lenses (optional, for closer observation)\n- Data recording sheet (template provided below)\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring distance pushed)\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Observing and Describing Materials (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set Up:** Give each group four trays, each containing a different material: sand, soil, gravel, and rocks. Ensure samples are about 2 inches deep.\n\n2. **Direct Student Investigation:**\n   - \"Look at each material carefully. Use your hand lenses if you have them.\"\n   - \"Touch each material gently. What do you notice? Is it smooth or bumpy? Wet or dry? Heavy or light?\"\n   - \"On your data sheet, draw what each material looks like and write words to describe it.\"\n   - Prompt observation questions: *Is it made of big pieces or small pieces? Does it stick together or fall apart? Is it hard or soft?*\n\n3. **Record Observations:** Students sketch and describe each material in the first section of their data sheet.\n\n**Part B: Testing How Materials Move (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **First Test—Pushing with a Spoon:**\n   - \"Now we're going to test which material is easiest to push. Use your spoon to push each material across the tray. Push the same amount each time.\"\n   - \"What happens? Does the material move easily or does it stay stuck? How far does it move?\"\n   - Students record on their sheet whether each material was \"Easy to Push\" or \"Hard to Push\" and roughly how far it moved (near the spoon, middle of tray, far across tray).\n\n2. **Second Test—Making a Small Pile:**\n   - \"Pile each material into a small mound. Now try to push the pile with a wooden block or your spoon. What happens?\"\n   - \"Which material stays in a pile? Which material spreads out? Why do you think that happens?\"\n   - Students record observations.\n\n3. **Optional Third Test—Moving with a Toy Car (if time allows):**\n   - \"Place a toy car on top of each material. What happens? Does the car sink in? Roll on top? Get stuck?\"\n   - \"Which materials would be easiest for a big machine to drive on?\"\n   - Record results.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions without telling students the answers: *\"What did you notice when you pushed? Did all the materials move the same way? Why might that be?\"*\n- Help groups stay focused on observing and recording.\n- Encourage careful, slow pushes so students can see differences clearly.\n- Have paper towels available for spills.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that sand and small gravel move more easily and spread out, while larger rocks don't move as far.\n- Students observe that materials with bigger pieces and harder particles behave differently from fine, loose materials.\n- Students produce data sheets with descriptions and simple comparisons of how each material responds to pushing forces.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to the properties of materials; explain why these properties affect how things move.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms and pictures\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Picture cards or real samples of the four materials in containers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Out and Compare (8-10 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their findings: *\"Which material was easiest to push? Which was hardest? Why do you think?\"*\n   - Record their conclusions on chart paper: Create two columns: \"Easy to Move\" and \"Hard to Move.\"\n   - Guide students to notice the pattern: Materials made of small, loose pieces are easier to move; materials made of large, heavy pieces are harder to move.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (5-8 minutes):**\n\n   Use simple language with pictures or real objects to introduce:\n\n   - **Material:** The stuff something is made of (sand, soil, rock, metal). *\"All these things around us are made of materials. Some are hard, some are soft, some are loose.\"*\n   \n   - **Properties:** The things you can see, feel, or notice about something—like its color, size, shape, or texture. *\"The property of sand is that it's small and loose. The property of rocks is that they're hard and heavy.\"*\n   \n   - **Push and Pull:** Forces we use to move things. A push makes something move away from you; a pull brings it toward you. *\"When you used the spoon, you gave the material a push. The backhoe pushes and pulls heavy materials.\"*\n   \n   - **Tool:** Something we make to help us do work more easily. *\"A spoon is a small tool. A backhoe is a big machine tool that helps move really heavy things.\"*\n   \n   - **Easy to Move / Hard to Move:** Some materials move with a small force; others need a much bigger force.\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Show the backhoe photo again.\n   - \"Look at the backhoe's bucket. It's designed to pick up and move soil, gravel, and rocks—the same materials we just tested. Why do you think we need such a big machine?\"\n   - Guide responses: *\"Because soil and rocks are heavy and hard to move. The backhoe uses a huge push-and-pull force to lift what our hands cannot.\"*\n   - Point to the different materials visible in the photo: *\"See the piles? That's soil, gravel, and rocks—just like you tested!\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Turn and talk to a partner: Why do you think the material with bigger, heavier pieces was harder to push? Use the word 'properties' in your answer if you can.\"\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share briefly.\n   - Quick Yes/No questions:\n     - \"Is sand a property?\" (No, sand is a material.)\n     - \"Are 'hard' and 'loose' properties?\" (Yes!)\n     - \"Can we use the same push to move sand and rocks the same way?\" (No—rocks need a bigger push.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Material** | The stuff something is made of, like sand, soil, rock, or metal. |\n| **Properties** | The things you can see, feel, or notice about something, like how big it is, its color, if it's hard or soft, or if it's loose or stuck together. |\n| **Push** | A force that makes something move away from you. |\n| **Pull** | A force that brings something toward you. |\n| **Tool** | Something we make or use to help us do work, like a spoon, shovel, or backhoe. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the four materials tested and describe at least two properties of each.\n- Students understand that properties of materials affect how easily they can be moved.\n- Students connect their test results to why a backhoe is necessary for moving heavy loads.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of material properties and forces to a new, real-world scenario; think about why the backhoe's design matters.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with scenario printed or written\n- Picture cards of different scenarios (or use the backhoe photo again)\n- Drawing paper and colored pencils\n- Optional: Small plastic construction toy vehicles (if available) and bins with material samples\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Application:**\n\nPresent students with the following real-world scenario (read aloud and display pictures):\n\n*\"A construction company is building a new playground. They need to move three different materials:*\n- *Soft sand for the sand box*\n- *Heavy, hard rocks for decorative borders*\n- *Loose gravel for pathways*\n\n*They have two tools available: a person with a shovel and a big backhoe machine. Which tool should they use for each material? Why?\"*\n\n1. **Guided Discussion (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Which material is lightest and easiest to move? Could a person with a shovel move sand? Why?\"\n   - \"Which material is heaviest and hardest to move? Could a person move all those rocks? Why would we need the backhoe?\"\n   - \"What about the gravel? Let's think about properties again—is gravel easier or harder to move than rocks?\"\n\n2. **Student Application Activity (10 minutes):**\n\n   **Option A (Drawing & Labeling):**\n   - Provide each student with a scenario card and a drawing prompt.\n   - \"Draw the playground situation. Show which tool (shovel or backhoe) you would use for each material. Label each material and tool. Write one reason for each choice, using the word 'properties.'\"\n   - Example sentence frame: *\"I would use the backhoe for rocks because the property of rocks is that they are _______ and _______.\"*\n\n   **Option B (Hands-On Simulation):**\n   - If available, students use toy construction vehicles to move samples of materials in small bins.\n   - Challenge: *\"Move this pile of sand with the small shovel. Now move this pile of rocks with the small shovel. What's different? Now use the big 'backhoe.' What happens?\"*\n   - Record observations on a comparison chart.\n\n3. **Share and Discuss (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 students to share their drawings or demonstrate their simulation results.\n   - Ask peers: *\"Do you agree with their choice? Why or why not?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the scenario discussion; ask probing questions but don't lead to one answer.\n- As students work, ask: *\"Why did you choose that tool? What property of that material made you decide?\"*\n- Encourage use of vocabulary: material, property, push, pull, tool.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding by matching tools to materials based on properties.\n- Students produce labeled drawings or demonstrations showing reasoning.\n- Students use newly learned vocabulary to explain their choices.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of material properties, how properties affect movement, and the role of tools.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation notes during Explore: Can students accurately describe and compare materials?\n- Listen to student language during Explain share-out: Are they using \"property,\" \"push,\" \"pull,\" \"material\"?\n- Questions during Elaborate: Can students match tools to materials and justify their reasoning?\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes at end of lesson or next day):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket with the following three items:\n\n1. **Draw and Label (with teacher scribing if needed):**\n   *\"Draw two materials from our investigation. Label one 'Easy to Move' and one 'Hard to Move.' Draw an arrow showing a push on each one.\"*\n\n2. **Multiple Choice Question:**\n   *\"Which material was HARDEST to push with the spoon?\"*\n   - A) Sand  \n   - B) Soil  \n   - C) Gravel  \n   - D) Rocks  \n\n3. **Short Answer (with picture support if needed):**\n   *\"Why do we need a big backhoe to move rocks instead of using our hands? Use the word 'property' in your answer.\"*\n   \n   *Example: \"Rocks are hard and heavy. Those properties make rocks _______ to move, so we need a _______ machine.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies properties of at least two materials (e.g., \"sand is small and loose,\" \"rocks are hard and heavy\").\n- ✓ Student accurately predicts or recalls which material was easiest/hardest to move.\n- ✓ Student explains the connection between material properties and why a tool is needed (even with support/sentence frames).\n- ✓ Student uses at least two vocabulary terms correctly (material, property, push, pull, or tool).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that materials have different properties that affect how easily they move.\n- Most students (80%+) correctly classify materials as easy or hard to move.\n- Students show emerging understanding that large forces or tools are needed for heavy materials.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Material Sorting:** Reduce to two materials initially (sand and rocks). Start with only the push test before adding the pull or car test. Use picture cards to match materials to \"Easy to Move\" or \"Hard to Move\" categories.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames and Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Provide visual anchor chart with pictures and labels of vocabulary terms (property, push, pull, material) posted prominently. Use sentence frames for Exit Ticket: \n   - *\"This material is [easy/hard] to move because it is [adjective: hard, soft, heavy, light].\"*\n   - Have peer buddy or aide help scribe student thinking into sentence frames.\n\n3. **Modified Exit Ticket:** Provide images instead of blank drawing space. Ask student to circle or point to the material that was hardest to move, and accept one-word or short responses (\"Heavy,\" \"Hard,\" \"Big rocks\") rather than full sentences.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Predict and Test New Materials:** Challenge students to bring in or identify another material (like clay, flour, gravel, or mulch) and predict whether it will be easy or hard to move based on its properties before testing. Have them test, record, and explain their prediction (was it correct?).\n\n2. **Design a Tool:** Provide craft materials (cardboard, popsicle sticks, plastic spoons) and ask: *\"Design a tool that would be better at moving one of these materials than the spoon we used. Why would your tool work better?\"* Have them draw or build a prototype and explain using properties and forces vocabulary.\n\n3. **Real-World Research:** Ask students to find pictures of different construction tools (dump truck, bulldozer, wheelbarrow, shovel) and sort them by which material they'd be best for moving. Have them write or tell reasons based on material properties and tool design.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Texture and Sorting Hunt (Homework or Follow-Up):**\n   - Students go outside or around their home to find three natural or human-made materials (pebbles, leaves, soil, foam, plastic).\n   - They describe each material's properties (hard/soft, rough/smooth, heavy/light, loose/packed) and predict whether a push could move it easily.\n   - They bring materials back or draw/photograph them for a class \"Material Properties Museum\" display.\n\n2. **Read-Aloud and Discussion: Construction Books**\n   - Read picture books about construction (e.g., *Little Blue Truck*, *Goodnight, Goodnight, Construction Site*, or *Truck* by Donald Crews).\n   - Pause to ask: *\"What materials are the trucks moving? Why do they need that truck for that job? What properties does the material have?\"*\n   - Make connections between the story and the original photograph/investigation.\n\n3. **Dramatic Play: Construction Site Center**\n   - Set up a dramatic play area with sandboxes, toy construction vehicles (backhoe, dump truck, bulldozer), and bins of different materials (sand, gravel, plastic rocks, soil).\n   - Students role-play construction workers, experimenting with moving materials, discussing which tools work best for which materials, and using vocabulary naturally.\n   - Teacher listens for use of target vocabulary and asks clarifying questions during play.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
