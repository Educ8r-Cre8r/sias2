ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about shadows and sunlight using the photograph.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Printed photograph (or digital display on screen)\n  - Student observation worksheet (pictures with checkboxes, no reading required)\n  - Optional: a real fire hydrant or traffic cone from the playground if available\n\n- **Activity:**\n  Display the photograph on a large screen or print it for small group viewing. Point to the shadows cast by the hydrant and traffic cone, and ask:\n  \n  1. \"What do you notice about the dark spots on the ground? Where did they come from?\"\n  2. \"Why is the grass in the shadow different from the grass in the sunny spot?\"\n  3. \"If you touched the concrete in the sunny part and the concrete in the shade, which one do you think would be warmer?\"\n  4. \"Can you find the biggest shadow in this picture? What made it?\"\n\n  After discussion, show students the photograph again and say: \"Today, we're going to be shadow detectives and heat explorers! We're going to find out how the sun makes shadows and makes things hot.\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Let's go outside (or to a sunny window area) and do our own shadow hunt!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate shadows and the warming effects of sunlight through hands-on outdoor observation.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper or large poster board for recording observations\n  - Markers or crayons\n  - Thermometers (optional, for advanced K classes) or hand-feel comparison\n  - Objects with different surface colors (dark and light paper, foam, plastic)\n  - String or chalk for marking areas\n  - Student shadow observation cards (picture cards to place where shadows are found)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Part 1: Shadow Hunt (10 minutes)**\n  Take students outside to a sunny area. Divide into small groups.\n  \n  - Direct students: \"Find an object that makes a shadow. It could be a person, a tree, a sign, or a playground structure. Stand in the shadow. Now step into the sunny spot next to it. What do you feel different?\"\n  - Have students place observation cards (simple picture markers) on the ground in shadowy spots and sunny spots.\n  - Encourage them to notice: Does the shadow move? Is it hard or fuzzy?\n\n  **Part 2: Warming Test (10-15 minutes)**\n  If possible, bring out the colored paper objects (dark and light surfaces).\n  \n  - Direct students: \"Put your hand gently on the dark paper in the sun. Now touch the light paper. Which one feels warmer? Let's mark which one felt hotter.\"\n  - Record findings on chart paper with simple pictures and tallies of which surface was warmer.\n  - Have students place their hand in the shade and then in the sun on the same surface. Ask: \"Did moving into the shadow change how warm it feels?\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:** \n  Circulate among groups, ask guiding questions (\"What did you discover?\", \"How does it feel different?\"), and help students place observation markers. Do not tell them answers—let them discover through feeling and observing.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students discover that sunlight creates shadows.\n  - Students observe that sunny spots feel warmer than shaded spots.\n  - Students record observations using pictures and markers (not necessarily words).\n  - Students can point to examples of warm and cool spots in the outdoor area.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect observations to scientific concepts.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart from Explore phase\n  - Picture cards showing sun, shadow, warm, and cool\n  - Real objects from the outdoor investigation (if brought inside)\n  - Simple diagram poster showing sun rays and a shadow\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  Gather students in a circle. Review the observations from the Explore phase.\n  \n  - Show the picture cards and introduce vocabulary: \"When sunlight shines on something, it makes a **shadow**—a dark spot where the sunlight doesn't reach. When sunlight hits a surface, it makes it warm. We call this the **warming effect of sunlight**.\"\n  \n  - Point to the chart from Explore: \"Look, we discovered that dark surfaces got warmer than light surfaces in the sun. We also found that shaded spots were cooler than sunny spots.\"\n  \n  - Hold up the colored papers again: \"The dark paper **absorbed** more heat from the sun, so it got warmer. The light paper **reflected** more light away.\"\n  \n  - Draw a simple diagram on a fresh piece of chart paper: sun rays pointing down, one hitting a sunny spot (with a smiley face), one hitting a shaded spot (with a cool face).\n  \n  **Check for Understanding:**\n  - Ask: \"Show me with your hand where the shadow is in this picture.\" (Point to the photograph again.)\n  - Ask: \"Which would feel warmer—standing in the sun or standing under a tree?\"\n  - Have students turn to a partner and say one thing they discovered about shadows or warmth.\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Shadow:** A dark spot or area made when something blocks sunlight from reaching the ground or another surface.\n  - **Sunlight:** Light energy from the sun that travels to Earth.\n  - **Warm:** Having a higher temperature; feeling hot.\n  - **Cool:** Having a lower temperature; not warm.\n  - **Absorbed:** Taken in; when a dark surface takes in heat from the sun and becomes warm.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  Students understand that sunlight causes shadows and warms surfaces, and they can use the vocabulary words in simple sentences or point to examples.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a shaded structure.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Paper cups or paper bowls\n  - Cardboard or foam sheets cut into small pieces\n  - Straws or sticks\n  - Tape (painter's tape recommended)\n  - Markers\n  - Toy figures or objects to place under structures\n  - Thermometers (optional)\n  - Open sunny area or sunny windowsill\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  Present the challenge: \"The hydrant and cone in the photograph are in the sun. They get hot. We need to design a **shade structure**—something that blocks sunlight and keeps an area cool. Can you build something to shade a toy figure or object?\"\n  \n  **Student Directions:**\n  1. Choose materials: a base (cup or cardboard) and something to create shade (paper, foam, or cardboard \"roof\").\n  2. Tape or attach the shade part to create a covered area.\n  3. Place your toy figure or object in the shade you created.\n  4. Test it: Put a thermometer (if available) in the sunny spot next to your structure and under the shade. Does it feel cooler under your shade?\n  5. Draw or mark your design on paper to show what you made.\n  \n  **Real-World Connection:** \"People and animals need shade on hot days. Parks have umbrellas. Playgrounds have shade structures. Trees provide shade. Your design helps keep things cooler!\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  Provide materials, ask: \"How will you make shade?\", \"What could block sunlight?\", and \"Is your design working?\" Allow trial and error. Celebrate creative designs.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  Students create a simple shade structure that blocks sunlight and can explain that their design keeps things cooler by preventing sunlight from reaching a surface.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of sunlight's effects and ability to design solutions.\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n  - Observe student participation in the shadow hunt and warming test.\n  - Listen to student explanations about shadows and warmth.\n  - Check student ability to use vocabulary words (shadow, warm, cool, sunlight).\n  \n  **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n  Use picture-based exit cards (Kindergarten-appropriate):\n  \n  1. **Picture card with sun and a surface:** \"Point to where you think it will be warm.\" (Student points to sunny spot.)\n  2. **Picture card showing a shadow:** \"What made this shadow?\" (Student may answer \"sunlight\" or \"the sun blocked by something,\" or simply point to the object.)\n  3. **Picture card showing a shaded area and sunny area:** \"Which place is cooler?\" (Student points to shaded area.)\n  4. **Picture of a sun and an object:** \"Show me one way to keep this object cooler.\" (Student points to a shaded spot or demonstrates understanding that shade/blocking sunlight helps.)\n  \n  **Success Criteria:**\n  - Student correctly identifies that sunlight creates heat and shadows.\n  - Student demonstrates understanding that shaded areas are cooler than sunny areas.\n  - Student can apply this knowledge by creating or pointing to a shading solution.\n  - Student uses vocabulary words (shadow, warm, cool, sunlight) when prompted or unprompted.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  Students demonstrate understanding by accurately answering 3 out of 4 assessment questions and showing their shade structure design.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support:**\n  1. **For students struggling with observation:** Use hand-over-hand guidance during the warming test (place their hand gently on materials with teacher support). Use simple yes/no questions instead of open-ended ones: \"Is this hot or cold?\" with picture choices.\n  2. **For students with limited vocabulary:** Provide a word bank with picture cards (sun, shadow, warm, cool) they can point to instead of speaking. Accept pointing or single-word responses.\n  3. **For students who struggle with building:** Provide a pre-made shade structure frame (paper cup with cardboard top already attached) that they only need to personalize or place their object under.\n\n- **Challenge:**\n  1. **For advanced students:** Ask them to compare different shade structures: \"Which design makes the coolest spot?\" Have them measure temperature differences with a thermometer if available, or rank shaded spots by how cool they feel.\n  2. **For students ready for more complex thinking:** Introduce the concept of angle: \"What angle should your shade be to block the most sun?\" Let them experiment with tilting their shade structures.\n  3. **For students interested in real-world applications:** Ask: \"Where do you see shade structures at school or in your neighborhood? Why are they there?\" Take a \"shade hunt\" walk around the school grounds identifying natural and human-made shades.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Playground Shade Map:** Take students on a walk around the playground or school grounds. Have them mark with chalk or place markers in shaded areas and sunny areas. Create a simple map showing where the shadiest spots are. Discuss why certain areas are shadier (near trees, buildings, structures). This extends K-PS3-1 by having students observe and record patterns of sunlight across the outdoor environment.\n\n2. **Build a Sunflower or Tree Shade:** Provide paper, crayons, and materials for students to create a large paper tree or flower structure to place in a sunny classroom windowsill. Place small toys or objects \"under\" the tree and observe which ones stay cooler. This is a creative application of K-PS3-2 and connects to life science by showing how real plants provide shade.\n\n3. **Sundial Shadow Project:** Create a simple sundial using a stick (gnomon) placed in playdough in a sunny spot. Have students trace or mark the shadow at different times of day (morning, noon, afternoon). Observe how the shadow moves and changes as the sun's position changes. This extends understanding of how sunlight and shadows change over time and connects to Earth-space science concepts about the sun's apparent movement.\n\n---",
