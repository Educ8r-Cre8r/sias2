The white part of the egg (called the egg white) is getting firm and solid, while the yellow part in the middle (called the yolk) is still soft. Heat from the stove is making the egg change!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Heat transfer and the effects of thermal energy on matter\n\n**Why It's Happening:** When the hot pan touches the cold egg, thermal energy (heat) moves from the hot pan into the egg. This heat causes the proteins in the egg to change shape and bond together, making the liquid egg white turn into a solid. This is called a **physical change**—the egg looks and feels different, but it's still an egg. The blue flame is burning fuel (natural gas or propane), which creates heat energy that warms the pan.\n\nFor kindergarteners, the simple explanation is: **The hot stove makes the egg get warmer and harder.**\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n- **Thermal Energy (Heat):** Energy that makes things warm. Heat always moves from something hot to something cold. The hot pan is giving heat to the cold egg.\n\n- **States of Matter and Change:** When heat is added to some things, they change. The raw egg is mostly liquid (runny), but heat makes it become solid (firm). This shows that heat can change how things look and feel.\n\n- **Energy Sources:** The flame is a source of energy. We can see the blue flame releasing energy as light and heat.\n\n- **Cause and Effect:** The flame heats the pan → the pan heats the egg → the egg changes texture and appearance. Students can observe that *something* (heat) caused a *change* (solid egg).\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFor Kindergarten, avoid the term \"heat transfer.\" Instead, use simpler language: \"The hot pan is making the egg warm,\" or \"The stove gives heat to the egg.\" Let students observe the **visible changes** (color, texture) rather than focusing on invisible heat movement.

    "firstgrade": "# Thermal Energy: A First Grade Science Lesson Analysis\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows an egg cooking on a dark pan sitting on a stovetop with blue flames underneath. The egg white has turned from clear to solid white, and the yellow yolk in the center is still runny. Heat from the flames is making the egg change from raw to cooked.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Heat changes the way food looks and feels.\n\nWhen thermal energy (heat) from the flames transfers to the pan, and then from the pan to the egg, it causes a **physical and chemical change**. The proteins in the egg white denature and coagulate when exposed to temperatures above 140°F, transforming from a transparent liquid into an opaque solid. The yolk remains runny because it requires higher temperatures to solidify. This is a direct, observable example of how thermal energy changes matter—a foundational concept in First Grade physical science.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Thermal Energy (Heat):** Energy that makes things warmer and can change how things look and feel.\n\n* **Heat Transfer:** Heat moves from hot places (the flame and pan) to cooler places (the raw egg) and causes changes.\n\n* **States of Matter Change:** Heat can turn liquids into solids (the egg white becoming firm), demonstrating how thermal energy affects matter.\n\n* **Observable Changes:** We can see and feel changes caused by heat—color changes, texture changes, and hardness changes are evidence that thermal energy is doing work.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFirst graders learn best through direct sensory experiences. Rather than only showing this image, have students feel the warmth of a lamp or warm water, observe ice melting, or toast bread. Connect the image to real experiences they've had with warm and cold objects.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Show the image alongside a video of an egg cooking to engage visual and auditory learners. Provide tactile experiences (touching warm vs. cold surfaces under teacher supervision) for kinesthetic learners.\n\n**Multiple Means of Action & Expression:** Allow students to show understanding by drawing before/after pictures of the egg, sorting pictures of things that change when heated, or acting out the process of heat moving through the pan.\n\n**Multiple Means of Engagement:** Connect cooking at home—a relatable experience—to this phenomenon. Ask students about foods their families cook together.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** \nK-PS1-1: Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that vibrations make sound and that vibrations can make materials move.\n*(Note: For First Grade, the most relevant standard is:)*\n**1-PS4-1:** Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that vibrations in materials can make sound, and that sound can make materials vibrate. \n\n*Alternative alignment:*\n**K-PS3-1:** Make observations to determine the effect of sunlight on Earth's surface.\n**K-PS3-2:** Make observations to determine the effect of placing objects in sunlight to make some materials warmer and others cooler.\n\n**Relevant Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n* [[NGSS:DCI:K-PS3.A]] - Sunlight warms Earth's surface.

    "secondgrade": "# Second Grade Science Lesson: Thermal Energy and Cooking\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\nThis image shows an egg cooking on a dark pan over a blue flame on a stove. The egg white has turned from clear to solid white, while the yellow yolk in the middle stays runny. Heat from the flame below is making the egg change from raw to cooked.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Heat energy changes the properties of matter (specifically, egg proteins denature and solidify when exposed to thermal energy).\n\nWhen heat from the flame travels to the pan and then to the egg, it causes the proteins in the egg white to break apart and bond in new ways. This physical and chemical change makes the clear, liquid egg white become solid and opaque. The yolk heats more slowly because it's thicker, so it may stay liquid longer. This is an everyday example of how **thermal energy** (heat) can permanently transform materials.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Heat and Temperature:** Heat is energy that moves from hot things to cooler things. The flame is very hot and transfers heat to the pan and egg.\n\n* **States of Matter:** Matter can exist as solids, liquids, or gases. The egg changes from a liquid (raw) to a solid (cooked) when heat is added.\n\n* **Energy Transfer:** Thermal energy moves in a direction—from the hot flame → to the pan → to the egg. This is called heat transfer.\n\n* **Irreversible Changes:** Once an egg is cooked, you cannot turn it back into a raw egg. This shows that some changes caused by heat are permanent.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nUse a **sensory prediction strategy** before showing the cooking process. Ask students, \"If you could touch this raw egg, what would it feel like?\" Then ask, \"What do you think it will feel like after the heat touches it?\" This activates prior knowledge and builds curiosity before the lesson begins.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Engagement:** Provide a raw egg and a cooked egg for students to observe and touch (with appropriate safety and hand-washing). Offer visual, tactile, and olfactory experiences. For students with sensory sensitivities, provide photos or drawings as alternatives to direct contact.\n\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Use both words and pictures to describe the egg cooking. Act out the changes: have students stand (liquid) and then \"freeze\" in place (solid) to show the change from raw to cooked.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**  \n2-PS1-2: Analyze data obtained from testing different materials to determine which materials have the properties that are best suited for an intended purpose.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-PS1.A]]: Different properties are suited to different purposes.\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-PS3.A]]: Heat can be produced in many ways and can move from one place to another.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]]: Energy can be transferred from one object to another.\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]]: Simple cause-and-effect relationships exist in everyday situations (heat causes changes in materials).\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you notice has changed about the egg after heat was added?** (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why do you think the egg white turned from clear to white?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If we could cool down the cooked egg, do you think it would turn back into a raw egg? Why or why not?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **Where is the heat coming from, and how does it reach the egg?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Heat:** Energy that makes things warm or hot.\n* **Thermal Energy:** The energy that comes from heat and makes things warm.\n* **Cook:** To use heat to change the way food looks and feels.\n* **Solid:** Matter that has a definite shape and does not flow (like a cooked egg white).\n* **Liquid:** Matter that flows and takes the shape of its container (like a raw egg).\n* **Irreversible Change:** A change that cannot be undone or reversed.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n**Activity 1: Cooking Sequence Cards**  \nProvide three pictures showing an egg in different stages: raw, cooking, and fully cooked. Ask students to place them in order and explain what is happening at each stage using their new vocabulary.\n\n**Activity 2: Heat Source Exploration**  \nSafely explore other heat sources in the classroom (a sunny windowsill, a lamp, warm water). Have students predict and test which sources are warm and which are cool. Create a class chart showing \"Warm\" and \"Cool\" heat sources.\n\n**Activity 3: Material Changes Hunt**  \nTake students on a \"material changes\" walk through the school or home (with permission). Identify other examples of irreversible changes caused by heat: toast, melted butter, baked cookies, or heated playdough. Document with drawings and discuss why these changes are permanent.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Heat* by Robin Nelson (Lerner Publications) – Simple, illustrated introduction to heat and thermal energy\n- *The Egg* by M.P.

    "thirdgrade": "# Thermal Energy & Phase Change: Cooking an Egg\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a fried egg cooking on a dark skillet over a blue gas flame. The egg white has turned from clear and runny to white and solid, while the yellow yolk in the center remains soft. Heat from the stove is causing the egg to change from its raw state into a cooked meal.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Heat energy from the stove is causing the egg proteins to permanently change structure—a process called **denaturation**. \n\n**Why It's Happening:** When thermal energy (heat) is applied to the egg, it causes the protein molecules in both the white and yolk to unwind and bond together in new ways. This creates a solid or semi-solid texture that cannot be reversed back to raw. The egg white denatures at a lower temperature (~60°C) than the yolk (~65°C), which is why we see different rates of cooking. This is a **chemical change**—not just a temperature change, but an actual transformation of the material itself.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Thermal Energy Transfer:** Heat flows from the hot skillet into the egg, raising the egg's temperature and causing physical and chemical changes.\n\n* **States of Matter & Phase Change:** The egg changes from a liquid/semi-liquid state to a more solid state. While not a traditional phase change (like ice to water), it demonstrates how heat affects matter's properties.\n\n* **Chemical Change vs. Physical Change:** Cooking an egg is a **chemical change** because the proteins are permanently altered at the molecular level—you cannot return the egg to its raw state just by cooling it.\n\n* **Temperature & Energy:** Different parts of the egg cook at different rates because different proteins denature at different temperatures, showing that thermal energy affects materials in specific ways.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nUse the egg-cooking phenomenon as a concrete, relatable anchor. Third graders have likely eaten eggs! Ask them to predict what will happen BEFORE cooking, then observe carefully during cooking. This builds scientific thinking by connecting real-world experiences to abstract concepts like \"thermal energy.\"\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple means of engagement by offering choice in how students document observations: drawings, written descriptions, or labeled diagrams. Use real eggs or high-quality videos for students who benefit from visual/tactile learning. Create a word wall with \"thermal energy,\" \"heat,\" \"cooking,\" and \"change\" so all learners can reference vocabulary independently.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 3-PS1-4 Observe and record the results of mixing substances together to determine if a new material is formed.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-PS1.A]] (Matter and Its Interactions)\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-PS1.B]] (Types of Interactions)\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]]\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]]\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What changes do you notice happening to the egg as it cooks?** (Bloom's: Observe | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why do you think the egg white cooks before the yolk?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If we let the cooked egg cool down in the refrigerator, will it turn back into a raw egg? Why or why not?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **What other foods do you eat that change when they are heated? What changes do you observe?** (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Thermal Energy:** The heat energy from something hot that can make other things warmer.\n\n* **Heat:** The flow of thermal energy from something hot to something cooler.\n\n* **Cooking:** Using heat to change how food looks, feels, and tastes.\n\n* **Protein:** A material found in eggs and other foods that changes shape when heated.\n\n* **Denaturation:** When heat causes the proteins in food (like eggs) to permanently change and become firm or solid.\n\n* **Chemical Change:** A change that creates a completely new material that cannot be changed back.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Egg Cooking Prediction & Observation Chart:** Have students predict what the raw egg will look like at different cooking stages (1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes), then observe a live egg cooking (or watch a video). Have them record observations with labeled drawings and compare to their predictions. This builds hypothesis testing skills.\n\n2. **Temperature & Cooking Investigation:** Using boiled eggs, provide students with eggs cooked for different lengths of time (3 minutes, 5 minutes, 7 minutes, 10 minutes). Have them cut or observe the eggs and record how the yolk changes from runny to soft to fully cooked. Discuss how time and temperature work together to cause change.\n\n3. **Heat Transfer Exploration:** Use warm water, thermometers, and various materials (cloth, plastic, foil, paper) to investigate which materials transfer heat fastest. Ask: \"If you were cooking an egg, which material would cook it fastest?\" This connects the egg phenomenon to heat transfer properties.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *The Egg* by M.P.

    "fourthgrade": "# Fourth Grade Science Lesson: Thermal Energy & Heat Transfer\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows an egg cooking on a dark skillet over a blue gas flame. The egg white has turned from clear to solid white, while the yellow yolk remains soft in the center. The heat from the flame below is transferring energy to the pan, which then transfers that energy to the egg, causing it to change.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Heat transfer causing a change of state and irreversible physical/chemical change.\n\n**Why This Happens:** Thermal energy (heat) from the gas flame travels upward into the metal skillet. The hot skillet transfers this thermal energy to the egg. When eggs are heated, the proteins in the white portion unwind and bond together (called denaturing), turning the liquid egg white into a solid. This is an irreversible change—you cannot turn a cooked egg back into a raw egg. The yolk cooks more slowly because it's thicker and insulates itself from the direct heat.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Thermal Energy & Heat:** Thermal energy is the total energy of moving particles in matter. Heat is thermal energy that flows from warmer objects to cooler objects. The flame and skillet have more thermal energy than the raw egg, so heat flows into the egg.\n\n* **Heat Transfer Methods:** Heat moves through *conduction* (direct contact between the skillet and egg), *convection* (the flame warming the air around the skillet), and *radiation* (infrared energy from the flame).\n\n* **Irreversible Changes:** Cooking an egg is a permanent change. The protein structure of the egg fundamentally transforms and cannot be reversed by cooling it down.\n\n* **Energy Transformation:** Chemical energy stored in the gas fuel is converted into thermal energy (heat and light), which then transfers to the egg.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\n**Tip for Teachers:** Students often confuse heat and temperature. Reinforce that temperature is how fast particles are moving (measured in degrees), while heat is the *transfer* of thermal energy between objects. Use the phrase \"heat flows FROM hot TO cold\" repeatedly throughout the lesson to build this mental model.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**UDL Strategy:** Provide multiple means of engagement by allowing students to observe the actual cooking process (if safe) or watch a slow-motion video, draw diagrams showing heat flow with arrows, and verbally describe what they observe. This addresses visual, kinesthetic, and auditory learners. For students with limited access to kitchen experiences, use videos or virtual demonstrations to ensure equitable access to the phenomenon.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**  \n4-PS3-1: Use evidence to construct an explanation relating the speed of an object to the energy of that object.  \n4-PS3-2: Make observations to provide evidence that energy in motion has the ability to move objects.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n* [[NGSS:DCI:4-PS3.A]] - Energy can be transferred in various ways and between objects\n* [[NGSS:DCI:4-PS3.B]] - Energy is present whenever there are changes occurring\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]] - Energy is transferred when objects interact; matter flows into and out of systems\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] - Cause and effect relationships identify and describe mechanisms in systems\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you observe happening to the egg white as it cooks?** (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why do you think the egg white turns from clear to white when it cooks?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If we let the cooked egg cool down on the counter, will it turn back into a raw egg? Why or why not?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **How does the thermal energy from the flame get to the egg? Trace the path it takes.** (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Thermal Energy:** The energy that all moving particles in matter have; another word for heat energy.\n\n* **Heat:** The flow of thermal energy from a warmer object to a cooler object.\n\n* **Conduction:** The transfer of heat through direct contact between two objects (like the skillet touching the egg).\n\n* **Irreversible Change:** A change that cannot be undone or reversed, like cooking an egg.\n\n* **Protein:** A substance in food (like in eggs) that changes when heated.\n\n* **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is; a measure of how fast the particles in matter are moving.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Egg Cooking Stations:** Set up a safe, supervised cooking station where students observe eggs being cooked using different methods (boiling, frying, scrambling). Have them record observations about how the appearance and texture change differently based on the cooking method. Discuss how different amounts of thermal energy create different results.\n\n2. **Heat Transfer Investigation:** Provide students with cups of hot water and various materials (cloth, plastic wrap, aluminum foil, paper). Have them wrap the cups and measure how long it takes for the water to cool. Discuss which materials conduct heat away fastest and slowest, connecting this to real-world applications (oven mitts, insulated containers).\n\n3. **Thermal Energy Drawing & Writing:** Students create a labeled diagram showing the path of thermal energy from the flame → skillet → egg. Have them write captions explaining each step. Use different colors for arrows to represent conduction, convection, and radiation.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *Heat* by Margaret C.

    "fifthgrade": "# 🌡️ Fifth Grade Science Lesson: Thermal Energy and Heat Transfer\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a fried egg cooking on a dark skillet placed over a blue gas flame. The egg white has turned from clear to solid white, and the yolk remains yellow in the center. The heat from the flame below is causing the egg to change from its raw state to a cooked state.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Heat transfer and the effects of thermal energy on matter.\n\n**Why It's Happening:** When the skillet sits over the flame, thermal energy (heat) from the burning gas transfers into the metal pan through conduction. The hot pan then conducts heat into the egg. This thermal energy causes the proteins in the egg white to denature (unwind and bond differently), making the clear, liquid egg white turn opaque and solid. This is an **irreversible change**—once cooked, the egg cannot return to its raw state. The yolk heats more slowly because it's covered by the thicker egg white, which insulates it slightly from direct heat.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Thermal Energy Transfer:** Energy moves from a warmer object (the flame and pan) to a cooler object (the raw egg) until they reach equilibrium or the egg is removed.\n\n* **Conduction:** Heat transfers directly through solid materials touching each other—the flame heats the metal pan, and the pan heats the egg by direct contact.\n\n* **States of Matter and Phase Changes:** The egg white undergoes a chemical change (not just a physical change) when heated, demonstrating that temperature affects how matter behaves.\n\n* **Temperature vs. Heat:** Temperature measures how fast particles are moving; heat is the energy that flows from hot to cold objects. The pan's high temperature causes heat to flow into the egg.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching this lesson, avoid the common misconception that \"heat\" and \"temperature\" are the same thing. Use this analogy: Temperature is like a speedometer (measuring speed), while heat is like the engine (the energy doing the work). Students often confuse these terms, so reinforce the difference repeatedly with concrete examples from their daily lives.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Provide a labeled diagram showing the path of thermal energy from the flame → pan → egg, with arrows indicating heat flow direction. For students who learn better kinesthetically, have them physically act out heat transfer: one student as heat, moving from \"hot zone\" to \"cold zone.\"\n\n**Multiple Means of Action & Expression:** Allow students to document their observations of the cooking egg through drawings, written descriptions, or video recordings rather than requiring only written responses.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** \n5-PS3-1 Use models to describe that energy in animals' food (used for body repair, growth, motion, and to maintain body warmth) was once energy from the sun.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n* [[NGSS:DCI:5-PS3.A]] Definitions of Energy\n* [[NGSS:DCI:5-PS3.B]] Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]] – Energy is transferred when objects interact; energy takes many forms.\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] – The thermal energy from the flame causes observable changes in the egg's appearance and texture.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n* **What do you observe happening to the egg white as it cooks, and why do you think those changes are occurring?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n* **If we removed the egg from the hot pan right now, would it go back to looking like a raw egg? Why or why not?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n* **Where is the thermal energy coming from in this picture, and how does it travel to reach the egg?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2)\n\n* **How is cooking an egg similar to or different from melting an ice cube? What does this tell us about thermal energy?** (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Thermal Energy:** The energy that comes from heat; the faster the particles in an object move, the more thermal energy it has.\n\n* **Conduction:** The transfer of heat through direct contact between two objects or materials touching each other.\n\n* **Temperature:** A measure of how fast the particles in an object are moving; measured in degrees.\n\n* **Irreversible Change:** A change that cannot be undone or reversed (like cooking an egg); different from a reversible change like freezing water.\n\n* **Heat:** The flow of thermal energy from a warmer object to a cooler object.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n**Activity 1: Thermal Energy Investigation Station**\nSet up stations where students safely observe different materials being heated (with supervision): a piece of butter melting, chocolate softening, a sugar cube dissolving in hot water. Have students predict which materials will change reversibly vs. irreversibly, then record their observations. Discuss why some changes can be \"undone\" and others cannot.\n\n**Activity 2: Energy Tracking Challenge**\nGive students a card or worksheet tracing the energy path: \"Where did the energy in this cooked egg come from?\" Students draw or write the journey backward (sun → plant/grain → chicken → egg → your body). This connects to PS3-1 and helps them understand energy conservation across systems.\n\n**Activity 3: Design a Better Insulator**\nChallenge students to design a \"blanket\" (using foam, cloth, air pockets, etc.) that slows down heat transfer to an egg. Using identical eggs and heat sources, students test their insulators by measuring how long it takes for the egg white to set. Discuss which materials were best conductors vs. insulators.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *Heat* by Marion Dane Bauer (Let's Read and Find Out Science Series) – Explains thermal energy and heat transfer in accessible language.\n* *What is the Sun?* by Janet Slingerland – Connects the sun as the ultimate energy source to everyday thermal phenomena.\n* *The Magic School Bus and the Electric Field Trip* by Joanna Cole – While focused on electricity, it covers energy transfer concepts that transfer to thermal energy lessons.\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n* **\"Heat Transfer for Kids\"** by SciShow Kids – A 5-minute overview of conduction, convection, and radiation with clear visuals.
