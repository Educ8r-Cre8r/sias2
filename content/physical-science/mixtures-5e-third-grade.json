  "content": "# Mixing It Up: A Third Grade Investigation of Materials and Motion\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Mixing and combining materials:** Different dry and wet ingredients can be combined together to create new mixtures with different properties.\n- **Observable changes in materials:** When materials are mixed together, their appearance, texture, and properties can change (the dry brown powder becomes darker and wetter when mixed with the red liquid).\n- **Forces and motion in mixing:** Whisks, paddles, and mechanical tools apply forces that move and blend materials together, demonstrating how tools help us combine substances.\n- **Properties of materials before and after combining:** Individual materials (dry flour-like powder, liquid sauce, sugar) have distinct properties that change when mixed together.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Mixing Machines: How Forces Blend Ingredients**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (approximately 90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** 3-PS2-1 (Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object); 3-PS2-2 (Make observations and/or measurements of an object's motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- **Observe and describe** how different forces (pushing, pulling, stirring) affect the motion of materials in a mixture.\n- **Predict and test** how the speed or direction of a mixing tool changes how quickly ingredients combine.\n- **Measure and record** observations about the time and effort needed to mix different combinations of materials.\n- **Explain the relationship** between the force applied (how hard or fast you mix) and the result (how well ingredients blend).\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about forces and mixing by examining the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph of the mixing setup\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Small bowl with dry ingredients (flour, cinnamon, sugar mixed together)\n- Wooden spoon\n- One whisk\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or print it large enough for all students to see. Point to the bowl with the brown dry mixture and the bowl with the red liquid.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you think is happening in this picture? Why are there two bowls with different things in them?\"\n   - \"What tool do you see in the left bowl? What do you think that whisk is used for?\"\n   - \"If we poured the red liquid into the brown powder, what do you think would happen? Would it change? How?\"\n   - \"Have you ever mixed something at home—like making cookies, a smoothie, or chocolate milk? What did you do to mix it together?\"\n\n3. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"Today we're going to be mixing detectives. We're going to investigate how the **tool we use** and **how hard we push and pull** it can change how fast ingredients mix together. What do you think will happen if we stir slowly instead of fast?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper with drawings or words.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's get our hands on some mixing tools and do our own experiment to see what really happens!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how different forces (stirring speed, tool choice, amount of force) affect how quickly ingredients mix.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- Small bowl or cup (opaque preferred so students can't see through)\n- Dry ingredient mixture: 3 tablespoons flour + 1 tablespoon cocoa powder + 1 tablespoon cinnamon\n- Liquid: 1/4 cup water (or food coloring mixed with water for visual effect)\n- Three mixing tools: wooden spoon, whisk, fork\n- Stopwatch or timer (teacher-led or student-managed)\n- Paper towels or small mat to prevent spills\n- Data recording sheet (see below)\n- Measuring spoons\n\n**Student Directions (written simply on chart or board):**\n\n1. **Set up:** Pour your dry mixture into a bowl. Make sure all students in your group can see it.\n\n2. **First test – Slow stirring:** Pour 1/4 cup of water into the bowl. Use the **wooden spoon** to stir **slowly and gently** (like you're moving sleepily). Have one partner use a timer to count how many seconds it takes for the mixture to look mostly blended (no big lumps of dry powder). Write down the number.\n\n3. **Second test – Fast stirring:** Pour a new bowl with the same dry mixture. Pour 1/4 cup of water. Use the **same wooden spoon** but this time stir **quickly and hard** (like you're in a hurry!). Count how many seconds it takes to blend. Write down the number.\n\n4. **Third test – Different tool:** Pour a new bowl with dry mixture. Pour 1/4 cup of water. Now use the **whisk** instead. Stir at a **normal speed**. Count the seconds. Write down the number.\n\n5. **What did you notice?** Draw a picture or write words about which tool or method mixed the ingredients the fastest. Did the force you used (slow vs. fast) matter?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group and ask: \"What are you noticing? Is the slow stirring mixing it as fast as the fast stirring? Why do you think that is?\"\n- Help students start their timers but do **not** tell them the answer.\n- Encourage them to keep stirring until they see a real change.\n- Ask: \"Can you feel the difference in your arm when you stir slowly vs. fast? That's the force you're using!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that **faster stirring blends ingredients more quickly** than slow stirring.\n- Students will notice that different **tools work differently**—the whisk might move the mixture around differently than the spoon.\n- Students will record observations and numbers on their data sheet.\n- Students will make a simple drawing or written statement about which method worked best.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to the concepts of force and motion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- The original photograph (projected again)\n- Students' data sheets from Explore phase\n- Drawing of a whisk and spoon with arrows showing motion\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 2-3 groups to share their results:\n   - \"How many seconds did it take with slow stirring? With fast stirring?\"\n   - \"Which was faster? Why do you think fast stirring worked better?\"\n   - \"What did the whisk do differently than the spoon?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with a chart visible to all students:\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|----------|--------------------------------|\n| **Force** | A push or pull that makes something move or change. When you stir, your arm is using force. |\n| **Motion** | When something moves from one place to another. The spoon moves in circles; the liquid moves around the bowl. |\n| **Speed** | How fast or slow something moves. Fast stirring is higher speed; slow stirring is lower speed. |\n| **Mixing** | Combining two or more materials together so they become one new thing. |\n| **Tool** | An object we use to help us do work. A whisk and spoon are both mixing tools. |\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph:**\n   - \"In this picture, someone is using a whisk. A whisk is a tool that pushes and pulls the liquid and powder together.\"\n   - \"Look at all those wires on the whisk—they move through the mixture fast, which is a lot of **force** and **motion**!\"\n   - \"The person had to decide: 'Should I stir slowly or fast?' Your experiment showed us that **force matters**.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I want to mix ingredients really fast, should I stir slowly or use more force?\"\n   - Ask: \"What force did you use with your arm when you stirred? A push? A pull? Both?\"\n   - Have students show with their hands how a whisk moves (circular motion).\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or change.\n- **Motion:** The act of moving or changing position.\n- **Speed:** How fast or slow something moves.\n- **Mixing:** Combining two or more materials together.\n- **Tool:** An object we use to help us do work.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that **more force (faster stirring) = faster mixing**.\n- Students can identify **force and motion** in the mixing process.\n- Students recognize that **tools change how force works** (whisk vs. spoon).\n- Students can use the vocabulary words in simple sentences about their experiment.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of force and motion by designing and testing a way to mix without using their hands.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small bowls with dry ingredient mixture (same as Explore)\n- Water or colored water\n- Assortment of tools: forks, spoons, whisks, plastic straws, small spatulas, wooden sticks\n- Stopwatches or timers\n- Chart for recording: \"Tool Name,\" \"What Force Did It Use?\", \"How Fast Did It Mix?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**\"Tool Challenge: Design the Best Mixer\"**\n\n1. **Present the challenge:** \"Now that you know that force and speed matter for mixing, I'm going to give you a challenge. You get to **pick a tool** from this collection and design a **mixing plan**. Your goal: Mix ingredients as fast as you can using your tool. But here's the trick—your tool can only **push or pull** the mixture. You decide how fast!\"\n\n2. **Student steps:**\n   - Choose one tool from the collection.\n   - Pour dry mixture and water into a bowl.\n   - Plan: \"Will I use fast or slow motions with my tool? Why?\"\n   - Test your plan. Time how long it takes to blend.\n   - Compare your time to your Explore results. Did this tool work better or worse?\n\n3. **Group discussion after testing:**\n   - \"What tool did you choose? Did it use more or less force than the spoon?\"\n   - \"Was the mixing faster or slower? Why do you think that happened?\"\n   - \"If you could invent a **new mixing tool**, what would it look like? What kind of force would it use?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Why did you choose that tool? What kind of force does it use—pushing, pulling, or both?\"\n- Help students see that tools with **more contact area** (like a whisk) might mix differently.\n- Encourage students to predict before testing: \"What do you think will happen?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding of force to predict and test new mixing scenarios.\n- Students recognize that **different tools use force in different ways**.\n- Students can **explain cause and effect**: \"The fork didn't work as well because it has thin wires and doesn't push the mixture around as much.\"\n- Students develop simple design thinking: choosing a tool and explaining their choice.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how force and motion affect mixing.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Listen to students' language. Do they describe **speed** (\"fast\" or \"slow\")? Do they mention **effort** (\"hard\" or \"easy\")? Do they recognize that stirring causes **motion**?\n- **During Explain:** Can students use the vocabulary words—force, motion, speed—in their own sentences?\n- **During Elaborate:** Do students make **predictions** before testing a new tool? Can they explain **why** one tool worked better?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nGive each student a simple sheet with these questions (read aloud; students can draw or write):\n\n1. **Draw or write:** Show two ways to stir a mixture—one slow way and one fast way. Label which one uses more **force**.\n\n2. **Answer in a sentence or picture:** \"If you want to mix chocolate powder into milk really fast, should you stir slowly or fast? Why?\"\n\n3. **Complete the sentence:** \"A **force** is a _____ or _____ that makes something _____.\"\n\n4. **True or False:** \"Whisks and spoons both mix ingredients, but they use force differently.\" (Circle True or False and draw or explain why.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student recognizes that **faster motion requires more force**.\n- ✓ Student can **identify force** (push or pull) in the mixing process.\n- ✓ Student understands that **different tools** create different types of motion.\n- ✓ Student can **predict** how force affects mixing speed.\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary words (force, motion, speed, mixing, tool) appropriately.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students who meet expectations will explain: \"Fast stirring mixes faster because you use more force\" and identify force as a push or pull.\n- Students exceeding expectations will design or describe a new tool and explain how its force would affect mixing.\n- Students needing support will recognize that fast is better than slow and can identify motion in mixing.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**SUPPORT (for students who need scaffolding):**\n\n1. **Reduce variables:** Give these students **only two tools to compare** (spoon and whisk) rather than the full collection. Provide a simplified data sheet with pictures and checkboxes instead of writing.\n\n2. **Provide a \"force helper\":** Have students work with a partner or teacher aide who repeats the vocabulary: \"Are you using more force now? What motion is happening? Is it moving fast?\" This reinforces language and observation.\n\n3. **Pre-teach timing:** If students struggle with stopwatches, practice counting seconds together or use a simple verbal count (\"1-Mississippi, 2-Mississippi...\") before the Explore phase. Alternatively, just count \"how many stirs\" until it's mixed instead of timing seconds.\n\n**CHALLENGE (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Predict motion patterns:** Ask: \"If I stir in a circle, do you think the mixture will move differently than if I stir up and down? Make a prediction and test it. How would you explain what you see?\" This pushes them to connect **direction of force** to **direction of motion** (aligning with 3-PS2-2).\n\n2. **Design a tool:** \"Imagine you're an engineer. Design a new mixing tool using a pencil, rubber bands, and straws. Draw your design. Explain what **forces** it would use and why you think it would mix fast or slow.\" This requires deeper reasoning about force and tool design.\n\n3. **Measure more carefully:** Have advanced students **measure the mixing time** to the nearest 5 seconds and create a simple bar graph comparing slow vs. fast vs. tool results. Ask: \"What pattern do you see? Can you predict how long it would take if we stirred **super fast**?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Real-world mixing hunt:** Take students on a \"force and motion walk\" around the classroom or kitchen (if available). Identify tools that mix or blend (egg beater, food processor, blender, paint mixer). For each, ask: \"What kind of force does this use? Does it push, pull, or both? Is the motion fast or slow?\" Create a class poster documenting each tool.\n\n2. **Story problem investigations:** Present scenarios like \"Mom is making cookie dough but she's in a hurry. Should she stir slowly or fast? Why?\" or \"A scientist is mixing paint colors. She wants them perfectly blended, not splashed everywhere. What kind of force should she use?\" Students draw or write their reasoning, connecting force to real-world outcomes.\n\n3. **Home mixing experiment (homework/optional):** Send a simple instruction sheet home asking families to help their child observe someone mixing (cooking, making juice, etc.). Students report back: \"What tool did they use? Was the motion fast or slow? Did the force change the mixing?\" This bridges home and school science and deepens observational skills.\n\n---",
