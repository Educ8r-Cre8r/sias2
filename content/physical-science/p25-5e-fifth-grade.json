ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about light, shadows, and how objects interact with light using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed on projector or smart board, or printed copies)\n- Classroom light source\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board. Ask students to observe quietly for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about the red flowers in this picture? Why do they look so bright?\"\n   - \"Look at the shadows in the background. Where is the light coming from in this room? How do you know?\"\n   - \"If I turned off that hanging lamp, what would change in this picture?\"\n   - \"Why can you see through the clear vase, but you can't see through the flowers?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to show you some different materials in our classroom. I want you to predict: Will light pass through it, or will it block light and make a shadow?\" Write student predictions on chart paper.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become light detectives. We'll investigate how light travels, what blocks it, and what lets it through—just like in this photograph.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate light behavior through hands-on exploration of transparent, translucent, and opaque materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 flashlight per pair of students (or use classroom lamp)\n- Clear plastic sheet or clear plastic cup\n- Frosted plastic sheet or tissue paper\n- Opaque cardboard or construction paper\n- Opaque objects (pencil, book, coin)\n- White poster board or white paper (to observe shadows)\n- Masking tape\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Work with a partner. One person will be the 'Light Keeper' (holds the flashlight), and one person will be the 'Shadow Tracker' (watches and records).\"\n\n2. \"In a darkened corner of the classroom, shine your flashlight on the white poster board.\"\n\n3. \"Place the **clear plastic** between the light and the poster board. What do you see? Does light pass through? Is there a shadow? Record what you observe using drawings and words on your data sheet.\"\n\n4. \"Repeat Step 3 with the **frosted plastic/tissue paper.** Shine the same light through it. What happens now?\"\n\n5. \"Repeat Step 3 with the **opaque cardboard.** What is different?\"\n\n6. \"Now place an **opaque object** (pencil, coin) on the poster board and shine the light from above and from the side. Observe the shadows. Do they change shape or position?\"\n\n7. \"Trade roles. The Shadow Tracker becomes the Light Keeper, and repeat all observations.\"\n\n**What students should record:**\n- Drawings of shadows (or lack thereof) for each material\n- Written descriptions: \"Light passed through,\" \"Light did not pass through,\" \"I could see through it, but it was fuzzy\"\n- Observations about how shadow shape/size changed when the light direction changed\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Dim the lights to optimize shadow visibility.\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions without revealing answers: \"What do you see happening? Does the light go through this material? Can you see a shadow?\"\n- Encourage students to test each material multiple times and from different angles.\n- Resist telling students the names of material types—let them discover through observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that clear materials allow light to pass through with sharp shadows behind them.\n- Students will observe that frosted/translucent materials allow some light through but create blurry or dim shadows.\n- Students will observe that opaque materials block all light and create dark, defined shadows.\n- Students will notice that shadow size and shape change based on light position.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and concepts through guided discussion anchored in student observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations as a class.** Ask pairs to share one thing they discovered: \"What happened when you shined light through the clear plastic? What about the frosted plastic? What about the cardboard?\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary using student examples:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Transparent:** A material that light passes through clearly. You can see objects on the other side without them looking blurry. (Example: clear plastic, window glass)\n   - **Translucent:** A material that lets some light through, but not clearly. Objects behind it look fuzzy or unclear. (Example: frosted plastic, wax paper, tissue paper)\n   - **Opaque:** A material that does NOT let any light pass through. It blocks light and creates a dark shadow. (Example: wood, cardboard, metal)\n   - **Shadow:** A dark area created when an opaque object blocks light from reaching a surface.\n   - **Light source:** Anything that makes or produces light. (Example: lamp, sun, flashlight, light bulb)\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Look at the vase in the picture. Is the glass transparent, translucent, or opaque?\" (Transparent—we can see the water and flowers through it clearly.)\n   - \"Are the red flowers transparent, translucent, or opaque?\" (Opaque—they block light and create shadows on the wall.)\n   - \"The hanging lamp is a light source. The flowers are blocking its light. That's why we see shadows.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:** Hold up objects around the classroom (piece of paper, plastic bottle, window). Ask students to stand on one side of the room if the object is transparent, another if translucent, and a third if opaque. (This is a kinesthetic quick-check.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define transparent, translucent, and opaque using their own observations.\n- Students can classify materials correctly based on how light interacts with them.\n- Students understand that shadows form when light is blocked by opaque objects.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Deepen understanding by applying light concepts to predict and design a new scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Flashlights or lamps\n- 3D objects of various opacities (clear cup, frosted plastic cup, wooden block, clear water in a cup, colored water in a cup)\n- White poster board\n- Optional: colored cellophane, colored tissue paper\n- Pencils for drawing\n- Prediction sheets\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Prediction Challenge:** Show students a setup where a flashlight will be placed in a new position. Ask students to **draw on their prediction sheet** where they think the shadow will appear before you turn on the light.\n\n2. **Example scenario:** Place a wooden block on the poster board. Show students where the light will shine from (from the left side, elevated). Ask: \"Where will the shadow be? Will it be short or long? Will it be dark or light?\"\n\n3. **Test the prediction.** Shine the light. Students compare their drawings to the actual shadow.\n\n4. **Explore with colored materials:** Provide colored cellophane or colored water. Ask: \"What happens if I put colored transparent material in front of the light? Does the shadow color change?\" Students predict, then test.\n\n5. **Application question:** \"If you were designing a stage light for a school play, and you wanted to make a big shadow of an actor on the stage, where would you put the light? Would you put it close to the actor or far away? Would you put it high or low?\" Students explain their reasoning using what they learned.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate predictions without judgment.\n- Encourage students to test predictions and revise their thinking.\n- Ask: \"What surprised you?\" and \"Why did the shadow look different than you predicted?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly predict shadow location and approximate size based on light position.\n- Students recognize that transparent colored materials change the appearance of light without blocking it.\n- Students apply understanding of light behavior to real-world scenarios (stage lights, flashlights, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light behavior, material properties, and shadow formation.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Can students correctly classify materials as transparent/translucent/opaque based on how light passes through?\n- Kinesthetic sort (during Explain): Do students stand in the correct group for object classification?\n- Predictions during Elaborate: Are student predictions becoming more accurate as they refine their understanding?\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a sheet containing these questions:\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Draw a picture showing a light source, an opaque object, and where the shadow would be.\n\n2. **Vocabulary check:** Circle the correct answer:\n   - A window is: **transparent / translucent / opaque**\n   - Frosted glass is: **transparent / translucent / opaque**\n   - A wooden door is: **transparent / translucent / opaque**\n\n3. **Explain:** \"Why does a shadow form? Use the words 'light,' 'block,' and 'opaque' in your answer.\"\n\n4. **Apply:** \"If you have a flashlight and a pencil, how could you make a small shadow? How could you make a big shadow? Explain.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly draws light source, object, and shadow location\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies at least 2 of 3 materials by type\n- ✓ Student's shadow explanation includes the idea that opaque objects block light\n- ✓ Student demonstrates understanding that shadow size/position depends on light position\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly classify materials and predict shadow formation.\n- Students will articulate that shadows form when light is blocked by opaque objects.\n- Students will demonstrate that light position affects shadow size and location.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"see-through,\" \"fuzzy,\" and \"dark\" instead of transparent/translucent/opaque during early phases. Introduce formal terms in Explain phase with repeated examples.\n\n2. **Hands-on sorting:** Instead of written exit ticket, provide printed images of materials (window, frosted glass, wood, etc.) for students to physically sort into three categories as you facilitate the conversation.\n\n3. **Partner with stronger peer:** During Elaborate, pair struggling students with advanced peers so they can observe and participate in prediction tasks while the peer leads recording.\n\n4. **Reduce number of materials:** Use only 2 types of objects (clear and opaque) in initial Explore phase. Add translucent materials only after mastery.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Investigate light refraction:** Provide a clear plastic cup with water and a pencil. Ask: \"Why does the pencil look bent under water? Test whether this works with opaque liquids (chocolate milk) or translucent liquids (apple juice).\" Students investigate and explain that transparent materials can bend light (refraction), not just pass through it.\n\n2. **Design a shadow puppet show:** Challenge students to create a story using opaque objects and a light source. Students must position the light strategically to create specific shadow sizes and shapes. They present to the class, explaining their light placement decisions.\n\n3. **Explore light sources in the environment:** Ask students to go on a \"light hunt\" around the school, identifying all light sources and classifying objects by transparency near each light. They create a map or written report.\n\n4. **Predict and test with multiple light sources:** Provide two flashlights and ask: \"What happens to shadows when two light sources shine on one object? Can you make two shadows? Why?\" Students investigate and present findings.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Sunrise and Sunset Investigation:** Connect to Earth Science standards by exploring how the position of the sun (light source) during different times of day changes shadow length and direction. Students observe their own shadows outside at different times (morning, noon, afternoon) and record how they change. Link to the lesson: \"Just like we moved the flashlight to change shadow size, Earth's movement changes where sunlight hits us.\"\n\n2. **Natural Light Scavenger Hunt:** Students take a classroom/hallway tour with clipboards, identifying transparent, translucent, and opaque objects. They photograph or sketch 2–3 examples of each and create a classroom poster titled \"What's See-Through in Our School?\" Reinforces vocabulary in authentic context.\n\n3. **Create an Opacity Scale:** Provide students with 5–6 materials of varying opacity (clear plastic, wax paper, thin tissue, thick paper, etc.). Students rank them from \"most see-through\" to \"least see-through\" by shining light through each and comparing. They create a visual scale or number line to display. This bridges toward quantitative thinking about material properties.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure flashlights and lamps are cool before handling. If using classroom lamps, keep them away from water and never leave unattended.\n- **Lighting setup:** Darken the room as much as possible during Explore and Elaborate phases for optimal shadow visibility. Close blinds, use a corner, or create a small \"investigation station.\"\n- **Prior knowledge:** This lesson assumes students have seen shadows and understand that objects block light. A quick pre-assessment question (\"What makes a shadow?\") can gauge starting knowledge.\n- **Connection to energy (5-PS3-1):** If you want to emphasize energy transformation, explicitly discuss during Explain: \"The lamp turns electrical energy into light energy. Light is energy traveling. When it hits the flowers, that energy is blocked, and we see a shadow.\" This is subtle but important for the NGSS standard.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson uses the photograph as a springboard for authentic inquiry into light behavior while maintaining safety, engagement, and age-appropriate rigor for Fifth Grade.",
