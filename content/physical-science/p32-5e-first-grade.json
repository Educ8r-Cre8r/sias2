Observe and describe what happens when light shines through a transparent material (a soap bubble).\n2. Identify that we can see objects only when light reaches them.\n3. Investigate how different materials (transparent vs. opaque) allow or block light differently.\n4. Create bubbles and record observations about how light interacts with them.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital display of the bubble photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: flashlight or lamp visible in classroom\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projected where all students can see it clearly. Ask students to sit in a circle on the carpet.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** (pause after each for 15-20 seconds of think time):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What colors do you notice?\" *(Students should identify the rainbow colors on the bubble.)*\n   - \"How do you think the bubble got these pretty colors?\" *(Accept all responses without judgment.)*\n   - \"Where do you think the light is coming from that lets us see the colors?\" *(Point gently to the sunlight in the background of the photo.)*\n   - \"What do you think the bubble is made of? Is it solid or see-through?\" *(Guide toward the idea that bubbles are transparent—you can see through them.)*\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Say, \"I wonder why we can see the rainbow colors only when light shines on the bubble. Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Record predictions** on chart paper: \"What will happen when light shines on a bubble?\" Write down 2-3 student predictions word-for-word.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to make our own bubbles and use light to explore what makes those beautiful colors appear!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bubble solution (recipe: 1 cup water + 2 tablespoons dish soap + 1 tablespoon corn syrup)\n- Bubble wands (pipe cleaners bent into loops or commercial wands) — 1 per student or per pair\n- Small cups or bowls of bubble solution\n- Flashlights or desk lamps — 1-2 per small group\n- White paper or white poster board\n- Observation sheets (half-page, with pictures: \"What I see on my bubble\" with drawings of sun, colors, lines)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity — Hands-On Bubble Investigation:**\n\n**Step-by-step Student Directions:**\n1. \"Dip your bubble wand into the solution slowly. Blow gently to make a bubble.\"\n2. \"Let the bubble float in front of you. What colors do you see? Can you see your hand through the bubble?\" *(Transparent property.)*\n3. \"Now, I'm going to shine the flashlight on your bubble. Watch what happens to the colors!\" *(Teacher or helper shines light source on the bubble.)*\n4. \"Does the bubble look the same when the light shines on it? Are the colors brighter, dimmer, or different?\"\n5. \"Now try making a bubble with NO light shining on it. What colors do you see?\" *(Students explore in dimmer area.)*\n6. \"Record what you observed by coloring or drawing on your observation sheet.\"\n\n**How This Connects to the Photograph:**\n\"The bubble in our picture is showing the same thing you just saw — when light shines on a bubble, we see beautiful rainbow colors!\"\n\n**What Students Should Record or Document:**\n- Drawings of the colors they saw on their bubble\n- Answers to: \"Did the light make the colors brighter?\" (Yes/No with a picture)\n- A simple sentence dictated to the teacher or written independently: \"I saw ___ colors on my bubble.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among small groups; don't correct or lead.\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"How is your bubble different when the light shines on it?\"\n- Help students refocus if they start playing instead of observing.\n- Have students blow bubbles over white paper so colors show up more clearly.\n- Manage the flashlights — assign one student as \"light keeper\" per group.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that bubbles are see-through (transparent).\n- Students will observe that light makes the colors on bubbles visible and bright.\n- Students will notice bubbles are harder to see in dim light.\n- Each student will produce an observation drawing with at least 2 colors labeled or shown.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Printed vocabulary cards with pictures (see Vocabulary section below)\n- The bubble photograph displayed again\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 students to share what they observed: \"Tell us about the colors on your bubble.\"\n   - Ask: \"How many people saw colors when the light shined on their bubble?\" (Show of hands.)\n   - Ask: \"Could you see through your bubble?\" (Yes/No responses.)\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   Display vocabulary cards and repeat each term 2-3 times. Use the photograph and student bubbles (if still available) as reference points.\n\n3. **Make Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"This bubble looks see-through, just like yours did. Do you see the colors? That's because sunlight is shining on it!\"\n   - Revisit predictions from Engage: \"We predicted that light would make the colors show. Were we right? What did you discover?\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   Ask: \"Show me with your thumbs: Did light help us see the colors on the bubbles?\" (Thumbs up = yes, thumbs middle = not sure, thumbs down = no.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Light** | Energy that lets us see things. Light comes from the sun, lamps, and flashlights. |\n| **Transparent** | Something you can see through, like a bubble, glass, or clear plastic. |\n| **Reflect** | When light bounces off something. (Simple version: Light bounces and makes the colors appear.) |\n| **Colors** | Different shades of light that our eyes can see. Bubbles show a rainbow because light bounces around inside them. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can point to or name something transparent in the classroom.\n- Students understand that light is needed to see the colors on bubbles.\n- Students can explain in simple words: \"Bubbles are see-through and light makes them colorful.\"\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bubble solution and wands (from Explore)\n- Flashlights or lamps\n- Various transparent and opaque objects: clear plastic cup, white foam cup, clear plastic bag, tissue paper, cardboard\n- White poster board or chart paper\n- Crayons, markers\n\n**Activity — Testing Different Materials:**\n\n**Setup:**\nDivide class into 2-3 small groups. Set up stations with different materials.\n\n**Student Task:**\n\"We know bubbles are transparent and let light shine through. Let's test other things! Is this material transparent (see-through) or opaque (you can't see through it)? We'll shine light on it and see!\"\n\n**Step-by-Step:**\n1. Student places one material in the path of the flashlight beam on white paper.\n2. Student observes: Does light come through it? Can you see a shadow or a bright spot?\n3. Marks on a simple chart: ✓ Light comes through or ✗ Light does NOT come through.\n4. Draws the material and labels it: \"See-through\" or \"Blocks light.\"\n\n**Real-World Connection:**\n\"A bubble is see-through like a window, but that foam cup blocks light like a wall. That's why we can see through some things and not others!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate at one station; have a teaching assistant or advanced student lead another.\n- Ask: \"What happens when light hits this material?\"\n- Record observations on a class chart for later reference.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can sort materials into two groups: transparent and opaque.\n- Students understand that some materials let light pass through and others block it.\n- Each student contributes one drawing or mark to the class chart.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Did the student notice the colors when light shined on the bubble?\n- Thumbs check during Explain: Can the student respond to \"Did light help us see the colors?\"\n- Sorting activity in Elaborate: Can the student correctly identify transparent vs. opaque materials?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\nProvide each student with a half-page exit ticket (can be done individually or in pairs with teacher support).\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n1. **Draw a picture:** \"Draw the bubble with light shining on it. What colors do you see?\" \n   - *Success criteria:* Student draws a bubble and includes at least 2 colors (even if not perfectly realistic).\n\n2. **Tell or write:** \"Why do you think we could see the colors on the bubble?\" \n   - *Accept responses such as:* \"Because light was on it,\" \"The light made it colorful,\" \"Light shined on it.\"\n   - *Success criteria:* Student mentions light or how light helped them see.\n\n3. **Yes/No question:** \"Can light shine through a bubble?\" \n   - *Success criteria:* Student says \"Yes\" and can point to or name something transparent.\n\n**Success Criteria for Learning Objectives:**\n- **Objective 1 (Observe transparent materials):** Student can identify that bubbles are see-through.\n- **Objective 2 (Light needed to see):** Student explains that light makes the colors visible.\n- **Objective 3 (Different materials):** Student sorts at least 3 items correctly as transparent or opaque.\n- **Objective 4 (Record observations):** Student's drawings include colors and show understanding of what light does.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify that light is needed to see colors on bubbles.\n- 75% of students will create a drawing showing a bubble with colors.\n- 70% of students will sort transparent and opaque materials with 2 out of 3 correct.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Use only two terms (\"see-through\" and \"light\") instead of four. Skip \"reflect\" for this group.\n2. **Buddy system:** Pair with a more experienced observer during Explore. Let the student hold the flashlight while the buddy blows bubbles.\n3. **Simplified recording:** Provide a pre-drawn bubble outline and ask student to color the colors they see, rather than drawing from scratch.\n4. **One-on-one flashlight time:** Rotate this student to shine the light themselves so they have clear ownership and focus.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n1. **Prediction challenge:** Before Elaborate, ask, \"If we tape paper over half the bubble wand, what will happen to the bubble? Will it still have colors?\" Have them test and explain their results.\n2. **Material investigation extension:** Give these students 5-6 materials and ask them to arrange them from \"most see-through\" to \"least see-through.\" Have them explain their ordering using observations.\n3. **Sun connection:** Show a picture of the sun and ask, \"Why do you think we needed light to see the bubble colors? What if we did this experiment at night inside with only a dim light?\" Encourage them to make predictions based on what they learned.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Shadow Exploration (Follow-up lesson):**\n   Set up a light source and have students create shadow puppets with their hands and transparent/opaque objects. Discuss: \"Why does the bubble not make a dark shadow like the foam cup?\" Connects to light blocking and transparency.\n\n2. **Bubble and Light Color Walk:**\n   Take students outside on a sunny day with bubble wands. Have them blow bubbles and observe the colors in sunlight vs. shade. Create a class book: \"Where did we see the brightest colors?\" Reinforces that bright light shows colors best.\n\n3. **Design a Window Activity:**\n   Provide each student with a paper frame and a choice of transparent material (clear plastic wrap, cellophane, or plastic bag) or opaque material (construction paper, foil). Have them glue it into the frame and test it with a flashlight. Display as \"Our Windows\" and label \"See-Through\" or \"Blocks Light.\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n- **Safety reminder:** Supervise flashlight use; ensure students don't point lights directly into eyes.\n- **Bubble solution prep:** Make 15-20 minutes before lesson; it works best when slightly cooled.\n- **Outdoor alternative:** This lesson works beautifully outdoors on a sunny day. Natural sunlight makes the rainbow colors much more vivid.\n- **Photo display:** Keep the original photograph posted throughout the week as a reference point. Students will point to it during discussions and make connections.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly uses the photograph as the scientific anchor point and guides students through authentic discovery of how light interacts with transparent materials — a foundational physical science concept for First Grade.**",
