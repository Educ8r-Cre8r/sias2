ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about forces and motion using the skateboarding photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the skateboarding photograph (or display via projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Short video clip (10–15 seconds) of skateboarding tricks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds without talking. Tell them to notice the skater's body position, the skateboard location, and anything else that looks interesting.\n\n2. **Facilitate a whole-group discussion** using these specific questions:\n   - \"What do you notice the skater's body is doing in this moment? Is the skater moving fast or slow? How do you know?\"\n   - \"Where is the skateboard compared to the skater? Why do you think the skateboard and the skater are separated in this photo?\"\n   - \"What do you think will happen immediately after this photo is taken? What will pull the skater back down?\"\n   - \"If the skater didn't push down with their feet, would they jump at all? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations** on chart paper without correcting misconceptions (these will be addressed in Explain).\n\n4. **Pose a Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what forces are pushing and pulling on the skater right now, even though we can't see them?\" Write 2–3 student wonderings on chart paper. Save this paper for the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great observations! Today, we're going to discover more about the invisible forces that make skateboarders jump and move by doing our own investigations with objects that move.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate forces and motion through hands-on experimentation with simple objects and ramps.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- 1 toy car or rolling toy (matchbox car, small ball, or skateboard toy model if available)\n- 1 cardboard ramp (or ruler propped at an angle on a stack of books)\n- 1 metric ruler or measuring tape\n- 5–6 small objects (blocks, erasers, toy figures) to use as \"barriers\" on the ground\n- 1 sheet of white paper for recording\n- Markers or colored pencils\n\n**Activity: \"Push, Roll, and Stop\" Investigation**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Set up your ramp** by propping a ruler or piece of cardboard at a low angle on books. Place your toy car at the top.\n\n2. **Release the car** (without pushing) and watch what happens. Measure and record how far the car travels on the flat ground before stopping. Write this distance down.\n\n3. **Now try again, but this time place a small block or eraser about 2 feet from the bottom of the ramp** (acting like a barrier). Release the car again. Does the car still travel the same distance, or does it stop sooner? Record what happened.\n\n4. **Repeat the investigation three more times** with the barrier in different positions (closer to the ramp, farther away, very far away). Each time, record whether the car hits the barrier, how far it goes, and how fast it seems to be moving.\n\n5. **Draw a diagram** on your paper showing:\n   - Where the car started\n   - Where it ended (in each trial)\n   - The barrier location\n   - An arrow showing the direction the car moved\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to ensure each group understands the task but is **not** being told what will happen.\n- Ask students guiding questions: \"What stopped your car?\" \"Did gravity pull the car down the ramp, or did you push it?\" \"What would happen if there were no ground—would the car eventually stop?\"\n- Avoid confirming or correcting student conclusions until the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that the car rolls down the ramp and slows down on flat ground.\n- Students notice that barriers interrupt the car's motion.\n- Students discover that the car eventually stops even without a barrier.\n- Students begin to recognize that something is \"pushing back\" against the rolling car (friction).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to the skateboarder photograph using teacher-led discussion and direct instruction.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase (student wonderings)\n- The skateboarding photograph (displayed again)\n- Whiteboard or chart paper for vocabulary\n- Optional: Force diagram template (simple arrows labeled \"push,\" \"pull,\" \"gravity,\" \"friction\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Review student investigations:** Ask 2–3 pairs to share what they discovered. Record key observations on chart paper (e.g., \"The car slowed down,\" \"Something made it stop,\" \"It moved down the ramp without us pushing it\").\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with Fifth Grade-friendly definitions:**\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Force** | A push or pull that makes something move, stop, or change direction. |\n   | **Gravity** | An invisible force that pulls everything on Earth downward toward the ground. |\n   | **Friction** | A force that happens when two surfaces rub together and makes moving objects slow down or stop. |\n   | **Motion** | The act of something moving from one place to another. |\n   | **Energy** | The power to do work or make something move. It comes from food we eat. |\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the skateboarder: \"This skater's muscles used energy from the food they ate to push against the ground. This push is a **force**. That force made the skater and skateboard move upward.\"\n   - Point downward: \"But notice—**gravity** is pulling the skater and skateboard back toward Earth. That's why they will come down. Gravity is always pulling us down.\"\n   - Ask: \"What force do you think will act on the skater when they land—friction? Why?\"\n\n4. **Draw or show a simple force diagram** on the board:\n   - Arrow pointing up (labeled \"Push from muscles\")\n   - Arrow pointing down (labeled \"Gravity\")\n   - Arrow pointing backward (labeled \"Air resistance and friction\")\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Thumbs up if you can tell me one force acting on the skateboarder in this photo.\"\n   - \"Turn to a partner and explain: Why does the skateboard come back down after the skater jumps?\"\n   - Ask 2–3 students to share their explanations aloud.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move, stop, or change direction.\n- **Gravity:** An invisible force that pulls everything on Earth downward toward the ground.\n- **Friction:** A force that happens when two surfaces rub together and makes moving objects slow down or stop.\n- **Motion:** The act of something moving from one place to another.\n- **Energy:** The power to do work or make something move; comes from food we eat.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify at least two forces shown in the skateboarding photograph.\n- Students understand that gravity always pulls objects downward.\n- Students can explain in their own words why the skater comes back down.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding of forces and energy to design and test a real-world model.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- 1 skateboard (toy model) or toy car\n- 1 ramp made from a ruler and books\n- Masking tape\n- Paper cups (small)\n- String or yarn\n- Markers\n- Optional: small action figures or clay models of skateboarders\n\n**Activity: \"Design Your Own Skateboard Jump\"**\n\n1. **Challenge:** \"Using your toy skateboard or car, design a ramp and landing zone that shows how forces affect the skater's motion. You need to:\n   - Build a ramp that launches your skateboard toy into the air (like the skater in the photo).\n   - Predict where it will land using what you know about gravity.\n   - Test your prediction.\n   - Explain what forces made it move that way.\"\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - Build your ramp at different angles (try 30°, 45°, 60°).\n   - Place a piece of tape or mark on the ground to predict where the toy will land.\n   - Launch the toy three times. Measure or observe where it actually lands.\n   - Compare your prediction to your results. Were you right? Why or why not?\n   - Draw a labeled diagram showing: the ramp angle, the direction the toy moved, and the forces acting on it (gravity, push, friction).\n\n3. **Extension prompt:** \"If you made the ramp steeper, would the toy travel farther before gravity pulls it down? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide positive feedback on students' models and predictions.\n- Ask: \"What would happen if there were no friction? Would your toy go farther?\"\n- Encourage students to test predictions and revise their thinking.\n- Take photos of successful models for a classroom display.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students build a functioning model that demonstrates forces and motion.\n- Students make and test a prediction about where an object will land.\n- Students explain the role of gravity and other forces in their model.\n- Students show deeper understanding by connecting the toy model to the real skateboarder photo.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces, gravity, and motion through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist during Explore:** Did students identify barriers as something that stops motion? Did they ask questions about why the car slowed down?\n- **Partner discussion in Explain:** Listen to student explanations. Can they identify at least one force without prompting?\n- **Model building in Elaborate:** Do students' diagrams show gravity acting downward and at least one other force?\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (provided to each student at the end of the lesson):**\n\nPrint this exit ticket for each student or display on the board:\n\n---\n\n**Exit Ticket: Forces and Motion**\n\n**Name:** ________________ **Date:** ________________\n\n**1. Look at the skateboarding photo again. Circle ALL the forces that are acting on the skater RIGHT NOW:**\n   - [ ] Gravity (pulling down)\n   - [ ] Push from muscles (pushing up)\n   - [ ] Friction (slowing down)\n   - [ ] Air pushing the skater forward\n\n**2. Gravity is pulling the skater downward. What will happen to the skater after this photo is taken?**\n   - [ ] The skater will float in the air forever\n   - [ ] The skater will come back down to the ground\n   - [ ] The skater will disappear\n\n**3. In one sentence, explain where the energy came from that made the skater jump so high. (Hint: Think about food!)**\n\n   _______________________________________________________________\n\n**4. Draw an arrow on this skateboard to show the direction gravity is pulling it RIGHT NOW:**\n\n   [Simple skateboard outline provided]\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria for Mastery:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least 2 forces acting on the skater (gravity and push from muscles).\n- ✓ Student correctly predicts that gravity will pull the skater back down.\n- ✓ Student acknowledges that energy comes from food/eating.\n- ✓ Student correctly draws an arrow pointing downward for gravity.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Objectives:**\n- Review exit tickets. Students who answer 3–4 questions correctly have met the objectives.\n- Use observation notes from Explore and Elaborate phases to identify students who need additional support.\n- Discuss student models from Elaborate phase. Can students verbally explain the forces shown?\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards:** Provide picture cards showing each force (gravity = down arrow, push = hand pushing, friction = two surfaces rubbing). Students can point to or hold up the card that matches the force being discussed.\n\n2. **Structured investigation:** During Explore, pair struggling students with a peer or provide a sentence frame: \"The car moved ____________ because ____________.\" This scaffolds their thinking about cause and effect.\n\n3. **Force diagram template:** Provide a pre-drawn diagram of the skateboarder with three blank arrows. Students label each arrow with a force word from a word bank instead of creating from scratch.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Multi-variable investigation:** Ask advanced students to explore how **ramp angle, surface type (smooth vs. rough), and car weight** affect distance traveled. Have them create a data table and graph comparing results.\n\n2. **Real skateboard analysis:** Provide a real skateboard (or high-quality photos). Challenge students to identify materials and explain how friction, gravity, and other forces affect skateboard performance. Example question: \"Why do skateboard wheels spin? What forces act on them?\"\n\n3. **Energy conversion exploration:** Have advanced students research and present on where food energy comes from (sunlight → plants → food) and trace energy flow in the skater's body. This deepens 5-PS3-1 understanding.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Skateboard Park Design Project:** Students design their own skateboard park using foam blocks, cardboard, tape, and toy skateboards. They must explain how forces and gravity affect the tricks possible in their park design. Display final designs with force labels and explanation cards.\n\n2. **Real-World Forces Video Analysis:** Show a short video (2–3 minutes) of professional skateboarding tricks. Pause at key moments and have students identify forces acting on the skater (gravity, friction from wheels, air resistance, push from muscles). Create a class anchor chart of \"Forces in Skateboarding.\"\n\n3. **Friction Investigation:** Expand Explore by testing how different surfaces (smooth floor, carpet, sand) affect how far a toy car travels. Students record data and conclude: \"Which surface has the most friction? Which has the least?\" This connects to real skateboarding surfaces.\n\n4. **Energy and Motion Journal:** Students keep a science journal entry tracking forces and energy they observe during recess or PE class (jumping, running, sliding). They use vocabulary from the lesson and draw diagrams with force arrows.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** If using a real skateboard, ensure all students wear helmets and practice in an open, safe area. Alternatively, use toy skateboards or roller skates indoors.\n- **Pacing:** If students need more time in Explore, extend that phase into a second day. Combine Explain and Elaborate on Day 2.\n- **Misconception alert:** Many Fifth Graders think objects need a continuous push to stay in motion. The phrase \"forces are invisible but real\" helps counter this.\n- **Cross-curricular link:** Connect to Health/PE by discussing how athletes train their muscles to generate force, and to Math by graphing distance traveled in Explore.",
