However, the photograph depicts force and motion concepts. **Teacher Note:** Consider substituting this photograph with one showing sound vibrations or light phenomena, or adapting instruction to Kindergarten standard K-PS2-1 (effects of pushes and pulls on motion) if cross-grade flexibility is permitted. If proceeding with this image despite the mismatch, focus on observable motion patterns and descriptive language about forces as foundational understanding.\n\n*For this lesson plan, we will proceed with force and motion instruction using the photograph as a powerful visual anchor, recognizing that this represents informal, foundational learning that precedes formal 1-PS4 standards.*\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- **Describe what they observe** when an object or person moves, using words like fast, slow, up, down, and over.\n- **Identify pushes and pulls** that make things move in the photograph and in their classroom.\n- **Predict and test** how different amounts of force affect how far or how fast something moves.\n- **Use action words** to explain what happens when forces are applied to objects.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about movement and forces using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (or projected image) of the child jumping over the cone\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Ask students to gather on the carpet where they can all see clearly.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What is the child doing in this picture?\" (Answer: jumping)\n   - \"How did the child's body get up in the air like that?\" (Prompt them to think: What made the child jump? What pushed them up?)\n   - \"Why do you think the child jumped over the orange cone? What was the child trying to do?\" (Answer: to go over the obstacle)\n   - \"If the child jumped harder, what might happen?\" (Would they jump higher? Farther?)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Say, \"I wonder... what made the child's body move? What kind of push or pull helped the child jump? Let's find out by doing some jumping of our own!\"\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be like that child and explore how pushes and pulls make things move. We'll use our bodies and some objects to discover the amazing science of motion!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how pushes and pulls affect motion through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Open classroom floor or hallway space (or gymnasium if available)\n- 6-8 foam cones or cardboard boxes (as obstacles)\n- Soft foam balls (4-6)\n- Masking tape\n- Index cards with simple pictures of: jump, run, slide, hop, skip\n- Small classroom objects to push: toy cars, blocks, bean bags\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Station 1 — Body Motion (10 minutes):**\n   - Set up a simple obstacle course with 3-4 cones spaced 3-4 feet apart\n   - Divide students into two small groups; groups rotate through stations\n   - **Student Directions:** \"Jump over each cone like the child in our picture! Try to jump high. Then try jumping far. Then try jumping slowly and carefully.\"\n   - **Documentation:** As each student jumps, a partner holds up a picture card (jump, hop, skip) and describes what they see: \"You jumped HIGH!\" or \"You jumped FAR!\"\n\n2. **Station 2 — Pushing and Pulling (8-10 minutes):**\n   - Place toy cars, small blocks, or other lightweight classroom objects on a smooth floor surface\n   - Tape a start line and a finish line (about 6-8 feet apart)\n   - **Student Directions:** \"Push this toy car gently with one finger. Now push it harder! See how far it goes. Try pulling it slowly back to the start.\"\n   - **Documentation:** Students draw or point to show: Did the object move far or not far? Was the push soft or hard?\n\n3. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate between stations\n   - Ask open-ended questions: \"What did you notice when you pushed harder?\" \"What happens if you use less force?\"\n   - Do NOT give answers; let students discover by doing\n   - Encourage use of action words: fast, slow, far, near, high, low\n   - Use descriptive language: \"I see you gave that a big push!\"\n\n4. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students notice that bigger pushes make things move farther or faster\n   - Students observe that pulling and pushing are different ways to make things move\n   - Students use descriptive language to compare their movements\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to the original photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words written large and illustrated\n- The original photograph (projected or printed)\n- Real objects from Explore stations (toy car, cone, ball)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Gather students in a circle\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover? Show us with your body or tell us in words what you found out about pushes and pulls.\"\n   - Call on 3-4 students to demonstrate or share\n   - As they share, affirm and use consistent vocabulary\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (7-10 minutes):**\n   - Write and draw each term on chart paper with a simple illustration\n   - Point to the photograph and use each term:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Push:** A force that makes something move away from you (demonstrate by pushing a ball away)\n   - **Pull:** A force that makes something move toward you (demonstrate by pulling a rope or object toward you)\n   - **Force:** The strength or power that makes something move or change direction (point to the child's muscles and motion in the photo)\n   - **Motion:** When something moves from one place to another (point to the jumping child)\n   - **Fast/Slow:** Words that describe how quickly something moves (push a car slowly, then fast)\n\n3. **Connect to Photograph:**\n   - Point to the jumping child: \"The child is using a big push from their legs to jump up in the air. That's force and motion!\"\n   - Point to the cone: \"The child had to jump over the cone. Their push had to be strong enough and in the right direction to make their body go up and over.\"\n   - Ask: \"Did the child use a big push or a small push to jump that high?\" (Big push!)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Show the photograph again and ask:\n     - \"Is the child pushing or pulling to jump?\" (Pushing from the ground)\n     - \"Is the child moving fast or slow?\" (Fast)\n     - \"What kind of force did the child need to jump over the cone?\" (A big upward push)\n   - Have students echo definitions and act out the vocabulary with their bodies\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and demonstrate pushes and pulls\n- Students use vocabulary terms (push, pull, force, motion) when describing movement\n- Students understand that bigger forces create bigger motions\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to new contexts and deepen understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with scenario pictures or simple sentences\n- Toy cars, balls, blocks, ropes, and other classroom objects\n- Optional: playground equipment (if outdoors)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-World Scenarios (10-12 minutes):**\n   - Present 3-4 simple scenarios and ask: \"Is this a push or a pull? What force would you need?\"\n   - Scenario 1: \"A teacher is moving a desk across the room. What kind of force does the teacher need to use?\" (Pull or push; big force)\n   - Scenario 2: \"You want to roll a ball to your friend. What do you do?\" (Push the ball; medium force)\n   - Scenario 3: \"You're opening a door. Are you pushing or pulling?\" (Both; pulling the handle, pushing the door)\n   - Scenario 4: \"A big, heavy box needs to move. Would you use a tiny push or a big push?\" (Big push)\n   - **For each scenario, have students role-play or demonstrate the motion**\n\n2. **Design a Simple Challenge (5-8 minutes):**\n   - \"Can you make a ball move slowly across the floor? What kind of push would you use?\" (Soft push)\n   - \"Can you make a ball move to a specific spot? What do you have to control?\" (The direction and strength of your push)\n   - Students attempt the challenges and report what they discover\n\n3. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Ask guiding questions: \"What happened when you used a soft push? A hard push?\"\n   - Celebrate effort and observation: \"You discovered that push power changes how things move!\"\n   - Encourage students to predict before trying\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply push/pull concepts to new situations\n- Students recognize that the strength of a force affects motion\n- Students explain cause-and-effect relationships: \"I pushed hard, so the ball went far\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces and motion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n   - Observe during Explore stations: Do students demonstrate understanding through their actions and language?\n   - Listen to vocabulary use during share-out and Elaborate\n   - Ask open-ended questions to gauge understanding without leading answers\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (Individual, 5 minutes at end of Session 2):**\n   - Show the original photograph again\n   - Ask 2-3 of these questions (verbally for first grade, with picture support):\n     - \"What is the child doing to jump? Is the child pushing or pulling?\" (Expected: The child is pushing from the ground with their legs)\n     - \"The child jumped over the cone. Did the child use a soft push or a hard push?\" (Expected: A hard/big push)\n     - \"Draw or show me a push.\" or \"Show me with your body what a pull looks like.\" (Expected: Accurate demonstration)\n\n3. **Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n   - ✓ Student can demonstrate a push or pull with their body\n   - ✓ Student uses the words \"push,\" \"pull,\" \"force,\" or \"motion\" when describing movement\n   - ✓ Student recognizes that bigger forces cause bigger motions\n   - ✓ Student can answer: \"What made the child in the photo jump?\" (Answer: The child pushed with their legs)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most first graders will show understanding through physical demonstration and simple verbal explanations\n- Students will recognize that forces (pushes and pulls) make things move\n- Students will begin to connect the strength of a force to the resulting motion\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n1. **Simplify vocabulary:** Use only \"push\" and \"pull\" in early sessions; add other terms once these are secure. Pair vocabulary with consistent hand motions and body demonstrations\n2. **Reduce obstacle complexity:** Use wider spacing between cones; focus on successful completion before adding challenges\n3. **One-on-one questioning:** Ask yes/no questions before open-ended ones (\"Did the child push? Yes or no?\"). Provide sentence starters: \"The child used a _____ push to jump.\"\n4. **Multisensory learning:** Allow students to repeat movements multiple times; some learners need repetition to internalize concepts. Pair physical movement with verbal description\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n1. **Predict and test:** \"If we push this car twice as hard, how far do you think it will go? Let's test your prediction. Were you right? Why or why not?\"\n2. **Increase complexity:** Create a multi-obstacle course where students must adjust their pushes for different surfaces (carpet, tile, grass) or different objects (heavy ball vs. light ball)\n3. **Apply to unfamiliar contexts:** \"Can you show me a push that makes something go straight? Now show me a push that makes something go to the side. What's different?\"\n4. **Introduce variables:** \"What happens if we push the same object from different heights? From far away? What changes?\" Record observations and compare\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Push and Pull Hunt\" (Classroom Walk-Around):**\n   - Take students on a guided walk around the school (classroom, hallway, cafeteria)\n   - Challenge them to spot examples of pushes and pulls: doors opening/closing, children swinging, balls rolling, etc.\n   - Create a class list with drawings or photos labeled \"Pushes We Saw\" and \"Pulls We Saw\"\n   - Display in classroom as reference\n\n2. **\"Design a Jump Course\" (Creative Project):**\n   - Provide students with safe, lightweight materials (foam blocks, hula hoops, tape)\n   - In small groups, let students design their own jumping or hopping course\n   - Test it out and describe the pushes needed: \"To jump through this hoop, you need a medium push. To jump over the blocks, you need a big push!\"\n   - Document with drawings or photos\n\n3. **\"Force Stories\" (Literacy Connection):**\n   - Read aloud simple movement books: *Jump, Frog, Jump!* or *Dear Zoo* (with animal movements)\n   - As you read, pause and ask: \"Is that a push or a pull? Show me!\"\n   - Create a class book: \"Our Push and Pull Adventures\" with student drawings and dictated sentences about movements they've done\n   - This reinforces vocabulary and connects to language arts standards\n\n---\n\n### Teacher Reflection & Notes\n\n**Important Consideration:** The provided First Grade NGSS standards (1-PS4-1 through 1-PS4-4) focus on **sound and light**, not force and motion. The photograph depicts force and motion concepts, which align with **Kindergarten standard K-PS2-1 and K-PS2-2** (pushes, pulls, and motion).\n\n**Recommendation:** If you must use only First Grade PS standards, consider substituting the photograph with images showing:\n- Sound vibrations (drum, speaker, tuning fork)\n- Light and illumination (flashlight in dark room, shadow)\n- Communication devices using light or sound\n\nAlternatively, obtain administrator approval to use K-PS2 standards with first graders as foundational reinforcement, or use this lesson as an informal, pre-assessment bridge activity before transitioning to sound/light investigations.\n\nThe lesson above is **pedagogically sound and developmentally appropriate** for first graders; the mismatch is **standards alignment only**, not instructional quality.",
