ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how heavy equipment moves large objects using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the backhoe\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Heavy textbook or similar object (3-5 lbs)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Ask students to observe quietly for 30 seconds, then turn to a partner and describe what they see.\n\n2. **Facilitate whole-group discussion** with these targeted questions:\n   - \"What is this machine doing, and why do you think it needs to be so big and strong?\"\n   - \"If you tried to pick up that huge bucket of dirt with just your hands, what would happen? How is this machine different?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this machine gets its power to lift something so heavy?\"\n   - \"What parts of the machine do you think help it do this work?\"\n\n3. **Demonstrate a challenge:** Hold up a heavy textbook and ask, \"Can everyone easily lift this? Now, what if I gave you a stick to help you as a lever—do you think that would make it easier or harder?\" Show students a ruler or stick and let volunteers try using it as a simple lever under the textbook to lift it.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we could make our own mini version of this backhoe arm. Do you think we could move heavy things more easily?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore how machines like backhoes use simple levers and forces to do big work. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate simple machines and mechanical advantage through hands-on lever experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Rulers or paint sticks (one per pair)\n- Fulcrums: erasers, wooden blocks, or stacked books\n- Various objects to lift: textbooks, water bottles, bags of sand, small buckets (2-5 lbs each)\n- Tape measures or measuring sticks\n- Clipboards with paper and pencils\n- Small cups or containers to hold objects being lifted\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Building and Testing a Simple Lever (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Pair students** and give each pair a ruler, an eraser, and an object to lift.\n\n2. **Provide step-by-step directions:**\n   - \"Place your eraser under the ruler at different positions—near the middle, near one end, etc.\"\n   - \"Try to lift your object (place it on one end of the ruler) by pressing down on the opposite end.\"\n   - \"Move the eraser closer and farther from the object and try again each time.\"\n   - \"What changes? Does it feel easier or harder to lift when the eraser is closer to the object? Closer to where you push?\"\n\n3. **Guide observation without giving answers:**\n   - \"What do you notice about where you need to push and where the eraser is?\"\n   - \"How much force do you think you're using when the eraser is in different spots?\"\n   - \"Compare your results with another pair—do you see the same pattern?\"\n\n4. **Have students record** in simple drawings or words:\n   - Where they placed the eraser\n   - Whether it was easy or hard to lift\n   - What changed when they moved the eraser\n\n**Part B: Connecting to the Backhoe (10 minutes)**\n\n5. **Ask students:** \"The backhoe arm works like a lever too! Where do you think the 'eraser' (fulcrum) is on the backhoe? Where is the operator pushing (applying force)? What is being lifted (the load)?\"\n\n6. **Have students point to** or sketch these parts on the photograph.\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate among pairs, asking guiding questions: \"What happens when you move the fulcrum?\" \"Does pushing harder make a difference?\" \"Why do you think that works?\" Avoid telling students the answer; let them discover the pattern through trial.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students discover that moving the fulcrum closer to the load makes lifting easier (mechanical advantage). They recognize this principle is the same in the backhoe's arm.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and scientific concepts after hands-on discovery.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart paper\n- Markers\n- Photograph (displayed)\n- Simple diagram of a lever with labeled parts\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students** in a circle where all can see the photograph and chart paper.\n\n2. **Conduct a group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Who found that moving the fulcrum made lifting easier? Tell us what you discovered.\"\n   - \"What did you notice about where the backhoe operator had to push?\"\n   - \"How is the backhoe's arm like the ruler we used?\"\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes)** while creating an anchor chart:\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n   \n   - **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move, stop, or change direction. (Point to the operator pushing on the backhoe controls.)\n   - **Lever:** A simple machine—like a stick—that uses a fulcrum to help us move heavy things with less effort.\n   - **Fulcrum:** The point where a lever rests or turns. It's like the \"hinge\" of the machine. (Point to where the backhoe arm connects.)\n   - **Mechanical Advantage:** When a machine helps us do work more easily by using less force or effort.\n   - **Energy:** The power that makes things move or work. The backhoe's engine gives it the energy to lift and dig.\n\n4. **Make explicit connections (5 minutes):**\n   - \"When you moved the eraser closer to your object, what happened? It became easier! That's mechanical advantage.\"\n   - \"The backhoe's arm is like a super-strong lever. The fulcrum is where the arm connects to the machine. The operator's push is the force, and the bucket is the load.\"\n   - \"The backhoe's engine gives it ENERGY, which it converts into the movement and lifting we see.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"If I wanted to lift something really heavy with my ruler, where should I put the fulcrum—close to what I'm lifting, or far away?\"\n   - \"What gives the backhoe the power to lift all that dirt?\" (Guide students to say: the engine, which converts fuel into energy.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students can identify and label the parts of a lever (fulcrum, force, load). They understand that mechanical advantage makes work easier. They connect the backhoe's system to simple lever principles.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply lever principles to a new design challenge and deepen their understanding of forces and mechanical advantage.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Rulers or craft sticks\n- Erasers or blocks for fulcrums\n- Plastic cups or small buckets\n- Sand, pebbles, or coins to create \"loads\" of different weights\n- Tape\n- Paper clips or string (optional)\n- Design challenge worksheet or chart\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge:** \"Design and build a lever system that can lift a bucket of sand higher and more easily than your first one did.\"\n\n1. **Introduce the design constraint:** \"You have the same materials—a ruler, an eraser, and a bucket. But this time, your goal is to lift the bucket as HIGH as possible while using the LEAST amount of force (pushing as lightly as you can).\"\n\n2. **Have students plan first (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Where will you place your fulcrum?\"\n   - \"How will you attach the bucket to the lever?\"\n   - \"What do you predict will happen?\"\n\n3. **Students build and test (10 minutes):**\n   - Allow time to construct their improved lever.\n   - Have them test and refine their design.\n   - Encourage adjustments if it doesn't work as predicted.\n\n4. **Reflection questions (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Did your design work better than the first one? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What did you learn about where the fulcrum needs to be?\"\n   - \"How is your design similar to or different from the backhoe arm?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** Observe and guide with questions like: \"What happens if you move the fulcrum? Does that help?\" Encourage students to predict before testing, then reflect on whether their prediction matched the result.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students demonstrate understanding of mechanical advantage by intentionally designing a more efficient lever. They can explain why their design choices matter based on force and distance principles.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces, levers, and mechanical advantage through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore phase:** Do students recognize when the lever becomes easier to use? Can they articulate why?\n- **Questioning during Explain phase:** Can students correctly identify the force, fulcrum, and load in the backhoe photograph?\n- **Design choices during Elaborate phase:** Do students intentionally adjust their fulcrum placement based on their understanding of mechanical advantage?\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a written or drawn exit ticket with these prompts (read aloud for access):\n\n1. **Draw and label a simple lever.** Show the fulcrum, where you push (the force), and what you're lifting (the load).\n\n2. **Answer in words or pictures:** \"If you wanted to lift something super heavy with a stick, where would you put the fulcrum—right in the middle, close to the heavy thing, or far away from it? Explain why.\"\n\n3. **Connect to the backhoe:** \"How is the backhoe's arm like the lever we made today?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students can identify the three parts of a lever (force, fulcrum, load).\n- Students understand that moving the fulcrum closer to the load increases mechanical advantage.\n- Students can explain the connection between the lever principle and the backhoe's function.\n- Students attempt an explanation using accurate vocabulary (force, lever, mechanical advantage, or energy).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Exit tickets reveal whether students grasp that levers work by multiplying force through distance, and that the backhoe operates on the same principle. Drawings and explanations demonstrate concrete understanding of mechanical advantage.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Provide a labeled diagram** of the backhoe showing the fulcrum, force point, and load. Allow students to trace or match the parts during Explain phase rather than drawing from scratch.\n\n2. **Use a pre-built lever setup** during Explore (with fulcrum already in place) so students focus only on moving it and observing what happens, rather than constructing it. Simplify the task to: \"Does it feel easier or harder?\" before asking \"why?\"\n\n3. **Offer sentence frames** for exit ticket explanations:\n   - \"The fulcrum is at the _____.\"\n   - \"When I moved the eraser closer to the bucket, it became _____.\"\n   - \"The backhoe's arm works like a lever because _____.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate multiple fulcrum positions quantitatively:** Have students measure the distance from fulcrum to load and from fulcrum to force point, and record how much force (using a spring scale, if available) is needed at each position. Create a graph showing the relationship between distance and force needed.\n\n2. **Design a multi-stage lever system:** Challenge students to attach one ruler lever to another (two levers working together) and test whether they can lift even heavier loads. Discuss why stacking levers might provide even more mechanical advantage.\n\n3. **Research real-world examples:** Have students find and sketch three other machines in their community (a seesaw, a crowbar, a bottle opener, a wheelbarrow) that use levers. Create a class poster showing \"Levers All Around Us.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Virtual Backhoe Operation:** If available, show a short video (2-3 minutes) of a backhoe in action at a construction site or in a controlled demonstration. Have students pause and identify when the operator is using different forces and how the bucket (load) moves. Discuss how the operator controls the lever arms to dig, scoop, and lift.\n\n2. **Class Challenge: Build a Stronger Lever Bridge:** Using craft sticks and blocks, have small groups design and build a lever-based bridge or structure that can support a toy car or small weight. Test whose design can hold the most weight. Connect this to real engineering and how professionals use mechanical advantage in construction.\n\n3. **Home Investigation:** Send home a challenge sheet asking families to find three levers in their home (door handles, drawer handles, seesaws, can openers, scissors). Have students sketch or photograph them and label the fulcrum, force, and load. Share findings in a gallery walk or class discussion.\n\n---",
