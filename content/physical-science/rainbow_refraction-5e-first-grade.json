ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about rainbows and activate prior knowledge about light and color.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the rainbow (printed or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: video clip of a rainbow (30 seconds)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Ask students to look carefully without talking for 15 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions** (one at a time, allowing think-pair-share before responding):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What colors can you spot?\"\n   - \"Where do you think these colors came from?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a rainbow? When did you see it?\"\n   - \"What do you think we need to make a rainbow appear?\"\n\n3. **Record student ideas** on chart paper. Accept all ideas without judgment—this activates prior knowledge and reveals misconceptions to address later.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... what makes a rainbow show up? What has to happen in the sky for us to see all those colors?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become rainbow scientists! We're going to explore how light makes colors, just like in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how light creates colors by passing through water or clear materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic cups (one per pair of students)\n- Water\n- Flashlights or desk lamps (one per pair)\n- White paper or white cloth to catch light\n- Prisms (optional, if available—or clear plastic sheets)\n- Small mirrors (optional)\n- Dark paper or black poster board\n- Paper towels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Light Through Water (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Setup:** Pair students. Dim the lights in the classroom slightly or close blinds partially.\n\n2. **Student directions (demonstrate first, then have students follow):**\n   - \"Fill your cup halfway with water.\"\n   - \"Turn on your flashlight and shine it at an angle into the cup of water.\"\n   - \"Shine the light onto a piece of white paper held below or beside the cup.\"\n   - \"Move the flashlight slowly and watch what happens on the paper.\"\n   - \"Do you see colors? What colors appear?\"\n   - \"What happens if you shine the light straight down instead of at an angle?\"\n\n3. **Recording:** Students draw or write what they see on their observation sheet:\n   - \"Draw the light and water. What colors did you see?\"\n   - \"Where did the colors come from?\"\n\n**Part B: Light and Different Materials (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Students test other materials** (same pairs, same setup):\n   - Place a clear plastic sheet in the path of the light (does it block light or let light through?)\n   - Place white paper in the light path (does it block light or show colors?)\n   - Place black paper in the light path (what happens?)\n\n2. **Students record:** \"Which materials let light through? Which materials blocked the light?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice? Is the light still bright? Did colors appear? Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Resist explaining; instead, ask students to describe what they observe.\n- Encourage students to try different angles and positions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that light can pass through water and create colors on a surface.\n- Students notice that different materials affect how light travels.\n- Students see that light is necessary to create the visible colors (when lights are dimmed, effects are less visible or invisible).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of light, refraction, and color.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Vocabulary posters with pictures (pre-made or created together)\n- The original rainbow photograph\n- White light source (flashlight)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3–4 pairs to share what they discovered: \"What did you see when light went through the water?\"\n   - Record common observations on a new chart titled \"What We Learned About Light.\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Present each term with a picture and simple definition. Use the photograph and Explore activity as reference points.\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Light:** Energy that helps us see. Light comes from the sun, flashlights, lamps, and other sources.\n   - **Color:** What we see when light bounces off objects or passes through things. White light from the sun is made of many colors mixed together.\n   - **Refraction:** When light bends as it passes through water or other clear things. This bending can separate white light into different colors.\n   - **Transparent:** Materials that let light pass through so we can see things (like water, clear plastic, glass).\n   - **Opaque:** Materials that block light and don't let it pass through (like black paper, wood, cloth).\n\n3. **Connect back to the rainbow photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the rainbow in the photograph.\n   - Explain: \"In the sky, when it rains and the sun is shining, water droplets act like the water in your cup. Sunlight passes through the water drops and bends. This bending separates the white light into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple—the colors of the rainbow!\"\n   - Emphasize: \"We could only see the rainbow because sunlight was shining. Without light, we can't see the colors.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (1 minute):**\n   - Quick hand signals: \"Thumbs up if light helped us see colors. Thumbs sideways if you're not sure.\"\n   - Ask one student to explain to a partner: \"Why does light help us see colors?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that light is necessary for vision.\n- Students can describe (in simple terms) that light passing through water creates colors.\n- Students recognize that some materials let light through and others block it.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by creating their own rainbows and predicting what will happen in new scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Spray bottles filled with water (one per pair or small group)\n- Sunny window or access to sunlight\n- White poster board or white cloth\n- Prisms (if available)\n- Mirrors (optional)\n- Checklist: \"Rainbow Predictions\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Rainbow Creation (10 minutes):**\n   - Take students to a sunny window.\n   - Have pairs or small groups use a spray bottle to create a fine mist of water in front of the window.\n   - Students look for rainbow colors in the mist.\n   - Students draw or photograph the colors they see.\n   - Ask: \"Why can we see a rainbow here? What do we need? (Sun, water, and light.)\"\n\n2. **Prediction Challenge (8 minutes):**\n   - Show students a scenario card or ask aloud:\n     - \"If we spray water in the dark corner with no sunlight, will we see a rainbow? Why or why not?\"\n     - \"If we use a flashlight instead of the sun, can we make a rainbow with our spray bottle? Let's try!\"\n     - \"What colors do you predict we will see?\"\n   - Students make predictions on a simple chart.\n   - Test one prediction (e.g., using a flashlight with the spray bottle in a dimmer area).\n   - Students compare their prediction to what actually happened.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate safe water use.\n- Ask students to explain their reasoning: \"What made you think that would happen?\"\n- Celebrate both correct and incorrect predictions as learning opportunities.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully create rainbows using water and sunlight.\n- Students demonstrate that light and water are necessary for rainbow formation.\n- Students begin to predict outcomes based on what they've learned.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light, color, and refraction through formative and summative assessment.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing):**\n- During Explore and Elaborate phases, observe whether students:\n  - Correctly describe what happens when light passes through water.\n  - Notice the difference between transparent and opaque materials.\n  - Understand that light is necessary to see colors.\n\n**Exit Ticket or Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes at end of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with three simple scenarios. Students draw or point to the correct answer.\n\n**Question 1:** \"Can we see a rainbow without sunlight?\" \n- (A) Yes, always.  \n- (B) No, we need light.  \n- (C) Maybe, I'm not sure.\n\n**Question 2:** \"What happened when light went through the water in our cup?\"\n- (A) The light disappeared.  \n- (B) We saw colors appear.  \n- (C) Nothing happened.\n\n**Question 3:** \"Which material let light pass through?\"\n- (A) Black paper  \n- (B) Clear plastic  \n- (C) Wood\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly answers 2 out of 3 questions.\n- ✓ Student can explain (verbally or in drawing) that light is needed to see colors.\n- ✓ Student observes and describes colors when light passes through water.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that light is essential for seeing colors.\n- Students recognize that light interacts with materials like water to create visible effects.\n- Students show developing understanding of how light and transparent materials work together.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n- **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"light,\" \"color,\" and \"see\" rather than \"refraction\" or \"transparent.\" Reinforce with repeated exposure and visuals.\n- **Guided exploration:** Pair struggling students with a partner or teach in a small group. Provide hand-over-hand guidance for flashlight positioning and water cup manipulation.\n- **Picture-based recording:** Have students draw observations rather than write, or provide sentence frames: \"I see _____ colors. The light _____ the water.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n- **Predict and test:** Ask, \"What if we used different colored water? What if we held the light at different angles? Can you make the colors brighter or dimmer?\"\n- **Research extension:** Have students find out why rainbows appear in specific locations (sun behind you, rain ahead). Create a simple diagram of rainbow geometry.\n- **Material investigation:** Provide a variety of transparent and translucent materials (colored cellophane, frosted plastic, clear glass). Investigate how different materials affect color and light transmission.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rainbow Art Project:** Students use their understanding to create a mixed-media rainbow artwork. They might use tissue paper, paint, colored pencils, and a flashlight to show \"how light makes colors.\" Display with labels explaining the science.\n\n2. **Light Journal:** Over one week, have students document rainbows or light effects they see in their environment (sunlight through a window creating a colored spot, light through colored glass, etc.). Bring in drawings or descriptions to share and discuss why those phenomena happened.\n\n3. **Prism Exploration Station:** If prisms are available, set up a station where students investigate how prisms separate white light into colors. Have them sketch the light path and colors, then compare to the water cup activity. Discussion question: \"How is a prism like water? How is it different?\"\n\n---",
