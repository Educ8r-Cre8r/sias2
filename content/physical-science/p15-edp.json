Use string, paper, or plastic to build a cage or net that will let the bubble sit safely inside. Test it by making bubbles and trying to catch them. How long can your bubble stay safe?\n\n#### **3-5 Version**\n**\"Design a Bubble-Protection Enclosure\"**  \nCreate a sealed or semi-sealed container using recyclable materials (plastic wrap, straws, paper tubes) that can house a soap bubble for at least 2 minutes without it popping. Your design must:\n- Allow you to see the bubble clearly\n- Protect the bubble from air currents and accidental contact\n- Use only materials from the provided list\n- Be testable and reusable for at least 3 trials\n\nSuccess = bubble remains intact for the full 2-minute timer period.\n\n---\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**  \nThis photo shows a delicate structure with an obvious vulnerability (bubbles pop easily). Students naturally encounter this problem when making bubbles, making the challenge authentic and grounded in direct experience. The task asks \"How can we keep something fragile safe?\" before jumping to building, which centers the problem-definition phase.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Materials\n1. **Plastic wrap or cellophane sheets** – for creating transparent barriers\n2. **Paper towel tubes or toilet paper tubes** – for frame or structural support\n3. **Bubble solution and wands** – to generate test bubbles\n4. **String or yarn** – for bracing and creating protective frameworks\n5. **Index cards or poster board** – to build walls or shields around the bubble\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Time\n**Two 30-minute sessions** – First session: design, build, and initial testing; Second session: refine design based on failures, retest, and document results.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.A (Defining and Delimiting a Problem)** by asking students to identify constraints (fragility, air pressure, evaporation) and design within them—turning a familiar object into an authentic engineering challenge.",
