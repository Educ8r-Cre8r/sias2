ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about speed, motion, and energy using the skateboarding photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed or projected photograph of skateboarder at the skate park\n- Chart paper and markers\n- **Optional:** A short video clip (30 seconds) of a skateboard rolling down a ramp\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph prominently** on the board or screen. Ask students to observe quietly for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (allow think-pair-share before whole-class responses):\n   - \"What is happening in this picture? What do you notice about the skateboarder's body and the skateboard?\"\n   - \"Do you think the skateboard is moving fast or slow right now? What makes you think that?\"\n   - \"Where did the skateboarder's energy come from to jump so high into the air?\"\n   - \"If the skateboarder went down a bigger ramp, do you think they would go faster or slower? Why?\"\n\n3. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"If I pushed a skateboard down a small ramp and then down a really tall ramp, which one would have more energy—the one that goes faster or the one that goes slower? Turn to your neighbor and make a prediction together.\"\n\n4. **Chart student predictions and wonderings** on the board. Keep this visible throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great predictions! Today we're going to test our ideas by building our own ramps and rolling objects down them, just like the skateboarder uses the concrete ramps in the park. Let's see if speed and energy are connected.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the relationship between speed and energy through hands-on ramp experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- Foam or plastic ramp (or a sturdy wooden board, 3-4 feet long)\n- Wooden blocks or textbooks to prop up the ramp at different heights\n- 1 toy car or rolling ball (marble or small rubber ball works well)\n- Masking tape\n- Meter stick or measuring tape\n- Piece of white paper or chalk to mark distance on the floor\n- Observation worksheet (see template below)\n\n**Activity: \"Ramp Racing Investigation\"**\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud; write on board or handout):**\n\n1. **Set up your ramp** at a low height (about 6 inches high at the top). Use blocks to prop it up.\n\n2. **Place the car/ball at the top** of the ramp. Release it (do NOT push it).\n\n3. **Measure and mark** where the car stops using tape or chalk. **Record the distance** on your worksheet (e.g., \"Low ramp: car traveled 24 inches\").\n\n4. **Repeat two more times** from the same height to make sure your results are similar.\n\n5. **Now raise your ramp** to a medium height (about 12 inches). **Repeat steps 2-4** and record the distance.\n\n6. **Raise the ramp to a high height** (about 18 inches). **Repeat steps 2-4** and record.\n\n7. **Compare your three measurements.** Which ramp height made the car go the farthest? Which made it travel the shortest distance?\n\n8. **Draw or describe** what you think was different about the car's **speed** (how fast it was moving) at each height. Was it faster from the high ramp or the low ramp?\n\n**Observation Worksheet Template:**\n\n| Ramp Height | Distance Traveled (Trial 1) | Distance Traveled (Trial 2) | Distance Traveled (Trial 3) | Average Distance |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Low (6\") |  |  |  |  |\n| Medium (12\") |  |  |  |  |\n| High (18\") |  |  |  |  |\n\n**Additional Recording Prompt:**\n- \"Draw the car at three different moments: at the top of the ramp, in the middle, and at the bottom. Label which one was going fastest.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- **Circulate among groups** and ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n  - \"What do you notice about the distance? Is it getting longer or shorter as the ramp gets taller?\"\n  - \"If the car is traveling farther, what does that tell you about how fast it was moving?\"\n  - \"Why do you think a higher ramp made a difference?\"\n- **Do not tell students the answer;** let them discover the pattern.\n- Ensure all groups complete **at least two ramp heights** before time expires.\n- Assist with measurement if students struggle, but have them do the releasing and observing themselves.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should discover that:\n- Objects released from **higher ramps travel farther** (evidence of greater speed).\n- **Higher starting positions = faster speed = more energy** (they may not use the word \"energy\" yet, but they'll see the effect).\n- **Repeated trials help confirm** the pattern.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to the photograph and real-world skateboarding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of skateboarder (displayed again)\n- Simple diagram of a ramp (drawn by teacher or pre-made)\n- Index cards with vocabulary terms\n\n**Activity: Guided Discussion and Vocabulary Building**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore phase (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their **distance measurements** and what they noticed.\n   - Create a class chart showing the pattern: \"Higher Ramp = Faster Speed = Farther Distance.\"\n   - Ask: \"Did everyone see the same pattern? What does that tell us?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Display each term on an index card. Use a think-aloud to explain each one.\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n   - **Speed:** How fast something is moving. A skateboard coming down a tall ramp has more speed than one coming down a small ramp.\n   - **Kinetic Energy:** The energy that something has because it is moving. Faster-moving objects have more kinetic energy. (Use skateboard example: the faster the skater goes, the more energy they have to jump high.)\n   - **Ramp (or Incline):** A sloped surface. The steeper or taller a ramp is, the more speed an object can gain rolling down it.\n   - **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or change direction. Gravity is a force pulling the skateboarder and skateboard down the ramp.\n   - **Energy Transfer:** When energy moves from one thing to another. In the skate park, the skateboarder's muscles push energy into the skateboard, which then has kinetic energy.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the skateboarding photo again.\n   - \"Look at the skater's position in the air. The skater went down a concrete ramp (just like our ramp experiment). Because of the height and curve of the ramp, the skater gained a lot of **speed**. With more speed comes more **kinetic energy**. That energy helped the skater jump really high into the air and do a trick!\"\n   - Point to the concrete curved surfaces: \"See how the ramp is curved and tall? That's on purpose—it helps the skater go faster and have more energy.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Show a diagram of two ramps—one tall, one short.\n   - Ask: \"If a skateboard rolls down the tall ramp, which ramp will give the skateboard more kinetic energy? Why?\"\n   - Have students turn to a partner and explain using the word **speed** in their answer.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should understand that:\n- **Speed and kinetic energy are connected:** faster objects have more energy.\n- **Ramps and height cause changes in speed:** higher starting points = more speed.\n- Real-world application: skateboarders use tall, curved ramps to gain speed and energy for tricks.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by predicting and testing a new scenario.\n\n**Materials (per group):**\n- Same ramps and rolling objects from Explore phase\n- Small plastic cup or paper cup\n- Tape\n- Pre-made \"target zones\" marked on the floor with tape (place targets at 18 inches, 24 inches, 36 inches from the ramp base)\n\n**Activity: \"Design a Ramp for a Mission\"**\n\n**Scenario (present to class):**\n\"Imagine you are designing a ramp for a delivery robot. The robot needs to roll a small package and have it land in a specific zone—not too close, not too far. Your job is to figure out what **height** your ramp should be to make the package (our rolling ball/car) stop in the target zone.\"\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Choose a target zone** (18-inch, 24-inch, or 36-inch mark).\n\n2. **Predict:** \"What height ramp do you think will make the ball land in your target zone?\" Write or draw your prediction.\n\n3. **Test:** Set your ramp to different heights and release the rolling object. Try at least two different heights.\n\n4. **Observe and record:** Where did it land? Was it close to your target? Too far? Too short?\n\n5. **Adjust and retest:** Change your ramp height based on what you learned. Try to get closer to your target zone.\n\n6. **Reflect:** \"What did you change about the ramp? How did that change the **speed** of the object? How did speed help you hit (or miss) your target?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- **Facilitate problem-solving** without giving answers:\n  - \"Your ball went too far. What could you change about the ramp to make it go slower?\"\n  - \"You need it to go farther. What does height do to speed?\"\n- **Celebrate attempts and adjustments:** \"I see you're testing different heights—that's exactly what scientists do!\"\n- **Push thinking:** \"Can you explain *why* that height worked? What happened to the ball's speed?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate deeper understanding by:\n- **Predicting ramp heights** based on the relationship between height and distance.\n- **Testing and refining** their design based on evidence.\n- **Explaining the connection** between ramp height, speed, and how far an object travels.\n- **Recognizing that energy affects outcomes** in real-world scenarios (delivery, skateboarding tricks).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of speed, kinetic energy, and their relationship.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n\n- **Observation during Explore and Elaborate:** Did students notice the pattern? Could they adjust their predictions based on evidence?\n- **Exit Ticket Questions (provide at end of Session 1 or Session 2):**\n\n**Exit Ticket (Read aloud; students draw or write responses):**\n\n1. **Draw or write:** \"A skateboard rolls down a tall ramp and a short ramp. Which skateboard will be going faster? Circle it.\"\n\n2. **Explain in 2-3 sentences:** \"Why does a higher ramp make a skateboard go faster?\"\n\n3. **Apply:** \"If a skateboarder wants to jump really high, should they use a tall ramp or a short ramp? Why?\"\n\n**Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n\n**Performance Task:** \"Speed and Energy Challenge\"\n\nProvide students with a photograph or diagram showing two ramps of different heights. Ask:\n\n- \"A ball rolls down Ramp A (tall) and another ball rolls down Ramp B (short). Which ball has more kinetic energy? Use **evidence from our experiment** to explain your answer in 3-4 sentences. Include the words **speed**, **kinetic energy**, and **ramp height** in your explanation.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Student **identifies the correct answer** (tall ramp = more kinetic energy).  \n✓ Student **uses evidence from the investigation** (e.g., \"The ball from the tall ramp traveled farther...\").  \n✓ Student **uses 2-3 vocabulary terms correctly** (speed, kinetic energy, ramp, height).  \n✓ Student **makes a clear connection** between height, speed, and energy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes (Evidence of Meeting Learning Objectives):**\n\n- **Learning Objective 1:** Students can describe how speed changes as objects go down ramps of different heights.\n- **Learning Objective 2:** Students can construct a simple explanation connecting faster speed to more kinetic energy (using data and observations).\n- **Learning Objective 3:** Students can predict how a change in ramp height will affect speed and distance.\n- **Learning Objective 4:** Students can point to evidence (distance measurements, observations) to support their claims about energy differences.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary** using physical demonstrations. Before Explain phase, show students a slow-rolling ball and a fast-rolling ball. Ask: \"Which one is going faster? Which one has more energy? Watch what happens.\" Use repeated, concrete examples.\n\n2. **Provide a sentence frame** for the exit ticket:\n   - \"A higher ramp makes the ball go _______. When the ball goes faster, it has _______ kinetic energy.\"\n   - (Answer options provided in word bank: faster, slower, more, less)\n\n3. **Simplify the Elaborate task.** Instead of choosing a target zone, give struggling students a **pre-set ramp height** and have them predict and test how far the object will travel. Focus on the observation and recording, not the design challenge.\n\n4. **Pair with a supportive peer** during investigations. Assign a role: one student releases the object; the other records and measures. Rotate roles.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Introduce angle/slope:** \"It's not just the height—the **angle** of the ramp matters too. A steep ramp (high angle) and a shallow ramp (low angle) with the same height might give different speeds. Can you test this?\" Provide two ramps of equal height but different angles.\n\n2. **Predict with variables:** \"What if we changed both the ramp height AND the weight of the object (use different balls or add tape)? How would that change the speed and distance? Make a prediction and test it.\"\n\n3. **Real-world research connection:** \"Find a photo of a skate park online or in a book. Measure or estimate the heights of different ramps. Predict which ramp would help a skater go the fastest. Explain your reasoning using kinetic energy.\"\n\n4. **Energy transfer exploration:** \"When the rolling object hits something (like a cup), what happens to its kinetic energy? Where does the energy go? Does the object stop immediately or does it slide? Test it and explain.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Skateboard Park Design Project (Take-Home or Class Activity):**\n   - Provide students with graph paper and ask them to **design their own skate park** using ramps of different heights.\n   - Each ramp should be labeled with its height.\n   - Students write a \"design brief\" explaining why each ramp is a certain height and what speed they predict a skateboarder will achieve.\n   - **Connection to lesson:** Applies understanding of height and speed to creative, real-world design.\n\n2. **Speed and Energy in Sports (Cross-Curricular Connection):**\n   - Show short video clips (30-60 seconds each) of athletes in different sports: skateboarding, skiing, sledding, roller skating.\n   - Have students identify the ramps, heights, and predict relative speeds.\n   - **Class discussion:** \"Which sport uses the tallest ramps? Which athlete would have the most kinetic energy? How do you know?\"\n   - Students draw and label one example with vocabulary terms.\n\n3. **Build a Ball Run (Hands-On Extension):**\n   - Provide cardboard tubes, plastic gutters, foam tubing, and tape.\n   - Challenge students to **build a multi-level ramp system** where a ball travels through different heights.\n   - Students measure the ball's distance at different points and predict where it will be fastest.\n   - **Real-world connection:** Similar to theme park rides and industrial systems.\n   - **Documentation:** Students photograph or sketch their design and write labels explaining the speeds at each level.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure the floor is clear of obstacles. Marbles and small balls should be used only with close supervision. Secure ramps so they don't tip.\n- **Pacing:** If students finish Explore early, have them repeat the investigation with a different rolling object (ball vs. car) to see if the pattern holds.\n- **Vocabulary support:** Post a word wall with images. Take photos of the ramp at different heights and label them \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" \"High\" to anchor understanding.\n- **Connection to skateboarding:** If possible, show a 30-second video clip of a skateboarder dropping into a pool or bowl-shaped ramp in a skate park. Pause and ask: \"What's making them go faster—is it the ramp?\" This reinforces the real-world relevance.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is ready to teach. All materials are classroom-accessible, and activities are designed to let students discover the connection between speed and kinetic energy before introducing the formal terminology. The photograph serves as both a hook and a reference point throughout all five phases.",
