Identify and describe how waves transfer energy from one place to another.\n2. Explain how wave motion causes objects to move and explains why different materials react differently to waves.\n3. Demonstrate understanding of the relationship between wave size (amplitude) and the force it exerts on objects.\n4. Predict how waves with more energy will move objects farther or faster than waves with less energy.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about wave energy and motion through visual exploration of the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (projected or printed for each group)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** and allow 30 seconds of silent observation before any talking. Ask students to just look.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see happening to the water in this picture?\" (Students should note the large, white, splashing wave)\n   - \"Why do you think the wave is so big and powerful-looking?\" (Prompt thinking about energy and movement)\n   - \"What do you think would happen if you stood in front of a wave like that?\" (Connect to force and motion)\n   - \"Why are the rocks in the picture dark and smooth? What might have made them that way?\" (Introduce the idea of waves changing things over time)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder: If we could make waves in a container, could we make them move objects just like this ocean wave? Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper under the title \"What We Think Will Happen.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be wave scientists. We'll make our own waves and discover how they move things, just like the ocean waves in this photo.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how waves transfer energy and move objects through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large shallow containers or plastic bins (1 per group of 3-4 students)\n- Water (prepared ahead)\n- Small objects: plastic beads, foam chips, lightweight plastic toys, small pebbles\n- Index cards\n- Rulers\n- Splash guards (optional: towels or plastic sheeting)\n- Recording sheets (see below)\n- Spoons or sticks for creating waves\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and display with visuals):**\n\n1. \"Fill your container halfway with water. This is your 'ocean.'\"\n\n2. \"Predict: How far do you think a small object will move if you make ONE gentle wave? Write or draw your prediction on your recording sheet.\"\n\n3. \"Place a bead, foam chip, or other small object in the water about 4 inches from the edge of the container.\"\n\n4. \"Make ONE gentle wave by slowly pushing water toward the object with your hand or spoon. Watch what happens. Measure how far the object moved. Record it.\"\n\n5. \"Now make ONE BIG wave by pushing water quickly and with more force. Predict: Will the object move farther? Measure and record.\"\n\n6. \"Try different objects. Do they all move the same distance? Record your observations.\"\n\n7. \"Make TWO waves in a row. What happens? Record.\"\n\n**Recording Sheet Prompt:**\n- Draw or write: \"My wave was _____ (gentle/big). The object moved _____ inches.\"\n- Comparison: \"The big wave moved the object (farther/less far) than the gentle wave.\"\n- Observation: \"Different objects moved (the same/differently).\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What did you notice changed when you made a bigger wave?\" and \"Why do you think that object didn't move as far?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answer—let them discover the relationship between wave size/force and motion.\n- Help students measure but let them determine what happened.\n- Encourage drawing and labeling observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that larger/faster waves cause objects to move farther.\n- Students notice that different materials (foam vs. heavier objects) respond differently to the same wave.\n- Students develop vocabulary around \"big wave,\" \"small wave,\" \"fast,\" \"far,\" \"moved.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize understanding using scientific vocabulary and connect observations to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph (projected again)\n- Visual vocabulary cards (images + words)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 groups to share one key discovery: \"What did you learn about how waves move things?\"\n   - Record their observations on a chart titled \"What We Discovered.\"\n   - Affirm language and gently introduce scientific terms: \"Yes! You noticed the wave had MORE ENERGY, and that's why it moved the object farther.\"\n\n2. **Teacher Mini-Lesson (10-12 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again. Point to the large wave.\n   - Say: \"This is a real ocean wave. It has a LOT of energy because it's very big and moving very fast. Watch what happens—it crashes on the rocks and moves sand.\"\n   - Explain using student language first, then introduce formal terms:\n\n3. **Vocabulary Introduction:**\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|----------------------------|\n   | **Wave** | A pattern of motion that travels through water (or other materials) and makes things move up and down. |\n   | **Energy** | The ability or power to make things move or change. A big wave has more energy than a small wave. |\n   | **Amplitude** | How big or tall a wave is. A tall wave has a bigger amplitude. |\n   | **Force** | A push or pull that makes things move or stop. Waves create force. |\n   | **Motion** | When something moves from one place to another. Waves cause motion. |\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Show the photograph and ask: \"Is this wave big or small?\" (Big) \"Does it have a lot of energy or a little energy?\" (A lot) \"What will this wave probably do to the sand and rocks?\" (Move them, push them)\n   - Ask students to show thumbs up/middle/down to indicate understanding.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use terms like \"energy,\" \"wave,\" and \"force\" correctly in sentences.\n- Students explain: \"Big waves have more energy and move things farther.\"\n- Students connect the classroom waves to the ocean waves in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply wave concepts to a real-world scenario and predict how waves shape beaches over time.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Sand in shallow bins or trays\n- Water\n- Spoons or sticks\n- Picture cards of beaches before/after storms\n- Recording sheet\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario Introduction:**\n\"The rocks and sand on beaches are shaped by waves over many years. A tiny pebble starts big, but wave energy breaks it into smaller and smaller pieces. This is called EROSION. Let's see how waves change sand and rocks.\"\n\n**Student Investigation:**\n\n1. \"Fill your bin with damp sand.\"\n\n2. \"Create a gentle hill or mound of sand.\"\n\n3. \"Make gentle waves by slowly moving water. What happens to your sand hill? Record.\"\n\n4. \"Now make BIG waves by moving water quickly and with force. What happens NOW? Record.\"\n\n5. \"Compare: Did big waves or gentle waves change the sand more? Why?\"\n\n**Extension Prompt:**\n\"Imagine a storm creates HUGE waves on the beach. Predict: What will happen to the beach over time? Will it stay the same, or will it change?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to observe and record without leading conclusions.\n- Ask: \"What do you notice is different between the gentle waves and the big waves?\" and \"How is this like what happens at real beaches?\"\n- Connect back to the photograph: \"Those rocks in the picture—waves like the ones you created have been smoothing them for years and years!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that wave energy reshapes sand and breaks down materials.\n- Students predict that bigger waves cause bigger changes.\n- Students begin to understand that erosion happens over time.\n- Students record observations with drawings and words.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of wave energy, motion, and force.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Are students making waves and recording observations?\n- Questions during Explain: Can students explain why big waves moved objects farther?\n- Sketches and labels: Do drawings show understanding of wave motion and its effects?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nAdminister this at the end of the lesson. Use drawings + words (Fourth Grade appropriate).\n\n**Exit Ticket Prompt:**\n\n\"1. Draw a picture of a wave moving an object.\n\n2. Answer: What makes a wave have MORE energy?\n   - ☐ It's bigger\n   - ☐ It's faster\n   - ☐ Both\n\n3. Fill in the blank: A wave with more energy will move an object _____________ than a wave with less energy.\n   (farther / not as far)\n\n4. True or False: Waves can change rocks and sand over time.\n   - ☐ True\n   - ☐ False\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies that bigger/faster waves have more energy.\n- ✓ Student explains that more energy = objects move farther.\n- ✓ Student correctly predicts or observes that waves change materials.\n- ✓ Student uses or understands vocabulary: wave, energy, force, motion.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students accurately answer 3 of 4 exit ticket questions.\n- Students can explain in their own words: \"Bigger waves have more energy and push things farther.\"\n- Students recognize waves transfer energy and cause motion and change.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Recording Sheets:** Provide pre-drawn boxes for observations with sentence starters: \"The wave was _____. The object moved _____.\" Students draw or use one-word answers.\n\n2. **Guided Wave Exploration:** Before independent exploration, model making ONE gentle wave and ONE big wave together as a whole group. Have students trace the motion with their fingers. Then let them try with support.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Visuals:** Provide laminated picture cards of each vocabulary term (amplitude, energy, force, motion, wave) paired with simple illustrations. Allow students to reference these during discussion and writing.\n\n4. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair struggling learners with confident peers during Explore phase. The peer models observation and recording while the struggling learner participates directly.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multiple Variable Investigation:** Ask: \"What else could change how far an object moves? Could the shape of the wave matter? Could the weight of the object matter? Design an experiment to test ONE of these ideas.\" Students design and conduct mini-investigations, record data, and present findings.\n\n2. **Wave Prediction and Measurement:** Provide rulers and ask students to measure wave amplitude before and after each attempt. Create a data table with Wave Size (amplitude) vs. Distance Object Moved. Graph results and describe the pattern they observe.\n\n3. **Erosion Over Time:** Challenge students to predict: \"If waves like this hit a beach every day for a year, how would it change? Sketch what the beach might look like after 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year.\" Have them explain their reasoning using energy and force concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Beach Erosion Over Geologic Time\" Research Project:**\n   Students research famous beaches or coastal areas that have changed due to wave erosion (e.g., sea cliffs, barrier islands). They create a simple before/after poster with images, measurements, and a written explanation of how wave energy caused the changes over years or decades.\n\n2. **Wave Energy in the Real World:**\n   Show videos (2-3 minutes) of ocean waves, tsunamis, or waves in lakes during storms. Discuss: \"How is this like the waves we made? How is it different? What could cause a wave to have even MORE energy?\" Connect to real-world impacts and perhaps introduce the idea of wave energy as renewable energy (without going deep into high school physics).\n\n3. **Design a Wave Barrier:**\n   Challenge students: \"If you wanted to protect a beach from wave erosion, what would you build? Design a barrier (using clay, blocks, or drawings) that could reduce wave force. Test it in your wave container. Does it work? Why or why not?\" This applies engineering and design thinking to wave energy concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Prep Ahead:** Fill water containers the morning of or day before. Prepare recording sheets and vocabulary cards. Have towels ready for water spills.\n- **Differentiated Pacing:** Explore phase can extend to 30 minutes if students are deeply engaged; truncate Elaborate if needed.\n- **Safety Reminder:** Manage water spill expectations and establish cleanup procedures before Explore begins.\n- **Connection to Next Lesson:** This lesson sets up future learning about sound waves (4-PS4-1), light (4-PS4-2), and energy transfer more broadly.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson plan transforms the striking photograph of ocean wave energy into a concrete, investigative experience where Fourth Grade students discover the relationship between wave size, energy, force, and motion—the core of 4-PS3-1 and 4-PS4-1.",
