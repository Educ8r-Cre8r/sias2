Observe and describe how engines in cars make them move using pushes and pulls.\n2. Investigate how different strengths of pushes affect how far or fast something moves.\n3. Explain that a strong push makes things move more than a weak push.\n4. Design and test a way to make a toy car move using different amounts of force.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how engines make cars move by examining the photograph and connecting it to their own experiences.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digitally displayed photograph of the car engine\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Optional: toy cars or pictures of different vehicles\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or print it for a whole-group view. Point to the engine compartment and say: \"This is the heart of a car—the engine. It's what makes the car GO!\"\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions:**\n   - \"Who has ever ridden in a car? What does a car do?\" (Listen for: goes fast, moves, goes somewhere)\n   - \"Look at all these tubes and black metal parts. What do you think they do?\" (Accept all answers without judgment)\n   - \"Do you think your muscles could push a real car? What helps the car move instead?\" (Guide toward: engine, machine, power)\n   - \"Have you ever pushed a toy car with your hand? How did it feel? Do you think it's easier or harder than pushing a real car?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if we pushed a toy car with a tiny push, how far would it go? What if we pushed it with a BIG push? Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to be scientists and test how pushes make things move, just like the engine pushes the car!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover through hands-on investigation that different strengths of pushes cause different amounts of motion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Toy cars or small rolling objects (1 per pair of students, or 4-5 for demonstrations)\n- Masking tape\n- Meter stick or measuring tape\n- Ramp materials: smooth boards, textbooks, or wooden planks (optional but helpful)\n- Open floor space or long hallway\n- Paper and crayons for recording\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Gentle Push Investigation**\n\n1. **Set up:** Create a starting line using masking tape on the floor. Have an open space of at least 10 feet ahead of the line.\n\n2. **Teacher model:** Demonstrate with a toy car. \"I'm going to give the car a TINY, GENTLE push.\" Give a small tap to the car and let it roll. Mark where it stops with a piece of tape.\n\n3. **Student turn:** Pair students. One child gives their toy car a gentle push from the starting line. Their partner watches and marks where it stops with tape. Encourage soft, controlled pushes.\n\n4. **Observation:** \"Look! The car didn't go very far. A gentle push makes the car move just a little bit.\"\n\n**Part 2: Strong Push Investigation**\n\n1. **Same setup:** Return cars to the starting line.\n\n2. **Teacher model:** \"Now I'm going to give my car a BIG, STRONG push!\" Demonstrate a firm push that sends the car much farther.\n\n3. **Student turn:** Pairs switch roles. The second child gives their toy car a strong push. Partner marks where it stops.\n\n4. **Observation:** \"Wow! This time the car went SO much farther! A strong push makes the car travel farther and faster!\"\n\n**Part 3: Comparison & Recording**\n\n1. **Gather:** Bring students back to the starting line. Compare the two marked spots—gentle push vs. strong push.\n\n2. **Visual data:** Create a simple picture chart on paper:\n   - Draw two cars: one with a small arrow (gentle) and one with a big arrow (strong)\n   - Have 3-4 volunteers place their cars on the chart to show which spot their car reached (gentle or strong)\n\n3. **Student recording:** Give each student a paper with two car outlines. They draw or color: one car with a small push arrow, one with a big push arrow. Teacher writes or they copy: \"Big push = far\" / \"Little push = near.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask: \"What do you notice?\" and \"How is this push different from your first push?\"\n- Encourage students to use hand motions to show gentle vs. strong\n- Help students stay focused on comparing the two distances\n- Record their observations on chart paper for the Explain phase\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe and verbalize that stronger pushes make cars go farther\n- Students can show the difference between gentle and strong pushes using their own movements\n- Students create a simple visual record comparing the two types of pushes\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to how engines work.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with observations from Explore phase\n- Picture of car engine (same photograph)\n- Word cards: PUSH, FORCE, STRONG, WEAK, MOTION\n- Real objects: a heavy toy, a light toy\n- Space for whole-group discussion\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations:** Point to the recorded data from Explore. \"You discovered something important! When you gave a strong push, the car went farther. When you gave a gentle push, the car didn't go as far. Let's learn the scientist words for what you found.\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** (display word cards as you introduce each):\n\n   - **PUSH**: When you use your strength to move something away from you. (Demonstrate with a gentle push on a toy.)\n   - **FORCE**: The power of a push or pull. It's how strong or powerful you are. (Flex muscles playfully; make strong vs. weak hand movements.)\n   - **STRONG FORCE**: A big, powerful push that makes things move far and fast. (Demonstrate with toy car—send it flying.)\n   - **WEAK FORCE**: A small, gentle push that makes things move just a little bit. (Demonstrate with toy car—gentle tap, short distance.)\n   - **MOTION**: Movement. When something moves from one place to another. (Point to the toy car rolling.)\n\n3. **Connect to the engine photo:** Point to the engine in the photograph. \"The engine is like a super-strong muscle. It uses fuel (like food gives us energy) to make a VERY STRONG FORCE. That force PUSHES the car and makes it go fast—much faster than if you tried to push it with your hands!\"\n\n4. **Interactive comparison:** \n   - \"Can anyone push a toy car?\" (Invite a student to do so gently.)\n   - \"The engine is MUCH stronger. It can push this heavy car really, really fast! That's why cars are so cool.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your hands: What does a STRONG push look like?\" (Large, fast movements)\n   - \"Show me with your hands: What does a WEAK push look like?\" (Small, slow movements)\n   - \"Does a strong push make a car go far or near?\" (Far!)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Push** | Using your strength to move something away from you |\n| **Force** | The power of a push; how strong something is |\n| **Strong Force** | A big, powerful push that makes things move far and fast |\n| **Weak Force** | A small, gentle push that makes things move just a little bit |\n| **Motion** | Movement; when something goes from one place to another |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students use the words PUSH, FORCE, and MOTION correctly in simple sentences\n- Students demonstrate understanding that strong forces cause more motion than weak forces\n- Students make a connection between car engines and powerful forces\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of force and motion by designing and testing different ways to make cars move.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Toy cars (1-2 per pair)\n- Ramps of different heights (books stacked at different levels, smooth boards, or cardboard tubes)\n- Masking tape and meter sticks\n- Chart for recording results\n- Pictures/drawings of their ramp designs\n- Optional: cotton balls, blocks, or other small obstacles to place in the car's path\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Challenge introduction:** \"Now you're going to be engineers! Engines make cars fast by pushing them. But what else can make a push stronger? What if the car goes DOWN a ramp? Does that make it go faster?\"\n\n2. **Ramp exploration:**\n   - **Set-up:** Create 2-3 ramp stations with books stacked at different heights (low, medium, high).\n   - **Student task:** Students work in pairs or small groups. They:\n     - Place a car at the top of a ramp\n     - Release it (don't push it—gravity does the pushing!)\n     - Mark where it stops\n     - Draw a picture of their ramp (high or low)\n     - Compare: Did the car go farther from the high ramp or the low ramp?\n\n3. **Data collection:**\n   - Create a simple graph or chart on poster paper\n   - Have each group draw their ramp and mark where their car stopped\n   - Discuss: \"Which ramp made the car go the farthest? Why do you think that is?\"\n\n4. **Real-world connection:** \"Engines push cars down roads. Sometimes the road slopes down. What happens when a car goes downhill? It might go faster because gravity is helping it—like our ramps!\"\n\n5. **Optional challenge:** Place soft obstacles (cotton balls, blocks) in the car's path. \"Can you design a way to push the car around these obstacles?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate setup and ensure safety\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Which ramp made the car move fastest?\"\n- Help students record their findings without providing answers\n- Connect their discoveries to how real cars use both engine power AND the shape of roads\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe that steeper ramps (or gravity-assisted pushes) create more motion\n- Students can describe their ramp design and results\n- Students begin to understand that forces can be applied in different ways\n- Students record data through drawings and teacher-scribed labels\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces, pushes, and motion through observation, questioning, and simple tasks.\n\n**Assessment Strategy:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** as students explore:\n  - ☐ Student can demonstrate a gentle push\n  - ☐ Student can demonstrate a strong push\n  - ☐ Student describes difference in distance traveled\n  - ☐ Student uses vocabulary: push, force, motion\n\n- **Question prompts during Explore and Elaborate:**\n  - \"What happens when you push gently?\" (Expected: car goes short distance)\n  - \"What happens when you push hard?\" (Expected: car goes far)\n  - \"Why did that ramp make the car go faster?\" (Expected: mentions steep/high or gravity)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nConduct a 1-on-1 or small group conversation with each student or student pair using these prompts. Document their responses:\n\n1. **Show a toy car.** \"Show me a GENTLE push. Now show me a STRONG push. What was different?\" \n   - *Success:* Student demonstrates two clearly different push strengths with hands/body\n\n2. **Point to the engine photo.** \"What does the engine do to make the car move?\"\n   - *Success:* Student says something like \"It pushes the car\" or \"It makes it go fast\"\n\n3. **Ask about their Elaborate activity.** \"Which ramp made your car go farther—the tall one or the short one? Why?\"\n   - *Success:* Student identifies the correct ramp and attempts an explanation (even if not perfectly accurate)\n\n4. **Simple force scenario:** \"If I push this car with a BIG push, will it go near or far?\"\n   - *Success:* Student correctly responds \"far\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- Students correctly identify that stronger pushes create more motion (3 of 4 prompts)\n- Students can demonstrate the difference between weak and strong forces physically\n- Students use at least one new vocabulary word (push, force, or motion) correctly\n- Students make a simple connection between engines and pushes\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- All students demonstrate understanding that different push strengths cause different motion\n- Most students (80%+) use the term \"push\" or \"force\" correctly\n- Students show evidence of scientific thinking: comparing, predicting, testing\n- Students can apply the concept to a new scenario (e.g., ramp investigation)\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce complexity:** Provide only 2 push options (gentle vs. strong) instead of multiple ramp heights. Let students focus on one concept at a time.\n\n2. **Hands-on scaffolding:** Pair struggling students with a peer model or teacher assistant. Use repeated demonstrations: \"Watch how I push gently... now watch how I push strong. You try!\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary support:** Use picture cards and hand motions consistently. Create a visual anchor chart showing gentle push (small arrow) vs. strong push (big arrow) that stays visible throughout all five phases.\n\n4. **Shorter distances:** Mark spaces closer together (2 feet and 5 feet instead of 3 feet and 10 feet) so differences are obvious and students can see success.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Multiple variables:** Have advanced students test: \"What happens if we combine a strong push AND a ramp? Does the car go even farther?\" Record and compare three scenarios: gentle push, strong push, strong push down a ramp.\n\n2. **Direction exploration:** Introduce the concept of *direction*. \"Can you make the car turn? What kind of push would make it go left instead of straight?\" Have them test gentle and strong pushes at angles.\n\n3. **Estimation and measurement:** Ask advanced students to estimate distance before testing (\"I think the car will go about 8 steps\"). Then measure and compare to actual results. Introduce simple measurement concepts (steps, feet, or tape markings).\n\n4. **Real-world problem:** \"Engines have brakes too—they're like a push in the opposite direction. How could we make a car STOP?\" Have them design a barrier or test different stopping methods.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Ramp engineering challenge:** \"Design a ramp that makes your car go exactly to a target line.\" Provide different materials (blocks, books, cardboard) and have students predict, build, test, and adjust. Extend K-PS2-2 by incorporating the design-test-improve cycle.\n\n2. **Classroom scavenger hunt:** \"Find things in our classroom that PUSH or PULL.\" Create a list with picture labels (door opens with a pull, drawer slides with a push, playground slide uses gravity to push you down). Sort into PUSH and PULL categories on poster paper. Connect to recognizing forces in everyday life.\n\n3. **\"Make the toy move\" challenge stations:** Set up 3 stations where students try different methods to move a toy:\n   - Station 1: Push by hand (gentle and strong)\n   - Station 2: Push down a ramp\n   - Station 3: Pull with a string\n   - Have students record which method made the toy go the farthest. This bridges to K-PS2-2 by comparing design solutions.\n\n4. **Dramatic play connection:** Create a pretend \"car garage\" in the classroom. Students role-play as mechanics checking engines, pushing cars into place, and discussing which cars are \"fast\" (strong engines) vs. \"slow\" (weak engines). Reinforce vocabulary in a playful, low-pressure context.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n**Safety reminders:**\n- Ensure adequate floor space; no obstacles in rolling paths\n- Use only toy cars—never allow students to test with actual vehicles\n- Supervise ramp activities to prevent falls or dropped materials\n\n**Timing flexibility:**\n- This lesson works as a single 75-minute block or split into two sessions: Day 1 (Engage + Explore), Day 2 (Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate)\n- Adjust activity durations based on student engagement and pacing\n\n**Materials note:**\n- Toy cars can be replaced with rolling blocks or balls if cars aren't available\n- Ramps can be made from smooth boards, plastic slides, or stacked books—nothing fancy required\n\n**Home connection:**\n- Send a simple note home: \"We learned about PUSHES today! Ask your child to show you a gentle push vs. a strong push. Talk about engines in family vehicles: 'That engine makes a strong push to move our heavy car!'\"",
