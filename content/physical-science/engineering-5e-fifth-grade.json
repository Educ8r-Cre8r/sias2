ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by observing the motorized machines in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the LEGO motorized machines (printed or displayed on screen)\n- One or two pre-built motorized LEGO machines (or similar toys) to demonstrate motion if available\n- Stopwatch or timer (optional for demonstration)\n- Student notebooks or observation sheets\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass printed copies around the classroom. Ask students to observe for 30-45 seconds in silence, looking closely at all the details.\n\n2. **Facilitate a \"Notice and Wonder\" discussion** using these guiding questions:\n   - \"What do you notice moving in this picture? What parts appear to be in motion?\"\n   - \"Where is the energy coming from to make these machines move? What clues do you see?\" (Guide them to notice the wires and suggest they connect to power/electricity)\n   - \"How do you think these machines were built? What materials can you identify?\"\n   - \"What would happen if we changed the size of the wheels or gears? Would the machines move differently?\"\n\n3. **Demonstrate a simple motorized machine** (if available) for 30 seconds, showing how it moves. Ask: \"What surprised you about how this machine moves? What questions do you have?\"\n\n4. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"If we built our own motorized machine, what could we make it do? How would we control how fast or slow it moves, or what direction it goes?\"\n\n**Transition:** \n\"Today, you're going to become engineers! We're going to explore how motors convert energy into motion, and then you'll design and build your own motorized machine.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (25-30 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate energy transfer and motion through hands-on exploration and machine building.\n\n**Materials:**\n- LEGO building sets (or similar building blocks with motorized components) — enough for pairs or small groups (3-4 students)\n- Pre-assembled motors with battery packs\n- Wheels, gears, axles, and simple machine components\n- Building instruction sheets (optional starter guides showing simple motorized designs)\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Masking tape and markers\n- Large open workspace (table or floor space)\n- Video camera or smartphone to record machine motion (optional but recommended)\n- Student observation sheets with prompts\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide students into small groups** (pairs or trios). Distribute building materials and a pre-assembled motor.\n\n2. **Provide an open-ended challenge:**\n   \"Your task is to design and build a motorized machine that can move an object from one place to another. You can make it push, pull, lift, or roll something. You have 20 minutes to build and test.\"\n\n3. **Guide students through the investigation with these structured steps:**\n\n   - **Step 1 (5 min):** Examine the motor and its parts. Turn it on and observe: \"What moves when the motor is on? What does the motor do?\" Have students feel the vibration and watch the shaft rotate. Ask: \"How is this motion different from a push or a pull you can do with your hand?\"\n   \n   - **Step 2 (10 min):** **Build a simple machine.** Students attach the motor to their building structure and connect wheels, gears, or other moving parts. Provide guidance: \"Think about what you want your machine to do. Should it move fast or slow? Should it go forward, backward, or spin? Choose materials that will help.\"\n   \n   - **Step 3 (5 min):** **Test and modify.** Turn on the motor and observe the motion. Students record observations: Does it move the way you expected? Is it too fast, too slow, or just right? What part moves the most? If it doesn't work, try changing one thing—maybe the position of the wheels, the size of the gears, or the structure itself.\n\n4. **Document observations:** Each student records on their sheet:\n   - Sketch or describe what their machine looks like\n   - How does it move? (fast/slow, direction)\n   - What part does the motor move directly?\n   - What would they change to make it better?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask questions without solving problems: \"What do you observe happening? Why do you think it's moving that way? What could you try differently?\"\n- Encourage predictions: \"If you use a bigger gear, what do you think will happen?\"\n- Facilitate peer learning: \"How did another group solve that problem?\"\n- Ensure all students engage with the motor and understand the energy transfer.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students construct a working motorized machine that demonstrates motion\n- Students observe and record how electrical energy from the motor creates mechanical motion\n- Students identify the specific parts that move and describe the direction and type of motion\n- Students recognize that they can modify their design to change how the machine moves\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts, connecting back to student observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Interactive whiteboard or poster paper\n- Images or diagrams of motors, energy conversion, and forces\n- Vocabulary cards or word wall\n- Student science notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (8 minutes):** Ask 3-4 groups to briefly show their machine and describe:\n   - \"What does your motor do?\"\n   - \"How does the machine move?\"\n   - \"What surprised you?\"\n\n   As groups present, highlight key observations about motion, direction, and speed.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary and concepts (10 minutes):**\n\n   Use the share-outs to naturally introduce these terms:\n\n   **Energy:** \"The ability to do work or cause change. In your machines, electrical energy (from the battery) powered the motor to create motion.\"\n   \n   **Mechanical energy:** \"The energy of motion and position. When your motor spins, it creates mechanical energy that makes the wheels and gears move.\"\n   \n   **Force:** \"A push or a pull that can cause an object to move, stop, or change direction. The spinning motor applies a force to the gears and wheels, making them turn.\"\n   \n   **Motion:** \"When something changes position or moves from one place to another. Your machines show different kinds of motion—spinning, rolling, rotating.\"\n   \n   **Simple machine:** \"A basic device with few moving parts that helps us do work by changing the direction or amount of force. Wheels and gears are examples you used.\"\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph:**\n   - Display the original LEGO photograph again. \"These machines work the same way as yours. A motor converts electrical energy into motion. The gears and wheels change how that force moves, making the bird wings flap or the vehicle roll.\"\n   - Point out: \"See the wires? Those carry electrical energy from the battery to the motor. Without energy, the machines don't move. With energy, they create forces that cause motion.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"If I disconnect the battery, what will happen to the motor?\" (It will stop moving; no electrical energy.)\n   - \"Why do you think gears are useful in machines?\" (They can change direction of motion, speed up or slow down movement.)\n   - \"Is the energy disappearing when the machine stops, or is it just changing form?\" (It's still there—just not being used to create motion.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Energy:** The ability to do work or make things move and change.\n- **Electrical energy:** Energy that flows through wires and powers devices like motors.\n- **Mechanical energy:** Energy that comes from motion and position (things moving or objects held up against gravity).\n- **Force:** A push or pull that can change the motion or shape of an object.\n- **Motion:** The act of changing position; moving from one place to another.\n- **Motor:** A device that converts electrical energy into mechanical motion (spinning).\n- **Simple machine:** A basic tool that makes work easier by changing the direction or size of a force (examples: wheels, gears, pulleys).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define energy and explain that motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy\n- Students understand that force and motion are connected\n- Students recognize gears and wheels as simple machines that help machines work\n- Students can use vocabulary terms when describing how their machines moved\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by engineering a solution to a real-world challenge.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Motorized LEGO building sets (same as Explore phase)\n- Objects to move: small plastic cups, toy blocks, cotton balls, index cards\n- Ramps made from books and rulers\n- Measuring tape or marked distance on table\n- Challenge task cards (see below)\n- Data recording sheets\n\n**Activity:**\n\nChoose one of the following challenge scenarios (you may differentiate by group):\n\n**Challenge A: \"Build a machine that pushes an object across the longest distance.\"**\n- Students redesign their machine to maximize pushing force and distance\n- They test by pushing a small cup across a table from different motor positions\n- They measure and record the distance traveled\n- They identify: \"What design choice made the biggest difference in distance?\"\n\n**Challenge B: \"Build a machine that lifts or raises an object.\"**\n- Students use their motor to lift a small plastic cup or weight using gears, levers, or a pulley-like system\n- They test to see how high they can lift it\n- They record: \"How much higher could you lift it if you used different gears?\"\n\n**Challenge C: \"Build a machine that moves an object up a ramp.\"**\n- Students position their machine to push or pull a object up an inclined plane\n- They measure how far up the ramp the object travels\n- They explore: \"Does the angle of the ramp change how far the object goes?\"\n\n**Structured steps:**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge** and show an example of success (e.g., \"This cup needs to travel at least 2 feet\").\n2. **Students design** a modification to their existing machine or build a new one.\n3. **Students test and measure** the results (distance, height, or time).\n4. **Students record data** and make observations: \"What worked? What didn't? Why?\"\n5. **Quick debrief:** \"What did you learn about how to make machines work better for a specific job?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide challenges that require students to think about force, motion, and engineering trade-offs\n- Ask: \"How would increasing the size of your wheels affect the speed?\" or \"Does a bigger gear make the machine stronger or faster?\"\n- Guide students to collect real data and reflect on results\n- Encourage comparison: \"How did your results compare to another group's?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding of energy and force to solve an engineering problem\n- Students collect and analyze data about machine performance\n- Students explain the relationship between their design choices and the machine's motion (faster, slower, stronger, weaker)\n- Students recognize that machines are designed for specific purposes and require optimization\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of energy conversion, forces, and motion through formative and summative methods.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore and Elaborate phases:\n  - Can students operate the motor and identify moving parts?\n  - Do they recognize the energy source (battery/electrical energy)?\n  - Can they describe motion using direction and speed?\n  - Do they adjust designs based on observations?\n\n- **Questioning during Explain phase:**\n  - Listen to responses when asking about energy conversion, forces, and simple machines\n  - Note misconceptions: e.g., \"Where does the energy go when the motor stops?\" to check if they understand energy is conserved\n\n**Summative Exit Ticket (end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with this 3-question exit ticket:\n\n1. **\"Explain how the motor in your machine caused it to move. Where did the energy come from?\"**\n   - *Success criteria:* Student mentions electrical energy from battery/power source and describes how it made something turn or spin\n\n2. **\"If you wanted to make your machine move faster, what is one change you could make to your design? Why would that work?\"**\n   - *Success criteria:* Student suggests a specific design change (larger wheels, different gears, etc.) and provides a logical reason related to force or motion\n\n3. **\"Draw a simple diagram of your machine. Label the motor, the part that moves, and show with an arrow the direction the object moves.\"**\n   - *Success criteria:* Diagram shows understanding of how motor connects to moving parts; arrow indicates accurate direction of motion\n\n**Alternative Summative Options:**\n\n- **Engineering Design Brief:** Students complete a written or digital reflection: \"Describe the machine you built, explain how it works, and predict what would happen if you made one specific change.\"\n\n- **Peer Teaching:** Students teach another group how their machine works, using vocabulary terms (energy, force, motion, simple machine) correctly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should demonstrate:\n- Understanding that electrical energy is converted into mechanical motion by the motor\n- Ability to describe forces (pushes/pulls) and the resulting motion (direction, speed)\n- Recognition of how design choices affect machine performance\n- Use of grade-appropriate vocabulary (energy, force, motion, motor, simple machine)\n- Ability to make predictions about how changes to the design would affect motion\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support\n\n**For struggling learners:**\n\n1. **Provide pre-built motor assemblies:** Rather than students connecting the motor themselves, provide a motor already attached to a simple base so they can focus on building the working structure and observing motion.\n\n2. **Use simplified challenge tasks:** Offer a single, concrete challenge (e.g., \"Make your machine move a ball from point A to point B\") with a visual success criteria poster showing what success looks like. Avoid complex tasks with multiple variables initially.\n\n3. **Pair with strong partners:** Assign students to work with peers who can model problem-solving and vocabulary use. Provide sentence frames for explanations: \"My machine moves because the motor makes the _____ turn. This creates a _____ (push/pull) that moves the _____.\"\n\n### Challenge\n\n**For advanced learners:**\n\n1. **Multi-stage engineering challenges:** \"Design a machine that can push an object AND lift another object using only one motor. Which task does it do better? Why?\" This requires optimization thinking and trade-off analysis.\n\n2. **Quantitative exploration:** Challenge students to collect precise data and create graphs. \"Measure the speed of your machine three times. Did it move at the same speed each time? Create a bar graph showing your data. Why might the results vary?\"\n\n3. **Systems thinking extension:** \"Design a chain or system where one machine's motion triggers or powers another machine. How does the energy transfer between the two machines?\" This deepens understanding of energy transfer through interconnected systems.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Real-world machine research:** Students research and present on one real-world motorized machine or vehicle (e.g., electric car, robot, conveyor belt). They identify the motor, the type of motion it creates, and explain how understanding simple machines helped engineers design it. Encourage use of diagrams and digital presentations.\n\n2. **Energy transformation stations:** Set up 3-4 stations around the classroom, each demonstrating a different type of energy transformation (solar power to motion, gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy, etc.). Students rotate through and record observations in a station journal, connecting each to the motorized machines they built.\n\n3. **Engineering design competition:** Host a \"Strongest Machine\" or \"Fastest Machine\" competition where students rebuild or modify their machines to meet specific criteria (push the heaviest object, travel the farthest distance, climb the steepest ramp). Students predict outcomes, test, measure, and present results to the class.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\nThis lesson sequence builds from concrete, hands-on exploration to abstract thinking about energy and forces. Fifth-graders benefit from seeing, touching, and testing machines before learning vocabulary. The photograph serves as an authentic hook and a reference point throughout the lesson. Consider saving student-built machines for display or for students to demonstrate to younger grades—this reinforces learning through teaching and builds confidence.",
