Design and build a simple motorized structure using LEGO bricks, gears, and a small motor.\n2. Observe and record patterns in how forces from a motor cause objects to move in specific directions.\n3. Predict how changes to the design (such as wheel size or motor direction) will affect the motion of the machine.\n4. Explain the relationship between the motor's force and the resulting motion of the structure using evidence from their observations.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about forces and motion using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of motorized LEGO machines (displayed on screen or printed)\n- Optional: Small toy car or wind-up toy to demonstrate motion\n\n**Activity:**\n\nDisplay the photograph prominently where all students can see it clearly. Ask students to observe silently for 20-30 seconds, then facilitate this discussion:\n\n1. **\"What do you see moving in this picture? What is making those things move?\"** (Accept observations about wheels, motors, machines, colors, structures.)\n\n2. **\"If you touch the base of the machine with the wheels, do you think it would feel still or like something is vibrating or moving inside? Why do you think that?\"** (Elicit predictions based on visible motors and moving parts.)\n\n3. **\"Look at the two bird figures standing on top. Why do you think the engineer put them on this machine? What might happen if the machine starts moving?\"** (Prompt thinking about how attached objects respond to the machine's motion.)\n\n4. **\"If we changed something about this machine—like using bigger wheels or moving the motor to a different spot—how do you think it would move differently?\"** (Activate prior thinking about design changes.)\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become engineers just like the person who designed these machines. You'll build your own motorized structure and investigate how the motor's force changes the way your machine moves.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts of forces and motion through hands-on building and testing.\n\n**Materials:**\n- LEGO building sets with motors (1 set per pair of students; basic motorized kits such as LEGO WeDo or LEGO Technic work well)\n- Small LEGO wheels (at least 2-3 sizes per set)\n- LEGO base plates or building boards\n- Simple design instruction cards (pictures only, no words, showing: basic chassis, wheel placement, motor attachment, gear connection)\n- Measuring tape or meter stick (1 per pair)\n- Observation recording sheets (see template below)\n- Optional: tape to mark starting lines on the floor or table\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Build a Base Machine (10 minutes):**\n   - Using the design card as a guide, build a simple motorized vehicle with a chassis, two wheels, and an attached motor.\n   - Do not turn on the motor yet.\n   - Ask: \"Does your machine move without the motor? Why or why not?\"\n\n2. **Test the Motor Direction (5 minutes):**\n   - Turn on the motor and observe carefully. Does your machine move forward, backward, or not at all?\n   - Predict: \"If we reverse the motor direction, what will happen?\"\n   - Reverse the motor direction. Record whether your prediction was correct.\n\n3. **Record Your Observations:**\n   - On the observation sheet, draw an arrow showing the direction your machine moved.\n   - Write or draw: What made the machine move? (The motor/force)\n   - Predict: If we added a larger wheel, would the machine move faster or slower? Write your guess.\n\n**How the Activity Connects to the Photograph:**\nStudents are recreating the process shown in the photograph—they're designing and testing motorized machines with wheels, just like the examples displayed. They're discovering firsthand what happens when a motor (force) is applied.\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Simple drawings showing machine direction of motion\n- One sentence or phrase about what caused the motion\n- A written or drawn prediction about changing the wheel size\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nCirculate among pairs. Ask guiding questions rather than giving answers: \"What happened when you turned the motor on?\" \"What force made the wheel turn?\" \"Do you think changing this part would make a difference?\" Ensure all pairs have functioning motors before moving forward. Troubleshoot any connection issues.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents will discover that:\n- The motor provides the force that makes wheels turn.\n- The direction of motor force determines the direction of motion.\n- Changing a variable (like reversing the motor) creates a predictable change in motion.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and deepen understanding of forces, motion, and cause-and-effect relationships after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of motorized machines (displayed again)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Simple diagram showing motor → force → motion\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share their observations: \"What happened when your motor turned on? What caused your machine to move?\"\n   - Record student responses on chart paper using their language first.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Display a simple diagram: **Motor (energy source) → Force → Motion**\n   - Explain each term using student observations as examples:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move. Your motor created a force that pushed the wheels to turn.\n- **Motor:** A machine that uses electricity to create a force that makes things turn or move.\n- **Motion:** When something changes position or moves from one place to another. Your wheels were in motion!\n- **Direction:** The way something moves—forward, backward, left, or right. When you reversed the motor, it changed the direction of motion.\n- **Cause and Effect:** Cause is what makes something happen. Effect is what happens. The motor turning (cause) made your wheels spin (effect).\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the motorized machines in the photo. \"See these motors? They're creating forces, just like your motors did. The force makes the wheels spin, and that's the motion you see. The engineers designed these to solve a problem—they wanted to make something move automatically.\"\n   - Point to the wheeled machine at the bottom: \"This one has bigger wheels. Based on what you learned, do you think bigger wheels would be faster or slower? Why?\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If the motor is the cause, what is the effect in your machine?\" (The wheels spinning / the machine moving)\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if we turned off the motor?\" (The force would stop, and the motion would stop)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents will understand that:\n- Motors create forces.\n- Forces cause motion in predictable patterns.\n- You can predict how changing the design will change the motion.\n- Cause and effect: motor turning = wheels moving.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by modifying their designs and predicting outcomes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Motorized machines built during Explore phase\n- Additional LEGO wheels (different sizes)\n- Gears (if available in the kit)\n- Measuring tape\n- New observation sheets for predictions and testing\n- Optional: small obstacles or ramps to test machine movement\n\n**Activity:**\n\nStudents will conduct a design investigation to test their predictions from the Explore phase:\n\n1. **Modify the Machine (8 minutes):**\n   - Challenge: \"Change ONE part of your machine. You might use bigger wheels, add a gear, or shift where the motor is attached.\"\n   - Have students draw or write their prediction: \"I think my machine will move _______ (faster/slower/in a different direction) because _______.\"\n\n2. **Test and Measure (10 minutes):**\n   - Turn the motor on and observe. Does the motion match your prediction?\n   - If possible, measure how far the machine travels in 5 seconds using the measuring tape. Record the distance.\n   - Test with the original design and compare: Which design moved farther? Which was faster?\n\n3. **Explain Results:**\n   - Ask: \"What force was different between your two designs? How did that change the motion?\"\n   - Encourage students to think like engineers: \"Which design would be better for a race? Which would be better for moving something heavy? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nAsk prediction questions: \"What do you think will happen?\" \"Why do you think that?\" Facilitate measurement and comparison. Praise specific observations: \"You noticed that bigger wheels made it travel farther—that's excellent scientific thinking!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will see that design changes cause predictable changes in motion.\n- They will use evidence (measurements and observations) to support their ideas.\n- They will begin thinking like engineers: choosing designs based on what they want the machine to do.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces, motion, cause-and-effect relationships, and design thinking.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Circulate during Explore phase and listen to student explanations: Can they identify the motor as the cause and motion as the effect?\n- Ask probing questions: \"What would happen if...?\" to assess their understanding of predictable patterns in motion.\n- Review observation sheets for evidence that students can draw and label motion patterns.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet paper or digital form with two questions:\n\n1. **Draw and Label:** Draw a simple motorized machine. Label the motor, the wheels, and the direction it will move. Then write one sentence: \"The _______ created a force that made the _______ move.\"\n\n2. **Prediction Question:** \"If you made the wheels even BIGGER, what would happen to how fast your machine moves? Circle: FASTER / SLOWER / SAME. Explain your thinking in one sentence.\"\n\n**Alternative Exit Ticket (for advanced readers):**\n\"A student built a motorized machine that moves very slowly. She wants it to move faster. What could she change about her design and why would that help?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they can:\n- ✓ Identify the motor as the force-maker (cause)\n- ✓ Describe the resulting motion accurately (effect)\n- ✓ Make a prediction about how a design change will affect motion\n- ✓ Provide at least one reason for their prediction\n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n- **Learning Objective 1 (Design and Build):** Observe whether each pair successfully built a motorized structure that moves. This can be observed directly during Explore.\n- **Learning Objective 2 (Observe and Record Patterns):** Review observation sheets. Students should show direction of motion with arrows or descriptions.\n- **Learning Objective 3 (Predict Design Changes):** Check Elaborate activity and exit ticket. Students should make predictions about wheel size, gear changes, etc.\n- **Learning Objective 4 (Explain Force-Motion Relationship):** Exit ticket answers should connect motor force to motion. Students should use cause-and-effect language.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-Built Motor Option:** Have a pre-assembled motorized base ready for students who struggle with building. They can focus on observing and recording motion rather than troubleshooting mechanical issues. This keeps them engaged with the core concepts (forces and motion) without frustration.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames:** Provide printed sentence frames for observation recording:\n   - \"The motor creates a _______ (push/pull).\"\n   - \"This force makes the wheels _______.\"\n   - \"When I changed the _______, the motion became _______.\"\n\n3. **Simplified Predictions:** Rather than asking students to predict what will happen with design changes, allow them to test first and then explain what they observed. Example: \"What DID change when you made the wheel bigger?\" (observation-first learning)\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Complex Design Challenge:** Provide gears and ask: \"Design a machine where the wheels turn in opposite directions. How would that change the motion?\" Require a labeled diagram and written explanation.\n\n2. **Measurement and Graphing:** Have advanced students measure and graph the distance traveled with different wheel sizes. Create a bar graph showing which design traveled the farthest. Introduce the concept of variables: \"The wheel size was the variable we changed.\"\n\n3. **Real-World Problem Solving:** Present a scenario: \"An engineer needs to design a motorized machine that pushes a book across a table gently (not fast). What design would work best and why?\" Require a labeled drawing and written justification using scientific vocabulary (force, motion, motor).\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Motorized Art Project:** Students design a motorized machine that traces or paints a pattern. Attach a marker to their machine and let it move across a large sheet of paper. Challenge: \"Can you create a machine that draws a circle? A square? What shapes are possible?\" This applies understanding of motion patterns to a creative context and introduces the idea that predictable forces create predictable patterns.\n\n2. **Build a Motorized Delivery System:** Students design a motorized platform or cart that can carry a small load (a pencil, block, or toy). Challenge: \"Can your machine move the object without dropping it? How does adding weight change the motion?\" This applies force-and-motion concepts to engineering design and introduces the real-world idea of friction and resistance.\n\n3. **Compare and Contrast: Living vs. Mechanical Motion:** Show video clips or photographs of animals moving (a bird flying, a dog running) alongside the motorized machines. Discuss: \"How is the motion the same? How is it different? What provides the force in a living animal? What provides the force in a machine?\" This extends learning to biological systems and deepens cause-and-effect thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n**Safety Reminders:**\n- Ensure all LEGO motors are age-appropriate and have no loose small parts.\n- Keep hands clear of moving wheels and gears to prevent pinching.\n- If using any additional materials (tape, ramps), ensure they are classroom-safe.\n\n**Preparation:**\n- Test all motorized LEGO sets before the lesson to ensure they function properly.\n- Pre-make simple design instruction cards with clear pictures (no text) to support students who need visual guides.\n- Set up a observation/testing area with clear workspace for each pair.\n\n**Pacing Notes:**\n- Day 1: Complete Engage and Explore phases (25 minutes total).\n- Day 2: Complete Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate phases (50 minutes total).\n- Alternatively, conduct as a single 90-minute session with a brief transition break.\n\nThis lesson directly aligns with third-grade learners' developmental readiness for hands-on engineering and their emerging ability to predict patterns and identify cause-and-effect relationships. The photograph serves as a concrete, relatable model of what engineers actually create, making abstract concepts of force and motion tangible and exciting.",
