ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity about light and materials using the photograph of buildings with glass and reflections.\n\n#### Materials\n- Large printed color photograph (or projected image) of the building glass/reflection scene\n- Pointer stick or finger for directing attention\n- Chart paper and marker\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display and Introduce the Photograph:**\nShow students the photograph on a screen or as a large print. Point to the glass building on the left and the building visible through the glass on the right.\n\n**Engage with Discussion Questions:**\nAsk students these specific, observation-focused questions:\n\n1. *\"Look at this picture. What do you see when you look at the glass part on the left side? Can you see through it?\"* (Let students describe: it's see-through, clear, you can see the sky, etc.)\n\n2. *\"Now look at the tan building you can see through the glass. Why can we see that building through the glass? What is the glass doing?\"* (Guide them toward: the glass lets light come through; we can see because light travels through the glass)\n\n3. *\"If I put something dark and thick in front of your eyes, like a book, could you see through it the way you see through this glass?\"* (Elicit: no, the book is not see-through; it blocks what we see)\n\n4. *\"I wonder... are ALL materials see-through like glass? Or do some materials look different when light tries to go through them?\"* (This is your wonder prompt—don't answer it yet!)\n\n**Record Predictions:**\nAsk: *\"What do you think? What materials in our classroom might let light pass through them like the glass does?\"* Write down 3-4 student predictions on chart paper. Keep this visible for later comparison.\n\n#### Transition\n\"Today, you're going to be Light Detectives! We're going to test different materials just like the glass in this picture to find out which ones let light shine through.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate which classroom materials allow light to pass through and which don't.\n\n#### Materials\n- Flashlights or small LED light sources (1 per pair/small group)\n- Clear plastic wrap\n- Wax paper\n- Construction paper (dark color)\n- Tissue paper (white)\n- Frosted transparency sheets (or diffraction film)\n- Paper cups or cardboard tubes to hold materials\n- Observation recording sheets (simple drawings or pictures to circle)\n- A semi-dark or dimly lit corner of the classroom (close blinds partially, or use a table with a blanket over it to create shadiness)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Setup:**\nDivide the class into 4-5 small groups (3-4 students per group). Each group gets:\n- One flashlight\n- A set of materials to test (clear plastic wrap, wax paper, construction paper, tissue paper, frosted sheet)\n- An observation sheet with pictures of each material\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud and demonstrate with one material first):**\n\n1. *\"Turn on your flashlight. Point it at the white wall or paper in front of you. What do you see? You see the light, right?\"*\n\n2. *\"Now, hold up the CLEAR PLASTIC WRAP in front of your flashlight. Shine the light through it. Can you still see the light on the wall? Can you see the light clearly? Draw or circle what you see on your paper.\"*\n\n3. *\"Now try the TISSUE PAPER. Hold it in front of the light. Does the light come through? Is it bright or dim? Circle or draw what you see.\"*\n\n4. *\"Try the WAX PAPER. Same question: does light come through? Is it bright or dim?\"*\n\n5. *\"Now try the DARK CONSTRUCTION PAPER. Shine the light at it. Can you see light on the wall behind it? Circle what you see.\"*\n\n6. *\"Finally, try the FROSTED SHEET. What happens? Does it look different from the clear plastic?\"*\n\n**What to Record:**\nStudents should circle or draw on their sheets:\n- BRIGHT light came through\n- DIM light came through  \n- NO light came through (just darkness)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice? Is this light bright or dim? Can you see the shape of the light clearly?\"*\n- Do NOT tell them the answers—let them observe and describe.\n- Encourage students to use words like: clear, bright, dark, dim, blurry, blocked.\n- Take photos of student investigations for documentation.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students discover that clear materials let lots of light through (bright light).\n- Students find that some materials (wax paper, tissue) let light through but make it dimmer or softer.\n- Students observe that thick, dark materials (construction paper) block light completely.\n- Students record their observations using pictures and simple descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce vocabulary and connect observations to light concepts using evidence from the Explore phase.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper from Engage phase with predictions\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n- Large images or actual samples of each material\n- A flashlight and the material samples\n- Vocabulary anchor chart (to create with students)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\nGather students back together. Ask:\n\n- *\"What did you discover? Which materials let LOTS of light through?\"* (clear plastic wrap)\n- *\"Which materials let SOME light through, but it was dim or soft?\"* (tissue paper, wax paper)\n- *\"Which material blocked the light completely?\"* (dark construction paper)\n\n**Introduce Key Vocabulary (with student-friendly definitions):**\n\nCreate an anchor chart together as you define each term:\n\n1. **Transparent (TRANS-pare-ent):** A material you can see clearly through, like clear glass or clear plastic wrap. Light passes right through it, bright and clear.\n\n2. **Translucent (trans-LOO-sent):** A material that lets light through, but it's blurry or dim, like frosted glass or wax paper. You can see light, but not see things clearly.\n\n3. **Opaque (oh-PAYK):** A material that does NOT let light through, like dark construction paper or wood. It blocks light and makes a shadow.\n\n4. **Light:** Energy that lets us see. It travels in straight lines until something stops it.\n\n5. **Shadow:** The dark shape made when something blocks light.\n\n**Connect Back to the Photograph:**\nPoint to the photograph again. Say:\n\n*\"Remember this picture? The glass building on the left is TRANSPARENT, like our clear plastic wrap! That's why we can see through it to the building behind it. The glass is clear, so lots of light travels through it. The tan building we see is made of something more like our construction paper—it's OPAQUE. The light can't get through the building, so we can only see the outside of it.\"*\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\nShow each material sample. Ask: *\"Is this transparent, translucent, or opaque? Why did you pick that?\"* Have students hold up their fingers to vote (1 = transparent, 2 = translucent, 3 = opaque). Correct gently if needed.\n\n#### Vocabulary\n- **Transparent:** You can see clearly through it; light passes through it brightly.\n- **Translucent:** Light passes through, but it's soft and blurry; you cannot see clearly.\n- **Opaque:** Light cannot pass through it; it blocks light and makes darkness.\n- **Light:** The energy that lets us see things.\n- **Shadow:** The dark spot made when something blocks light.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students can name and describe the three types of materials based on how light passes through them.\n- Students understand that different materials have different properties that affect light.\n- Students can use the new vocabulary with some accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply their understanding of light and materials to a real-world scenario and design a practical solution.\n\n#### Materials\n- Building blocks, small boxes, or cardboard pieces\n- Flashlights (1-2 per group)\n- Samples of transparent, translucent, and opaque materials\n- Small objects or toys to hide (small figurines, blocks, or pictures)\n- Chart paper for design recording\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Real-World Scenario:**\n*\"Imagine you're building a house for a family. They want a front door where they can see outside (but not see them). They also want a window that lets lots of bright light in so they can see the garden. And they want a storage closet where it's dark so things stay safe in the dark. Which materials should we use for each?\"*\n\n**Student Task:**\nIn small groups, students:\n\n1. **Design a small \"house\"** using blocks or boxes.\n2. **Choose materials** for three parts:\n   - A front door (translucent—so you can see shapes but not details)\n   - A bright window (transparent—so light comes through clearly)\n   - A closet wall (opaque—so no light gets through)\n\n3. **Test their design** with the flashlight. Shine light through each part and describe what happens.\n4. **Record or draw** their design and explain why they chose each material.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: *\"Why did you choose transparent for that part? What will happen when light hits it?\"*\n- Help students test their designs with light.\n- Ask them to predict before testing: *\"What do you think will happen if we shine light through this?\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students apply the concepts of transparent, translucent, and opaque to solve a real problem.\n- Students can justify material choices based on light properties.\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding by predicting light behavior before testing.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of how different materials affect light.\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\nThroughout all phases, listen for:\n- Can students describe what light does (passes through, gets blocked)?\n- Can they use vocabulary terms (transparent, translucent, opaque) with accuracy?\n- Do their predictions match their observations?\n\n**Exit Ticket (End of Lesson):**\nShow each student a mystery material sample (could be: clear plastic, tissue, or cardstock). Ask them to respond to ONE of these prompts:\n\n*Option 1 (with picture choices):* \"Is this material transparent, translucent, or opaque? Point to or circle the word.\"\n\n*Option 2 (with verbal response):* \"Can light pass through this material? How do you know? What would you see if you held it up to the sun?\"\n\n*Option 3 (with a simple drawing):* \"Draw what you think will happen when we shine light through this material.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n✓ Student correctly identifies the material type.\n✓ Student gives a reason based on what light does.\n✓ Student uses evidence from their investigation to explain their answer.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- **Developing:** Student can describe whether light passes through a material but may not use precise vocabulary.\n- **Proficient:** Student correctly identifies transparent/translucent/opaque and explains using light behavior.\n- **Advanced:** Student predicts light behavior for unknown materials and explains using scientific reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on just TWO categories during Explain—\"Lets light through\" (clear and blurry) vs. \"Blocks light\" (dark). Introduce \"transparent\" and \"opaque\" only; skip \"translucent\" initially.\n\n2. **Guided exploration:** Assign a teaching assistant or peer buddy to work with small groups during Explore. Ask them to narrate what they observe: *\"I see bright light on the wall. That means this lets light through.\"*\n\n3. **Simplified recording:** Use a picture chart with just three columns—smiley face (clear/bright), neutral face (dim/blurry), sad face (blocked/dark)—instead of written observations.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Predict and test combinations:** Ask: *\"What happens if we layer TWO materials together? Will the light be brighter or dimmer? Let's test your prediction.\"* Have them test stacking materials (plastic + tissue, for example).\n\n2. **Real-world application extension:** *\"Think about your classroom windows, your backpack, and a mirror. Are they transparent, translucent, or opaque? Why does each one need to be that way?\"* Have them photograph or draw examples around the school.\n\n3. **Explain the science deeper:** Ask advanced students to explain WHY different materials affect light differently: *\"What do you think is happening inside the material that makes the light dim or get blocked?\"* (Introduce the idea that materials are made of tiny particles that light bumps into.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Light and Shadow Theatre (Homework/Follow-up):**\n   At home, have students shine a flashlight through different household materials (plastic wrap from the kitchen, tissue from a box, paper bags, etc.). Ask them to draw or describe what they see and bring their discoveries back to school to share. This reinforces vocabulary and extends learning beyond the classroom.\n\n2. **Design a Window for the Classroom (Class Project):**\n   Use student learning to design a new \"window\" for the classroom that lets in light but also creates interesting shadows or patterns. Provide materials like frosted paper, tissue paper, and clear plastic. Students vote on the design and help install it, seeing light behavior in real time as the day changes.\n\n3. **Light Investigation Journal (Independent or Small Group):**\n   Create a simple booklet where students document light interactions with different materials they observe in the school: windows in the hallway, the glass on the secretary's office, the door to the gymnasium, etc. Have them draw and label each as transparent, translucent, or opaque, and explain why each is useful in that location.\n\n---\n\n## Alignment to NGSS\n\n**1-PS4-2** is fully addressed: Students make observations (Explore phase) to construct evidence-based accounts (Explain + Elaborate phases) that objects (materials) can be seen through or blocked from view based on light traveling through or being blocked.\n\n**1-PS4-3** is fully addressed: Students plan and conduct investigations (Explore phase) to determine the effect of placing objects made with different materials (transparent, translucent, opaque) in the path of a beam of light (flashlight), recording and explaining their findings.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Classroom environment:** If possible, conduct Explore in a semi-dark area to make light behavior more visible. Close blinds partially or use a table with a blanket draped over it.\n- **Materials sourcing:** Most materials are classroom-standard. Frosted sheets can be purchased inexpensively online or at office supply stores. Alternatively, use tracing paper or vellum as translucent substitutes.\n- **Pacing:** This lesson works well across two 45-minute sessions (Engage/Explore on Day 1; Explain/Elaborate/Evaluate on Day 2) or as one extended 90-minute block. Adjust timing based on your students' focus needs.\n- **Vocabulary:** First graders may not retain all three terms immediately. Emphasize transparent and opaque first; translucent can be revisited in subsequent grades.",
