Explain how electrical energy is converted into motion in a motorized machine.\n2. Design and build a LEGO machine that uses a motor to move objects or perform a task.\n3. Test their machine and collect evidence about how changes to the design affect its speed or motion.\n4. Use observations to describe the relationship between the energy input (motor power) and the motion produced.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring the photograph of motorized LEGO machines.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the LEGO engineering machines (or displayed on projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Short 30-second video clip of a simple motorized machine in action (e.g., a LEGO car moving)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector where all students can see clearly. Point out the different machines and ask students to look closely at what they notice.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about these LEGO machines? What makes them different from a regular LEGO structure?\"\n   - \"Can you see any wires or cords connected to these machines? What do you think those are for?\"\n   - \"How do you think these machines got the energy to move? What powered them?\"\n   - \"If you could build a machine like this, what would you want it to do?\"\n\n3. **Prediction and Wonder Prompt:** \n   - Show the photograph again and say: \"These machines are powered by motors that run on electricity. When electricity flows through the motor, it creates motion. I'm wondering: How do you think the engineers who designed these machines decided what parts to use? What do you predict would happen if we made the wheels bigger or smaller?\"\n   \n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper. Highlight any mentions of electricity, motors, speed, or movement.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become engineers just like the people who built these machines. We'll design our own motorized LEGO machine and test how to make it work best!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how motors transfer energy to create motion by building and testing a simple motorized LEGO machine.\n\n**Materials (per student group of 2-3):**\n- LEGO building bricks (assorted)\n- LEGO motor unit and power source (battery pack or USB powered motor kit—minimum 1 per group)\n- Wheels and axles (various sizes)\n- Flat LEGO base plates\n- Paper or card stock for creating \"cargo\" to move (small paper cups, foam blocks, or LEGO loads)\n- Stopwatch or timer (can use phone/classroom timer)\n- Meter stick or measuring tape\n- Data recording sheet (see example below)\n- Optional: Small ramps made from cardboard or books\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and post visually):**\n\n1. **Build the base:** Construct a simple LEGO platform or chassis that is at least 4 inches long and 2 inches wide using bricks.\n\n2. **Attach the motor:** Connect the LEGO motor to your base platform according to the kit instructions. Secure the motor firmly so it won't shift during testing.\n\n3. **Add wheels and axles:** Attach wheels to axles and connect those axles to your motor so that when the motor runs, the wheels turn. (Note: If using non-motorized wheels, create a simple gear system or direct axle connection to the motor.)\n\n4. **Test Movement:** \n   - Turn on the motor and observe what happens.\n   - Does your machine move? In which direction?\n   - How fast does it move?\n\n5. **Add Cargo (Optional Challenge):**\n   - Place a small foam block or paper cup on top of your machine.\n   - Run the motor again. Does it move as fast? Can it still carry the cargo?\n   - Record your observations.\n\n6. **Test Wheel Size (Exploration Extension):**\n   - If time allows, try swapping wheels for larger or smaller ones.\n   - Do larger wheels make your machine faster or slower? What about smaller wheels?\n   - Record what you observe.\n\n7. **Document Your Findings:**\n   - Draw a labeled diagram of your machine showing the motor, wheels, and base.\n   - Write or sketch what you noticed about how the motor made the wheels turn.\n   - Record: How far did your machine travel in 10 seconds? Did adding cargo change this?\n\n**How This Connects to the Photograph:**\n\"Just like the machines in the photo, your machine uses a motor powered by electricity to make wheels turn and create motion. The engineers who designed the photo machines probably tested different wheel sizes and weights, just like you're doing now.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions rather than providing solutions:\n  - \"What happens when you turn on the motor? What do you see moving?\"\n  - \"How could you measure how far your machine travels?\"\n  - \"What do you think will happen if you use bigger wheels?\"\n  \n- Assist with motor connections and troubleshooting (wiring, securing axles) but let students discover how changes affect motion.\n- Encourage students to make predictions *before* making changes: \"What do you think will happen if...?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students build a functioning motorized LEGO machine with wheels that move when the motor is activated.\n- Students observe and record that:\n  - Electrical energy from the battery/power source causes the motor to spin.\n  - The spinning motor transfers energy to the wheels, causing them to rotate and the machine to move.\n  - Changes in wheel size or added weight affect how the machine moves.\n- Students produce labeled diagrams and written observations of their machine and its movement.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (16-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the energy conversion process after students have explored hands-on.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Printed vocabulary cards (or write on board)\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Simple diagram or animation showing energy transfer (optional: projected image or teacher-drawn)\n- Photograph from introduction (display again)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-6 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 groups to briefly describe their machines and share one observation.\n   - Focus on: What made their machine move? What changed when they tested different parts?\n   - Write key student observations on chart paper (e.g., \"bigger wheels made it faster,\" \"the motor spins the wheels,\" \"electricity made it work\").\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n   - Write each term on the board as you explain it using student language and the photograph.\n   - Point to the machines in the photo as you discuss each term.\n\n3. **Explain the Energy Transfer Process:**\n   - \"When you connected the motor to power, electrical energy traveled through the wires. That electrical energy made the motor spin. The spinning motor was mechanical energy, which then moved the wheels and made your whole machine go. This is called energy transfer—energy changed from electrical into motion, or mechanical energy.\"\n   - Draw a simple arrow diagram: **Electrical Energy → Motor Spins → Wheels Turn → Machine Moves**\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students to turn and talk to a partner: \"Tell your partner: What type of energy powered your machine? What type of motion did it create?\"\n   - Call on 2-3 pairs to share out.\n   - Use a thumbs-up/sideways/down quick check: \"Thumbs up if you understand how electricity made your machine move.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Energy:** The power or ability to make something happen or to move and change things. (In your machine, energy from the battery made the motor work.)\n- **Electrical Energy:** Energy that comes from electricity, usually from a battery or power source. (The wires and battery gave electrical energy to your motor.)\n- **Mechanical Energy:** Energy of motion—the energy something has because it is moving. (Your spinning wheels and moving machine had mechanical energy.)\n- **Motor:** A machine that changes electrical energy into spinning motion. (The motor in your LEGO machine made the wheels turn.)\n- **Energy Transfer:** When energy moves from one form to another or from one place to another. (Your machine transferred electrical energy into the motion of the wheels—that's energy transfer!)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that electrical energy powered their motor.\n- Students can explain (using words or drawings) that the motor transferred that energy to create motion.\n- Students recognize the connection between their hands-on machine and the energy concept.\n- Students use vocabulary terms correctly when discussing their observations.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (16-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of energy transfer and design by improving or redesigning their machines.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original LEGO machines from Explore phase\n- Additional LEGO bricks and pieces (extended variety)\n- Extra motors (if available) or additional battery packs\n- Data sheets or engineering notebooks\n- Optional: Ramps, barriers, or obstacle course materials\n- Challenge cards (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge: Redesign for Speed, Strength, or Distance (Choose One)**\n\nPresent students with three redesign challenges (display on board or provide cards):\n\n1. **Speed Challenge:** \"Redesign your machine to make it travel as fast as possible in 10 seconds. You can change wheel size, add more motor power (if available), or adjust the gear ratio. Test it and measure how far it goes. Can you make it faster than your first design?\"\n\n2. **Strength Challenge:** \"Redesign your machine to carry the heaviest cargo without slowing down. You might need to reinforce your base, use stronger wheels, or add a second motor. Test different cargo weights and see how much it can handle.\"\n\n3. **Distance Challenge:** \"Redesign your machine to travel the farthest distance on a single 10-second run. Think about friction, wheel size, and motor power. What changes help it go the farthest?\"\n\n**Student Actions:**\n\n1. Choose one challenge and predict what changes they'll make.\n2. Modify their machine based on their hypothesis.\n3. Test the redesigned machine using the same measurement method from Explore.\n4. Compare: Did it perform better than the original? What evidence do they have?\n5. Record the before-and-after data with drawings and written explanations.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Guide students to think about which design variables matter for their chosen challenge.\n- Ask: \"Why do you think that change will help? How will you measure if it worked?\"\n- Encourage students to test one variable at a time (e.g., change wheel size, test, then record before changing anything else).\n- Help students interpret data: \"What does your data tell you? Did your redesign work?\"\n\n**Real-World Connection:**\n\"Engineers who design real cars, robots, or delivery drones test and redesign just like you're doing. They measure how fast, how strong, or how far their machines can go, and they use that data to make better designs. You're doing real engineering!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students redesign their machine based on a specific goal.\n- Students collect evidence (measurements, observations, sketches) comparing original and redesigned versions.\n- Students explain which design changes helped and why, using energy and motion vocabulary.\n- Students produce updated diagrams and data showing their design improvements.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of energy transfer, motion, and engineering design.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observations during Explore:** Watch for students connecting motor action to motion; note if they understand the energy pathway.\n- **Questioning during Explain:** Listen to student responses about energy types and motor function.\n- **Challenge Selection and Execution:** Assess students' ability to apply concepts to solve a design problem.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (Administer at end of Day 2 or Session 2)**\n\n**Provide each student with the following exit ticket (can be printed or projected for students to write/draw answers):**\n\n---\n\n**LEGO Machine Engineer Exit Ticket**\n\n**Name: ________________________     Date: ____________**\n\n1. **Draw and label your final machine.** Show the motor, wheels, and power source.\n\n2. **Explain in words:** How did electrical energy make your machine move? Use the words \"energy transfer\" in your answer.\n   \n   _________________________________________________________________\n   \n   _________________________________________________________________\n\n3. **What happened when you changed the wheels (or cargo, or motor power)? Write one observation:**\n\n   _________________________________________________________________\n\n4. **If you could build a LEGO machine to do ANY job (like deliver a package, knock down blocks, or climb a ramp), what would it be? What would you need to change about your machine to do that job?**\n\n   _________________________________________________________________\n   \n   _________________________________________________________________\n\n---\n\n**Scoring Rubric (4-Point Scale):**\n\n| Criteria | 4 – Excellent | 3 – Proficient | 2 – Developing | 1 – Beginning |\n|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|\n| **Energy Transfer Explanation** | Student clearly explains electrical→mechanical energy transfer; uses correct vocabulary | Student explains energy transfer with minor gaps; uses most vocabulary correctly | Student gives a basic explanation; uses some vocabulary | Student struggles to explain or uses incorrect terms |\n| **Diagram Accuracy** | Machine diagram is labeled, accurate, and includes motor and power source clearly | Diagram is mostly accurate with most parts labeled | Diagram shows basic machine parts; some labels missing | Diagram is incomplete or unclear |\n| **Design Application** | Student describes thoughtful design change with reasoning; shows understanding of variables | Student describes a design change and how it affected motion | Student describes a design change with limited explanation | Student cannot identify any design change made |\n| **Use of Evidence** | Student uses specific measurements or detailed observations to support claims | Student provides observations and some data | Student provides general observations | Student provides minimal or no evidence |\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting NGSS Standards:**\n\n- **4-PS3-2:** Students provide evidence (observations from their testing, measurements, or sketches) that electrical energy was transferred through wires to the motor, which then transferred energy to move wheels and create motion.\n\n- **4-PS3-4:** Students design, test, and refine a motorized device (their LEGO machine) that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, and they show evidence of refinement through the Elaborate phase.\n\n- **4-PS3-1:** Students collect data showing that faster machines (higher energy input or better design) produced greater motion; they can explain the relationship between motor speed/power and how far or fast their machine traveled.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Exit tickets show that students understand energy transfer from electrical to mechanical.\n- Students can identify at least one design change and explain how it affected their machine's motion.\n- Students demonstrate thinking like engineers by considering how to improve designs for specific purposes.\n- 80% of students score \"Proficient\" or \"Excellent\" on the rubric.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-Built Motor Connection:** Provide a simple, pre-assembled motorized chassis so students can focus on understanding energy transfer rather than struggling with construction. They can practice testing and redesigning without building challenges.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:** Create a word wall with vocabulary cards including pictures/icons. Pair students with visual learners; allow them to use the cards during exit ticket. Provide sentence frames: \"The electrical energy made the _______ spin. This created _______ motion.\"\n\n3. **Simplified Data Recording:** Instead of measuring exact distances, use simple checkboxes or picture charts: \"Did it move? Fast or slow? Far or short?\" This reduces writing demands while still gathering evidence.\n\n4. **Buddy System:** Pair struggling students with confident peers. Assign specific roles (e.g., one builds, one records; one predicts, one tests) so each student contributes meaningfully.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Multiple Motors / Complex Machines:** Provide access to kits with multiple motors or gears. Challenge students to build a machine with two independent motors or a gear system. Ask: \"How does connecting two motors change what your machine can do? Can they work together or against each other?\"\n\n2. **Quantitative Analysis:** Have advanced students create graphs showing the relationship between wheel size and distance traveled, or cargo weight and speed. Ask them to identify trends and make predictions for untested sizes/weights.\n\n3. **Engineering Design Challenge:** Present a real-world scenario: \"A delivery company wants a LEGO robot that can move a package 3 meters in 5 seconds. Design and test a machine to meet these specifications. What trade-offs did you have to make?\" Students must optimize multiple variables.\n\n4. **Energy Efficiency Investigation:** Ask: \"Which machine design uses the least battery power to move the same distance? How could you test this?\" This extends thinking to energy conservation and efficiency.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n**For Early Finishers, Homework, or Follow-Up Lessons:**\n\n1. **Obstacle Course Design:** Students design an obstacle course (using blocks, ramps, or barriers) and test whether their LEGO machine can navigate it. They modify their machine as needed and document the trials. This reinforces iterative design and problem-solving.\n\n2. **Energy Transfer Poster:** Students create a colorful poster showing the energy transfer in their machine using arrows, labels, and illustrations. They explain each step from battery to motion. Display in the classroom or hallway as a visual reference for other students.\n\n3. **Research Real Machines:** Students research and present on a real-world motorized machine (e.g., electric car, robot vacuum, conveyor belt, escalator). They identify the energy source, the motor or mechanism, and the motion produced. Create a gallery walk or brief presentations comparing real machines to LEGO machines.\n\n4. **Speed Trials Data Collection:** Students conduct multiple trials of their original and redesigned machines, collecting at least 5 data points for each. They create a bar graph or line graph showing speed/distance over trials and identify patterns (e.g., Does the machine slow down over time? Is it consistent?).\n\n5. **Design Journal Reflection:** Students write or draw in a journal reflecting on: \"What surprised you about how motors work? What was hard about designing a machine? What would you do differently if you built another one?\" This builds metacognitive skills and reinforces learning.\n\n---\n\n### Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Pre-Lesson Preparation:** Test all LEGO motors and battery packs before class to ensure they work. Have backup motors available.\n- **Grouping:** Pairs or groups of 3 work best; groups larger than 4 risk students becoming passive.\n- **Time Management:** If running short, simplify Elaborate to a single challenge (e.g., everyone does the speed challenge) rather than offering three options.\n- **Materials Organization:** Pre-sort LEGO bricks into bins by type (wheels, motors, bases, connectors) to reduce setup time and keep exploration focused.\n- **Safety:** Ensure cords are secured to avoid tripping hazards. Supervise electrical connections.\n- **Connection to Next Lessons:** This lesson naturally leads to discussions of simple machines (gears, levers, pulleys) or friction and resistance in future sessions.",
