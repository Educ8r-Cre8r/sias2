Explain that waves carry energy and apply force to objects they encounter.\n2. Describe how different materials (rocks vs. sand) respond differently when a force is applied to them.\n3. Support an argument that gravity pulls water and objects downward toward Earth.\n4. Model how ocean waves are created by energy from the sun (wind) and transfer energy to the shore.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph (p30.jpg)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image of the crashing wave against the rocks and sand. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Hook with a Question:** Say: *\"What do you notice is happening in this picture? What do you think made the rocks look so different from the sand?\"*\n\n3. **Facilitated Discussion:** Ask these specific discussion questions:\n   - *\"Why do you think the wave is splashing so high? What is pushing it?\"*\n   - *\"If you touched the rocks in this picture and touched the sand, do you think they would feel the same or different? Why?\"*\n   - *\"Where do you think the rocks and sand came from? Could the wave have changed them?\"*\n   - *\"What do you think will happen to the sand and rocks if waves keep crashing here for a long time?\"*\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** Say: *\"Today, we're going to figure out how invisible pushes called forces can move things and shape our beaches. We're detectives investigating the power of waves!\"*\n\n5. **Record Predictions:** Write student predictions on chart paper under the heading: *\"What We Think About Waves and Shores.\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Let's become wave scientists and discover how forces work by making our own mini waves and testing different materials.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Shallow rectangular containers (8-10, such as aluminum baking pans, large plastic storage containers, or cafeteria trays)\n- Sand (about 3-4 cups per group, or collected beach sand)\n- Small rocks or pebbles (various sizes, about 1 cup per group)\n- Water (pitcher or spray bottle)\n- Rulers (one per pair or group)\n- Paper towels\n- Data recording sheets (see teacher preparation below)\n- Aprons or old t-shirts (optional but recommended)\n\n**Teacher Preparation:**\nCreate a simple data recording sheet with these columns:\n- *Material Tested (Sand / Rock)*\n- *How Much Water I Used*\n- *What I Observed After the \"Wave\"*\n- *Did the Material Move? (Yes/No)*\n- *How Far Did It Move? (inches)*\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize Groups:** Divide the class into 4-5 pairs or small groups. Set up each container station.\n\n2. **Setup Instructions for Students:**\n   - *\"In your container, create a small beach. Pour sand on one side and place rocks on the other side. Make it look like the picture we saw.\"*\n   - Allow 3-4 minutes for setup.\n\n3. **Wave Creation:** Explain: *\"Now you're going to create a wave by pouring water quickly into your container. Watch what happens to the sand and rocks. Does the wave push them the same way?\"*\n\n4. **Controlled Investigation:**\n   - **Trial 1:** Slowly pour water into the container (gentle wave). Observe and record what happens to sand and rocks.\n   - **Trial 2:** Pour water more quickly (stronger wave). Observe and record.\n   - **Trial 3:** Pour water very quickly (biggest wave). Observe and record.\n\n5. **Measurement:** Using a ruler, students measure how far sand grains or pebbles moved from their original position after each trial.\n\n6. **Documentation:** Students draw or photograph their observations and fill in the data sheet for each trial.\n\n7. **Reflection Questions (asked during exploration):**\n   - *\"Why do you think the sand and rocks moved differently?\"*\n   - *\"Did a bigger, faster wave make things move more? How do you know?\"*\n   - *\"What else do you notice about how the water moved?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between groups; ask guiding questions rather than providing answers (e.g., *\"What did you notice that was different that time? Why do you think that happened?\"*)\n- Ensure water stays contained and safety is maintained.\n- Prompt students to measure carefully and record all observations.\n- Ask: *\"If you did this again with an even bigger 'wave,' what would you predict would happen?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that faster, stronger water movement (waves with more force) moves materials farther.\n- Students observe that sand moves more easily than rocks.\n- Students record data showing a pattern: larger force = more movement.\n- Students understand that water applies a push (force) to objects.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Photograph (p30.jpg) re-displayed\n- Vocabulary anchor chart (prepare in advance)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share: *\"What happened when you made your wave?\"*\n   - Record findings on a large comparison chart titled: *\"Sand vs. Rocks: How They Respond to Waves\"*\n   - Ask: *\"What pattern did we notice? Did bigger waves move things farther?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n   Present each term with an example from the Explore activity:\n\n   **Force:** A push or a pull that can make something move, stop, or change shape.\n   - *\"When you poured the water into your container, that water created a force. It pushed the sand and rocks.\"*\n\n   **Energy:** The power to make something move or change.\n   - *\"The water in your experiment had energy—it could move the sand and rocks. In real oceans, wind gives energy to waves.\"*\n\n   **Gravity:** An invisible force that pulls objects down toward Earth.\n   - *\"Look at our photo. The wave is crashing DOWN. Gravity is pulling the water down toward the beach. This helps create the pushing force we saw.\"*\n\n   **Erosion:** When water or wind wears away rock and soil over a long time.\n   - *\"In the photograph, the rocks are darker and smoother because waves have been pushing against them for years and years. That's erosion.\"*\n\n   **Wave:** A moving disturbance in water that carries energy from one place to another.\n   - *\"The water you poured was like a small wave. In the ocean, waves travel across huge distances and carry even more energy.\"*\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Display the original photo again.\n   - Say: *\"Now we understand what we're seeing. The waves in this picture are applying FORCE to the rocks and sand. The rocks are hard, so they don't move much—but over many, many years, waves can break rocks apart through erosion. The sand moves more easily because it's made of smaller pieces.\"*\n   - Point out: *\"Gravity is pulling that water down, which creates the powerful push we see.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   Ask students to turn to a partner and answer: *\"Why do you think rocks stay on the beach but sand gets washed away more easily?\"* Listen for language about properties of materials, force, and movement.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Force** | A push or pull that can make something move, stop, or change. |\n| **Energy** | The power to make something do work or change. |\n| **Gravity** | An invisible force that pulls things down toward Earth. |\n| **Erosion** | When water, wind, or ice slowly wears away rocks and soil. |\n| **Wave** | A moving bump of water that carries energy across the ocean. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the new vocabulary to describe what they observed.\n- Students can explain that waves apply force and carry energy.\n- Students understand that gravity pulls water downward.\n- Students can distinguish between hard materials (rocks) and soft materials (sand) and predict which one a force will move more easily.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Containers from Explore phase (reused or fresh setup)\n- Sand, rocks, shells, and small toy objects (plastic fish, boats, figures)\n- Water pitchers\n- Scenario cards (printed, see below)\n- Clipboards and pencils\n- Optional: Video clip (30 seconds) of real ocean waves hitting a rocky shore\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-World Connection (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Show a brief video clip of real ocean waves (if available) or describe: *\"What we made today is tiny, but real ocean waves are HUGE and carry much more energy. Let's think about what happens on real beaches.\"*\n\n2. **Challenge Scenarios** (Students work in their pairs/groups):\n   Distribute scenario cards. Each group gets one scenario:\n\n   **Scenario A:** *\"A hurricane is coming. Waves will be very, very big and strong. What do you predict will happen to a beach with sand? What about a beach with rocks? Draw your prediction.\"*\n\n   **Scenario B:** *\"A shipping boat sinks near a rocky shore. Where would the cargo float to: near the rocks or out into deeper water? Why? Use what you learned about forces.\"*\n\n   **Scenario C:** *\"Humans want to build a castle from sand at the beach. Why might waves make this difficult? What property of sand makes it easy for waves to move it?\"*\n\n   **Scenario D:** *\"Over 100 years, how might a rocky beach change because of waves? Draw or describe what it might look like.\"*\n\n3. **Investigation Extension (10-12 minutes):**\n   - Groups set up their container again.\n   - Challenge: *\"Make the biggest, strongest wave you can without spilling water on the floor. What moved the most? What stayed still? Can you move a large rock with a wave?\"*\n   - Students test predictions from their scenario and record results.\n\n4. **Presentation of Findings (3-4 minutes):**\n   - 2-3 groups share their scenario predictions and results.\n   - Class discusses: *\"What did we learn about how strong forces are? What did we learn about gravity and water?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate scenario discussions by asking: *\"Why did you predict that? What force would be acting on the objects?\"*\n- Prompt students to use vocabulary: force, energy, gravity, erosion, wave.\n- Encourage students to explain their reasoning using evidence from their experiments.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply understanding of force and material properties to real-world scenarios.\n- Students predict and explain consequences of large wave forces.\n- Students use scientific vocabulary accurately and with confidence.\n- Students can articulate the role of gravity in pulling water and creating force.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Observe whether students are making accurate measurements and recording data. Ask: *\"How do you know the force was stronger that time?\"*\n- **During Explain:** Listen to partner conversations and check whether students use new vocabulary correctly.\n- **During Elaborate:** Review scenario predictions and drawings for accurate reasoning about force and material properties.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment—use at the end of Day 2):**\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (digital or paper). Students answer all three questions:\n\n1. **Draw and Label:** *\"Draw a wave hitting a beach with sand and rocks. Label where gravity is pulling water and where forces are pushing sand and rocks. Use at least two vocabulary words.\"*\n\n2. **Short Answer:** *\"Why do you think sand moves more easily than rocks when a wave pushes them? Explain using the word 'force' in your answer.\"*\n\n3. **Prediction:** *\"If a wave twice as big hit the beach, what would happen to the sand and rocks? Why?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria for Mastery:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies gravity pulling downward.\n- ✓ Student labels force as a push affecting sand and/or rocks.\n- ✓ Student explains that sand moves more because it is softer or in smaller pieces.\n- ✓ Student predicts that a bigger force (larger wave) will move objects farther.\n- ✓ Student uses at least 3 vocabulary words (force, energy, gravity, wave, erosion) correctly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that waves apply force.\n- Students explain that gravity pulls water downward.\n- Students recognize that material properties (hardness, size) affect how objects respond to force.\n- Students can make evidence-based predictions about cause and effect.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Sentence Frames for Exit Ticket:**\n   Provide sentence starters such as:\n   - *\"Gravity pulls the water ___.\"*\n   - *\"The sand moved because the wave ___.\"*\n   - *\"Sand is easier to move than rocks because ___.\"*\n\n2. **Simplified Scenario Cards:**\n   Instead of complex scenarios, provide single-image cards: *\"This wave is very big. What will happen to the sand?\"* (with picture cues)\n\n3. **Partner During Explore:**\n   Pair struggling learners with confident peers. Assign roles: one pours water (teacher-guided) while the other observes and measures. Switch roles.\n\n4. **Vocabulary Reference Sheet:**\n   Provide a visual anchor chart at each station showing vocabulary words with simple pictures (force = arrow pushing, gravity = arrow pointing down, wave = wavy lines).\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Multi-Variable Experiment:**\n   Ask: *\"What if we changed the angle of the container? Would the wave move sand and rocks differently? Test and record your findings.\"*\n\n2. **Real-World Research:**\n   *\"Look up information about a famous beach erosion problem (e.g., Miami Beach, Cape Cod). Why is erosion a problem there? Write a paragraph explaining using vocabulary from today.\"*\n\n3. **Engineering Challenge:**\n   *\"Design a beach structure (breakwater, seawall, or jetty) that would stop waves from moving sand. Sketch it, explain how it works using forces, and test it in your container.\"*\n\n4. **Energy Source Investigation:**\n   *\"Where does a wave's energy come from? Research: What causes wind? What causes waves in the first place?\"* (This connects to 5-PS3-1 about energy from the sun.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Beach Erosion Documentary Viewing:**\n   Show a 5-10 minute video about real-world beach erosion or coastal management. Afterward, students write: *\"How was this similar to or different from our experiment? What real forces did the scientists measure?\"*\n\n2. **Create a Beach Profile Over Time:**\n   Set up a container with a sand beach. Mark the original shoreline. Create waves daily (or multiple times in one session) and photograph/draw the beach profile. Display as a time-lapse sequence showing how erosion happens gradually. Discuss: *\"What would happen after a whole year of waves?\"*\n\n3. **Forces All Around Us Project:**\n   Students identify three other places where forces push or pull objects in their daily lives (playground, home, sports). They draw or photograph each example and label the direction of the force. Share in a class gallery walk.\n\n4. **Gravity and Water Exploration:**\n   Set up a \"water droplet\" investigation: Use a dropper to drip water onto different materials (paper, cloth, plastic, sand). Ask: *\"How does gravity pull water? Where does it go? Why?\"* Students predict and test, connecting back to waves and beach scenarios.\n\n5. **Interview a Coastal Community Member:**\n   If possible, arrange for a parent, local geologist, or beach manager to visit (virtually or in-person) and discuss their experiences with waves, erosion, or coastal changes. Students prepare 3-4 questions using lesson vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure containers are placed on tables with waterproof protection underneath. Have paper towels nearby for spills. Supervise water use closely.\n- **Preparation:** Pre-gather and organize all materials into station kits the day before. Test the containers to ensure they don't leak.\n- **Timing:** The Explore phase is hands-on and exciting—students may want to extend it. Consider setting a 20-minute timer to keep on schedule.\n- **Connection to Real World:** Throughout, reference the original photograph. Bring it back often—it's a powerful anchor for understanding the abstract concepts of force and gravity.\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Use the five vocabulary words consistently in all teacher language. Students will internalize them through repeated exposure.\n- **Inclusive Language:** Some students may have beach or ocean experience; invite them to share connections. Others may not—provide context where needed.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson transforms a striking photograph of wave action into a concrete, kinesthetic exploration of physical forces. Fifth graders leave understanding that invisible pushes called forces shape our world—and that gravity is one of the most important forces on Earth.",
