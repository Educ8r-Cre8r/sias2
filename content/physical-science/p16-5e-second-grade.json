  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Crispy Changes—How Heat Transforms Materials\n\n---\n\n## Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Effect of heating on materials:** The fried food pieces show how heat changes the texture, color, and appearance of raw ingredients into a crunchy, golden finished product\n- **Observable properties of materials:** Different raw ingredients (lettuce, vegetables, protein coating) have distinct colors, textures, and firmness that are visible before and after cooking\n- **Reversible vs. irreversible changes:** The structural transformation from raw to fried food demonstrates an irreversible change—the materials cannot be returned to their original state by simply cooling\n- **Properties suited for purpose:** The crispy coating protects the tender interior and creates a desirable texture, demonstrating how material properties serve a specific function\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**Crispy, Crunchy Changes: How Heat Transforms What We Eat**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or three 30-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-PS1-4: Construct an argument with evidence that some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed and some cannot.\n  - 2-PS1-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to describe and classify different kinds of materials by their observable properties.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Observe and describe** the properties (color, texture, firmness) of materials before and after heating.\n2. **Classify changes** as reversible (can be undone) or irreversible (cannot be undone) using evidence from investigations.\n3. **Explain** how heating changed the appearance and texture of food materials using descriptive vocabulary.\n4. **Predict** what will happen when other materials are heated based on patterns they observe.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Hook students' curiosity about how heat changes everyday materials using the photograph of cooked food.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital photograph of the crispy fried food salad (displayed large enough for all students to see)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Small ziplock bag of dry lettuce and cooked crispy pieces (actual samples if available and school policy allows)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it. Ask students to sit in a circle facing the image.\n\n2. **Ask these specific questions** (pause for 5-10 seconds after each to allow thinking time):\n   - \"What do you see that is crunchy and golden-brown?\"\n   - \"Do you think this food looked like this *before* someone cooked it? What do you think it looked like?\"\n   - \"What changed? What's different about the brown, crispy pieces compared to how lettuce and vegetables usually look?\"\n   - \"How do you think someone made it change this way?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations** on chart paper (these become data for later phases). Write exactly what they say.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder if we can make things crispy and crunchy by heating them? And I wonder—if we cool it down again, will it go back to how it was before?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be scientists and investigate how heat changes materials. We'll discover what changes stick around forever and what changes can be undone.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how heating changes the observable properties of materials through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- 2 small pieces of white paper (approximately 3\" × 3\")\n- 1 piece of uncooked pasta (penne or similar tube shape)\n- 1 wet paper towel\n- Heat source: **Teacher-controlled candle, heat lamp, or hot plate** (students observe, do NOT handle heat directly)\n- Safety goggles (1 per student)\n- Clipboard and pencil\n- **Observation sheet** (see directions below)\n\n**Safety Note:** Students do NOT touch heat sources. The teacher demonstrates the heating process, and students observe closely and record changes.\n\n**Activity—Student Directions (Read aloud and demonstrate):**\n\n1. \"Put on your safety goggles. We are being careful scientists today.\"\n\n2. \"Look at your piece of uncooked pasta. Draw it on your observation sheet in the 'BEFORE' box. Write or say words that describe it: Is it hard? Soft? What color? What does it feel like?\"\n\n3. \"Now, hold your paper towel. Keep it wet.\"\n\n4. \"Watch carefully while I hold the pasta near the heat [TEACHER does this—do NOT let students do it]. What do you see happening?\"\n\n5. \"Students, I'm going to heat the pasta slowly. Tell me: Does the color change? Does it look different? Is the shape changing?\"\n\n6. **Teacher heats pasta until it softens and browns slightly** (20-30 seconds). Hold it up for all students to see. Ask: \"What changed?\"\n\n7. \"Now, I'm going to cool it with this wet paper towel. Watch what happens.\" **Cool it.**\n\n8. \"Can we make it go back to how it was? Is it hard again or still soft?\" (Expected: It will be softer/changed permanently.)\n\n9. \"Draw the pasta AFTER heating in the 'AFTER' box on your sheet. Describe it: Did the color change? Is it still hard?\"\n\n10. **Repeat with paper:** \"Now, let's try heating plain white paper the same way. Predict: Do you think the same thing will happen?\" Heat edge of paper briefly to show browning/charring. Cool it. \"Can we undo this change? Can we make it white again?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Control all heat sources\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice? What changed? Can we fix it?\"\n- Do NOT tell students if changes are reversible—let them observe and wonder\n- Circulate and listen to student language; record interesting predictions\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that heating causes color changes (browning/darkening)\n- Students notice texture changes (pasta becomes softer, paper becomes brittle)\n- Students discover that once cooled, pasta and paper do NOT return to original state\n- Students draw/record observations on worksheet\n- Students use words like: \"darker,\" \"softer,\" \"broke,\" \"changed,\" \"hard,\" \"crunchy\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student observations to the photograph and key concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Pictures of before/after food examples (optional: printed images of raw vs. cooked foods)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations:** \"Let's talk about what we discovered. Who wants to tell us what happened to the pasta when we heated it?\" (Call on 2-3 students.) Write their exact words on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** (write each word, draw a simple picture, and use in a sentence):\n\n   - **Heat:** Energy that makes things warmer. *Example: \"The flame from the candle gave heat to the pasta.\"*\n   \n   - **Property:** Something you can observe about a material, like color, texture, or shape. *Example: \"The pasta's properties changed from white and hard to brown and soft.\"*\n   \n   - **Irreversible change:** A change that cannot be undone. Once it happens, you cannot make it go back. *Example: \"When we heated the pasta, it became soft. Even after we cooled it, it stayed soft. That is an irreversible change.\"*\n   \n   - **Reversible change:** A change that can be undone. You can make it go back to how it was. *Example: \"If you heat ice cream, it melts. But if you put it in the freezer, it freezes again. That is a reversible change.\"*\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Look at our picture of the crispy, golden food. What do you think happened to it?\"\n   - \"The raw vegetables and protein were lighter in color and had different textures. Then heat made them brown and crunchy. Is this an irreversible change? Why?\"\n   - \"Could we cool it down and make it go back to being raw? Why or why not?\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:** Ask individual students:\n   - \"Can you point to something in this picture that was changed by heat?\"\n   - \"Is this change reversible or irreversible? How do you know?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Heat** | Energy that makes things warm. It can change how things look and feel. |\n| **Property** | Something you can see or feel about a material, like its color, shape, or texture (bumpy or smooth). |\n| **Irreversible Change** | A change that cannot be undone. You cannot make it go back to how it was before. |\n| **Reversible Change** | A change that CAN be undone. You can make it go back to how it was. |\n| **Texture** | How something feels when you touch it (rough, smooth, bumpy, soft, hard, crunchy). |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the terms \"heat,\" \"property,\" and \"irreversible change\" in sentences\n- Students identify the change in the photograph as caused by heating\n- Students explain that cooling the food will NOT undo the change\n- Students understand that heating changes observable properties permanently in this case\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply heating/cooling concepts to a new real-world scenario and deepen understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper titled \"Reversible or Irreversible?\"\n- Pictures or actual items: ice cube, chocolate, butter, aluminum foil, egg, clay\n- Individual dry-erase boards and markers (or paper)\n- Optional: real ice cubes, warm water bowl, butter squares (for demonstration)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario setup:** \"Scientists, I have a question for you. Some changes from heat CAN be undone. Some changes CANNOT be undone. Let's investigate which ones.\"\n\n2. **Teacher demonstrates (or shows pictures of):**\n   - Ice cube melting in warm water → cooling the water → ice refreezes (reversible)\n   - Butter melting → cooling → butter hardens (reversible)\n   - Egg cooking → cooling → egg stays cooked (irreversible)\n\n3. **Student task—\"Sort the Changes\":**\n   - Show 4-5 different materials/scenarios one at a time\n   - Students hold up \"reversible\" or \"irreversible\" signs (or mark on dry-erase board)\n   - Students must explain their choice using evidence: \"I think this is _____ because...\"\n\n4. **Real-world connection:** \"Where do we see reversible and irreversible changes in our lives?\"\n   - Examples: melting chocolate to dip strawberries (reversible), toasting bread (irreversible), freezing juice (reversible), baking a cake (irreversible)\n\n5. **Chart student thinking:** Record on chart paper: \"Changes that CAN be undone\" and \"Changes that CANNOT be undone\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask: \"How do you know?\" and \"What evidence shows that?\"\n- Correct misconceptions gently: \"Let's test that idea. What do you predict will happen if...?\"\n- Encourage students to use vocabulary: \"Say that again using the word 'irreversible.'\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students classify 4-5 new scenarios as reversible or irreversible with reasoning\n- Students use evidence from observations (color, texture, shape)\n- Students explain the difference between reversible and irreversible in their own words\n- Students see that heating has many real-world applications\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess students' understanding of how heat changes material properties and whether changes are reversible or irreversible.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- Observe students' responses during Engage and Explain phases\n- Listen to language used in Explore: Do they describe properties? Do they use \"change\"?\n- Review observation sheets: Can students draw and label before/after states?\n- Monitor small-group discussions in Elaborate: Are they using vocabulary correctly?\n\n**Exit Ticket (end of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be oral for non-readers; teacher scribes). Ask:\n\n1. **\"I heated a piece of white paper and it turned brown and crinkly. Is this change reversible or irreversible? How do you know?\"**\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student says \"irreversible\" and gives one reason (e.g., \"Because it can't turn white again\" or \"Because it's broken and burned\")\n\n2. **\"Look at this picture of a cookie. The cookie dough was soft and light. After baking, it's brown and crunchy. Did heat change it? What properties changed?\"**\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student identifies: color changed (light to brown), texture changed (soft to crunchy), and heat caused it\n\n3. **\"Can we cool down this cookie and make it go back to dough? Why or why not?\"**\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student says no/cannot, and gives evidence (e.g., \"It's baked,\" \"It's burned,\" \"It can't go back\")\n\n**Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide a **Picture-Sorting Task:**\n- Show 4-6 images of foods/materials (raw egg, cooked egg, ice, melted ice, toast, bread, candle flame next to white paper)\n- Student sorts into two piles: \"This was changed by heat and CAN go back\" vs. \"This was changed by heat and CANNOT go back\"\n- Student explains one choice to teacher or peer\n\n**Success Criteria for Lesson Mastery:**\n✓ Student correctly identifies when heat caused a change\n✓ Student correctly classifies at least 3 examples as reversible or irreversible\n✓ Student uses the word \"heat,\" \"change,\" or \"irreversible\" in an explanation\n✓ Student provides evidence from observation (color, texture, shape) to support claim\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly classify 2-3 scenarios\n- Students will use at least one new vocabulary term in context\n- Students will provide observable evidence for their reasoning\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for students who struggle with concepts):\n\n1. **Concrete sentence frames:** Provide oral or written sentence starters:\n   - \"I see that the _____ changed from _____ to _____.\"\n   - \"This is irreversible because it _____ and cannot _____.\"\n   - \"Heat makes things _____.\"\n   - Laminate these and keep at student desks during Explain and Elaborate\n\n2. **Focus on ONE concept at a time:** Some students may grasp \"heat causes changes\" but not yet understand \"reversible vs. irreversible.\" In Evaluate, ask only about irreversible changes first; reversible changes can be a follow-up lesson.\n\n3. **Hands-on demonstrations vs. pictures:** Ensure students who are visual or kinesthetic get to observe real heating (at safe distance) rather than only seeing pictures. Seat them near the teacher demonstration.\n\n4. **Simplified observation sheet:** Use 2-box before/after with pictures only (no writing required). Students point to or draw changes.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Predict and test:** After the pasta/paper demo, ask: \"What other materials do you think will have irreversible changes from heat? Let's test your predictions together.\" (e.g., tissue paper, a plastic cup at low heat, wax crayon shavings)\n\n2. **Reverse engineering:** Show students a cooked egg and ask, \"Is there ANY way to make this white and raw again?\" Let them brainstorm crazy ideas (freezer, magic, etc.). Then discuss the science reason why it's impossible. Introduce concept of chemical change (age-appropriate: \"Some changes happen inside the material that we can't see, and heat is part of it\").\n\n3. **Real-world investigation:** Ask advanced students to investigate: \"What foods in the school cafeteria or your kitchen have irreversible changes from heat?\" They can create a list, draw, or photograph examples to share with the class.\n\n4. **Comparative investigation:** \"Which material changed the MOST from heating—pasta, paper, or something else? How could we measure the change?\" (Introduce color-matching cards, measurement of texture change, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Reversible and Irreversible Changes Around Us\" Walk:** \n   - Take students on a classroom/school walk to find examples: the freezer (reversible changes), the cafeteria oven (irreversible), a sunny windowsill (reversible melting), etc.\n   - Create a large poster: \"In Our School, Heat Changes Things\" with pictures/drawings in two columns.\n   - Connects to: real-world science, community awareness, vocabulary reinforcement\n\n2. **Experiment: Can We Reverse It? Homework/Family Investigation:**\n   - Send home a simple investigation sheet: \"Heat a piece of butter in a bowl. Observe what happens. Then put it in the freezer. Does it go back to a solid?\" \n   - Students draw before, heating, cooling stages and bring back to class\n   - Share findings in a class meeting\n   - Connects to: home/family engagement, reversible vs. irreversible reinforcement, observation skills\n\n3. **\"Materials Detective\" Centers:**\n   - Set up 3-4 classroom centers with different materials (foam, fabric, plastic, foil, wax paper)\n   - Students predict what would happen if heated and sort into \"reversible\" and \"irreversible\" piles\n   - Optional: teacher heats one example at each center (safely) to confirm or challenge predictions\n   - Connects to: properties of materials, testing predictions, independent investigation\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety first:** Never let students handle heat sources. Model controlled, safe heating practices throughout.\n- **Timing:** If your students are quick finishers, the Elaborate phase can extend into a second day.\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Use \"heat,\" \"irreversible,\" and \"properties\" consistently throughout all 5 phases. Students need 10+ exposures to new vocabulary for retention.\n- **Photo connection:** Return to the original photograph frequently. It's your concrete anchor for all abstract concepts.\n- **Cultural note:** Food is universal. Students from all backgrounds have experience with cooked food. Use this common ground to build confidence and engagement.",
