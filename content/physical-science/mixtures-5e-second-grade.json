ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of baking ingredients and a mixer.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of baking ingredients and mixer (displayed on whiteboard or printed for student groups)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording student observations\n- Markers (multiple colors)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or distribute printed copies of the image showing the dry ingredients (flour, cinnamon), wet ingredients (what appears to be oil or liquid in the mixer bowl), kitchen tools, and a stand mixer. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Facilitate Discussion with Guided Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What materials are here?\" (Let students name sugar, flour, red mixture, mixer, bowl, whisk, etc.)\n   - \"What do you think these materials are used for?\" (Accept answers: cooking, baking, making a cake, making cookies.)\n   - \"Some of these materials look dry and powdery. Some look wet and red. What do you think will happen if we mix them together?\"\n   - \"Have you ever helped make cookies or a cake at home? What did you notice when all the ingredients got mixed together?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what happens to these materials when they get mixed together. Do they still look the same? Can we separate them back apart? Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Record Predictions:** Create a simple two-column chart on the board labeled \"Before Mixing\" and \"After Mixing.\" Write down 2-3 student predictions about what will happen.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be materials scientists. We'll mix different ingredients just like in this picture and watch what happens. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate mixing materials through hands-on activity and discover observable changes.\n\n**Materials (per student pair or small group):**\n- 1 white bowl or clear plastic cup\n- 1 small spoon or stirrer\n- 1 tablespoon of flour (in small container labeled \"Flour\")\n- 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder (in small container labeled \"Cocoa\") OR cinnamon (to match the photograph)\n- 1 tablespoon of sugar (in small container labeled \"Sugar\")\n- 1 tablespoon of water in a small cup (labeled \"Water\")\n- 1 observation sheet (template provided below) or paper for drawing\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Optional: droppers or small spoons to add liquids carefully\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Look at each material separately. You have flour, cocoa (or cinnamon), sugar, and water. Draw or describe what each one looks like before you mix anything. Write down the color, and use words like 'powdery,' 'grainy,' or 'wet' to describe what you see.\"\n\n2. \"Predict: What do you think will happen when you mix the dry materials (flour, cocoa, sugar) together? Write or draw your prediction.\"\n\n3. \"Prediction Test #1: Pour the flour into your bowl. Now add the cocoa and sugar. Stir them together gently. Look at what happened. Does it still look like three separate materials, or did it become something new? Record what you observe with words or a drawing.\"\n\n4. \"Look at the mixture carefully. Can you still see the separate colors, or are they all mixed together now? Can you separate them again?\" (Try to separate with a spoon—students will discover it's difficult or impossible.)\n\n5. \"Prediction Test #2: Now add just a few drops of water to your dry mixture and stir. What happens now? Does it look different? Does it feel different? Record your observations.\"\n\n6. \"Important Question: Do you think we can turn this wet mixture back into the dry powder we started with? Why or why not?\" (Accept all reasoning; don't give the answer yet.)\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** \"Look back at the picture. The dry materials are like the flour and sugar we see in the bowl. The red mixture in the mixer bowl is like what happens when we add water and stir. The mixer is doing what you just did with your spoon!\"\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Drawings or descriptions of each material before mixing\n- Observations of what happens when dry materials mix\n- Observations of what happens when water is added\n- Predictions about whether the mixture can be separated again\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking open-ended questions: \"What changed? How did it feel before and after? Could you separate it?\"\n- Do not tell students the \"right\" answer about reversibility—let them explore and wonder.\n- Help students with vocabulary by repeating their observations using scientific words: \"I see you noticed the colors mixed together. That's a mixture!\"\n- Manage cleanup as groups finish; have paper towels ready.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that dry materials can be mixed together and are difficult to separate.\n- Students observe that adding water creates a visible change and makes separation even harder.\n- Students begin to notice that some changes feel permanent.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to scientific concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Optional: small bowl with flour, sugar, cocoa, and water for teacher demonstration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 student pairs to share what they observed: \"What did you notice when you mixed the dry materials? What happened when you added water?\"\n   - Record their observations on chart paper using bullet points.\n   - Affirm correct observations: \"Yes! The colors mixed together and made a new color. That's a mixture!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   \n   Display and define these terms using student-friendly language and examples:\n\n   - **Material:** Something you can see and touch, like flour, water, sugar, or cocoa. \"What materials did you use today?\"\n   - **Properties:** How something looks, feels, or acts. Color, texture (rough, smooth, powdery), and whether something is wet or dry are all properties. \"Flour is white and powdery. Those are its properties.\"\n   - **Mixture:** What you get when you put two or more materials together. \"When you mixed flour and cocoa together, you made a mixture.\"\n   - **Reversible Change:** A change that can be undone or changed back. \"If you spilled sand in water, you can separate the sand from the water again. That's reversible.\"\n   - **Non-Reversible Change (or Permanent Change):** A change that cannot be undone. \"When flour and water mix together, you can't easily turn them back into separate materials. That's a non-reversible change.\"\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the dry ingredients in the bowl: \"These are separate materials with different properties—the flour is light, the cinnamon is brown and spicy-smelling.\"\n   - Point to the red mixture in the mixer: \"When all these materials get mixed together in the mixer, they become a mixture. The mixer helps them combine.\"\n   - \"The photograph shows us a mixture being made, just like you did!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I have two piles of sand, one red sand and one yellow sand, and I mix them together, is that a mixture?\" (Yes!)\n   - \"Can I separate red sand from yellow sand easily after I mix them?\" (Probably not completely, so it's hard to reverse.)\n   - \"What's the difference between the flour-cocoa-sugar mixture and the flour-cocoa-sugar-water mixture?\" (The water made it wet, which makes the change more permanent.)\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Table (write on chart paper):**\n\n| **Word** | **What It Means** | **Example from Today** |\n|----------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Material | Something you can see and touch | Flour, water, sugar |\n| Properties | How something looks or feels | White, powdery, wet |\n| Mixture | Two or more materials mixed together | Flour + cocoa + sugar |\n| Reversible Change | A change you can undo | Separating mixed sand |\n| Non-Reversible Change | A change you cannot undo | Flour + water (hard to separate) |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary to describe what they observed.\n- Students begin to understand that materials can be combined to make mixtures.\n- Students recognize that some changes are easier to reverse than others.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by predicting and testing how different materials mix and comparing reversibility.\n\n**Materials (per group or individual):**\n- 2-3 small bowls or cups\n- Salt (or sugar)\n- Water\n- Oil (if available) or sand (if not)\n- Spoon\n- Paper towels\n- Observation chart (template below)\n- Optional: food coloring to make mixing more visually obvious\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Real-World Application: \"Can We Separate Our Mixtures?\"**\n\n1. **Introduce the Scenario:** \"Imagine a baker is making cookies. They mix flour, sugar, and water together. But then they realize they made a mistake and need to use just the flour. Can they separate the materials? Let's test different materials to see which mixtures can be undone and which cannot.\"\n\n2. **Conduct Comparison Tests:**\n   - **Test 1 – Salt and Water:** Pour salt into a bowl and add water. Stir. Observe. (Salt dissolves completely—seems gone, but it's still there as a mixture.)\n   - **Test 2 – Oil and Water:** Pour a small amount of oil into water and stir. Observe. (Oil and water separate and don't fully mix—students see the oil floats on top, making it easier to see.)\n   - **Test 3 – Sand and Water:** Pour sand into water and stir. Observe. (Sand stays in water as a mixture, but sand particles don't dissolve.)\n\n3. **Record and Compare:**\n   Create a simple chart:\n   \n   | **Materials Mixed** | **What It Looked Like** | **Could You Separate Them?** | **Reversible or Non-Reversible?** |\n   |-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n   | Flour + Cocoa + Sugar | Brown powder | Very hard | Non-reversible |\n   | Salt + Water | Clear liquid (salt disappears) | Very hard | Non-reversible |\n   | Oil + Water | Oil floats on water | Easier to see layers | Somewhat reversible |\n   | Sand + Water | Grainy liquid | Sand sinks | Easier to separate |\n\n4. **Group Discussion:**\n   - \"Which mixture was easiest to separate? Why?\"\n   - \"Which mixture was hardest to separate?\"\n   - \"Why do you think water changes some mixtures more than others?\"\n   - \"If we had baked the flour-sugar-water mixture in an oven, do you think we could ever separate them again?\" (This bridges to baking/heating as a non-reversible change, connecting to standard 2-PS1-4.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate careful, safe mixing (especially with oil or water).\n- Ask guiding questions rather than providing answers: \"What do you notice? Does it look like the materials are still separate or mixed?\"\n- Help students make predictions before testing: \"What do you think will happen when we add oil to water?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that different materials create different types of mixtures.\n- Students begin to understand that some changes are harder to reverse than others.\n- Students apply the concepts of properties and mixtures to new materials and scenarios.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of material properties, mixtures, and reversible vs. non-reversible changes.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** As students explore, note whether they:\n  - Correctly describe properties of individual materials (color, texture, wet/dry)\n  - Recognize when materials combine to form a mixture\n  - Attempt to separate mixtures and reflect on the difficulty\n  - Use vocabulary (mixture, properties, reversible, non-reversible) in context\n\n- **Questioning:** Listen to student responses during Engage and Explain phases. Do they use scientific language? Can they explain *why* a change is reversible or not?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple 3-question exit ticket (can be oral, drawn, or written depending on student ability):\n\n1. **\"Draw or tell me about one mixture you made today. What materials did you mix together?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student identifies at least two materials and describes a mixture they created.\n\n2. **\"When we mixed flour and water together, could we easily turn it back into separate flour and water? Why or why not?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student recognizes the change was hard to reverse (non-reversible) and provides a simple reason (they mixed together, they're stuck together, water went into the flour, etc.).\n\n3. **\"If you spilled salt into your water bottle by mistake, do you think you could separate the salt from the water? Why?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student predicts whether separation is possible and uses reasoning about mixture properties or previous observations (e.g., \"No, because salt dissolves like when we mixed salt and water today\").\n\n**Scoring Guide:**\n\n- **Advanced (Meets & Exceeds):** Student clearly identifies materials in a mixture, uses vocabulary correctly, and explains reversibility with logical reasoning.\n- **Proficient (Meets):** Student describes a mixture with 2+ materials and attempts to explain reversibility.\n- **Developing (Approaches):** Student describes a mixture but may struggle with the reversibility concept; with support, makes reasonable predictions.\n- **Beginning (Below):** Student needs significant support to identify mixtures or properties; provide more exploration time and direct vocabulary instruction.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Students articulate that materials have observable properties that can be described.\n- Students identify when two or more materials form a mixture.\n- Students recognize and begin to explain why some mixtures are easier or harder to separate (reversibility).\n- Students use newly introduced vocabulary in context and in their explanations.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**SUPPORT (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only the core terms—material, mixture, change—in early lessons. Introduce reversible/non-reversible later with explicit, repeated examples. Provide a laminated reference card with pictures and simple definitions students can use during activities.\n\n2. **Reduced Number of Materials:** Instead of testing five different materials, limit Elaborate phase to just two comparative tests (e.g., salt water vs. sand water). Provide a partially filled observation chart where students only need to check boxes or circle words rather than write descriptions.\n\n3. **Partner Support:** Pair struggling students with confident peers during Explore and Elaborate phases. Assign the struggling student a specific job (e.g., being the \"observer\" who describes what they see while the partner records).\n\n4. **Teacher-Led Small Group:** Before or after the whole-group Explain phase, work with a small group to re-demonstrate mixing and use highly concrete language: \"Watch. I have flour. It is white and powdery. Now I add cocoa. It is brown. Together they make a brown mixture. Can we separate them? It's hard!\" Repeat with exaggerated gestures.\n\n**CHALLENGE (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate Dissolving vs. Mixing:** Challenge advanced students to test whether certain materials truly disappear in water or just become invisible. Provide salt water and ask: \"Can you prove the salt is still there even though you can't see it?\" (Evaporation investigation: leave salt water in the sun and observe salt crystals forming days later—connects to heating and change.)\n\n2. **Design a Separation Method:** Give advanced students a mixed powder (flour + cocoa + sugar) and ask them to design a way to separate the materials. Provide tools like sieves, strainers, magnets, water, etc. Have them predict, test, and evaluate whether their method works. Connect to standard 2-PS1-2 (which materials are best suited for a purpose).\n\n3. **Predict Baking Outcomes:** Extend the learning by showing students a recipe for cookies and asking: \"What do you think happens when we bake this mixture in the oven? Will the changes be reversible?\" Discuss how heat creates a permanent change (dough → baked cookie), deepening understanding of standard 2-PS1-4.\n\n4. **Compare Three States of Materials:** Challenge students to observe the same material (chocolate, butter, etc.) in different states: solid, melted, and cooled. Record observations and determine whether these changes are reversible and when heating/cooling causes changes that can or cannot be undone.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Home Exploration: Mixing Kitchen Materials**\n   Send home a simple worksheet asking families to find and mix safe kitchen materials (salt + flour, oil + water, sugar + water) and report back what happened. Students draw or write one sentence about whether they could separate the mixture and why. This extends the lesson and connects science learning to home/family involvement.\n\n2. **Cooking Class Connection: Following a Recipe**\n   In partnership with the school cafeteria or using a simple no-bake recipe in class (trail mix, no-bake cookies, fruit smoothie), demonstrate how recipes are instructions for creating specific mixtures. Have students identify the materials (ingredients) and properties before and after mixing. Discuss reversibility: \"Once we eat the trail mix, can we separate the nuts, raisins, and chocolate back? Why not?\" (Connects eating/digestion to non-reversible changes in a relatable way.)\n\n3. **Observation Journal: \"Mixture Detectives\"**\n   Over one week, ask students to notice and sketch mixtures they encounter outside of science class (paint, mud, trail mix, salad, smoothie, sand and pebbles at recess, etc.). Create a classroom poster titled \"Mixtures Around Us\" where students contribute drawings and labels. Return to the 5E vocabulary: \"Is this a mixture? What materials are in it? Can we separate it?\" This builds science observation habits and shows students that mixtures are everywhere.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
