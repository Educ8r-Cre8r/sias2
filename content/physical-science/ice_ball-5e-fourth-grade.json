Students can observe how water changes form when energy is removed through cooling.\n- **Energy Transfer Through Heat:** The ice ball demonstrates that thermal energy moves from warmer surroundings to the colder ice, causing it to melt. This visible change reveals heat energy in action.\n- **Properties of Materials:** The ice ball's transparency, hardness, and smooth surface are observable properties that differ from liquid water, helping students understand how the same material has different characteristics in different states.\n- **Observable Evidence of Energy:** The frost patterns and crystalline structure visible on the ice provide concrete evidence that energy changes create visible, measurable differences in matter.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**The Frozen Mystery: Tracking Heat Energy with Ice**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fourth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90 minutes (two 45-minute sessions, or one extended block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 4-PS3-2: Make observations to provide evidence that energy can be transferred from place to place by sound, light, heat, and electric currents.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Observe and describe the physical properties of ice and how they change over time as heat energy is added.\n2. Provide evidence that heat is a form of energy that can move from warm objects to cold objects.\n3. Predict and explain how different materials and environments affect how quickly ice melts.\n4. Use observations to explain that energy transfer causes changes in matter.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about heat, cold, and ice.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of ice ball (one per student or group, or projected image)\n- The actual ice ball from the photograph (if available), or a freshly made ice ball\n- Blue plastic tray (as shown in photo)\n- Paper towels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image on the board or pass around printed copies. Place an ice ball in a tray on a table at the front of the room if one is available.\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Questions:**\n   - \"Look at this ice ball. What do you notice about its surface? What does all that frosty, bumpy texture tell you?\"\n   - \"Where did this ice ball come from? What was it before it was ice?\"\n   - \"If we left this ice ball sitting here in our warm classroom for an hour, what would happen to it? Why do you think that would happen?\"\n   - \"How is heat energy involved in what you think will happen?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:**\n   - \"Right now, I want you to think like a scientist. Raise your hand if you think: *Does heat energy move into the ice ball, or does the ice ball's coldness move into the air?* Let's find out together today!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to be energy detectives. We're going to watch what happens to ice and figure out how heat energy moves around us.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate heat energy transfer through direct observation and measurement of melting ice under different conditions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-made ice balls (1 per student pair; recipe: fill small balloons with water, freeze 24–48 hours, remove balloon)\n  - *Prepare these ahead of time*\n- Blue plastic trays or shallow containers (1 per pair)\n- Thermometers (1 per pair, any type that reads 0–100°F)\n- Stopwatches or classroom timer\n- Measuring tape or ruler\n- Paper towels\n- White paper\n- Pencils and data recording sheets\n- **Three different environments:** \n  - Station A: Ice ball at room temperature (classroom)\n  - Station B: Ice ball in warm water (not boiling; ~110–120°F)\n  - Station C: Ice ball in front of a lamp or sunny window (heat source)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set Up Stations:** Before class, arrange three stations with different heat conditions. Label them clearly.\n\n2. **Divide into Pairs:** Assign pairs to one station, or rotate pairs through all three stations (10 minutes per station).\n\n3. **Student Directions (provide on a worksheet or card):**\n   - Place your ice ball in the tray at your station.\n   - Use the thermometer to measure the temperature around (not touching) the ice.\n   - **Every 2 minutes for 10 minutes**, record:\n     - The temperature in the air around the ice\n     - How much the ice ball has melted (measure the water in the tray with a ruler or describe the change: *a little, some, lots*)\n     - Any changes you see in the ice ball's surface (is it shiny? Frosty? Smooth?)\n   - Draw a picture of your ice ball at the start and at the end.\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate between stations without revealing answers.\n   - Ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice happening? What's changing? Where is the water coming from? Is the ice getting warmer or colder?\"*\n   - Ensure thermometers are being used correctly.\n   - Collect data sheets and drawings.\n\n5. **Documentation:** Students record data on a simple table and draw observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that ice melts faster in warm/heat environments.\n- Students measure temperature changes and water accumulation.\n- Students notice visible changes (frost disappearing, surface becoming smoother) as ice melts.\n- Students document that the process is faster near heat sources.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and solidify understanding of heat energy transfer.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Data sheets and drawings from Explore phase\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Thermometer (to show during discussion)\n- Printed vocabulary cards with definitions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - Call on 2–3 pairs to share what they observed at their stations.\n   - Display their data sheets side-by-side on the board.\n   - Ask: *\"Which station had the ice melt fastest? Why? What made the difference?\"*\n   - Record observations on chart paper: *\"Warm places → ice melts faster. Cold places → ice melts slower.\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary:**\n   - **Heat Energy:** The energy that makes things hot or warm. Heat always moves from hotter objects to colder objects.\n   - **Thermal Energy:** The total energy in all the tiny moving parts of something. When something is warmer, its parts move faster.\n   - **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is. We measure it with a thermometer in degrees (°F or °C).\n   - **Melting:** When a solid (like ice) turns into a liquid (like water) because heat energy is added to it.\n   - **Energy Transfer:** Heat moving from one place to another—in this case, from the warm air (or warm water, or lamp) into the cold ice.\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph:**\n   - Display the original ice ball photo again.\n   - \"In this picture, the ice ball is sitting in a warm classroom. Even though we can't see heat energy, it's moving from the warm air into the cold ice. That's why the ice is melting. The heat energy causes the ice to change from a solid into liquid water.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Quick show-of-hands: *\"Raise your hand if you can explain to a partner: Does heat move INTO the ice or does cold move OUT? Why?\"*\n   - Ask 3–4 students to explain in their own words.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| Heat Energy | The energy that makes things warm. It moves from hot things to cold things. |\n| Thermal Energy | All the tiny moving parts inside something that make it hot or cold. |\n| Temperature | How hot or cold something is. We measure it with a thermometer. |\n| Melting | When ice or another solid turns into a liquid because it gets warmer. |\n| Energy Transfer | Heat moving from one place to another. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and define heat energy, melting, and energy transfer.\n- Students explain that heat energy moved into the ice from the warmer environment.\n- Students connect their observations to the concept of energy transfer.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply heat energy concepts to a new scenario and predict outcomes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Three small ice cubes or ice balls (prepared ahead)\n- Three containers: one with room-temperature water, one with warm water (~120°F), one with ice water\n- Thermometers\n- Stopwatches\n- Paper cups or clear containers\n- Prediction worksheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Prediction Challenge:**\n   - Show students three containers with different water temperatures.\n   - Explain: *\"We're going to put an ice cube in each. Your job is to predict which will melt the fastest and explain why using what you learned about heat energy.\"*\n\n2. **Individual Prediction Worksheet (3–5 minutes):**\n   - Draw the three containers.\n   - Circle which ice cube you think will melt fastest.\n   - Write or draw: *\"Heat energy will move _____ into the ice because _____.\"*\n   - **Challenge question:** *\"What if we put an ice cube in the freezer? Would heat energy still move into it? Why or why not?\"*\n\n3. **Live Demonstration (5–7 minutes):**\n   - Place an ice cube in each container.\n   - Set timer for 5 minutes.\n   - Students observe and call out changes: *\"Ice in the warm water is melting faster!\"*\n   - After 5 minutes, compare remaining ice sizes.\n\n4. **Discuss Results:**\n   - Ask: *\"Did your prediction match what happened? Why or why not?\"*\n   - Reinforce: *\"Heat energy from the warmer water moved into the ice faster, so it melted quicker.\"*\n\n5. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - *\"Think about a frozen popsicle on a hot summer day. Heat energy from the air and sun moves into the popsicle. That's why it melts so fast! Or think about ice on a pond in winter—the cold air doesn't melt it, but the sun's heat energy does.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate predictions without judgment.\n- Guide students to explain *why* their prediction was right or wrong using heat energy language.\n- Celebrate thinking, even if predictions were incorrect.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students make evidence-based predictions about heat energy transfer.\n- Students explain that warmer environments transfer heat energy faster.\n- Students apply the concept to familiar real-world situations.\n- Students use vocabulary (heat energy, energy transfer, melting) in explanations.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of heat energy transfer and state changes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe student participation and explanation quality during Engage and Explore phases.\n- Review data sheets for accuracy of observations and temperature recordings.\n- Listen to student language during group share-outs in Explain phase.\n- Check prediction worksheet reasoning in Elaborate phase.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nAdminister at the end of the lesson (5 minutes). Students answer on a half-sheet of paper or digital form:\n\n1. **Draw and Explain:**\n   - *\"Draw an ice ball and the warm air around it. Use an arrow to show where heat energy is moving. Explain in 2–3 sentences.\"*\n   - **Success Criteria:** Arrow shows heat moving INTO the ice. Explanation mentions heat energy and/or melting.\n\n2. **Multiple Choice:**\n   - *\"Why does ice melt faster in warm water than in cold water?\"*\n     - A) The warm water is heavier.\n     - B) More heat energy moves into the ice from warm water.\n     - C) The ice cube gets older in warm water.\n     - D) Cold water has more energy.\n   - **Expected Answer:** B (Correct reasoning shows understanding of energy transfer)\n\n3. **Open-Ended Response:**\n   - *\"Explain: If you wanted to keep an ice ball frozen as long as possible, where would you put it? Use the word 'heat energy' in your answer.\"*\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student identifies a cold location (freezer, ice chest, shade, cold water) and explains that less heat energy reaches it there.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Students identify heat energy as the cause of melting.\n- ✓ Students explain that heat energy moves from warmer to colder objects.\n- ✓ Students use observation data to support conclusions.\n- ✓ Students apply concepts to new scenarios (predictions, real-world examples).\n- ✓ Students use lesson vocabulary accurately (heat energy, thermal energy, melting, energy transfer).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 70–80% of students correctly identify heat energy transfer as the reason for melting.\n- Students can draw and label heat energy movement.\n- Students apply concepts to predict outcomes in new situations.\n- Students articulate understanding using vocabulary from the lesson.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Data Sheet:** Provide a picture-based recording form where students simply circle *\"melted a little / some / a lot\"* instead of writing measurements. Include drawn thermometers they can color to show approximate temperature.\n\n2. **Partner Pairing:** Pair students with stronger peers during Explore. Assign roles: one measures temperature, one records time, one draws observations. Rotate roles to build confidence.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a large, colorful chart with heat energy, melting, and temperature with picture symbols. Leave it posted throughout the lesson. Allow students to point to words rather than recall them.\n\n4. **Guided Questioning:** Ask yes/no or either/or questions: *\"Is heat energy moving INTO the ice or OUT of the ice?\"* before open-ended prompts.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Insulation Investigation:** Provide ice balls wrapped in different materials (aluminum foil, cotton, plastic, newspaper). Ask: *\"Which material stops heat energy from reaching the ice the best? Test and explain.\"* Connects to insulation concepts.\n\n2. **Temperature Graphing:** Have advanced students graph their temperature data on a line graph to show the relationship between time and temperature. Discuss: *\"What does the slope of the line tell us about heat energy transfer?\"*\n\n3. **Energy Transfer Comparison:** Ask: *\"Heat energy can move through air, water, and solids. In our experiment, which medium transferred heat energy fastest—air at room temperature, warm water, or light from a lamp? Why?\"* Introduces conduction, convection, and radiation without those terms.\n\n4. **Real-World Problem Solving:** Present a scenario: *\"A polar ice cap is melting because Earth is getting warmer. Use what you know about heat energy transfer to explain why this is happening and what might happen next.\"* Connects to climate awareness developmentally.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Freezing vs. Melting:** Reverse the process. Have students freeze saltwater, sugar water, and plain water in ice-cube trays. Compare melting rates. Discuss: *\"Does the type of liquid change how heat energy transfers?\"* (Introduces solution properties and thermal properties of materials.)\n\n2. **Build an Insulator Challenge:** Provide foam, cotton, plastic wrap, aluminum foil, and cardboard. Challenge students to design and test a container that keeps ice frozen the longest. Have them predict, test for 30 minutes, and measure remaining ice. Discuss: *\"How did your design stop heat energy from reaching the ice?\"* (Applies energy transfer concepts to engineering/design.)\n\n3. **Seasonal Ice Exploration:** Display photographs of icebergs melting, ice skating rinks, frozen lakes thawing in spring, and glaciers. Discuss: *\"In each picture, what heat source is melting the ice? Where is the heat energy coming from?\"* (Connects to Earth science: seasons, water cycle, and heat energy from the sun.)\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- Prepare ice balls 2–3 days ahead by freezing water in small balloons in a standard freezer.\n- Ensure warm water (Station B) is heated to ~110–120°F for student safety; test before class.\n- This lesson strongly supports 4-PS3-2 by providing concrete, observable evidence that heat energy transfers and causes visible changes in matter.\n- Consider photographing student setups before and after to create a visual evidence display for the classroom.",
