ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the rainbow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the rainbow (or displayed digitally)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student observation journals or notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it on the screen. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe what you notice.\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this in the sky? When? What was happening outside?\"\n   - \"Do you see different colors? Can you name the colors you see in order from top to bottom (or outside to inside)?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the colors appeared in the sky? What made them happen?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what we would need to make colors like this appear. What materials or things from nature might help us create colors?\" Record student wonderings on chart paper.\n\n4. **Prediction activity:** \"Do you think we can make something like a rainbow right here in our classroom? What would we need?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become rainbow detectives! We'll investigate how light and water work together to make colors appear, just like in this photograph. Let's find out!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how light interacts with water to create color separation through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear cups or clear containers (one per pair of students)\n- Water\n- White paper or white paper plates\n- Flashlights or small desk lamps (one per pair)\n- Optional: clear plastic wrap, clear glass prisms, or CD discs\n- Hand mirrors (optional, for directing light)\n- Newspaper or paper towels (for spills)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Work with a partner. Place your white paper on the table in front of you.\"\n\n2. \"Fill your clear cup with water and place it on top of the white paper.\"\n\n3. \"Turn on your flashlight and shine it directly onto the water in your cup from above. Move the light around slowly. What do you see on the paper? Draw or describe what happens in your observation journal.\"\n\n4. \"Now try shining the light from the side of the cup, through the water. Does anything different happen? Record what you observe.\"\n\n5. \"If you have a mirror, try using it to bounce the flashlight beam through the water. What colors or patterns do you see?\"\n\n6. \"Try tilting your cup slightly. Does this change what you see? Why do you think that might be?\"\n\n7. \"Compare your observations with another pair of students. Did everyone see the same things?\"\n\n**Connection to photograph:** \"The water droplets in the rain created a natural prism, just like your cup of water did. The sunlight went through the water and separated into colors, making the rainbow you saw in the photograph.\"\n\n**What students should record or document:**\n- Drawings or descriptions of colors they observe\n- Which position of the light (top, side, tilted) created the best color separation\n- Observations about what materials were necessary (water, light, white surface)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between pairs, asking guiding questions: \"What colors do you see?\" \"Why do you think the light changed?\" \"What would happen if we used a different container?\"\n- Do not tell students they are creating a spectrum or prism—let them discover through exploration.\n- Help redirect light if students struggle, but allow them to experiment with positioning.\n- Encourage peer discussion: \"Tell your partner what you notice.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that light passing through water can separate into different colors.\n- Students discover that the position and angle of light affect what they see.\n- Students recognize that water is a material that can change how light appears.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and reinforce concepts discovered during exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with color names written and illustrated\n- The photograph from Engage phase\n- Student exploration journals\n- Optional: color-order poster (ROYGBIV: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share what they observed: \"What colors did you see? What made the colors appear?\"\n   - Record student observations on chart paper.\n   - Affirm accurate observations: \"Yes, you saw the light separate into different colors!\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph again and reference their exploration observations.\n   - \"The colors you saw in your cup and the colors in this rainbow are the same. Let's learn the names of these colors in order.\"\n   - Display the colors of the rainbow in sequence and teach the acronym **ROYGBIV** (if appropriate for your class) or simply teach the color order: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.\n\n3. **Connections and concepts (5 minutes):**\n   - \"When sunlight goes through water droplets in the air, something special happens: the light bends and separates into all these colors. We call this light's **property** — a property is something about how a material or object looks or acts.\"\n   - \"The photograph shows rain and sunshine together. That's why the rainbow appeared. In our investigation, we used water and light, and we made colors separate, too!\"\n   - \"Water is a **material** that lets light pass through it. Because light passes through water in a special way, we can see colors we don't usually see in regular sunlight.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to your neighbor and tell them: What do you need to make colors appear from light?\" (Answer: water/clear material and light)\n   - \"Point to the colors of the rainbow in order. Can you name them?\"\n   - Ask individual students to identify a color in the photograph and match it to their observations.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Light** | Energy that lets us see things; it travels and can bounce or bend. |\n| **Color** | A property of light that our eyes can see; light separates into different colors. |\n| **Water** | A clear, liquid material that light can pass through, which can make light separate into colors. |\n| **Material** | Something physical that things are made of; it has properties like being clear, hard, wet, or smooth. |\n| **Rainbow** | The pattern of colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) that appear when light passes through water. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the colors of the rainbow in order.\n- Students understand that light and water work together to make colors appear.\n- Students recognize that water and light are materials/things with properties that affect what we see.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by testing whether other clear materials can also separate light into colors, deepening their grasp of how material properties affect light.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear cups or containers with different materials: water, clear oil, clear soda (clear varieties), clear hand sanitizer, or clear gelatin\n- White paper\n- Flashlights\n- Labels for each cup\n- Observation journals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Challenge question:** \"We found out that water separates light into colors. Do you think other clear materials will do the same thing? Let's test!\"\n\n2. **Student investigation (directed exploration):**\n   - Prepare 3-4 cups with different clear materials. Label each one.\n   - In pairs or small groups, students shine a flashlight through each material and observe which colors appear.\n   - Students record which materials create colors and rank them: \"Best color separation,\" \"Some color separation,\" \"No color separation.\"\n\n3. **Guided analysis:**\n   - \"What do all the materials that made colors have in common?\" (They're all clear; they let light pass through.)\n   - \"Which material worked best? Why do you think that material was better?\"\n   - \"If you wanted to create colors from light, what **property** should a material have?\" (It should be clear so light can pass through.)\n\n4. **Real-world connection:**\n   - \"This is why the rainbow happened in the picture—the rain had millions of tiny water droplets. Each droplet was clear and let light pass through, just like our cups. All together, they made a huge rainbow!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the investigation without revealing results.\n- Use questions to guide thinking: \"Does this material let light pass through? Is it clear like water?\"\n- Help students see patterns: materials that let light through make colors; materials that block light do not.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply the concept to multiple materials and compare properties.\n- Students understand that clear materials with specific properties can separate light into colors.\n- Students can make predictions about which materials will create rainbow effects.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light, color, water, and material properties.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (ongoing):**\n- During Explore: Observe whether students notice color changes and record observations.\n- During Explain: Listen to partner conversations and check ability to name colors in order.\n- During Elaborate: Assess predictions and comparisons of different materials.\n\n**Exit ticket (Summative assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (can be verbal or written with pictures):\n\n1. **Show the original rainbow photograph again.** \"What do you see in this picture? What two things had to be together to make the rainbow?\" \n   - **Success criterion:** Student identifies rain/water and sunshine/light as both necessary.\n\n2. **\"Draw or describe: What would happen if you shined a flashlight through a cup of water?\"**\n   - **Success criterion:** Student indicates colors would appear or light would separate.\n\n3. **\"Which material has the best property for making light separate into colors: a mirror, a piece of paper, or a cup of water? Why?\"**\n   - **Success criterion:** Student selects water and explains it is clear (or lets light pass through).\n\n**Alternative exit ticket (for students who need visual support):**\n- Provide pictures of: water, mirror, paper, clear oil\n- \"Point to the material that can make light separate into colors. Can you tell me why?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they can:\n- Identify that both light and water (or clear materials) are needed for colors to appear.\n- Describe at least one color they observed.\n- Explain or show (through drawing) that light can separate into colors when it passes through water.\n- Compare materials based on whether they let light through or block it.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified investigation:** Provide pre-filled cups with water and a single high-quality flashlight. Guide students step-by-step: \"Shine the light here. What do you see?\" Use sentence starters: \"I see the color ___.\" \"The light ___.\"\n\n2. **Color matching:** Instead of naming all seven colors, have students match colors in the rainbow photograph to colored paper or objects in the classroom. Use a simple three-color rainbow: red, yellow, blue.\n\n3. **Peer partnerships:** Pair with a strong observer who can describe what happens while the struggling learner manipulates the flashlight. Rotate roles.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extension investigation:** \"What happens if you shine the light through two cups of water at different angles? Can you make the colors go in different directions? Can you make two rainbows?\" Have students plan and conduct their own experiment, predicting outcomes first.\n\n2. **Vocabulary exploration:** Introduce the word **prism** (an object that light passes through to separate colors). \"Our cup of water acted like a prism. Can you find other things in the classroom that might act like prisms?\" (Glass, clear plastic, water bottles, glass paperweights.)\n\n3. **Rainbow prediction challenge:** \"Based on what you learned, where else in nature or in our school might we be able to see rainbows? When would we be able to find them?\" Have students write or draw predictions and explain their thinking using the concepts of light and water.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Make a Rainbow at Home:** Send students home with a challenge: \"Find a sunny window, a cup of water, and white paper at home. Can you create a rainbow? Ask a family member to help. Draw what you observe and bring it to school to share.\" (Connects to home and community science; reinforces core concepts.)\n\n2. **Rainbow Hunt Nature Walk:** On a sunny or partially sunny day after rain, take students outside to search for rainbows or places where light might separate into colors (garden hoses with mist, car windows with water droplets, puddles with oil sheens if safe to observe). Document observations with photos or sketches. Discuss: \"Why did we see colors here?\"\n\n3. **Create a Rainbow Color Chart:** Students create a classroom poster showing the rainbow colors in order. They can paint, color, or cut and paste colored paper into a rainbow shape. Label each color. Display near the window or light source as a reference and reminder of the lesson. Add student observations: \"We discovered that water makes light into colors!\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson works best on a day with natural sunlight or in a room with good artificial light.\n- The water cup investigation may not produce dramatic results in very bright classrooms; try darkening the room slightly or using a more concentrated beam of light.\n- The photograph provides an authentic, real-world anchor for all activities, reinforcing that student investigations mirror what happens in nature.\n- Consider visiting this lesson again on days when rainbows actually appear, connecting classroom learning to live observation.",
