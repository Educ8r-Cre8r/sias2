  "content": "# Rainbow Light Refraction Lesson Plan\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Light travels in straight lines** but can be bent (refracted) when it passes through water droplets, creating visible light patterns like rainbows.\n- **Light separation and color** occur when white light from the sun interacts with water droplets in the air, revealing that white light contains multiple colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).\n- **Cause and effect relationships** between weather conditions (rain + sun position) and observable phenomena (rainbow appearance and direction).\n- **Angle and position matter** — rainbows appear only when the sun is behind the observer and water droplets are in front, demonstrating how light direction and angle affect what we see.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Chasing Rainbows: How Light Bends and Bounces**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 3-PS2-2: Make observations and/or measurements of an object's motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion.\n  - 3-PS2-3: Ask questions to determine cause and effect relationships of electric or magnetic interactions between two objects not in contact with each other. *(adapted for light interactions)*\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Observe and describe how light bends when it passes through water, creating a rainbow effect.\n2. Explain that sunlight is made up of many colors that can be separated by water droplets.\n3. Predict where a rainbow will appear based on the position of the sun and water (cause and effect).\n4. Design and conduct a simple experiment to create a rainbow and record observations about light behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the rainbow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the rainbow photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student science notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it so all students can see clearly. Allow students to sit quietly for 15 seconds, just observing.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing 30-60 seconds thinking and sharing time for each):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What colors do you notice?\"\n   - \"When have you seen a rainbow? What was happening outside at that moment?\" (Invite 3-4 student responses; listen for mentions of rain and sun together.)\n   - \"Do you think the rainbow was really made by something in the sky, or did someone paint it there? What makes you think so?\"\n   - \"What do you wonder about how rainbows are made?\"\n\n3. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper. Accept all ideas without judgment. Look for patterns in thinking (e.g., \"Does it have to do with rain?\" \"Does the sun have something to do with it?\").\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder if we can make our own rainbow without waiting for rain. Do you think that's possible? What would we need?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be rainbow scientists. We'll investigate how light and water work together to make rainbows, and then we'll create our own!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how light bends through water, creating rainbow colors.\n\n**Materials:** (per small group or pair)\n- Clear glass or plastic cups filled with water\n- White paper or white paper towels\n- Flashlight or smartphone with flashlight app\n- Mirrors (small, flat mirrors or pieces of reflective material)\n- Optional: spray bottle with water\n- Science notebooks and pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Light Through Water**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** to each pair or small group. Ensure each group has a cup of water, flashlight, white paper, and mirror.\n\n2. **Student directions** (read aloud and display on board):\n   - \"Shine your flashlight through the clear water in your cup onto the white paper. What do you see? Can you see the light beam? Does the light look the same on both sides of the water?\"\n   - \"Now, place a mirror at the bottom of your cup of water. Shine the flashlight through the water toward the mirror. What happens to the light? Does it bend or bounce?\"\n   - \"Carefully tilt your cup and angle the flashlight so light enters the water at different angles. Observe: Does the light always travel in the same path, or does it change?\"\n   - **Record observations:** \"Draw or write what you see. Did the light change direction when it went through the water? How?\"\n\n3. **How it connects to the photograph:** \"The light rays in your experiment are like the sunlight in the rainbow photo. When sunlight passes through millions of tiny water droplets in the air, it bends just like it does in your cup—and that bending separates the light into colors!\"\n\n4. **What students should record:**\n   - Drawings of light path with and without water\n   - Written or pictured descriptions of what changed (light bent, appeared to curve, etc.)\n   - A simple prediction: \"If I tilt the cup more, will the light bend MORE or LESS?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and observe without correcting. Ask open-ended questions:\n  - \"What do you notice when you change the angle of the flashlight?\"\n  - \"Where does the light go now? Is it in the same spot as before?\"\n  - \"Does the water change how the light moves?\"\n- Resist explaining; let students discover through observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that light changes direction when entering water.\n- Students begin to understand that the angle of light entry affects the direction of light exit.\n- Students recognize a cause-and-effect relationship: *changing the angle of light CAUSES the light path to change*.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration; connect to rainbow formation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Photograph of the rainbow (displayed again)\n- Optional: short video clip (1-2 minutes) showing how rainbows form (search \"how rainbows form\" on YouTube for age-appropriate options)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 groups to share their drawings and observations.\n   - Ask: \"Did anyone notice that the light bent when it went through the water? What did that look like?\"\n   - Affirm observations without overexplaining yet.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes)** using student-friendly language:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Light:** Energy that lets us see. Light travels very fast and usually in straight lines.\n   - **Refraction:** The bending of light when it passes through something clear (like water or air). Light bends because it slows down a tiny bit when it goes through water.\n   - **Reflect/Reflection:** When light bounces off something shiny, like a mirror. The light doesn't go through it—it bounces back.\n   - **Prism:** Something (like a water droplet) that splits white light into rainbow colors.\n   - **Rainbow:** The colors we see when white sunlight is bent and bounced by water droplets in the air.\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the rainbow in the image. \"This rainbow happened because sunlight hit billions of water droplets in the air after rain. The light bent (refracted) inside each water droplet, just like in your experiment. This bending separated the white sunlight into all the colors you see—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple!\"\n   - Point to the position of the sun. \"Notice: the sun is behind the photographer, and the water droplets are in front. That's the only way a rainbow can form. The light has to come from behind you and bounce off water in front of you.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to a partner and explain: What made the light bend in our experiment? (Answer: the water.)\"\n   - \"Why do you think we see a rainbow after a rainstorm? What has to be in the right place?\" (Answer: sun and water droplets.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and define refraction, reflection, and rainbow.\n- Students understand the cause-and-effect sequence: sunlight → water droplets → light bends → colors separate → we see a rainbow.\n- Students can predict that a rainbow requires both sun and water in specific positions.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to create their own rainbow and investigate color separation.\n\n**Materials:** (per pair or small group)\n- Spray bottle filled with water (or a cup and spoon for flicking water)\n- Flashlight or sunlight access\n- White paper\n- Prism (if available) OR clear water bottle/glass\n- Science notebooks\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Make Your Own Rainbow:**\n\n1. **Setup:** Take students outside if possible (into a sunny area). If indoors, use a flashlight in a darkened corner. Darken the room slightly by closing blinds.\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"You're going to make your own rainbow! Spray water into the air or between you and the light (flashlight or sun). Look carefully—can you see colors appear in the water spray?\"\n   - \"Angle your body and the water spray different ways. Does the rainbow appear in different places? Where does it appear when the light is behind you?\"\n   - \"Draw or describe your rainbow. What colors do you see? Are they in the same order as the rainbow in the photo?\"\n\n3. **Challenge:** \"Can you predict where the rainbow will appear if you move the water spray to the left? To the right? Test your prediction!\"\n\n4. **Real-world connection:** \"Have you ever created a rainbow with a garden hose at home? Explain when and how that happens, based on what you learned today.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the outdoor/darkened space safely.\n- Ask students to predict before adjusting the water spray angle: \"What do you think will happen if we move the spray?\"\n- Prompt deeper thinking: \"Where is the light coming from compared to where you are standing?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully create a visible rainbow or light spectrum.\n- Students document the observation with drawings and color descriptions.\n- Students explain the cause and effect: *The angle of light + water droplets CAUSE colors to separate.*\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light refraction, color separation, and rainbow formation.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student drawings and descriptions during Explore phase for evidence that they noticed light bending.\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain phase for use of vocabulary (refraction, rainbow, light).\n- Watch for student predictions and testing during Elaborate phase—do they adjust their approach based on observations?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal or written, depending on class literacy level). Ask students to complete the following:\n\n1. **Picture + Label:** \"Draw a rainbow. Label the sun, water droplets, and light. Use an arrow to show which direction the light is traveling.\"\n\n2. **Cause and Effect:** \"Fill in the blanks:\n   - When sunlight hits water droplets, the light _____ (bends/bounces/disappears).\n   - This causes the white light to separate into _____ (colors/shapes/patterns).\n   - We see a rainbow when the sun is _____ (in front of us / behind us / above us).\"\n\n3. **Application:** \"If you saw a rainbow while looking toward the east, where would the sun have to be? (East, West, North, or South?) Explain why.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Students accurately label the sun, water, and light direction in their drawing.\n- ✓ Students correctly identify that light bends (refracts) when passing through water.\n- ✓ Students demonstrate understanding of cause and effect: light bending → color separation → rainbow.\n- ✓ Students can explain the positional relationship between sun, observer, and water needed for a rainbow to form.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students correctly identify refraction as the cause of rainbows.\n- Students can verbally or visually explain that white light separates into colors when it bends through water.\n- Students can predict rainbow location based on sun position.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Guided observation protocol:** Provide a simple diagram showing light entering water and bending. Have students label the diagram as they conduct the Explore activity, using sentence starters: \"The light went _____ before the water. The light went _____ after the water.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary support:** Create a small reference card with pictures and one-word labels (Light, Water, Bend, Rainbow) for students to use during discussions. Allow students to point to the word rather than recall it.\n\n3. **Simplified exit ticket:** Reduce the exit ticket to yes/no and multiple-choice questions instead of open-ended responses. For example: \"Did the light bend when it went through the water? Yes or No. Did we use red light or white light? Red / White / Both.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate variables:** Challenge students to test which of the following creates the clearest rainbow: distance of water spray from light, angle of light, size of water droplets (fine mist vs. larger drops). Have them design a fair test and record results in a data table.\n\n2. **Color order investigation:** Provide a prism (if available) or clear glass of water. Challenge students to observe and record the order of colors in their created rainbow. Compare to ROY G. BIV (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) and discuss why the order is always the same. (Hint: different colors of light bend at slightly different angles.)\n\n3. **Secondary rainbows:** Show a photograph of a double rainbow (where a fainter secondary rainbow appears above the primary one). Ask: \"If one rainbow is caused by light bending once through water droplets, what do you think creates the secondary rainbow?\" Encourage research and hypothesis-building.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rainbow Art Project:** Students create a rainbow using only the colors they observed in their experiment (no coloring in black outlines). They label the colors in order and write a sentence explaining how the rainbow was made. Display in classroom with the original photograph and Explore-phase drawings to show the learning progression.\n\n2. **Rainbow Journey Story:** Students write a creative story from the perspective of a \"light ray\" that travels from the sun, hits a water droplet, bends, and becomes part of a rainbow. The story should include correct vocabulary (refraction, light, water, colors) and demonstrate understanding of the process.\n\n3. **Home Rainbow Hunt:** Students take home a simple worksheet asking them to observe and photograph or draw a rainbow if one appears during the next rainy week. They record the time of day, which direction they were facing, and where the sun was. Students bring observations back to class for a discussion about when and where rainbows appear in their community.\n\n---",
