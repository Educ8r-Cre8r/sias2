ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about light, shiny objects, and shadows using the photograph of the metal arches.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color photograph of the canyon arch sculpture (displayed on interactive board or printed poster, 18\" × 24\" minimum)\n- Flashlight or desk lamp (for demonstration)\n- Shiny object (aluminum foil, metal spoon, or shiny bracelet)\n- Dull object (wooden block, cloth, or paper)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Hook (3 minutes):**\n   - Show the photograph of the arches on the large screen or as a poster.\n   - Say: \"Look at this amazing picture! Today we're going to be light detectives and figure out why some things look so shiny and bright.\"\n   - Dim the lights slightly (or close blinds partially) so students notice the contrast.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (6 minutes):**\n   - \"Why do you think these metal arches look so bright and shiny? What makes them different from the buildings behind them?\"\n   - \"Do you see any dark spots or shadows under or around the arches? Where are they?\"\n   - \"What do you think is making the arches shine so bright?\" (Guide them to notice sunlight/light source.)\n   - \"If there were no sunlight, do you think we could still see the arches? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Quick Prediction (2 minutes):**\n   - Hold up two objects—one shiny (aluminum foil) and one dull (wooden block).\n   - Ask: \"If I shine my flashlight on both of these, which one do you think will look brighter? Which one will look duller?\"\n   - Record predictions on a chart labeled \"Our Predictions About Shiny and Dull.\"\n\n**Transition:** Now we're going to investigate what really happens when light hits shiny and dull things, just like the light hits those beautiful arches!\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (24 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students experiment with light, shadows, and different materials to discover how light behaves.\n\n**Materials (per pair of students):**\n- Flashlight or clip lamp with a clear beam\n- Aluminum foil\n- White paper\n- Wooden block or rubber block\n- Black construction paper\n- Small objects to create shadows (plastic toys, blocks, pencils)\n- White chart paper or poster board (to use as a \"light screen\")\n- Pencil for recording observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Shiny vs. Dull Investigation (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Setup (2 minutes):**\n   - Pair students up. Dim classroom lights.\n   - Give each pair a flashlight, aluminum foil, white paper, and a wooden block.\n   - Explain: \"We're going to shine light on different things and see what happens.\"\n\n2. **Student Directions (13 minutes):**\n   - Step 1: \"Take your flashlight and shine it on the aluminum foil. What do you see? Does it look bright and shiny? Where does the light go? Draw or write what you see in your notebook.\"\n   - Step 2: \"Now shine the same light on the white paper. Is it as bright as the foil? Does it look shiny or dull? Record your observation.\"\n   - Step 3: \"Shine your light on the wooden block. What happens? Is it shiny or dull? Write or draw.\"\n   - Step 4: \"Try shining the light on black paper. Can you see the light bounce off? Record what you notice.\"\n   - Circulate and prompt: \"What's different about how the light looks on each material? Which one bounces light back to your eyes the best?\"\n\n**Part B: Shadow Investigation (9 minutes)**\n\n3. **Shadow Creation (5 minutes):**\n   - Give each pair a chart paper to use as a \"screen\" and a flashlight.\n   - Say: \"Now we're going to make shadows, just like the shadows under those big arches in the picture!\"\n   - Students place small objects in front of the light to block it, observing the shadows cast on the paper.\n   - Directions: \"Hold your toy between the light and the paper. What do you see on the paper? That dark shape is a shadow! What made the shadow?\"\n   - Students try different objects, observing that different shapes make different shadows.\n   - Record: \"Draw the shadow shape you made.\"\n\n4. **Question to Deepen Thinking (4 minutes):**\n   - \"What happens to the shadow if you move the object closer to the light? What if you move it far away?\"\n   - Have students test this and observe shadow size changes.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\" \"Is the light bouncing or being blocked?\"\n- Do **not** tell students the answers; let them discover through trial.\n- Document student observations with photographs if possible.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that shiny materials (aluminum foil) reflect light and appear brighter.\n- Students observe that dull materials (wood, paper) don't shine as much.\n- Students understand that shadows form when objects block light.\n- Students notice that shadows change size when the object moves closer or farther from light.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect discoveries to the photograph and real-world observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of arches (displayed again)\n- Real objects used in Explore (flashlight, aluminum foil, wooden block, toy for shadow)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (6 minutes):**\n   - Gather students in a circle where all can see the photograph again.\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover about shiny things and light? Tell us what you found!\"\n   - Invite 3-4 pairs to share one discovery. Record on chart: \"What We Learned About Light.\"\n   - Examples: \"The foil was shinier,\" \"Light made shadows,\" \"Dark things don't shine as much.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Present 4-5 terms with visual supports:\n\n   | Vocabulary | Student-Friendly Definition | Visual |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Light** | Bright energy that helps us see things. It comes from the sun, lamps, and flashlights. | Point to sun through window; turn on flashlight |\n   | **Reflect** | When light bounces off something shiny and comes back to our eyes, making it look bright. | Shine light on aluminum foil; show the bounce |\n   | **Shadow** | The dark shape you see when something blocks the light. | Use flashlight and toy to make shadow on wall |\n   | **Shiny** | Something that bounces light back; it looks bright and sparkly. | Show aluminum foil, metal spoon |\n   | **Dull** | Something that doesn't bounce much light; it looks dark and not sparkly. | Show wooden block, cloth |\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the arches in the photo again.\n   - Say: \"See these big metal arches? They're made of a shiny metal, just like the aluminum foil you investigated. The sun's light bounces off them and reflects back to us, which is why they look so bright and beautiful in this picture.\"\n   - Point to the shadows under the arches: \"These dark shadows are where the arches block the sunlight. That's exactly what you created when you put your toys in front of the flashlight!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"If we covered the shiny arches with a big blanket, would they still look shiny?\" (No, because light can't bounce off them.)\n   - Ask: \"Why can we see the shadow under the arch?\" (Because the arch blocks the light.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Light:** Bright energy from the sun or lamps that lets us see things.\n- **Reflect:** When light bounces off something shiny and comes back to our eyes.\n- **Shadow:** A dark shape made when something blocks the light.\n- **Shiny:** Something smooth and smooth that bounces light (looks bright).\n- **Dull:** Something that doesn't bounce much light (looks dark, not sparkly).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary to describe what they observed.\n- Students make connections between their Explore activities and real-world example (the arches).\n- Students understand that light bounces off shiny things and is blocked by objects.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply light and shadow concepts to a new, creative context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Flashlights (1 per pair)\n- Variety of textured objects: smooth aluminum foil, crinkled aluminum foil, plastic wrap, wax paper, construction paper (various colors), cardboard, cloth\n- Shadow puppet templates (simple shapes: hand, animal outlines)\n- Poster board or large paper for shadow screen\n- Crayons and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Texture and Light Investigation (8 minutes)**\n- Present students with materials and ask: \"We learned that smooth, shiny metal reflects light. What about other materials? Some are smooth, some are bumpy. Some are thick, some are see-through.\"\n- Partner activity: \"Choose two different materials. Shine your light on both. Which one bounces more light? Which one blocks more light? Is the dull one really dull, or just different?\"\n- Student choice: Try crinkled foil vs. smooth foil, plastic wrap, wax paper.\n- Discovery: Students notice that even dull things can vary, and that some materials let light pass through (translucent).\n\n**Part B: Shadow Puppet Show (10 minutes)**\n- Say: \"You're going to make your own shadow show, just like shadows under the arches!\"\n- Directions:\n  1. Set up a \"stage\" with poster board as the screen and a flashlight behind it.\n  2. Students create shadow puppets by holding their hands or objects between light and screen.\n  3. Partners take turns: one makes shadows, one watches on the \"screen.\"\n  4. Encourage: \"Make the shadow bigger, smaller, change shape! What happens?\"\n  5. Optional: Students can draw or color shadow shapes they created.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask questions to deepen thinking: \"How did you make the shadow change? What happened when you moved it?\"\n- Celebrate creativity: \"That shadow looks like a bird! You blocked the light perfectly!\"\n- Connect back: \"Just like those big arches make shadows, you're making shadows the same way.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that materials interact with light differently (smooth, bumpy, thick, thin, transparent).\n- Students demonstrate that they can control shadows by moving objects.\n- Students express understanding through creative shadow play.\n- Students articulate cause-and-effect: \"When I move the light/object, the shadow changes because...\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light, reflection, and shadows.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe and document student explanations during Explore and Elaborate phases using a checklist:\n  - ☐ Student recognizes shiny objects reflect light\n  - ☐ Student understands shadows form when light is blocked\n  - ☐ Student can use vocabulary (light, reflect, shadow, shiny, dull) appropriately\n  - ☐ Student makes connections to the photograph of the arches\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes, end of Lesson 2):**\n- Show students the photograph of the arches one more time.\n- Ask students to complete ONE of the following (draw or dictate to you):\n\n  **Option A (Recall):** \"Draw the arches. Show where the light is and where the shadow is.\"\n  \n  **Option B (Application):** \"If you shined a flashlight on the shiny arches like we did with our flashlights, would they look bright or dull? Why?\"\n  \n  **Option C (Explanation):** \"Why are the metal arches so shiny? What makes them shine?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies light source and/or shadow location.\n- ✓ Student explains that shiny materials reflect light and make things bright.\n- ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary word (light, reflect, shadow, shiny, dull).\n- ✓ Student connects their investigation to the real-world photograph.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify where light and shadows are in the photograph.\n- 75% of students can explain that shiny things reflect light and look bright.\n- 70% of students use vocabulary correctly in context.\n- All students demonstrate increased observation skills and curiosity about light.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary Visuals:** Provide picture cards for each vocabulary word (light, reflect, shadow, shiny, dull) that students can reference during all phases. Use gestures and movements to reinforce (e.g., \"bounce\" motion for reflect).\n\n2. **Simplified Exploration:** Pair with a more confident student, or reduce the number of materials to investigate. Focus on just shiny (foil) vs. dull (wood) rather than multiple variations.\n\n3. **Guided Questions:** Instead of open-ended \"What do you notice?\", ask yes/no and either/or questions: \"Is this shiny or dull?\" \"Does the light bounce off this one?\" \"Does this one make a shadow?\"\n\n4. **Sentence Stems for Explanation:** Provide sentence starters like: \"The _____ is shiny because...\" \"I see a shadow because the light is _____...\" \"The metal arches reflect light so they look _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Investigate Angles:** \"What happens to the shadow if you tilt the light? Does the shadow get bigger or smaller? Why might that happen? Can you make the shadow bigger without moving the object?\"\n\n2. **Transparent Materials:** Introduce plastic wrap, clear plastic cups, or cellophane. \"This light passes through, not bouncing off or completely blocking. What would this material do to the arch shadow? Would it block light like the arch does?\" (Extend to concept of translucent/transparent without using terminology yet.)\n\n3. **Multi-Step Explanation:** \"Could the arches be made of something dull but still look shiny? How? Could a dull material look shiny under bright light?\" (Pushes thinking about relative brightness and material properties.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Home Exploration: Shiny and Dull Hunt**\n   - Send home a simple worksheet: \"Find three shiny things and three dull things at home. Draw or list them. Bring them back to share.\" Students can bring items for a classroom \"Shiny and Dull\" display, reinforcing vocabulary in real-world context.\n\n2. **Shadow Puppet Stories**\n   - Over several days, students create a simple shadow puppet story (3-4 scenes) using hand shadows and objects. They \"perform\" for classmates, narrating what happens. Connects to storytelling and sequencing while reinforcing shadow concepts.\n\n3. **Rainbow Light Investigation (Follow-Up Lesson)**\n   - Introduce clear prisms or CDs to show that white light bounces differently and can create colors. Ask: \"The metal arches are silver and reflect light. What if we used a different material that breaks light into colors? What would we see?\" (Naturally extends reflection concept to introduce light spectrum as a follow-up.)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Timing:** Lessons can be split into two 40-minute sessions (Engage + Explore on Day 1; Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2) or combined into one 75-minute block if possible.\n- **Safety:** Ensure flashlights have secure batteries and are not shined directly into students' eyes. Dim lights gently rather than making the room very dark.\n- **Classroom Setup:** Arrange tables so pairs can work independently during Explore without creating a chaotic light environment. Consider using small desk lamps rather than classroom lights for more controlled illumination.\n- **Photograph Connection:** Return to the arch photograph at each phase so students see how their investigations connect to the real-world example. This reinforces that science is about understanding the world around us.\n- **Language Inclusive:** All vocabulary is introduced with both visual and verbal support, making the lesson accessible for English learners and diverse learners.",
