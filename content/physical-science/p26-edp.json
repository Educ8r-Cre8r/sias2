Can your crane pick up small blocks or toys from a table and move them to another spot? Test it to see if your boat tips over or stays steady.\n\n**3-5**: *Design a cargo-loading system for a ship.* Your ship (a floating container) must pick up 5 identical weights (blocks or washers) using a simple crane mechanism (pulley, lever, or magnetic lift). Constraints: (1) The crane must lift each weight at least 15 cm, (2) The ship must not tip over while loaded, (3) The entire loading cycle must take no more than 3 minutes. Measure and record the ship's stability (does it list to one side?) and loading time. Redesign one part to make it faster or more stable.\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem** — This photo shows a real-world solution (a cargo ship with cranes) but doesn't show an active engineering challenge. Students need to first *identify* the problem the ship solves: \"How do we move heavy cargo on and off ships safely and quickly?\" This frames the design task and lets students imagine their own solutions before building.\n\n### Suggested Materials\n\n- Small plastic containers or foam trays (for ship hulls)\n- Straws, dowels, or wooden sticks (for crane booms)\n- String or fishing line (for cables/pulleys)\n- Washers, blocks, or small weights (cargo)\n- Plastic cups or small buckets (cargo holders)\n- Tape and scissors (assembly)\n\n### Estimated Time\n\n**K-2**: 20–30 minutes (minimal planning, quick build and test)  \n**3-5**: 45–60 minutes (planning, building, testing, measuring, one redesign cycle)\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS 3-5-ETS1-1** (*Ask & Define*) and **3-5-ETS1-2** (*Design & Test*) by having students identify a real constraint (stable loading of cargo), set measurable success criteria (weight lifted, stability, time), and iterate their design based on test data.",
