This lesson bridges student observations of heating to foundational understanding of energy transfer, preparing them for future thermal energy standards in higher grades. We will use **1-PS4-2: Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that objects in darkness can be seen only when illuminated** as a cross-cutting connection (observing the flame's light), while building conceptual foundation for heat energy through careful observation and description of physical changes.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to...\n\n1. **Observe and describe** what happens to an egg when heat from a flame is applied to it.\n2. **Identify the heat source** (the flame) and explain that it causes changes in the egg's appearance and texture.\n3. **Compare the properties** of raw and cooked egg white and yolk (color, texture, firmness).\n4. **Predict and explain** that different materials respond differently to heat energy.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about heat and thermal energy using the photograph of a cooking egg.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the egg cooking on the pan\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Real egg (uncooked) in a clear container for comparison\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently on the board or screen. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation time before any discussion.\n\n2. **Ask these specific questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see happening in this picture? Describe what you notice about the egg.\" (Listen for: white, yellow, flat, round, changing)\n   - \"Where is the heat coming from? Can you see it?\" (Guide them to notice the blue flame below the pan)\n   - \"Why do you think the egg is changing colors and textures? What could be making it do that?\"\n   - \"What do you predict would happen if we kept the egg on the heat for longer?\"\n\n3. **Show the real raw egg** in a clear container. Ask: \"How is this egg different from the one cooking in the picture? What changed?\"\n\n4. **Record student observations** on chart paper in a two-column \"Before/After\" format with simple drawings or words.\n\n**Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what is making the egg change from runny and clear to thick and white? What do you think is happening?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to explore what happens when heat is added to different materials, starting with our own safe heating activity!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students conduct hands-on investigations to observe and document how heat changes materials.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Shallow aluminum pans or metal pie tins (one per group) — **MUST be handled by teacher only**\n- Hot water in a thermos (pre-heated by teacher; approximately 150°F/65°C)\n- Raw eggs (1 per group)\n- Plastic spoons or small wooden stirring sticks\n- Observation sheets (pre-drawn with \"Before,\" \"During,\" and \"After\" sections with pictures to color or label)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Paper towels\n- Magnifying glasses (optional, for close observation)\n- **Teacher should cook eggs in advance in a separate location OR demonstrate with a cold pan first, then pre-cooked egg halves**\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**SAFETY NOTE:** Given First Grade age, the teacher will demonstrate with pre-cooked eggs OR conduct the heating demo as a whole-class teacher demo with students observing from a safe distance (3+ feet). Students will NOT handle hot materials.\n\n1. **Divide class into small groups.** Assign each group an observation station.\n\n2. **Teacher demonstrates:** \"Watch as I carefully pour hot water into this pan. Look at what happens to the egg.\" (Pour hot water around a raw egg in a metal pan or show the transformation with a pre-cooked egg placed in hot water.)\n\n3. **Student task:** Each group observes the egg in the hot water for 2-3 minutes. Students use magnifying glasses to look closely at:\n   - The color of the white\n   - The texture of the white (bumpy? smooth? hard?)\n   - The color and firmness of the yolk\n   - Any other changes they notice\n\n4. **Documentation:** Students draw or color their observations on the \"Before/During/After\" observation sheet. Encourage labels like: \"clear,\" \"white,\" \"hard,\" \"soft,\" \"runny,\" \"thick.\"\n\n5. **Group discussion:** After 3 minutes, each group briefly shares one observation: \"We noticed the white became ___.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups with guiding questions: \"What color was it before? What color is it now?\" \"Touch the rim of the pan—is it hot or cold?\" \"Why do you think it changed?\"\n- Avoid directly explaining cause and effect; ask open-ended questions.\n- Record student language and observations for the Explain phase.\n- Manage safety carefully; have students step back if they get too close to heat.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify visible changes in the egg (white becomes opaque, yolk firms up)\n- Students note that the pan and water are hot/warm\n- Students produce drawings or written/verbal descriptions of changes\n- Students begin to associate the presence of heat with material transformation\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of thermal energy and its effects on materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with the photograph taped at the top\n- Markers\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Word cards with pictures: \"heat,\" \"flame,\" \"change,\" \"warm,\" \"hot,\" \"temperature\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students together** in a circle or semi-circle where all can see the photograph.\n\n2. **Group share-out:** Invite 3-4 students to share their observations from the Explore phase. Record their descriptions on chart paper under a heading: \"What We Noticed.\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary with visual supports:**\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Visual Support** |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Heat** | Energy that makes things warm or hot; it comes from things like flames, the sun, and hot water. | Point to the flame in the photo; show a lit match (safely, from distance). |\n   | **Flame** | The hot, bright part of a fire that we can see. The blue part in the picture is a flame. | Point to the blue flame in the photograph. |\n   | **Temperature** | How hot or cold something is. The hotter something is, the higher the temperature. | Use a classroom thermometer; show \"hot\" and \"cold\" ends. |\n   | **Change** | When something becomes different. The egg changed from clear and runny to white and thick. | Show before/after drawings from student work. |\n   | **Energy** | The power to make things happen or move. Heat is a type of energy. | \"The flame gave energy to the egg and made it change.\" |\n\n4. **Make connections:** Point back to the photograph. \"The blue flame below the pan has **heat energy**. This heat travels to the pan and the egg. The **heat changed the egg's** texture and color. This is a **change** in how the egg looks and feels.\"\n\n5. **Ask guiding questions** (check for understanding):\n   - \"Where does the heat come from in the picture?\" (The blue flame)\n   - \"How did the egg change?\" (From clear to white, from runny to hard)\n   - \"Why did it change?\" (Because heat was added)\n   - \"If we took the egg away from the flame, would it change more or stay the same?\" (Stay the same—no more heat)\n\n6. **Create a class anchor chart** titled \"Heat Makes Changes\" with simple drawings:\n   - Raw egg (clear white, runny yolk) → Flame with arrows → Cooked egg (white white, firm yolk)\n   - Label: \"Heat energy from the flame changed the egg.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Heat:** Energy that makes things warm or hot.\n- **Flame:** The bright, hot part of a fire we can see (like the blue part under the pan).\n- **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is.\n- **Change:** When something becomes different from how it was before.\n- **Energy:** The power to make things happen or move things.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the heat source (flame) in the photograph.\n- Students use vocabulary (\"heat,\" \"change,\" \"temperature\") to describe what happened to the egg.\n- Students understand that heat is energy that causes observable changes in materials.\n- Students can predict that removing heat stops the change.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding of heat energy to predict and observe changes in other materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Several objects made of different materials: chocolate chip (in a wrapper), butter pat, ice cube, paper, aluminum foil, plastic bead\n- Small containers or plates\n- Cups of warm water (pre-heated by teacher; safe temperature ~110°F/43°C)\n- Observation recording sheet with simple pictures of each material and \"before/after\" spaces\n- Teacher-safe heat source (optional): a lamp with an incandescent bulb (if available and appropriate for your classroom)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the investigation:** \"We learned that heat can change an egg. What else can heat change? Let's test different materials and make predictions.\"\n\n2. **Show students 4-5 different materials** (chocolate, butter, ice, paper, foil). Hold each up and ask: \"Do you think heat would change this? How?\"\n\n3. **Set up stations** (or do this as a whole-class demo with teacher control of heat sources):\n   - **Station 1 (Warm water bath):** Students place a chocolate chip and butter pat in a container of warm water. Watch and describe what happens over 2-3 minutes.\n   - **Station 2 (Sunlight or lamp warmth):** Students place an ice cube on a plate near a sunny window or warm lamp. Observe.\n   - **Station 3 (No heat/control):** Students leave a chocolate chip and butter pat on a cool surface. Nothing changes—this is the comparison.\n\n4. **Students rotate through stations** (or observe teacher demo at each station) and record:\n   - Draw the material before\n   - Draw the material after\n   - Write or say: \"The heat made it ___.\"\n\n5. **Whole-group discussion:** \"Which materials changed? Which didn't? Why do you think heat affected some things but not others?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate rotations and manage materials.\n- Ask: \"Is it the same as before?\" \"What changed?\" \"What do you think made it change?\"\n- Guide observations without providing answers.\n- Emphasize that **all changes we saw were caused by heat energy.**\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that heat changes different materials in different ways (chocolate melts, ice melts, butter softens, paper doesn't change much).\n- Students apply the concept that \"heat is energy that causes changes.\"\n- Students produce visual records of their observations.\n- Students begin to understand that different materials have different properties and respond differently to heat.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of heat, thermal energy, and material change.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- **Observe during Explore:** Are students correctly identifying changes in the egg? Can they point to and name specific changes (color, texture)?\n- **Listen during Explain discussions:** Do students use vocabulary correctly (\"heat,\" \"change,\" \"flame\")? Can they connect the flame to the egg's transformation?\n- **Check Elaborate observations:** Can students predict whether heat will change a material? Can they describe the results accurately?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of Lesson Day 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (picture-based for first graders) with these prompts:\n\n1. **Show or draw:** \"Draw the egg at the beginning (raw) and at the end (cooked). Label or describe what changed.\"\n\n   *Success criterion:* Student shows clear visual difference between raw and cooked egg (clear/white, runny/firm).\n\n2. **Oral or written response:** \"What made the egg change?\" \n   \n   *Success criterion:* Student names \"heat,\" \"flame,\" \"hot water,\" or \"the stove.\" Accept: \"It got hot,\" \"The fire made it change,\" \"Heat did it.\"\n\n3. **Prediction:** \"If we put a cold egg on the counter (not on heat), would it change? Why or why not?\"\n   \n   *Success criterion:* Student says \"No, it won't change because there's no heat\" or similar reasoning. Accept: \"It needs heat to change.\"\n\n**Whole-Class Check:**\n- Display the anchor chart from Explain phase. Point to different parts and ask: \"What is this?\" \"Why did the egg change?\" Observe how many students can respond with accurate vocabulary and reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery if they:\n- Accurately describe visible changes in the egg (color, texture)\n- Identify the heat source (flame, hot water, stove)\n- Use vocabulary terms appropriately (\"heat,\" \"change,\" \"flame,\" \"energy\")\n- Understand that heat energy causes observable changes in materials\n- Can predict that materials change *when heat is added* and remain unchanged *without heat*\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce language load:** Use picture-based observation sheets instead of requiring written descriptions. Ask yes/no or either/or questions instead of open-ended ones: \"Is the white clear or white?\" \"Did it change or stay the same?\"\n\n2. **Provide a visual reference guide:** Create a simple poster with three pictures: \"Raw Egg\" → \"Heat from Flame\" → \"Cooked Egg.\" Point to this during discussions so students see the cause-and-effect sequence visually.\n\n3. **Partner with a peer or paraprofessional:** Pair struggling students with confident peers during station rotations. Have them describe what they see to their partner, who can record observations.\n\n4. **Use concrete, repeated vocabulary:** Say the same phrases consistently (\"Heat makes changes,\" \"The flame gives heat,\" \"Heat is energy\"). Repeat new vocabulary 5-7 times per lesson with the same visual context.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Introduce cause-and-effect reasoning:** Ask higher-order questions: \"Why do you think the egg white turned from clear to white?\" \"What would happen if we added even MORE heat?\" \"Can we undo the change?\" Let them predict multi-step scenarios.\n\n2. **Expand material testing:** Have advanced students test additional materials (wax, plastic, fabric) and categorize them: \"What melted? What got softer? What didn't change?\" Introduce the concept of \"melting point\"—different materials respond to heat at different temperatures.\n\n3. **Connect to real-world applications:** Ask: \"Why do we cook food with heat?\" \"What other things does heat change?\" \"Is heating always good, or can it be bad?\" (e.g., burning paper). Encourage them to find other examples of heat changes in their home or classroom.\n\n4. **Encourage data recording:** Have advanced students measure temperatures using a classroom thermometer (if safe) and record data in a simple table: \"Cold water: __ degrees. Warm water: __ degrees. Hot water: __ degrees.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cooking Sequence Exploration:** Provide students with laminated picture cards showing stages of cooking (raw egg, partially cooked, fully cooked). Have students arrange them in order and explain what \"heat energy\" did at each step. Create a class book titled \"How Heat Changed Our Egg\" with student drawings and dictated captions.\n\n2. **Heat Around Our School:** Take a \"heat walk\" around the school to identify heat sources: the sunny windows (sun's heat), the classroom heater, the cafeteria kitchen (stove), the water fountain. At each location, students point and say: \"Heat is here!\" This extends the concept of thermal energy beyond the classroom.\n\n3. **Frozen to Melted Investigation:** In a follow-up lesson, place different frozen items (ice cubes, popsicles, frozen grapes) in clear containers and observe over time at room temperature. Students predict which will melt first and why, recording observations. This reinforces that heat energy (from room temperature, sun, or hands) causes changes in state and is a bridge to future water cycle lessons.\n\n4. **Sensory Safe Heat Exploration:** Create a \"warmth station\" with items of different temperatures (a cold water bowl, room-temperature objects, a warm (not hot) water bowl wrapped in a blanket). Students touch and describe: \"cold,\" \"cool,\" \"warm,\" \"hot.\" This reinforces temperature vocabulary without safety concerns.\n\n5. **Literature Connection:** Read a simple book like *Pancakes for Breakfast* by Tomie dePaola or *The Egg* by M.P. Robertson, which show cooking and transformation. Connect the story to the egg lesson: \"Heat changed the pancake/egg in this story, just like it changed our egg!\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Reflection Notes:**\n\nThis lesson introduces First Grade students to observable thermal energy effects within their developmentally appropriate framework. While formal \"heat\" standards appear in 2nd-3rd grade and beyond, First Graders can safely observe, describe, and make simple predictions about heating and cooling through carefully controlled, teacher-managed demonstrations. The focus is on **observation, description, and vocabulary building**—foundational skills for future thermal energy standards. Always prioritize safety; never allow students unsupervised contact with heat sources, and carefully manage all demonstrations.",
