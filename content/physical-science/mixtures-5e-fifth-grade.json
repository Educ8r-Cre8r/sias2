Exploring Mixtures and Conservation of Matter**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 50-minute sessions (approximately 90-100 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-PS1-1: Develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen.\n  - 5-PS1-2: Measure and graph quantities to provide evidence that regardless of the type of change that occurs when heating, cooling, or mixing substances, the total weight of matter is conserved.\n  - 5-PS1-4: Conduct an investigation to determine whether the mixing of two or more substances results in new substances.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Observe and describe the physical properties of different materials before and after mixing them together.\n2. Measure and record the mass of individual substances and their mixture to demonstrate that matter is conserved during mixing.\n3. Determine whether mixing two or more substances creates a new substance by comparing observable properties before and after mixing.\n4. Explain that matter is made of invisible particles that combine when substances are mixed, using a model or diagram.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about mixing and kitchen chemistry.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Photograph of kitchen ingredients and mixing setup (printed or displayed on screen)\n  - Three small, clear plastic cups\n  - Salt, sugar, and flour (about 1 tablespoon of each)\n  - Water\n  - Spoon for stirring\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  Display the photograph to the class and ask:\n  \n  1. \"What do you see happening in this picture? What is being mixed together?\"\n  2. \"Why do you think someone might mix these ingredients together?\"\n  3. \"When you mix sugar and cocoa powder, do you still have sugar and cocoa powder, or do you have something completely new?\"\n  4. \"If I mix salt into water, where does the salt go? Can you still see it?\"\n  \n  After discussion, show students three small cups containing salt, sugar, and flour separately. Ask: \"What do you predict will happen if I add water to each of these? Will they look the same or different? Will they still be the same material?\"\n  \n  Have students make predictions and write them down on a prediction sheet.\n\n- **Transition:** Today, we're going to become kitchen scientists and investigate what happens when different materials get mixed together. Let's explore whether mixing creates something brand new or just rearranges what we already have.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate the properties of materials before and after mixing, and observe whether mixing creates new substances.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Small plastic cups (6-8 per group)\n  - Measuring spoons (teaspoon)\n  - Salt, sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda (small quantities)\n  - Water in a pitcher\n  - Food coloring (1-2 colors)\n  - Spoons for stirring\n  - Paper towels\n  - Observation sheet (provided below)\n  - Hand lens (optional, for close observation)\n  - Scale or balance (for measuring mass, if available)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  Organize students into small groups (3-4 students per group). Provide each group with an observation sheet and access to materials.\n  \n  **Student Directions:**\n  \n  1. **Choose two dry materials to mix.** Options: salt, sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda. In one cup, measure 1 teaspoon of the first material. In another cup, measure 1 teaspoon of the second material.\n  \n  2. **Observe and record.** Before mixing, look closely at each material. Write or draw what you observe about:\n     - Color\n     - Texture (is it rough, smooth, granular?)\n     - Size of particles (are they large or tiny?)\n  \n  3. **Mix the dry materials.** Pour one material into the cup with the other. Stir well for 10-15 seconds. Observe the mixture.\n  \n  4. **Record observations about the mixture:**\n     - What color is it now?\n     - Can you still see the individual materials, or are they blended?\n     - Does it look like something new?\n  \n  5. **Repeat with a wet mixture.** In a fresh cup, measure 1 teaspoon of sugar. Add 5-10 drops of water. Stir and observe. Record what happens.\n  \n  6. **Try a color mixture.** In a cup with water, add 2-3 drops of food coloring and stir. Observe and record.\n  \n  7. **Optional: Mass measurement.** If scales are available, measure the mass of each material before mixing, then measure the mass of the mixture. Record the numbers.\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  \n  Circulate among groups asking guiding questions without providing answers:\n  - \"What do you notice about the texture?\"\n  - \"Can you still identify each material, or have they combined?\"\n  - \"Do you think you could separate these materials again? Why or why not?\"\n  - \"What does the number on the scale tell you?\"\n  \n  Allow time for students to experiment and make mistakes. Encourage them to refine their observations.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  \n  Students will produce an observation sheet showing:\n  - Drawings or descriptions of individual materials' properties\n  - Observations and drawings of mixtures\n  - Recorded measurements (if using scales)\n  - Written or verbal explanations of whether the mixture looks like a \"new\" substance or just materials rearranged\n  - Predictions about whether each mixture could be separated back into original materials\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the science of matter, mixtures, and conservation.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Whiteboard or chart paper\n  - Markers\n  - Diagram or model showing particles (prepared in advance or drawn together with class)\n  - One demonstration mixture (e.g., salt and flour from Explore phase)\n  - Optional: Particle model using foam balls or clay to represent atoms/molecules\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n  \n  Ask 2-3 groups to share their observations. Ask the class:\n  - \"Did all groups see similar results?\"\n  - \"What stayed the same after mixing?\"\n  - \"What changed after mixing?\"\n  \n  **Introduce Vocabulary and Concepts (10-15 minutes):**\n  \n  Write each vocabulary term on the board and define it together:\n  \n  1. **Matter:** Everything around us that takes up space and has mass. In your investigations, sugar, salt, water, and cocoa powder are all matter.\n  \n  2. **Mixture:** When two or more materials are combined but each material keeps its own properties. Example: Salt mixed with flour is a mixture—you can still see both if you look closely.\n  \n  3. **Physical Change:** A change in how something looks (color, size, texture) but the material is still the same. When you mix salt and flour, it's a physical change—you still have salt and flour.\n  \n  4. **Conservation of Matter:** The big idea: When you mix materials together, you don't lose anything or create anything new. The total amount of matter stays the same. Let's prove it!\n  \n  5. **Particles:** Tiny, tiny pieces of matter that are so small we cannot see them with our eyes. All matter is made of particles. When you mix sugar into water, the sugar particles spread out and hide in the water, but they're still there.\n  \n  **Demonstration of Conservation (5 minutes):**\n  \n  Hold up the salt-flour mixture from Explore. Say: \"One group mixed 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of flour. Before mixing, we had 2 teaspoons of material. After mixing, how much material do we have?\" \n  \n  Let students predict. If a scale is available, weigh the mixture and show that it equals the combined weight of the separate materials. If no scale, use the visual: \"We didn't throw anything away. We didn't add anything new. We have the same amount—it just looks different.\"\n  \n  **Draw a Simple Particle Model (5 minutes):**\n  \n  Draw two groups of circles (or dots) on the board to represent salt particles and flour particles, separated. Then draw them mixed together, explaining: \"The particles of salt and flour are still there—they're just mixed up together. We can't see individual particles, but they're still there, and there's the same amount.\"\n  \n  **Check for Understanding:**\n  \n  Ask students:\n  - \"If I mix blue food coloring into water, is it a mixture or a new substance? Why?\"\n  - \"Can you tell me one thing that stayed the same after mixing?\"\n  - \"Why can't we see salt after it dissolves in water?\"\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n\n  | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n  |------|----------------------------|\n  | **Matter** | Everything that takes up space and has weight; the \"stuff\" that makes up everything around us. |\n  | **Mixture** | When two or more different materials are put together, and each one still stays itself (even if we can't see them separately). |\n  | **Physical Change** | A change in how something looks (like color or shape) but it's still the same material inside. |\n  | **Conservation of Matter** | A scientific rule: when you mix, separate, heat, or cool things, you don't lose any material and you don't create new material. The total amount always stays the same. |\n  | **Particles** | Teeny-tiny pieces of matter that are too small to see, but they make up everything. |\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  \n  Students will:\n  - Understand that mixtures are physical combinations where materials keep their properties\n  - Recognize that mixing is a physical change, not a chemical change (for this grade level)\n  - Grasp that matter is conserved—the total amount doesn't change when mixed\n  - Begin to visualize that invisible particles combine when substances are mixed\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new scenario and deepen their reasoning about mixtures and matter conservation.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Three different \"mystery mixtures\" (prepared in advance in opaque containers, labeled A, B, C):\n    - Mixture A: Salt + sugar (both white, need to test with water to distinguish)\n    - Mixture B: Flour + cocoa powder (clearly visible as a blend)\n    - Mixture C: Water + food coloring (completely blended, uniform color)\n  - Small cups\n  - Water, spoons, filter paper (optional)\n  - Properties observation chart (provided)\n  - Pencils\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  Present students with three mystery mixtures. Explain: \"These are three different mixtures. Your job is to figure out what might be in each one based on what you learned about physical properties and mixtures.\"\n  \n  **Student Task:**\n  \n  1. Examine each mixture carefully. Describe its properties (color, texture, appearance).\n  \n  2. Predict which materials might have been mixed together. Use what you know about properties from the Explore activity.\n  \n  3. Test one of the mixtures by adding water (for example, if you think it's salt and sugar, add a little water and stir—salt dissolves faster than sugar, so you might see sugar grains remain longer).\n  \n  4. Based on your observations and tests, identify the likely ingredients in each mixture.\n  \n  5. Explain: Even though these mixtures look different from their individual ingredients, the matter is still conserved. The particles are still there; they're just mixed together. So how much total matter do you think is in Mixture B? (Answer: as much as there was in the separate materials combined.)\n  \n  **Real-World Connection:**\n  \n  Ask students: \"When a baker mixes flour, sugar, eggs, and water to make cake batter, is that a mixture? What happens when the cake is baked? Is that still the same change we learned about, or is something different happening?\" (This introduces the idea that baking involves chemical changes, setting up future learning, though the formal explanation is beyond 5th grade.)\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  \n  Ask probing questions:\n  - \"How do you know that's a mixture and not a new substance?\"\n  - \"Where are the particles of salt in the salt-sugar mixture?\"\n  - \"Could you separate this mixture back to its original materials? How?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  \n  Students will:\n  - Identify ingredients in mystery mixtures using their knowledge of physical properties\n  - Explain their reasoning using the concept of particles and conservation of matter\n  - Demonstrate deeper understanding by applying concepts to new scenarios\n  - Show evidence of understanding that matter is conserved even when it's not visually obvious (e.g., dissolved salt)\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of mixtures, matter, and conservation through formative and summative strategies.\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n  \n  Throughout the Explore and Elaborate phases, use the following strategies:\n  - Observe students' drawings and written observations on their sheets; check for accurate descriptions of properties and changes.\n  - Listen to group discussions and ask clarifying questions.\n  - Review the \"Check for Understanding\" questions from the Explain phase.\n  - Observe whether students can make accurate predictions about which materials are in mystery mixtures.\n  \n  **Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket / End of Lesson):**\n  \n  Provide each student with a short exit ticket (can be verbal or written). Ask them to respond to the following:\n  \n  **Question 1 (Observation):**\n  \"I mixed 2 teaspoons of flour and 2 teaspoons of cocoa powder. After mixing, I have _____ teaspoons of mixture. Explain how you know.\"\n  \n  **Correct Answer:** 4 teaspoons (or approximately that amount, depending on how tightly packed). Explanation: Because matter is conserved; I didn't lose anything when I mixed them, so the total amount stayed the same.\n  \n  **Question 2 (Concept Application):**\n  \"When sugar dissolves in water, you can't see the sugar anymore. Is the sugar still there? How do you know?\"\n  \n  **Correct Answer:** Yes, the sugar is still there. The sugar particles are too small to see, but they mixed into the water. If you tasted it, it would be sweet because the sugar is still there. Matter is conserved.\n  \n  **Question 3 (Particle Model):**\n  \"Draw or describe what happens to the particles when you mix salt and flour together.\"\n  \n  **Correct Answer:** Student should show or describe that individual particles of salt and flour are still separate (tiny), but they are now mixed up together instead of in separate piles.\n  \n  **Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n  \n  - **Proficient:** Student correctly identifies conservation of matter in mixing activities, provides accurate descriptions of physical properties before and after mixing, and explains that particles are too small to see but still present. Can predict outcomes of mixing based on properties.\n  \n  - **Developing:** Student understands that mixing doesn't destroy matter but may not fully explain the particle model. Can describe observable properties but needs support connecting to conservation.\n  \n  - **Beginning:** Student observes that materials mix but struggles to articulate conservation or particle concepts. Requires significant scaffolding.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  \n  Students will demonstrate mastery by:\n  - Correctly calculating/estimating that total mass/volume is conserved during mixing\n  - Explaining that invisible particles remain even when substances dissolve or blend\n  - Identifying physical properties of materials and using them to predict mixture outcomes\n  - Applying the concept of conservation of matter to novel scenarios\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support:**\n  \n  1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a graphic organizer with visual placeholders (boxes for drawing) rather than requiring written descriptions. Use checkboxes for properties (e.g., \"☐ Granular ☐ Smooth ☐ Liquid\").\n  \n  2. **Guided Exploration:** Work with small groups to complete one mixture investigation together before allowing independent exploration. Model the vocabulary and observation process.\n  \n  3. **Particle Model Scaffolding:** Use concrete manipulatives (foam balls, clay, or two colors of beads) to physically demonstrate mixing. Have students arrange and mix the objects, then count to show conservation is real.\n\n- **Challenge:**\n  \n  1. **Separation Investigation:** Ask advanced students to design and conduct a procedure to separate a mixture (e.g., using water to dissolve salt from flour, then evaporating the water). Have them predict whether the separated materials will have the same properties as before and test their prediction.\n  \n  2. **Graph Construction:** Have students measure and graph the mass of individual materials and mixtures, creating a bar graph to visually demonstrate conservation of matter across multiple trials.\n  \n  3. **Reversibility Exploration:** Challenge students to investigate which mixtures are reversible (can be separated) and which are irreversible, leading toward understanding that some mixtures involve permanent physical changes.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Layered Density Mixtures:** Students create density columns using salt water, fresh water, oil, and food coloring to explore how different materials with different properties can be mixed yet remain visible as layers. Students predict, observe, and record whether conservation applies to density mixtures.\n\n2. **Solubility Investigation:** Students test which solids dissolve in water (salt, sugar, flour, baking soda, sand) and measure how much of each substance is needed to reach saturation. They graph results and discuss whether dissolved materials are still present even though invisible (connecting to particle model).\n\n3. **Kitchen Chemistry Journal:** Students keep a science journal over one week, finding examples of mixtures in their homes (cereal and milk, orange juice, salad, smoothies). They describe each mixture's ingredients and properties, and explain how conservation of matter applies to each one.",
