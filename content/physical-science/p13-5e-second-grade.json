Observe and describe how a balloon's properties (flexibility, elasticity, ability to hold air) make it useful for moving other objects.\n2. Investigate how gravity affects falling objects and predict which materials fall at different speeds.\n3. Explain that forces (pushes and pulls) from balloons and gravity cause objects to move.\n4. Compare the properties of different small objects (confetti pieces) and predict how each will move when affected by force.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the balloon and confetti photograph\n- One inflated blue balloon (or similar)\n- Small handful of colorful confetti or cut paper pieces\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the image prominently. Let students look silently for 15-20 seconds. Ask them to turn to a neighbor and describe what they see.\n\n2. **Facilitated Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice is happening in this picture? What do you see falling or moving?\"\n   - \"Where do you think all that colorful stuff came from?\"\n   - \"What do you think made those pieces move? What gave them a push or pull?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this happen? When?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Hold up your inflated balloon. \"I wonder if this balloon can make things move the way the balloon in the picture did. What do you think would happen if I let this balloon bounce or pop near some confetti?\"\n\n4. **Record Predictions:** On chart paper, write down 3-4 student predictions about what will happen. Keep these visible for later comparison.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's investigate! We're going to use balloons and confetti to discover how forces can make objects move—just like in the picture.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One inflated balloon per pair of students (or small group)\n- Confetti pieces, small cut-paper squares, or torn tissue paper (diverse colors and sizes)\n- Shallow trays or paper plates (one per pair)\n- Paper clips, pom-poms, or small foam pieces as alternative test objects\n- Observation sheets (printed template with boxes for drawings and words)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Put your confetti pieces on your tray or plate. Spread them out so they don't touch each other.\"\n\n2. \"Hold your balloon about 12 inches above your confetti. Predict: Which pieces will move the most? Circle or point to them on your tray.\"\n\n3. \"Gently bounce your balloon above the confetti. Watch what happens. Do the pieces move? Which ones move the farthest?\"\n\n4. \"Now try dropping your balloon closer to the confetti. Does it make more pieces move? Does it make them move farther?\"\n\n5. \"Try bouncing the balloon on different parts of your tray. Do some spots make the confetti jump more than others?\"\n\n6. \"Look carefully at the pieces that moved the most. Draw and describe them: Are they big or small? What color are they?\"\n\n7. \"Now try the same thing with your other test objects (pom-poms, foam pieces, etc.). Do they move differently than the confetti?\"\n\n**How the Activity Connects to the Photograph:**\nStudents are recreating the scenario shown in the photograph—using the balloon's force to move lightweight objects—but on a smaller, controllable scale. They observe how the balloon acts as a force-maker.\n\n**What Students Should Record or Document:**\n- Drawings of confetti that moved vs. confetti that didn't move\n- Descriptions using words like \"big,\" \"small,\" \"light,\" \"heavy,\" \"fast,\" \"slow,\" \"far,\" \"close\"\n- Predictions written/drawn about which objects move easiest\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nCirculate and ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n- \"What do you notice about the pieces that moved the most?\"\n- \"Do you think the balloon is pushing or pulling the confetti?\"\n- \"Why do you think some pieces didn't move?\"\n- \"What would happen if you dropped the balloon harder? Do you want to try?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that lighter, smaller pieces move more easily than heavy objects.\n- Students recognize that closer proximity and harder force (stronger push) cause more motion.\n- Students discover that the balloon's movement creates a force that pushes nearby objects.\n- Students document observations through drawings and simple descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with pre-drawn pictures of key vocabulary\n- The photograph (still displayed)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Real balloon, confetti, and tray (for demonstration)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Invite 3-4 pairs to briefly share what they discovered. Ask:\n   - \"Which confetti pieces moved the most? Why?\"\n   - \"What did the balloon do to make things move?\"\n   - Listen for and reinforce accurate observations.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary with Demonstrations:**\n\n   - **\"Force\"** (show the balloon bouncing above confetti): \"A force is a push or a pull that makes something move or stop. Your balloon pushed the confetti!\"\n   \n   - **\"Gravity\"** (drop a piece of confetti): \"Gravity is a force that pulls things down toward the ground. That's why your confetti eventually fell down.\"\n   \n   - **\"Light\" and \"Heavy\"** (compare a pom-pom to a rock or eraser): \"Light things are easy to move with a force. Heavy things need a bigger force to move.\"\n   \n   - **\"Material\"** (point to confetti, balloon, tray): \"A material is what something is made of. Plastic, paper, rubber—these are all materials. Different materials have different properties.\"\n   \n   - **\"Properties\"** (show balloon and confetti side-by-side): \"Properties are things you can see or feel about an object—like color, size, shape, and whether it's hard or soft.\"\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - \"In this picture, the balloon is falling and bouncing. Just like your balloons, it pushes the confetti with force!\"\n   - \"The confetti is light, so even the balloon's small push makes it fly around.\"\n   - \"Gravity is also at work—pulling all those pieces down.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding Strategy:**\n   - Ask students to show thumbs up/sideways/down: \"Do you think a tennis ball would move confetti more than a balloon? Why?\"\n   - Quick partner-talk: \"Tell your neighbor: Is the balloon making a push force or a pull force?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Force** | A push or pull that makes something move. |\n| **Gravity** | The force that pulls everything down toward the ground. |\n| **Light** | Easy to move; doesn't weigh much. |\n| **Heavy** | Hard to move; weighs a lot. |\n| **Material** | What something is made of (like plastic, paper, or rubber). |\n| **Properties** | Things you can see or feel about something, like color, size, or shape. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify the balloon's action as a force (push).\n- Students understand that gravity makes things fall.\n- Students recognize that lighter materials are easier to move than heavier ones.\n- Students use new vocabulary in simple sentences with teacher support.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Inflated balloons (one per pair)\n- Variety of small test objects: foam pieces, paper clips, sequins, feathers, small beads, tissue paper scraps, chalk dust\n- Trays or paper plates\n- **Prediction & Testing Chart** (pre-drawn with columns: \"Object Name,\" \"Light or Heavy?,\" \"Will It Move?\" \"Did It Move?\" \"How Far?\")\n- Crayons/colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**\"Mystery Object Challenge\"**\n\n1. \"Now that you're experts with forces and gravity, let's test some mystery objects! I'm going to give each pair a new object you haven't tried yet.\"\n\n2. \"Before we test it, you need to predict: Is this object light or heavy? Will the balloon force make it move? How far will it go?\"\n\n3. \"Record your prediction on your chart by drawing or writing.\"\n\n4. \"Now test it with your balloon, just like before. Record what actually happened.\"\n\n5. \"Compare: Was your prediction right? What surprised you?\"\n\n6. **Real-World Connection:** \"Sometimes scientists and engineers need to know which materials are light enough to move easily. Can you think of a time when we need something light? (parachutes, balloons for parties, feathers for pillows) Can you think of a time when we need something heavy? (anchors, door stops, weights)\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Distribute one \"mystery object\" per pair.\n- Facilitate predictions before testing (this builds metacognition).\n- Ask: \"Why do you think this will/won't move?\"\n- Challenge students: \"Can you predict which object will move the farthest? Let's test all our objects and line them up by distance.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use their understanding of material properties to make predictions.\n- Students test predictions and adjust their thinking based on evidence (if their prediction was wrong).\n- Students recognize that the same force affects different materials differently.\n- Students begin to see how understanding forces and properties is useful in real life.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n- Observe student predictions and explanations during Explore (Did they consider size/weight?).\n- Listen to vocabulary use during share-out in Explain phase.\n- Review prediction vs. actual outcome in Elaborate to see if students modified their thinking.\n\n**Exit Ticket or Summative Assessment:**\n\nPrint or display these questions. Students draw or write answers:\n\n1. **\"Look at this picture of a balloon and confetti. Point to or draw where you think the force is coming from. What is pushing the confetti?\"**\n\n2. **\"If I gave you a balloon and a feather, what would happen? Draw or explain.\"**\n\n3. **\"Which object would be easier to move with a balloon force: a marble or a piece of paper? Why?\"**\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student identifies that the balloon makes things move but struggles to explain why or predict outcomes.\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student explains that the balloon pushes (force) objects and can predict that light objects move more than heavy ones.\n\n✓ **Advanced:** Student uses vocabulary like \"force,\" \"light,\" \"heavy,\" and \"gravity\" correctly; makes accurate predictions about how different materials will move; explains the connection between material properties and how forces affect them.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- **Objective 1** (Observe balloon properties): Students identify the balloon as flexible and able to create movement.\n- **Objective 2** (Investigate gravity): Students describe how objects fall and predict different speeds based on weight/size.\n- **Objective 3** (Explain forces): Students use the word \"force\" or \"push\" to describe the balloon's action.\n- **Objective 4** (Compare objects): Students predict motion outcomes based on material properties (light vs. heavy, small vs. large).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Reduce Complexity:** Provide only 2-3 confetti types to compare (e.g., tissue paper vs. plastic sequin vs. pom-pom) rather than 5-6. Focus on \"moves a lot\" vs. \"doesn't move much\" instead of comparing distances.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames:** Provide written stems for predictions and explanations:\n   - \"I think the _____ will move because it is _____.\"\n   - \"The balloon pushed the _____ and it went _____.\"\n\n3. **Paired Exploration:** Always pair with a stronger peer; allow the support student to handle/manipulate while the partner records, then swap roles.\n\n4. **Vocabulary Support:** Use picture cards with vocabulary words; pair visuals with the word throughout the lesson.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Hypothesize Variables:** \"What if you dropped the balloon from higher up? From lower? What if you bounced it harder? Gentler? Make predictions and test them.\" Create a simple data chart showing height/force and motion distance.\n\n2. **Explain Patterns:** \"Look at all your test results. Can you draw a picture that shows: Light objects move _____, Heavy objects move _____. Why do you think that is?\"\n\n3. **Real-World Problem Solving:** \"A toy company wants to make a prize that won't break when launched by an air cannon at the carnival. Which material would be best—foam, plastic, or wood? Test with your balloon and explain your choice to the class.\"\n\n4. **Reverse Prediction:** \"I'm going to describe something moving. You tell me: Was it a big force or small force? Light or heavy?\" (e.g., \"A feather blew across the room\" = small force, light object).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Build a Force Detector\"**\n   - Students create a simple force meter using a balloon, string, and a straw taped to show how hard the balloon pushes.\n   - Place a small object on a surface; use the straw to measure how close the balloon must be to move the object.\n   - Record measurements and compare which object requires the balloon closest.\n\n2. **\"Gravity Race\"**\n   - Drop various materials from the same height (paper, feather, pom-pom, bead, tissue ball) and record which falls fastest.\n   - Discuss: \"Does gravity always pull things at the same speed? Why might some things fall slower?\" (air resistance—informally introduced).\n   - Connect to the confetti in the photograph: \"Why does the confetti seem to float in the picture instead of drop straight down?\"\n\n3. **\"Balloon Scientist's Journal\"**\n   - Send home a small deflated balloon with a worksheet.\n   - Parents help inflate it and child tests everyday household objects (cotton balls, buttons, small toys, pasta pieces).\n   - Child records which moved/which didn't, draws pictures, and shares findings with the class next day.\n   - Extends learning to the home environment and builds family engagement.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure balloons are age-appropriate and not used as projectiles. Supervise carefully. Have extra balloons on hand (they pop!). Do not use balloons with children who have latex allergies—use mylar alternatives.\n- **Confetti Alternatives:** If confetti is unavailable, use torn tissue paper, small paper squares, pom-poms, foam pieces, or even breakfast cereal (cheerios, fruit loops).\n- **Timing:** The Engage phase is quick; the Explore phase may run longer if students become deeply engaged. This is productive—let curiosity drive the timing, then compress Explain slightly if needed.\n- **Photograph Revisit:** Throughout the lesson, return to the photograph. Ask: \"Remember this picture? Now you know what's happening—forces and gravity! You're scientists, just like the photographer who captured this moment.\"\n\n---\n\n**Congratulations—you're ready to teach!** This lesson builds foundational understanding of forces and material properties in a way that's concrete, engaging, and grounded in a real-world image. Students will think about balloons and gravity differently after this. 🎈",
