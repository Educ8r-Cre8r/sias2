You can see foam and bubbles where the water hits the rocks.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image shows the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of wave energy transfer and erosion. Ocean waves carry energy from wind across the water's surface. When waves hit solid objects like rocks, the water's kinetic energy is transferred upon impact, creating dramatic splashing and spray. Over time, this repeated force breaks down rock surfaces through mechanical weathering, gradually changing the shape of coastlines.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Energy Transfer:** Waves carry energy from one place to another and release it when they crash\n2. **Force and Motion:** Moving water pushes against rocks with great force\n3. **Weathering:** Water slowly breaks down rocks over long periods of time\n4. **States of Matter:** Water exists as liquid droplets and foam (tiny air bubbles in water)\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use hand motions to help students understand wave energy - have them move their arms in wave motions and then \"crash\" their hands together to show energy transfer.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to experience wave motion through kinesthetic activities like using a rope to create waves, water tables, or even making waves with a blanket.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** At the molecular level, water molecules are constantly moving and bouncing off each other. When waves crash, these tiny particles hit the rock surface millions of times, slowly wearing away microscopic pieces of mineral.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This coastal erosion is part of the larger rock cycle and ocean system. Eroded materials become sediment that travels through ocean currents, eventually forming new beaches and land formations elsewhere on Earth.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"Rocks are too hard for water to break them\"\n   **Clarification:** Water is very powerful when it moves fast and hits repeatedly over long periods of time\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"The splashing water just disappears\"\n   **Clarification:** The water falls back down into the ocean and continues moving in the wave cycle\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"Waves only happen during storms\"\n   **Clarification:** Waves happen all the time because wind is always blowing somewhere on the ocean\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** 1-PS4-1: Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that vibrating materials can make sound and that sound can make materials vibrate\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:1-PS4.A]] - Sound can make matter vibrate, and vibrating matter can make sound\n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] - Simple cause and effect relationships\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you think makes the waves move toward the rocks? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n2. How do you think these rocks might look different after many years of waves hitting them? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n3. What sounds do you think you would hear if you were standing near these crashing waves? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n4. Where does the splashing water go after it hits the rocks? (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 1)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Wave:** Moving water that carries energy from one place to another\n* **Energy:** The power to make things move or change\n* **Force:** A push or pull on something\n* **Erosion:** When water or wind slowly wears away rocks and soil\n* **Foam:** Bubbles of air mixed with water\n* **Impact:** When one thing hits another thing hard\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- Waves by Kimberly Brubaker Bradley\n- The Magic School Bus at the Waterworks by Joanna Cole\n- Water Is Water by Miranda Paul\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- \"How Do Ocean Waves Work?\" - Simple explanation of wave formation for kids: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiGNTX3dFWs\n- \"Rock Cycle Song\" - Educational song about how rocks change over time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pI_2aWwGWo",
