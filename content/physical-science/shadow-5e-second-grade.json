The uneven surface creates varied shadow patterns.\n- **Materials have different properties that affect light** — The rock material is opaque (blocks light), while grass and other surfaces interact with light differently, creating contrast between shadow and sunlit areas.\n- **Shadows change based on the position of the light source** — The direction and angle of the sunlight (visible in the shadow's placement on the ground) determine where and how the shadow appears.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\nShadow Shapes: Discovering How Light Makes Shadows\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90 minutes (two 45-minute sessions, or three 30-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-PS1-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to describe and classify different kinds of materials by their observable properties.\n  - 2-PS1-2: Analyze data obtained from testing different materials to determine which materials have the properties that are best suited for an intended purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Observe and describe how light creates shadows when it is blocked by an object.\n2. Identify materials that are opaque (block light) and transparent (let light pass through) based on their observable properties.\n3. Predict how different objects will create shadows based on their shape and size.\n4. Use evidence from investigations to explain why certain materials are better at making shadows than others.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about shadows using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the rock and its shadow (large enough for all students to see)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph prominently on the board or screen. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation before asking any questions.\n\n2. Ask students to turn and talk with a partner: \"What do you notice in this picture?\" (Accept all observations—rocks, grass, shadows, light, dark areas.)\n\n3. Guide the discussion with these specific questions:\n   - \"Where is the shadow in this picture? How do you know it's a shadow?\" (Help students identify the dark area on the ground next to and beneath the rock.)\n   - \"What made this shadow? What do you think has to happen for a shadow to appear?\" (Listen for responses about something blocking light, the sun, or darkness.)\n   - \"If this rock wasn't here, would there still be a shadow in this spot? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"Do you think all objects make shadows the same way? What might be different?\" (Probe thinking about different materials, sizes, or shapes.)\n\n4. Record student wonderings on chart paper: \"What do we want to know about shadows?\" Highlight questions about what makes shadows, why some things might make better shadows, or how to make the biggest shadow.\n\n**Transition:** \"Excellent observations! Today we're going to be shadow scientists. We're going to test different materials to see which ones make shadows and why. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate which materials block light and create shadows.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Flashlights (one per pair or small group; alternatively, use a bright window or lamp as a light source)\n- Objects made of different materials to test:\n  - Opaque objects: wooden blocks, plastic cups, metal spoons, paper, cardboard, rock or stone, rubber ball\n  - Transparent/translucent objects: clear plastic wrap, tissue paper, clear plastic cup, wax paper, clear glass\n- White paper or white poster board as a \"shadow screen\"\n- Observation recording sheets (simple template with spaces to draw or write what they observe)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Divide students into small groups (3-4 per group). Assign each group a flashlight and a set of 4-5 test objects.\n\n2. Explain the investigation: \"You're going to shine light on different objects and see what shadows they make. You'll test materials from around our classroom. Here's what you do:\n   - Hold the object in front of the light (flashlight or near the window/lamp).\n   - Look at what happens on the white paper behind the object.\n   - Does a shadow appear? What does the shadow look like?\n   - Is the shadow dark or light? Is it clear or fuzzy?\n   - Write or draw what you see on your recording sheet.\"\n\n3. Demonstrate with one object first (e.g., hold a plastic cup in front of the flashlight and show the clear shadow on the white paper). Ask: \"What do you see? Is light coming through this material, or is it blocked?\"\n\n4. Students rotate through testing each object in their group, taking turns holding objects and observing shadows. They record observations by drawing or writing whether each object made a shadow and describing it.\n\n5. Circulate among groups and ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n   - \"What's happening to the light when this object is in the way?\"\n   - \"Can you see through this material? Does light pass through it?\"\n   - \"Compare the shadow from this object to the shadow from the other one. What's different?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Monitor to ensure safe use of flashlights (no shining in eyes).\n- Ask probing questions that help students notice the difference between objects that block light (opaque) and those that let light through (transparent/translucent).\n- Encourage students to test materials multiple times and compare their results.\n- Prompt students to notice that some objects make darker, clearer shadows while others make faint or unclear shadows.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that opaque materials (wood, plastic, metal, rock) create distinct shadows.\n- Students will notice that transparent materials (clear plastic, glass) create little to no shadow or very light shadows.\n- Students will observe that translucent materials (tissue paper, wax paper) create lighter, fuzzier shadows than opaque materials.\n- Recording sheets will show drawings or descriptions of which objects made shadows and which did not.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n- The Engage photograph (displayed again)\n- Student observation recording sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Gather students together and facilitate a group share-out:\n   - Ask volunteers: \"Which objects made the darkest shadows? Why do you think that happened?\"\n   - Ask: \"Which objects made very faint shadows or no shadow at all? What was different about those materials?\"\n   - Show 2-3 observation sheets and discuss what students recorded.\n\n2. Connect back to the photograph: \"Remember the rock in our picture at the beginning? That rock is similar to some of the objects we tested today. Let's think about why. The rock blocked the sunlight, just like [show a wooden block] blocked the flashlight in our experiment. That's how the shadow appeared!\"\n\n3. Introduce and define vocabulary terms on a poster or chart:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Shadow:** A dark area or shape made when light is blocked by an object.\n   - **Light:** Brightness that helps us see; it travels in straight lines.\n   - **Opaque (OH-payk):** A material that blocks light and creates a clear, dark shadow (like wood, plastic, metal, or rock).\n   - **Transparent (trans-PAIR-ent):** A material that lets light pass through it so you can see through it, and it makes little or no shadow (like clear glass or clear plastic).\n   - **Translucent (trans-LOO-sent):** A material that lets some light through but not all of it, so you cannot see through it clearly, and it makes a light, fuzzy shadow (like tissue paper or wax paper).\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Hold up different objects and ask: \"Is this opaque, transparent, or translucent? How do you know?\"\n   - Ask: \"If I want to make a shadow, should I use an opaque or transparent material? Why?\"\n   - Show the rock photograph again and ask: \"Is the rock opaque, transparent, or translucent? How do you know from looking at the shadow?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and use the terms opaque, transparent, and translucent correctly.\n- Students understand that opaque materials block light and create shadows, while transparent materials let light through.\n- Students can explain the connection between the rock in the photograph and the objects they tested.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding to design a shadow experiment and solve a real-world problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Flashlight\n- White poster board or screen\n- 4-5 different opaque objects (plastic cup, wooden block, toy figure, book, plastic bottle)\n- Paper for recording predictions and results\n- Markers or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Present a scenario: \"Imagine you're decorating for a shadow puppet show! You need to create the biggest, clearest shadows for your audience to see. Which materials should you use? And where should you position your light?\"\n\n2. Have students work in pairs to:\n   - **Make predictions:** Choose two different opaque objects and predict which one will make a bigger or clearer shadow.\n   - **Test:** Use the flashlight to compare the shadows from both objects. Measure or describe the size of each shadow.\n   - **Record results:** Draw or write which object made the better shadow for a puppet show and why.\n\n3. Optional extension for depth: Challenge students to position objects at different distances from the light. Ask: \"Does the shadow get bigger or smaller when you move the object closer to the light? Can you make a shadow that fills up the whole paper?\"\n\n4. Have pairs share their findings with another pair or the whole group: \"Which material worked best for making a big, clear shadow? Why do you think opaque materials were better for this than transparent ones?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the shadow puppet show scenario to make the learning real-world relevant.\n- Ask students to explain their predictions before testing.\n- Encourage students to test multiple positions and objects to deepen their understanding.\n- Use student discoveries to reinforce that opaque materials are \"best suited\" for creating visible shadows—connecting to 2-PS1-2.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will apply their understanding of opaque materials to select materials for a specific purpose (shadow puppet show).\n- Students will make evidence-based predictions and test them.\n- Students will discover that object distance and position affect shadow size and clarity.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of shadows and material properties.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n   - Observe student participation during the Explore phase. Do they test objects systematically? Can they describe what they observe?\n   - Listen to explanations during the Explain phase. Do students use vocabulary correctly? Can they classify materials?\n   - Review observation recording sheets for accuracy and detail.\n\n2. **Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment:**\n   Provide each student with a simple exit ticket with these questions (use pictures if needed for early readers):\n\n   - **Question 1:** \"Draw a shadow. What made the shadow?\" (Student draws and labels or writes: light, object, shadow)\n   \n   - **Question 2:** \"Which material would be BEST for making a shadow: clear plastic, wood, or tissue paper? Circle one. Why?\" (Accept: \"Wood because it blocks all the light\" or \"Wood is opaque\")\n   \n   - **Question 3:** \"Can light pass through a transparent material? Circle: YES or NO\" (Correct answer: YES)\n\n3. **Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n   - Student correctly identifies a shadow and explains that something is blocking light.\n   - Student selects an opaque material and provides a reason related to light blocking.\n   - Student correctly answers whether light passes through transparent materials.\n   - Student uses at least one vocabulary term (opaque, transparent, shadow, light) correctly in writing or speech.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show that students understand shadows are made when light is blocked.\n- Students can classify materials as opaque (blocks light) or transparent (light passes through).\n- Students connect their observations from the Explore phase to their answers.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary with visual supports:** Before the Explain phase, show students real objects and their shadows. Label \"opaque\" on the object and \"shadow\" on the dark area. Repeat with 2-3 familiar items so students build background knowledge.\n\n2. **Provide a word bank for exit tickets:** Offer simple words like \"opaque,\" \"shadow,\" and \"light\" for students to reference and copy. Allow drawing responses with labeled pictures instead of writing.\n\n3. **Reduce the number of test objects in Explore:** Assign each group only 2-3 objects instead of 4-5. This prevents cognitive overload and allows more focused observation. Pair each student with a stronger partner or provide adult support during investigations.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate shadow properties in depth:** Challenge students to explore shadow characteristics like sharpness, color gradients, and blur. Ask: \"Why is the edge of some shadows sharp and others fuzzy? What happens if you move the object very far from the light?\" Have students create labeled diagrams showing their discoveries.\n\n2. **Test mixed-material objects:** Provide objects that are partially opaque and partially transparent (e.g., a clear plastic cup with a plastic bottom, a picture frame with glass). Ask students to predict and then test: \"Will this make a shadow? What part of the shadow will be dark, and what part will be light?\"\n\n3. **Design a shadow engineering challenge:** Ask students to use opaque materials to create a specific shadow shape (e.g., \"Can you arrange blocks to make a shadow that looks like the letter T?\"). This applies understanding of how object shape affects shadow shape.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Shadow Art Gallery:** Have students create shadow pictures by arranging opaque objects on white paper and tracing their shadows with markers. Display the artwork with labels explaining which objects are opaque and why they cast shadows. Students can give a gallery walk and compare shadow shapes created by different classmates.\n\n2. **Time-Lapse Shadow Observation (outdoor activity):** On a sunny day, have students trace the shadow of a stick or their own body outline on the ground with chalk at three different times (morning, noon, afternoon). Students observe and record how shadows change throughout the day due to the sun's changing position. This naturally extends understanding of light direction and shadow movement.\n\n3. **Shadow Puppet Show Performance:** Students use opaque toys, figures, or paper cutouts with a flashlight to create a simple shadow puppet story. They write a short script and perform for another class. This applies their understanding that opaque materials create shadows while entertaining peers—making science authentic and fun.\n\n---",
