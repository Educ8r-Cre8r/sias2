ENGAGE (10-12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about pushes and pulls using the power line photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph of power lines\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** and ask students to look carefully at what they see. Point out the tall wooden pole and the wires hanging from it.\n\n2. **Ask these focus questions to spark wonder:**\n   - \"What do you notice about those wires? Are they straight or droopy?\"\n   - \"Why do you think those wires don't fall down to the ground?\"\n   - \"Do you see those little birds? What is holding them up?\"\n   - \"What do you think is pulling the wires? What do you think is pushing the pole?\"\n\n3. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"Think about how a rope moves when someone pulls it really hard versus pulling it gently. Do you think the wires in the picture are being pulled hard or gently? Why?\"\n\n4. **Accept all responses** and validate student thinking. Write a few predictions on chart paper.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Let's do our own experiment with pushes and pulls to find out how they change the way things move and stay in place.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate pushes and pulls through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Toy cars or blocks (one per pair of students)\n- Yarn or string (one length per pair)\n- Chart paper or large paper for each pair\n- Tape\n- Simple picture cards showing \"strong push,\" \"gentle push,\" \"strong pull,\" \"gentle pull\" (drawn by teacher in advance)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Pushes and Pulls with Toy Cars (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Pair students up.** Give each pair a toy car and a large sheet of paper taped to the table.\n\n2. **Demonstrate first:** Show students how to push a car gently across the paper, then push it hard. Ask: \"Did it move the same way both times?\"\n\n3. **Student instructions:**\n   - \"Take turns. One person will give the car a gentle push. Watch how far it goes. Mark where it stops with a crayon.\"\n   - \"Now give it a strong push. Mark where this one stops.\"\n   - \"Which push made the car go farther?\"\n\n4. **Repeat with pulling:** Tie a short piece of yarn to the car. Have students take turns pulling it gently and then pulling it hard. Record observations on the paper.\n\n5. **Observation prompt:** \"Did the strong pull move the car more than the gentle pull? How do you know?\"\n\n**Part B: Creating Tension Like the Power Lines (8-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Tape a long piece of yarn loosely across a table or between two chairs at students' eye level.**\n\n2. **Ask:** \"This yarn is like the power lines. What happens when we don't pull it tight?\" (It sags.)\n\n3. **Have student volunteers very carefully pull the yarn tighter.** Ask: \"What happened? Does it look more like the power lines now?\"\n\n4. **Student task:** Each pair gets a piece of string. Have them hold each end and try pulling it in different ways:\n   - Pull gently (loose, droopy)\n   - Pull harder (straighter, more like the power lines)\n\n5. **Discuss:** \"What did the stronger pull do to the string? Did it look more like the tight power lines or the droopy ones?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each pair, asking guiding questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Which push was stronger?\" \"How did the pull change the string?\"\n- Do not tell students the answers; let them discover through observation.\n- Ensure safety—no pulling too hard or toward faces.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe and record that stronger pushes make objects move farther.\n- Students will observe that stronger pulls make strings/yarn straighter and more tense.\n- Students will begin to make the connection between force and motion/position.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect discoveries to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of power lines (displayed again)\n- Index cards with vocabulary words and simple illustrations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students for group discussion.** Ask 3-4 volunteers to share what they discovered:\n   - \"Who found that a stronger push makes something move farther?\"\n   - \"Who found that pulling the string tighter made it less droopy?\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with demonstrations:**\n\n   - **PUSH:** Using your hand, push a block across the table. \"A push is when we move something away from us. It makes things go.\"\n   \n   - **PULL:** Using a string, pull the block toward you. \"A pull is when we move something toward us. It can also make things move.\"\n   \n   - **FORCE:** \"A push or a pull is called a force. A force is something that makes things move or stop.\"\n   \n   - **STRONG** and **GENTLE:** \"Some pushes and pulls are strong and powerful. Some are gentle and soft. They change how things move.\"\n   \n   - **TIGHT:** Point back to the photograph. \"The power line wires are tight because they are being pulled hard. That keeps them from falling down.\"\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Do you remember the power lines? Why don't they fall down?\"\n   - \"Something is pulling those wires really hard and tight. That pull is strong, just like when you gave the car a strong push.\"\n   - \"The pole has to be strong too because it's being pushed down by the weight of the wires. It has to stay in place.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"If I push this block gently, will it go far or not far?\" (not far)\n   - \"If I pull this string really hard, will it be droopy or tight?\" (tight)\n   - \"Is a push the same as a pull?\" (No, one is away and one is toward.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Push** | To move something away from you by using force. |\n| **Pull** | To move something toward you by using force. |\n| **Force** | A push or pull that makes things move or change. |\n| **Strong** | A push or pull with a lot of power; it moves things a lot. |\n| **Gentle** | A push or pull that is soft and light; it doesn't move things as much. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand the difference between a push and a pull.\n- Students recognize that strength of force affects how far or how much something moves.\n- Students can identify pushes and pulls in the power line photograph and their daily lives.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply push and pull concepts to a new, real-world scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Paper cups (one per student)\n- Small objects to push (erasers, blocks, tokens)\n- Pictures of 3-4 real-world scenarios: child on a swing, door opening, bucket being carried, book sliding across a desk\n- Chart with drawings of each scenario\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present real-world scenarios.** Show pictures of:\n   - A child pushing to go higher on a swing\n   - Someone pulling open a door\n   - A child pulling a wagon\n   - Someone pushing a toy car\n\n2. **Group task:** For each picture, ask:\n   - \"Is this a push or a pull?\"\n   - \"How do you know?\"\n   - \"Is it a strong push/pull or a gentle push/pull?\"\n\n3. **Design challenge (simplified for kindergarten):**\n   - Give each student a paper cup and a small erasable object.\n   - **Task:** \"Use a push or a pull to move the eraser into the cup. You can push it with your finger or pull it with a string. Try both ways. Which way works better for getting it in the cup?\"\n   - Students experiment and share discoveries.\n\n4. **Discussion:**\n   - \"Did anyone use a push? Did anyone use a pull?\"\n   - \"Which was easier for getting the eraser in the cup?\"\n   - \"What would happen if you pushed super gently? Would it make it?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion without giving away the \"right\" answer.\n- Encourage students to try both methods and compare.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"What else could you move with a push? With a pull?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply push and pull vocabulary to new situations.\n- Students recognize that different scenarios may require different types of forces.\n- Students understand that problem-solving can involve choosing the right push or pull.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pushes, pulls, and how they affect motion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Do they demonstrate stronger and gentler pushes/pulls?\n- Listen to vocabulary use during Explain phase: Can they name a push vs. a pull?\n- Note responses during discussions: Are students making connections to the power line photo?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Session 2):**\n\nAdminister this assessment using a combination of methods suited to kindergarten:\n\n1. **Show & Tell with Objects:**\n   - Give each student a small toy and ask: \"Show me how you would push this. Now show me how you would pull it.\"\n   - Observe: Do they perform pushes away from their body and pulls toward their body?\n\n2. **Picture Sort Activity:**\n   - Show 4 pictures (child pushing a swing, pulling a rope, pushing a book, pulling a toy).\n   - Ask: \"Is this a push or a pull?\" Students can point, nod, or say the answer.\n   - Success: Student correctly identifies at least 3 out of 4.\n\n3. **Verbal Response:**\n   - \"I'm going to describe something. You tell me if it's a push or a pull.\"\n     - \"Kicking a ball.\" (Push)\n     - \"Opening a drawer.\" (Pull)\n     - \"Pressing a button.\" (Push)\n     - \"Dragging a toy on a string.\" (Pull)\n   - Success: Student identifies at least 3 out of 4 correctly.\n\n4. **Application Question:**\n   - Point to the power line photograph again. \"Why do the wires stay tight and not fall down?\"\n   - Expected answer (in their own words): \"Something is pulling them hard\" or \"A strong pull keeps them up.\"\n   - Success: Student recognizes that a strong force (pull) keeps the wires in place.\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n- ✓ Student can identify and perform a push (moving object away) and a pull (moving object toward).\n- ✓ Student recognizes that stronger pushes/pulls move objects more than gentle ones.\n- ✓ Student connects the concept to the power line photograph or other real-world examples.\n- ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary word (push, pull, force) correctly in context.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most kindergarteners will successfully identify pushes vs. pulls through demonstration.\n- Students will recognize that force strength affects motion.\n- Students will begin connecting abstract concepts to real-world objects like the power lines.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on \"push\" and \"pull\" only; introduce \"strong\" and \"gentle\" in a follow-up lesson. Use consistent gestures (hand moving away for push, hand moving toward for pull) to reinforce meaning.\n\n2. **Provide hand-over-hand modeling:** If a student struggles to perform a push vs. pull, gently guide their hand through the motion while narrating: \"We push away... now we pull toward us.\"\n\n3. **Use repetition and familiar objects:** Let these students work longer with one object (like a toy car) with the same partner, practicing pushes and pulls repeatedly before adding the complexity of \"strong vs. gentle.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Introduce directional vocabulary:** Ask advanced students to describe the direction of pushes and pulls: \"Did you push it forward or backward? Did you pull it from the side?\" Encourage them to predict motion before testing.\n\n2. **Design a structure using pushes and pulls:** Challenge students to build a simple ramp and use pushes to make a car roll down it. Ask: \"How can you change your push to make it go faster or slower?\"\n\n3. **Connect to more complex systems:** Show a picture of a door with both a push and pull handle. Ask: \"Why might both be useful? What would happen if it only had a push?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Push and Pull Hunt Around the Classroom:**\n   - Take students on a \"push and pull scavenger hunt\" around the classroom and school (with supervision).\n   - Have them identify and label objects that require pushes (buttons, light switches, door hinges to close) and pulls (drawer handles, door handles, zippers).\n   - Create a class chart: \"Things We Push\" and \"Things We Pull.\"\n\n2. **Force and Motion Obstacle Course:**\n   - Set up a simple indoor obstacle course (pushed materials, not a hazard) where students must push or pull toys through different stations.\n   - Example: push a ball through a hoop, pull a toy across tape lines, push blocks into a bin.\n   - Ask at each station: \"Are you using a push or a pull? Is it strong or gentle?\"\n\n3. **Power Lines Dramatic Play:**\n   - In the classroom dramatic play area, set up \"power lines\" using yarn between two low structures.\n   - Let students \"be the force\" that keeps the lines tight (by holding the ends) or add small toy birds.\n   - Discuss: \"What happens to the power lines when we pull harder? When we let go?\"\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
