Electricity flows through conductive wires and must travel long distances efficiently.\n- **Properties of Materials:** The photograph shows different materials with different properties — conductive metal wires that allow electricity to flow, insulating materials that prevent electricity from escaping, and wooden poles that support the infrastructure.\n- **Force and Support Structures:** The wooden pole must support the weight of heavy wires, transformers, and other equipment. Gravity pulls these objects downward, and the pole's structure must be strong enough to resist this downward force.\n- **Energy Conversion and Distribution:** Electrical energy is generated elsewhere and transformed/distributed through this infrastructure to power human activities and technology.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Wires, Weights, and What Makes Electricity Flow: Exploring the Power Behind Power Lines**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 50-minute sessions (100 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-PS1-3: Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties\n  - 5-PS2-1: Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify and classify materials in the power line system based on their observable properties (conductive vs. non-conductive, flexible vs. rigid, lightweight vs. heavy).\n2. Make measurements and observations to explain how gravity pulls downward on the wires and equipment, and how the pole structure supports this weight.\n3. Construct an argument using evidence from the photograph that different materials are chosen for different parts of the power line system based on what they need to do.\n4. Design a model demonstrating how a structure can support heavy objects against the downward force of gravity.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the power pole and lines.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the power line photograph (large enough for all students to see clearly)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image of the power pole with lines, transformers, and birds perched on the wires. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without speaking.\n\n2. **Opening Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Name as many different things as you can spot.\"\n   - \"Which parts of this power pole look like they are made of the same material? Which parts look different?\"\n   - \"Why do you think some parts are thick and some are thin? Some are smooth and some are rough?\"\n   - \"Notice the birds sitting on the wire — are they in danger? What does that tell us about the wire they're sitting on?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \n   - \"I'm wondering: How does this tall pole hold up all of those heavy wires and metal equipment without breaking? What does the pole need to be like to do this job?\"\n\n4. **Record Initial Thoughts:** Ask students to jot down 2-3 observations and one question they have about the materials or how the power pole works.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be material scientists and structural engineers. We'll figure out which materials work best for different parts of a power line system, and we'll understand how gravity affects all the heavy things hanging from that pole.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate material properties and gravitational forces through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Per student pair: ruler, string (approximately 30 cm), tape, small paper cup, pennies or washers\n- Per group: samples of materials: copper wire (or coated wire), rubber tubing, wooden stick, aluminum foil, plastic wrap, leather strap\n- Scale or balance (classroom available)\n- Plastic dowels or wooden rods (to simulate a pole structure)\n- Building materials: blocks, books, or modeling clay\n- Student recording sheets (provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Material Properties Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set Up Stations:** Divide students into pairs. Provide each pair with samples of the different materials (wire, rubber, wood, aluminum, plastic, leather).\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Examine each material carefully. For each one, record:\"\n     - Is it flexible or rigid? (Can you bend it easily?)\n     - Is it heavy or light? (Does it feel dense?)\n     - Does it conduct electricity? (We'll use a simple test: try to identify which ones are shiny metals that could carry electricity)\"\n     - Where might you find this material on a real power pole?\n   - Create a chart in your notebook: **Material | Flexible? | Heavy? | Conducts Electricity? | Where on Power Pole?**\n\n3. **Teacher Role:** Circulate and ask follow-up questions:\n   - \"Why do you think copper makes a good wire?\"\n   - \"Why would rubber be wrapped around the wire?\"\n   - \"Why does the pole need to be strong and heavy?\"\n\n**Part B: Gravity and Support Structures (10 minutes)**\n\n4. **Introduce the Support Challenge:**\n   - Show students the wooden dowel or stick. Explain: \"This represents the power pole. The pole has to hold up all the heavy wires and equipment. Gravity is pulling everything downward.\"\n\n5. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Build a support structure around the dowel using blocks or books to represent how the pole keeps things from falling down.\"\n   - Hang a small cup from the dowel using string and tape. Add pennies one at a time into the cup to simulate the weight of wires and equipment.\n   - \"Observe: As you add weight, what happens to the dowel? Does your support structure help keep it from bending?\"\n   - Record: How much weight could your structure hold before bending? Did the pole bend down toward the ground?\n\n6. **Teacher Role:** \n   - Ask: \"Where is the cup being pulled? Why?\" (Downward, gravity.)\n   - \"What would happen without the pole — what would the weight do?\" (Fall straight down.)\n   - Encourage students to redesign their structure to hold more weight.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify that metal wires conduct electricity and are flexible enough to span distances.\n- Students recognize that rubber and plastic insulate and protect.\n- Students understand that wood is rigid and strong enough to support weight.\n- Students observe that gravity pulls downward and the pole structure prevents collapse.\n- Students can describe the relationship between material properties and function.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration; connect to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected photograph of power line\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms\n- Student notebooks\n- Annotated diagram of power pole (teacher-prepared or displayed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (6 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 pairs to briefly share their findings about material properties.\n   - Ask: \"Which materials did you identify as conductors? Which as insulators? How did you decide?\"\n   - Have students who built support structures explain their designs.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   Present these terms with student-friendly definitions and examples from the power line system:\n\n   - **Conductor:** A material that lets electricity flow through it easily. *Example: Copper wires carry electricity from place to place.*\n   \n   - **Insulator:** A material that does NOT let electricity flow through it. It protects people from electrical shock. *Example: Rubber coating around wires keeps the electricity inside.*\n   \n   - **Gravity:** The force that pulls all objects downward toward Earth. *Example: Gravity pulls the heavy transformer and wires down on the power pole.*\n   \n   - **Structural Support:** The parts of a structure designed to hold up weight and prevent collapse. *Example: The wooden pole is the structural support that keeps everything from falling.*\n   \n   - **Load:** The weight that a structure must support. *Example: The wires, transformer, and equipment are the \"load\" on the power pole.*\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Display the power line photograph again.\n   - Point to different parts and ask:\n     - \"What material is the main pole? Why do you think they chose wood or concrete?\"\n     - \"Can you see the copper wires? Why are they shiny? Why do they need to conduct electricity?\"\n     - \"Do you see the insulation around any wires? How is it different from the bare metal?\"\n     - \"What is pulling all of these things downward? How does the pole fight against gravity?\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Quick pair-share: \"Turn to your neighbor and explain: Why do you think electricity travels through copper wire and not through rubber?\"\n   - Call on volunteers to share their explanations.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (displayed on chart paper):**\n- **Conductor** — lets electricity flow through\n- **Insulator** — stops electricity from flowing\n- **Gravity** — force pulling objects downward\n- **Structural Support** — parts that hold up weight\n- **Load** — the weight a structure must hold\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary correctly to describe materials and forces.\n- Students explain the relationship between material properties and function in the power line system.\n- Students understand that gravity pulls downward and structures resist this force.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing a functional power line system model.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Per group: cardboard tube or wooden dowel (pole), copper wire or aluminum foil strips, rubber bands, tape, small weights (washers or pennies), string, index cards\n- Paper, colored pencils\n- Optional: PVC pipe or PVC connectors for more advanced designs\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the Design Challenge:**\n   - \"Your group is now a power company engineering team. You must design a safe, sturdy power pole that can:\"\n     - Support at least 500 grams (a water bottle) of weight\n     - Have exposed conductive wire (copper) that carries electricity\n     - Have insulated/protected parts so electricity doesn't escape\n     - Show how gravity pulls the load downward and the pole resists\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Design and build a model power pole structure using the materials provided.\"\n   - \"Include: (a) a rigid support pole, (b) at least one conductive material (wire or foil) representing electrical lines, (c) insulation (tape or rubber bands) around some wires, (d) a test of how much weight it can hold.\"\n   - \"Create a labeled diagram on paper showing the materials you used and explaining why you chose each one.\"\n   - \"Write a brief explanation: 'How does gravity affect the wires and equipment on your power pole? How does your pole resist this downward force?'\"\n\n3. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate and ask guiding questions:\n     - \"What would happen to your wires without the pole?\"\n     - \"Which direction is gravity pulling on your load?\"\n     - \"Is your conductor protected by insulation?\"\n   - Encourage students to test and redesign if their structure fails.\n\n4. **Gallery Walk (Optional):**\n   - Display finished models and diagrams.\n   - Allow students 3-4 minutes to view other designs and note successful features.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design a functional model demonstrating understanding of material properties and gravity.\n- Students create labeled diagrams explaining their design choices.\n- Students write evidence-based explanations connecting gravity, structural support, and material properties.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of material properties, gravitational force, and structural design.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation of student participation during Explore phase: Do students correctly identify conductors vs. insulators?\n- Quality of student drawings and annotations during Explain phase.\n- Effectiveness of model designs in Elaborate phase: Does the structure hold the load? Are materials appropriately selected?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide students with this written assessment at the end of Session 2:\n\n---\n\n**Power Pole Knowledge Check**\n\n1. **Material Properties:** Look at the photograph of the power pole again. Name two materials you see and explain why each one is good for its job on the power pole. (Example: \"Copper wire is good because it conducts electricity and is flexible...\")\n\n2. **Gravity and Support:** Draw a simple diagram showing:\n   - The power pole\n   - Heavy equipment hanging from the pole\n   - An arrow showing which direction gravity pulls\n   - An explanation of how the pole prevents collapse\n\n3. **Design Thinking:** If you were asked to build a power pole for a town, what three properties would you require in the material you chose for the main pole structure? Explain why.\n\n4. **Reflection:** What was the most interesting thing you learned about how power lines work or how gravity affects structures?\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- **Excellent (4):** Student correctly identifies at least two materials with accurate, detailed explanations of why they're suitable. Diagram clearly shows gravity pulling downward and includes a reasonable explanation of structural support. Design criteria are realistic and well-justified.\n\n- **Proficient (3):** Student identifies two materials with adequate explanations. Diagram shows gravity and pole support with minor gaps in clarity. Design criteria are mostly appropriate.\n\n- **Developing (2):** Student identifies materials but explanations are incomplete or partially incorrect. Diagram shows effort but lacks clarity about gravity or support mechanisms. Design criteria need more detail.\n\n- **Beginning (1):** Student struggles to identify materials or explain their function. Diagram is unclear or missing key elements. Limited understanding evident in design criteria.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that specific materials are chosen for specific functions based on their properties.\n- Students explain gravitational force and how structures resist it.\n- Students connect observations from the photograph to scientific concepts and vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Graphic Organizer:** Provide a pre-made chart with material names and checkboxes for properties (Flexible? Heavy? Conducts electricity?) so students focus on observation rather than organizing information.\n\n2. **Simplified Model Challenge:** Reduce the load requirement to 200 grams and provide pre-cut, pre-assembled materials. Students focus on material identification and gravity effects rather than complex construction.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Exit Ticket:** Offer sentence starters such as:\n   - \"Copper wire is good for power lines because it can ___.\"\n   - \"Gravity pulls the heavy equipment ___ and the pole ___ by resisting this force.\"\n   - \"I would choose [material] for the pole because it is ___.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Real-World Problem:** Have students research actual power pole materials used in your region and explain why those specific materials were chosen. Are there environmental or cost considerations?\n\n2. **Load Testing Graph:** Challenge students to systematically add weights to their model in 50-gram increments and graph the load vs. structural deformation. Calculate the maximum load their pole can support and predict failure point.\n\n3. **Multi-Level System Design:** Ask students to design a power pole system that serves multiple purposes: carries electricity AND water pipes AND telephone lines. How would material selection change? How would gravity affect each component differently?\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Historical Power Pole Investigation:** Provide students with historical photographs showing how power poles have changed over time (wooden poles in early 1900s, concrete poles, modern designs). Students research and present on how material science advances changed power infrastructure.\n\n2. **Gravity and Bridge Design:** Connect to structural engineering by having students research how different bridge designs (suspension, cable-stayed, arch) resist gravity. Compare the engineering principles to power pole design.\n\n3. **Home Energy Audit:** Students trace the path of electricity from the power pole outside their home to the outlets inside. They create a diagram labeling conductors, insulators, and structural supports, and explain how gravity affects the entire system from pole to home.\n\n---",
