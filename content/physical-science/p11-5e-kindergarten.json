Observe and describe how arches in buildings help support weight using pushes and pulls.\n2. Investigate how different types of pushes and pulls affect whether a simple structure stays up or falls down.\n3. Design and test a simple arch or bridge structure using classroom materials.\n4. Explain in their own words why arches help buildings stay strong.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the arches (or displayed on whiteboard/projector)\n- Optional: short video clip (30 seconds) of a building or bridge (silent, showing structures)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** large enough for all students to see clearly. Point to the curved metal arches prominently.\n\n2. **Ask these Kindergarten-friendly discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about these big metal curves? What shape are they?\" (Elicit: curved, arches, loops)\n   - \"Do you think those arches are pushing or pulling? What might they be holding up?\" (Let students gesture and hypothesize)\n   - \"Have you ever seen something curved before? What was it?\" (Elicit: bridges, rainbow, slide, doorway)\n   - \"If I push this (hold up object), what might happen? If the arch pushes back, what does that do?\" (Activate prior knowledge of pushes)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... what would happen to this building if the arches weren't there? Would it still stand up strong?\"\n\n4. **Transition sentence:** \"Let's find out how pushes and pulls help keep buildings from falling down by building our own arches!\"\n\n**Transition:** Bridge to Explore phase.\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small paper plates (or card stock circles), 5–6 per pair of students\n- Small foam blocks or small paper boxes (e.g., sugar cubes, small tissue boxes), 20–30 per pair\n- Tape (painter's tape or masking tape preferred for easy removal)\n- Plastic cups or small containers to hold or stack materials\n- Optional: blocks of wood or dominoes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Free Exploration (10 minutes)**\n1. Distribute materials to pairs or small groups.\n2. **Student directions (read aloud and demonstrate):**\n   - \"Today, we're going to build arches just like the ones we saw! Try stacking your blocks in a straight line.\"\n   - \"Now, try carefully placing your plate (or card) on top as a bridge. What happens?\"\n   - \"Now let's curve the plate into an arch shape. Tape the ends to your blocks. Is your arch stronger?\"\n   - \"Gently push down on the middle of your straight bridge. Does it bend or break?\"\n   - \"Gently push down on your curved arch. What happens? Does it feel stronger?\"\n\n3. **What to record:** Have students (or you) sketch or photograph their two structures (straight vs. curved) on a simple sheet or use a teacher-made chart with pictures of both.\n\n**Part 2: Testing Pushes (10 minutes)**\n4. **Next challenge:** \"Now let's see how much weight our arches can hold! Let's carefully place blocks on top, one at a time.\"\n   - Straight bridge: count how many blocks before it bends/breaks\n   - Curved arch: count how many blocks before it bends/breaks\n\n5. **Record results** on a simple chart using drawings or tally marks (e.g., \"Straight = 3 blocks, Curved = 7 blocks\").\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What's happening? Is it staying up? Why do you think that?\"\n- Don't give answers—guide them to observe and test.\n- Help with tape and demonstrate gentle pushing; ensure safety (no excessive force).\n- Prompt: \"Show me with your hand—is that a big push or a small push?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that curved arches support more weight than straight plates.\n- Students will notice that the direction and strength of the push affects the outcome.\n- Some students will begin to say things like, \"The arch is stronger!\" or \"It doesn't break.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Whiteboard or chart paper\n- Markers\n- Student drawings/photos from Explore phase (optional, to display)\n- One large book or heavy object to demonstrate\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 pairs to show their structures and share: \"What did you build? What happened when you pushed?\"\n   - Listen for language like \"it stayed up,\" \"it didn't break,\" \"it was strong.\"\n\n2. **Teacher-led explanation (8 minutes):**\n   - Hold up the photograph again. Point to the arches.\n   - Say: \"You know what? Real buildings use arches just like you made! The arch is a special shape. When you push down on it, it doesn't break—it pushes the weight down and out to the sides, kind of like how the weight spreads out.\"\n   - **Demonstrate with your hands:** Curve your hands into an arch shape, then press gently. Show how the force spreads.\n   - **Connect to the building photo:** \"These metal arches are helping this whole building stay strong. Every time something is on top—like people walking or rain—the arch pushes back and keeps the building safe.\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Write and say each word clearly. Use simple sentences.\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Can everyone show me an arch with your hands?\" (Observe and gently correct.)\n   - Ask: \"Does an arch make things stronger or weaker?\" (Listen for \"stronger.\")\n   - Ask: \"Which structure held more blocks—the straight one or the curved arch?\" (Elicit correct answer.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Arch:** A curved shape that is very strong and can hold heavy things without breaking.\n- **Push:** A force that moves something away from you or makes it go down.\n- **Structure:** A building or thing made of parts stuck together (like a house, bridge, or arch).\n- **Strong:** Able to hold up without breaking; not easy to break.\n- **Support:** To hold something up and keep it from falling.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can describe an arch as a curved, strong shape.\n- Students can explain that pushing down on an arch doesn't break it like it would break a straight piece.\n- Students understand that buildings use arches to stay strong.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- String or yarn (optional)\n- More foam blocks or paper cups\n- Index cards or construction paper\n- Tape\n- Optional: picture cards of real arches (bridges, doorways, tunnel entrances—printed from internet search \"famous arches\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge 1: Build a Bigger Arch (for all students, 10 minutes)**\n- \"Now you're going to be architects! Build the biggest, strongest arch you can. Make it wider, taller, or more curved. Then test it—how many blocks can it hold?\"\n- Students rebuild and retest structures from Explore phase, trying to improve the design.\n- Prompt: \"Does making the curve bigger or smaller help? Why?\"\n\n**Challenge 2: Arch Relay or Real-World Connection (5-10 minutes)**\n- **Show picture cards** of real arches: stone bridges, tunnel entrances, decorative arches in parks, doorways.\n- Ask: \"Where do you see arches in your town or neighborhood? Has anyone walked under an arch?\"\n- Invite 2-3 students to share.\n- Say: \"Architects and builders use arches everywhere because they learned—just like you did—that arches are super strong!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the building challenge; ask guiding questions: \"What if you make the curve sharper? What if you use more blocks under it?\"\n- Display picture cards and talk through them together.\n- Celebrate when students' arches hold more blocks than before: \"You improved your design!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students redesign and test structures, demonstrating deeper understanding.\n- Students can identify arches in photographs of real buildings.\n- Students express understanding that arches are useful in the real world.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing):**\n- Observe student responses during the Explore phase: Did they test the straight vs. curved structures? Did they attempt to add weight?\n- Listen for vocabulary use during group share-out: Do students use words like \"arch,\" \"push,\" \"strong,\" \"support\"?\n- Check hand gestures during \"show me an arch\" prompt.\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket or Quick Quiz (5 minutes):**\n\nChoose ONE of the following, administered individually or in small groups:\n\n**Option A: Picture Sort**\n- Show three simple pictures: (1) a curved arch holding blocks, (2) a straight beam holding blocks, (3) a bridge with an arch.\n- Ask: \"Point to the arch. Which one is strongest? Why?\"\n- Success: Student points to the arch and gives a simple reason (\"It doesn't break,\" \"It's strong,\" \"It holds more blocks\").\n\n**Option B: Demonstration**\n- Give each student a plate and small blocks.\n- Ask: \"Can you show me how to make a strong arch?\"\n- Observe: Can they curve the plate and stabilize it? Do they attempt to place blocks on it?\n- Success: Student makes a curved shape and places at least one block without it falling immediately.\n\n**Option C: Verbal Prompt (for small groups)**\n- Ask: \"Tell me about your arch. What did it do? How was it stronger than the straight one?\"\n- Success: Student uses 2-3 key words (arch, push, strong, blocks, hold) and describes an observation from their test.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student can identify or build an arch.\n- Student explains (in simple words) that arches are strong and don't break easily.\n- Student references pushing, blocks, or the building from the photograph.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students will correctly identify an arch.\n- 70%+ of students will explain that arches are stronger than straight beams.\n- 60%+ of students will use at least two vocabulary terms (arch, push, strong, support).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Pair with a strong peer** during Explore and Elaborate phases. Assign the peer as the \"builder\" and the struggling student as the \"tester\" or \"counter\" of blocks.\n\n2. **Pre-model the straight vs. curved test** at a whole-group level before students try independently. Use very exaggerated curvature so the difference is obvious.\n\n3. **Reduce material complexity:** Use only foam blocks and paper plates—no additional variables. Simplify the exit ticket to a picture sort rather than a verbal explanation.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Introduce load testing:** Ask, \"Can you build an arch that holds 15 blocks? 20? What's the maximum?\" Have them keep a tally chart and predict before each trial.\n\n2. **Explore multiple arch types:** Provide drinking straws, popsicle sticks, or string. Ask, \"Can you make an arch in a different way? Will it still be strong?\"\n\n3. **Design for a purpose:** \"Design an arch strong enough to hold this book (bridge for toys/vehicles). Then, redesign it to be strong AND pretty. Can you do both?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Arch Hunt Around School:** Take students on a short walk around the building or playground to find real arches (doorways, gym entrances, playground equipment, decorative features). Have them draw or photograph arches they find and create a class \"Arch Book.\"\n\n2. **Arch Art + Science:** Students paint or decorate paper plate arches, then test them for strength. Discuss: \"Does painting it make it weaker? Why or why not?\" (Introduces variable control.)\n\n3. **Story/Role-Play: Arch Engineers:** Set up a \"construction company\" in dramatic play. Students take turns as architects (designing arches on paper) and builders (constructing them), while others are \"clients\" requesting buildings. Integrate language: \"We need a strong arch for our library!\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety reminder:** Supervise tape use. Ensure blocks/materials don't fall on feet. Use gentle pushing only.\n- **Pacing:** If students are deeply engaged in Explore, the lesson can extend to 2 sessions. Don't rush the hands-on phase—this is where real learning happens.\n- **Connection to photograph:** Refer back to the photograph at each phase. This grounds the lesson in the real world and helps students see science in their environment.\n- **Prior knowledge:** Many Kindergarteners may not have formal experience with forces/pushes/pulls. Activate and build on what they know (they've pushed toys, felt rain push things, seen doors open/close). This lesson builds that foundational knowledge.",
