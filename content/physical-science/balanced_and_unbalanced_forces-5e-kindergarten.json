ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about pushes, pulls, and how big machines move heavy things.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Digital projector or interactive whiteboard to display photograph\n  - Printed copies of the photograph (optional, one per student)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Display the photograph** on the interactive board or projector. Ask students to sit where they can see it clearly.\n\n  2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n     - \"What do you see happening in this picture? What is the big machine doing?\"\n     - \"Do you see the bucket on the front of the machine? What do you think it's doing—is it pushing or pulling? How do you know?\"\n     - \"Look at the pile of dirt and rocks on the right side. How do you think the machine moved all that dirt there?\"\n     - \"Have you ever seen a big truck or digger like this before? What were they doing?\"\n\n  3. **Prediction prompt:** \"If we had a toy digger, what do you think we could move with it? Could we move dirt? Could we move a big rock? Could we move our classroom?\"\n\n  4. **Ask students to act it out:** Have 2-3 volunteers stand and pretend to be the excavator's bucket—\"Show me with your arms how the bucket pushes down into the dirt! Now show me how it pulls the dirt up!\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to do some digging and pushing and pulling of our own, just like that big machine. We're going to discover how pushes and pulls make things move!\"\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate pushes and pulls through hands-on exploration with classroom materials.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Small plastic toy trucks (1 per 2-3 students)\n  - Classroom blocks, plastic cups, lightweight objects (pencils, erasers, small boxes)\n  - Sandbox or tray of kinetic sand (or dried beans/rice in a shallow bin if sand unavailable)\n  - Child-safe plastic shovels, spoons, or craft sticks\n  - Masking tape to mark starting and finish lines on the floor\n  - Simple recording sheet (see below) with drawings of pushing and pulling\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Station 1: Push and Pull Race (15 minutes)**\n  1. Divide students into small groups (3-4 per group).\n  2. Set up a \"construction site\" with a masking tape line on the floor 5 feet away.\n  3. Place plastic blocks or small objects on one side of the line.\n  4. Give each group a toy truck.\n  5. **Student directions (simplified for Kindergarten):**\n     - \"Use your truck to PUSH the blocks across the line.\"\n     - \"Now TRY to PULL the blocks with your truck. What happens?\"\n     - \"Push the truck hard. Push it soft. Which move makes it go faster?\"\n     - \"Pull the truck in different directions. Does it go different ways?\"\n  6. Have students take turns being the \"construction worker\" while others observe and clap for effort.\n\n  **Station 2: Digging Station (10 minutes; rotate groups)**\n  1. Set up a shallow tray or sandbox with kinetic sand.\n  2. Place lightweight objects (plastic cups, spoons) in the sand.\n  3. **Student directions:**\n     - \"Use the shovel to DIG and PUSH the sand around.\"\n     - \"Use the shovel to PULL the sand toward you.\"\n     - \"Make a pile just like in the picture!\"\n     - \"What's easier—pushing or pulling the sand?\"\n\n- **What students should record:**\n  - Teacher circulates with a simple two-column picture sheet: one side shows a stick figure PUSHING, the other shows PULLING.\n  - Students draw or point to which action made their truck/sand move the way they wanted.\n  - Teacher scribes their observations: \"Maya discovered that pushing her truck FAST made it go really far!\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate between stations and ask open-ended questions: \"What happened when you pushed that block? What's different when you pull?\"\n  - Do NOT say \"Yes, that's right\" or provide answers—instead, ask students to describe what THEY observe: \"Tell me what you see happening.\"\n  - Encourage safe exploration and ensure students take turns.\n  - Prompt students to compare: \"Is this push the same as your first push, or different?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students discover that pushing makes things move away from them.\n  - Students discover that pulling makes things move toward them.\n  - Students notice that harder pushes/pulls move things faster or farther.\n  - Students begin to connect their exploration to the excavator in the photograph.\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and help students make sense of what they discovered.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Same photograph displayed on projector\n  - Chart paper or whiteboard\n  - Picture cards showing push and pull (printed or hand-drawn)\n  - Real object to demonstrate (toy truck or block)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Gather students in a circle.** Ask them to share one discovery from their exploration: \"What did you find out about pushing? What did you find out about pulling?\"\n  \n  2. **Create a simple class chart** (teacher draws as students watch):\n     - **Left column: PUSH** (draw an arrow pushing away, simple stick figure pushing a block away)\n     - **Right column: PULL** (draw an arrow pulling toward, simple stick figure pulling a block toward them)\n  \n  3. **Introduce vocabulary** (use these EXACT student-friendly words):\n     - **PUSH:** \"When you use force to move something AWAY from you. Like pushing a toy truck across the floor.\"\n     - **PULL:** \"When you use force to move something TOWARD you. Like pulling a toy truck back to you.\"\n     - **FORCE:** \"When you push or pull on something to make it move. A strong force makes things move a lot. A soft force makes things move a little.\"\n     - **MOTION:** \"When something moves or changes position. Pushes and pulls create motion.\"\n     - **DIRECTION:** \"The way something moves—forward, backward, left, right, up, or down.\"\n\n  4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n     - Point to the excavator's bucket. \"Look at this bucket. Is it pushing the dirt, or pulling the dirt? How do you know?\"\n     - Point to the grapple on the right. \"This is PULLING the big rocks. See how it grabs and pulls them up?\"\n     - \"The machine uses STRONG pushes and pulls because the dirt and rocks are VERY HEAVY.\"\n\n  5. **Check for understanding:**\n     - Ask: \"When I push this block (demonstrate), does it move TOWARD me or AWAY from me?\" (Away!)\n     - Ask: \"Show me with your arms: are you pushing or pulling when you bring something to your body?\" (Pulling!)\n     - Ask: \"What would happen if we pushed the block HARDER?\" (It would go faster/farther!)\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Push:** A force that moves something away from you\n  - **Pull:** A force that moves something toward you\n  - **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move\n  - **Motion:** When something moves from one place to another\n  - **Direction:** The way something moves (left, right, up, down, forward, backward)\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students can identify pushing and pulling in the photograph and in real life.\n  - Students understand that pushes and pulls create motion.\n  - Students recognize that direction matters (pushing makes things go away; pulling makes things come toward you).\n  - Students can use the words \"push,\" \"pull,\" and \"force\" in simple sentences.\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by solving a real design problem using pushes and pulls.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Small plastic containers or \"loads\" (lightweight boxes, plastic baskets)\n  - Classroom blocks, masking tape\n  - Craft sticks, string, paper cups, cardboard tubes\n  - Toy trucks or rolling objects\n  - Obstacle course setup area\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Design Challenge: Build a \"Construction Path\"**\n\n  1. **Present the problem:** \"The construction workers need to move supplies from one side of the yard to the other, but there are obstacles in the way! We need to design a path using PUSHES and PULLS to get the supplies across safely.\"\n\n  2. **Set up an obstacle course** with:\n     - Blocks arranged in a simple path (not a maze—keep it simple for Kindergarten)\n     - A \"starting dock\" and \"ending dock\" marked with tape\n     - Several small \"loads\" (containers with 2-3 lightweight objects) to move\n\n  3. **Student task:**\n     - Working in small groups, students use toy trucks to push/pull their \"load\" from the start to the finish.\n     - They must avoid knocking over the block obstacles (encourage them to choose GENTLE pushes or pulls).\n     - After completing the course, students redesign the path to make it EASIER or HARDER.\n\n  4. **Reflection questions (asked after completion):**\n     - \"Did you push or pull your truck? Why did you choose that?\"\n     - \"Was your push strong or soft? What happened?\"\n     - \"How could we make this easier for the next workers?\"\n     - \"What if we made the path HARDER? What would we need to do?\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Facilitate movement through the obstacle course.\n  - Ask students to predict before attempting: \"Do you think a soft push or a hard push will get your truck through safely?\"\n  - Encourage students to try different directions and forces.\n  - Provide specific praise: \"I saw you use a GENTLE push to avoid the blocks! That took control.\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students apply their understanding of pushes and pulls to solve a practical problem.\n  - Students discover that controlling the STRENGTH of a push or pull helps them succeed.\n  - Students make decisions about when to push, when to pull, and how much force to use.\n  - Students understand that there are multiple ways to solve a problem using forces.\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Determine if students met the learning objectives through observation and simple assessment tasks.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n  - **Observation checklist** (teacher notes during Explore and Elaborate):\n    - ☐ Student identifies a push in the photograph or classroom activity\n    - ☐ Student identifies a pull in the photograph or classroom activity\n    - ☐ Student demonstrates understanding that pushes/pulls create motion\n    - ☐ Student compares different strengths of pushes/pulls\n    - ☐ Student uses directional language (away, toward, up, down)\n\n  **Exit Ticket (Simple, picture-based):**\n  \n  Show students three images (drawn by teacher or printed):\n  1. A child pushing a ball away\n  2. A child pulling a rope toward them\n  3. A child standing still next to a ball\n  \n  **Ask:** \"Point to the picture where someone is PUSHING. Point to the picture where someone is PULLING.\"\n  \n  **Follow-up:** \"If I push this truck (demonstrate a gentle push), will it go FAST or SLOW? Why?\"\n\n  **Summative Assessment (end of Lesson 2):**\n  \n  One-on-one teacher check-in with each student (takes 1-2 minutes):\n  - **Question 1:** \"Show me how you would PUSH the block across the floor.\" (Watch for pushing motion away from body.)\n  - **Question 2:** \"Show me how you would PULL the block back to you.\" (Watch for pulling motion toward body.)\n  - **Question 3:** \"Is the excavator in the picture pushing or pulling the dirt? How do you know?\" (Accept any answer with an explanation.)\n\n- **Success Criteria:**\n  - ✓ Student can demonstrate a push and explain that it moves something AWAY.\n  - ✓ Student can demonstrate a pull and explain that it moves something TOWARD them.\n  - ✓ Student recognizes at least one push or pull in the photograph.\n  - ✓ Student understands that stronger pushes/pulls move things more than softer ones.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students show evidence of understanding pushes and pulls through physical demonstration.\n  - Students can use the words \"push\" and \"pull\" correctly in context.\n  - Students transfer their learning from classroom exploration to the real-world excavator in the photograph.\n  - Most students (80%+) demonstrate basic understanding of how pushes and pulls create motion and direction.\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (for struggling learners):**\n  1. **Pair students with strong models:** Have students work alongside a peer who is demonstrating clear understanding of pushes and pulls during Explore and Elaborate phases. The peer serves as a visual model.\n  2. **Simplify vocabulary:** Focus only on \"PUSH\" and \"PULL\" initially. Introduce \"force,\" \"motion,\" and \"direction\" after students show confidence with the first two terms.\n  3. **Use single-focus stations:** Rather than offering multiple options, assign struggling students to ONE activity (e.g., toy truck station only) so they can build deeper understanding in one context before transferring to others.\n  4. **Provide tactile cues:** Use physical hand-over-hand guidance to show pushing motion (away) and pulling motion (toward) if students cannot replicate the motions independently.\n\n- **Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n  1. **Explore combined forces:** Introduce the idea of pushing AND pulling at the same time. \"What if you pushed the truck AND your friend pulled it? What happens?\" Introduce the concept that multiple forces working together create different results.\n  2. **Increase obstacle complexity:** Create a more intricate obstacle course with multiple turns, ramps (simple cardboard), and varied surfaces (smooth tile vs. carpet) so students observe how the SAME push produces DIFFERENT motion on different surfaces.\n  3. **Introduce speed and distance:** Ask advanced learners to compare and measure: \"Push the truck soft, medium, and hard. Which push makes it go the FARTHEST? Can you mark where each one stops?\" (Use tape to mark distances; begin pre-measuring skills.)\n  4. **Design their own construction challenge:** Ask advanced students to create their own obstacle course for peers to navigate, encouraging them to think about how PUSHES and PULLS can solve design problems.\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Home Excavator Hunt:** Send home a simple worksheet showing six household items (door, toy box, skateboard, ball, book, chair). Students work with a family member to identify which items they would PUSH to move and which they would PULL to move. They draw or check boxes. Return to class and create a classroom chart of \"Things We Push\" and \"Things We Pull\" to reinforce vocabulary and show transfer to home environment.\n\n2. **Excavator Role-Play Center:** Set up a dramatic play area where students act as construction workers operating an imaginary excavator. Provide props like cardboard tubes (hydraulic arms), plastic buckets, a sandbox or kinetic sand, and small toy \"loads.\" Students take turns operating the \"excavator\" to dig, push, and pull loads. Teacher or peers can direct them: \"Push that pile to the left!\" \"Pull the bucket up higher!\" This develops motor skills and reinforces directional language.\n\n3. **Heavy Machines Photo Study:** Display photographs of other heavy machines (bulldozer, crane, dump truck, backhoe) alongside the original excavator. In small groups, students analyze each machine using the sentence frame: \"This machine uses a _____ [PUSH/PULL] to move _____.\" Have students draw or point to the pushing/pulling parts. Extend understanding to multiple contexts and machines.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson is designed to be concrete and kinesthetic—Kindergarteners learn through DOING, not just talking. Prioritize hands-on exploration.\n- The photograph of the real excavator is powerful because students see a GIANT machine doing what they just did with their toys, making the connection between scale and power tangible.\n- Repeat vocabulary many times in different contexts throughout both lessons; Kindergarten students need 10+ exposures to new words.\n- Keep exit tickets and assessments very simple—use demonstration and pointing rather than written responses.\n- If students have experienced real construction sites or heavy machines, invite them to share personal connections during Engage and Explain phases.",
