ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the jumping athlete.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on projector or large screen\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image of the student jumping over the orange cone. Ask students to observe silently for 15 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice the student's body doing in this picture? Describe the position of their arms and legs.\"\n   - \"What force do you think is pushing or pulling on this jumper? Is it pushing them up or pulling them down?\"\n   - \"If gravity always pulls things down, why is this student in the air? What must be stronger—gravity or something else?\"\n   - \"Where do you think the energy to jump comes from? What did this student eat that helps them jump?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \n   \"If we all tried to jump, would we all jump the same height? Why or why not? What could we change about how we jump to jump higher?\"\n\n4. **Record Student Ideas:** Write predictions and questions on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become scientists and investigate what makes jumping possible—and we'll discover the secret forces that are at work!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate forces and motion through hands-on jumping experiments and data collection.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Measuring tape or meter stick (1 per group)\n- Chalk or masking tape to mark floor\n- Orange cones or paper markers (optional)\n- Graph paper or data recording sheet (printed)\n- Stopwatch or classroom timer\n- Jumping space (gymnasium, cafeteria, or large classroom)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Measuring Jump Height (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into pairs or small groups** of 3-4. Each group rotates through stations or takes turns at a central jumping area.\n\n2. **Establish a baseline:** Have each student stand with one arm raised straight up. Mark the highest point they can reach while standing still on a wall or board with chalk. Record this as their \"reach height.\"\n\n3. **The Jump:** Students squat down deeply, swing their arms, and jump. A partner marks the wall at the highest point the jumping student's fingers reach.\n\n4. **Calculate jump height:** Subtract reach height from jump height. Record the difference (this is the actual height jumped).\n\n5. **Repeat three times:** Each student completes three jumps. Partners record all measurements on a data sheet.\n\n6. **Observations during jumping:**\n   - What body parts do students use to jump? (legs, arms, core)\n   - What happens to their body right before takeoff? (crouch lower = more potential energy)\n   - What happens when they land? (gravity pulls them back down)\n\n**Part B: Force Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n7. **Demonstrate downward force:** Drop a tennis ball from waist height and ask: \"What pulled the ball down?\" (Gravity/Earth's pull)\n\n8. **Ask students:** \"When you jump, you leave the ground. Does gravity disappear? Or is gravity still pulling on you, just weaker than the push from your legs?\" Have students discuss with their partner.\n\n9. **Document observations:** Students record on their data sheet: \"When I jumped, gravity was still pulling me _____ (down/up), which is why I came back down.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups and ask probing questions: \"Why did your second jump measure differently than your first?\" \"What did you notice your legs doing?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answers; guide them to discover through observation.\n- Help groups accurately measure and record data.\n- Ensure safe jumping practices (clear space, appropriate footwear, soft landing surfaces).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students collect three jump measurements per person.\n- Students observe that gravity pulls them back down after jumping.\n- Students notice that deeper squats or bigger arm swings seem to produce higher jumps.\n- Students discover variation in their own jump heights across three trials.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific explanations of forces and energy after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with data compiled from all student jumps\n- Vocabulary cards with images\n- Simple force diagram (printed or drawn)\n- Energy pathway poster (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out from Explore Phase:**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their jump measurements. Create a class chart showing all heights.\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover about how to jump higher?\"\n   - Record responses: deeper squat, stronger push with legs, arm swing, etc.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary and Concepts:**\n\n   **Gravity (or Gravitational Force):** \n   \"The invisible pulling force from Earth that pulls all objects downward. It's like Earth is always saying 'Come back down here!' Even when you jump, gravity is still pulling on you.\"\n   \n   **Force:** \n   \"A push or pull that makes something move, change direction, or change speed. When you push with your legs to jump, that's a force.\"\n   \n   **Balanced and Unbalanced Forces:** \n   \"When forces pushing on an object are equal, nothing moves—that's balanced. When one force is stronger than another, the object moves—that's unbalanced. Your leg muscles create an unbalanced force stronger than gravity, so you jump UP.\"\n   \n   **Energy:** \n   \"The ability to do work or make things move. When you eat food, your body stores energy. Your muscles use that energy to make your body move.\"\n   \n   **Kinetic Energy:** \n   \"The energy of movement. When you jump and move through the air, your body has kinetic energy. The faster you move, the more kinetic energy you have.\"\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Point to the jumper's feet leaving the ground. \"At this moment, what forces are acting on this student? The legs are pushing DOWN on the ground (action), and the ground pushes UP on the student (reaction)—that upward force is stronger than gravity right now.\"\n   - Point to the student in mid-air. \"Now gravity is pulling DOWN, but the student's momentum is carrying them UP. Eventually, gravity wins and pulls them back down.\"\n\n4. **Energy Connection:**\n   - \"This student ate breakfast (or lunch). Their food contained energy from the sun—plants captured sunlight and made food. That energy is now in their muscles. When they jump, that food energy becomes movement energy. Incredible!\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"Is gravity pushing or pulling?\" (pulling)\n   - \"When you jump, which force is stronger for a moment—your leg muscles or gravity?\" (leg muscles)\n   - \"After you leave the ground, which force wins—gravity or your legs?\" (gravity)\n   - \"Where did the energy to jump come from?\" (food)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Gravity:** The invisible force that pulls objects toward Earth (downward).\n- **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or change how it's moving.\n- **Balanced Forces:** Forces that are equal and opposite, so nothing moves.\n- **Unbalanced Forces:** Forces that are not equal, causing an object to move or change motion.\n- **Kinetic Energy:** The energy of a moving object.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that gravity always pulls downward.\n- Students can explain that jumping requires an upward force greater than gravity.\n- Students make the connection between food energy and jumping motion.\n- Students use vocabulary correctly in sentences (gravity, force, energy).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing and testing variations in jumping techniques.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Jumping space (same as Explore)\n- Measuring tape\n- Data recording sheets (new copies)\n- Chart with different jump styles listed\n- Optional: cones or obstacles to jump over\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Jump Style Comparison Experiment:**\n\n1. **Introduce variables:** Explain that scientists change one thing at a time to see what happens. Today, students will test how CHANGING THEIR JUMPING TECHNIQUE changes the result.\n\n2. **Assign each group a jump style variation to test:**\n   - **Jump Style 1:** Tiny squat (barely bending knees) + no arm swing = minimal force applied\n   - **Jump Style 2:** Normal squat + normal arm swing = typical jump\n   - **Jump Style 3:** Deep squat + big arm swing + explosive push = maximum force applied\n   - **Jump Style 4:** Jump without bending legs (stand straight and jump) = different technique\n\n3. **Test Protocol:**\n   - Each student in the group performs their assigned jump style THREE times.\n   - Partners measure and record jump height for each trial.\n   - Compare results: Which style produced the highest jump? Why?\n\n4. **Discussion:**\n   - \"Which style required the most effort?\" (Deep squat + big swing)\n   - \"Did effort relate to jump height?\" (Yes—more effort = stronger force = higher jump)\n   - \"Why does a deeper squat help?\" (Your muscles build up more force; you push against gravity for longer)\n   - \"If gravity is pulling down with the same strength every time, what changed?\" (The upward force from the legs changed)\n\n5. **Real-World Application:**\n   - \"Athletes like basketball players and high jumpers use a deep squat and big arm swing. Why would they do this?\" (To generate maximum upward force to overcome gravity and jump highest)\n   - \"Could you jump higher on the moon where gravity is weaker?\" (Yes, but we don't have to worry about that!)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate safe jumping and accurate measurements.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What changed between this jump and the last one?\" \"Do you think deeper squats give your legs more time to push?\"\n- Help students recognize the relationship between force applied and height achieved.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students test multiple jump styles and collect comparative data.\n- Students observe that greater force (deeper squat + arm swing) results in higher jumps.\n- Students explain WHY techniques work: more force pushes harder against gravity.\n- Students think about real-world applications (sports, athletics).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of gravitational force, forces and motion, and energy conversion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- During Explore: Observe student discussions and data collection—do they recognize gravity pulling them down? Do they notice differences in their jumps?\n- During Explain: Check responses to vocabulary questions—can students explain gravity, force, and energy?\n- During Elaborate: Can students predict which technique will jump highest before testing? Do they explain their reasoning?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket containing the following questions (adjust wording for clarity):\n\n1. **\"In this picture [show the original jumping photograph], the student's feet are not touching the ground. Explain: Is gravity still pulling on the student? How do you know?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student states \"yes, gravity is still pulling down\" and provides evidence (student comes back to ground, gravity is always pulling, etc.).\n\n2. **\"Compare two jumps: Jumper A does a tiny squat and barely pushes. Jumper B does a deep squat and pushes hard. Which jumper will jump higher? Why?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student identifies Jumper B, explains that a deeper squat and harder push create a stronger upward force that better overcomes gravity.\n\n3. **\"Where does the energy come from that allows you to jump? Trace it back as far as you can.\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student mentions food → energy in muscles → movement, or ideally: sun → food (plants) → student's body → jumping energy.\n\n4. **\"Draw a simple picture of yourself jumping. Label the forces acting on you at the moment your feet leave the ground. (Label: upward leg force and downward gravity force.)\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student shows both upward and downward arrows/forces, indicates upward force is stronger at takeoff moment.\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- Students can identify gravity as the downward pulling force.\n- Students explain that jumping requires an upward force greater than gravity.\n- Students recognize gravity continues to act even during flight.\n- Students connect food energy to jumping motion.\n- Students can predict how changing technique affects jump height and justify their prediction.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show students understand gravitational force and its constant downward direction.\n- Students can explain force imbalances and motion relationships.\n- Students connect energy conversion to human movement.\n- Most students successfully complete all four exit ticket items accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Support:** Provide a vocabulary poster with pictures (drawing of Earth pulling down = gravity; drawing of person pushing up = force). Students can point to pictures to answer questions instead of using words alone.\n\n2. **Measuring Assistance:** Pair struggling students with a strong peer or provide a pre-marked wall where students can clearly see the marks. Allow use of meter sticks without converting to centimeters—just record \"5 marks high\" if that's clearer.\n\n3. **Reduced Exit Ticket Questions:** Provide only 2-3 exit ticket questions instead of 4. For the drawing question, provide a pre-drawn figure and ask students only to draw and label arrows showing forces (up and down), not create the entire image.\n\n4. **Concrete Force Demonstrations:** Before abstract discussions, have students practice with physical objects: Drop a ball to SEE gravity; have students push against each other's hands to FEEL force. Concrete experiences support abstract thinking.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Comparative Data Analysis:** Ask advanced students to graph all class jump data by gender, by height of student, or by other variables. Can they see patterns? Do taller students jump higher? Why might that be? (Longer legs = more muscle mass)\n\n2. **Moon Gravity Investigation:** Provide information that the moon's gravity is 1/6 of Earth's. Ask: \"If you jumped 24 inches high on Earth, how high might you jump on the moon?\" Have them calculate and explain reasoning. (They should recognize with less downward force, the same upward force would achieve greater height.)\n\n3. **Olympic Athlete Research:** Ask advanced students to research how high Olympic high jumpers or basketball players can jump. Have them hypothesize why professional athletes jump so much higher than fifth graders (stronger muscles, more efficient technique, years of training). They can present findings to the class.\n\n4. **Energy Pathway Deep Dive:** Challenge students to trace energy flow in greater detail: Sun → plant makes food (photosynthesis) → student eats plant/meat from animal that ate plants → chemical energy in student's body → mitochondria in muscle cells breaks down glucose → ATP energy → muscle contraction → kinetic energy of jumping. Create a detailed diagram or flowchart.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Standing Broad Jump Challenge:** In addition to vertical jumping, have students practice and measure long jumps (jumping forward as far as possible). Compare which type of jump requires more effort. Investigate how the direction of force (upward vs. forward) affects the type of jump. Create a class leaderboard for standing broad jump records.\n\n2. **Jump Height Across Different Surfaces:** Test jumping on different surfaces: gym mat, tile floor, grass, sand. Does the surface change jump height? Why? (Softer surfaces absorb more energy; students should discover that firm, non-bouncy surfaces allow for higher jumps. This introduces the concept of energy transfer and surface properties.)\n\n3. **Slow-Motion Video Analysis:** If available, film students jumping using a smartphone or tablet in slow-motion mode (120 fps or higher). Play back and ask students to identify the phases: (1) preparation (squat), (2) takeoff (push), (3) flight (in air), (4) landing (gravity brings down). At which moment is the upward force greatest? When is gravity in control? Create a labeled diagram from the video stills.\n\n4. **Design a Better Jumper:** Challenge students to design a jumping apparatus (using craft materials, rubber bands, springs, etc.) that demonstrates the principles of force and gravity. Their device should store energy and release it to \"jump.\" Students test and refine their designs, explaining how forces work in their invention.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson plan deeply engages fifth graders in understanding gravitational force, forces and motion, and energy conversion through their own bodies' movements. The photograph serves as an authentic hook, and the hands-on jumping experiments ensure students discover concepts rather than simply memorize facts. All NGSS standards are directly addressed through observation, measurement, and reasoning.",
