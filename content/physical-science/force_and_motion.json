In the background, other children and adults watch the activity take place in an outdoor school setting. This image shows how our bodies can move through space when we apply force to push off the ground.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** *A person jumping over an obstacle and landing safely*\n\nThis happens because the child pushes down hard against the ground with their legs (applying force), which makes their body move upward into the air. Gravity then pulls them back down toward Earth. The child's muscles create the force needed to overcome gravity temporarily. The jumping motion demonstrates how **force causes changes in motion**—the child goes from standing still to moving upward very quickly, then slows down and comes back down. This is a perfect example of Newton's First Law: objects in motion stay in motion (and objects at rest stay at rest) unless a force acts on them.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Force:** A push or pull that makes things move, stop, or change direction. In this photo, the child's leg muscles push down on the ground, creating an upward force.\n\n* **Motion:** A change in position or location. The child moves from the ground upward into the air and then back down again.\n\n* **Gravity:** An invisible force that pulls objects toward Earth. It's what brings the jumping child back down to the ground.\n\n* **Balance and Control:** Using body awareness to stay steady while moving. The child's outstretched arms help maintain balance in the air.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nKindergarteners learn best through direct, physical experience. Rather than only showing this image, have children actually jump, hop, and skip themselves. Let them feel the force they create with their own legs and experience gravity pulling them back down. This embodied learning is far more powerful than passive observation for this age group.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Some children may benefit from slow-motion video of jumping to see the motion more clearly. Use visual supports like picture cards showing the sequence: \"push legs down → jump up → come back down.\" **Multiple Means of Action/Expression:** Allow children to demonstrate their understanding through movement (jumping, hopping) rather than requiring verbal or written responses.

    "firstgrade": "# Force and Motion: A First Grade Science Lesson\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nA child wearing a red shirt and khaki pants is jumping high in the air over an orange cone during an outdoor activity. Other children watch from the background. The child's feet are off the ground, showing how their body moved upward through the air.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** A child jumping and temporarily leaving the ground.\n\n**Why This Happens:** When the child's muscles push down hard against the ground, the ground pushes back up with equal force. This upward push is stronger than the pull of gravity for a moment, so the child's body moves upward into the air. Once the child stops pushing and is in the air, gravity pulls them back down to the ground. This demonstrates the fundamental principle that **forces cause objects to move**, and that balanced and unbalanced forces determine motion.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Force is a push or pull.** The child's leg muscles push against the ground to make the jump happen.\n\n* **Motion is when something changes position or location.** The child moves upward into the air, showing motion caused by force.\n\n* **Gravity always pulls objects downward.** Even though the child jumps up, gravity will eventually bring them back to the ground.\n\n* **Objects need a force to start moving, stop moving, or change direction.** The child's muscles provide the force needed to jump; gravity provides the force that brings them down.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFirst graders learn best through direct experience. Rather than only discussing the concept, allow students to jump themselves and observe their classmates. Ask them to notice what their legs do before jumping and what happens when they land. This kinesthetic connection helps cement understanding of force and motion in developmentally appropriate ways.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple means of engagement: Some students may prefer jumping, while others might roll a ball, push a toy car, or throw a beanbag to explore forces. Offer choice in how students demonstrate their understanding of jumping—through movement, drawing, dictation, or simple writing. For students with mobility differences, jumping can be replaced with other movements like arm reaches, spinning in a chair, or pushing objects across a table.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** \nK-PS2-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that vibrations make sound and that vibrations can make other objects move.\n*(Note: While this PE focuses on sound, the broader K-PS2 standard addresses forces and motion fundamentals.)*\n\n**Disciplinary Core Idea:**\n[[NGSS:DCI:K-PS2.A]] | Objects can be moved in a variety of ways, such as pushing, pulling, and by releasing or throwing them.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] | The child's leg muscles cause a force that results in the motion of jumping.\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] | Students can observe patterns in jumping motion across multiple trials.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What did the child's legs do to make their body jump up?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why does the child come back down to the ground instead of floating in the air?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If the child pushed their legs even harder, what do you think would happen to their jump?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n4. **How is jumping different from running?

Have students jump over and around obstacles while you observe how they adjust their force and motion. Ask: \"How did you change your jump to go over the tall cone?\"\n\n2. **Compare Different Movements:** Have students explore different ways to move (walking, running, hopping on one foot, crawling, rolling). Discuss which movements require the most force and why. Create a class chart showing \"Pushes We Use\" for each movement.\n\n3. **Force Exploration Station:** Provide various objects (balls, blocks, toy cars, bean bags) and let students push, pull, and throw them.

Other students and adults are visible in the background, watching the activity take place.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** A student jumping and becoming temporarily airborne.\n\n**Why This Happens (Scientific Explanation):** When the student pushes hard against the ground with their legs, they apply a **force** that propels their body upward. Once their feet leave the ground, **gravity** (an invisible force pulling things downward) gradually slows them down and brings them back to Earth. This demonstrates the relationship between force, motion, and gravity—core concepts in understanding how objects move.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Force:** A push or pull that causes something to move, stop, or change direction. In this case, the student's leg muscles push against the ground.\n\n2. **Motion:** The act of moving from one place to another. The jumping action shows motion in an upward direction, then downward.\n\n3. **Gravity:** An invisible force that pulls objects toward Earth. It affects the student's ability to jump and determines when they land.\n\n4. **Speed and Direction:** The student moves upward quickly (speed), demonstrating that forces have both magnitude and direction.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nHelp students understand force and motion by using the language of \"pushes and pulls.\" Ask them to identify which muscles are pushing during a jump.

Other students can be seen in the background watching the activity take place on a grassy area near a school building.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** A person jumping into the air and landing back on the ground.\n\n**Why It's Happening:** When the student pushes down hard with their legs against the ground, that force pushes them upward into the air. Gravity is a force that pulls everything toward Earth, so once the student leaves the ground, gravity pulls them back down. The student must use muscular force to overcome gravity to jump, and then gravity brings them safely back to the ground. This is a perfect example of how forces cause changes in motion.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Force:** A push or pull that can make something move, stop, or change direction.

    "fourthgrade": "# Force and Motion: Jump Over the Cone\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nA student in a red shirt is jumping over an orange cone on a grassy field, demonstrating how forces act on their body to make it move. The athlete's legs are bent and lifted high, showing the upward push needed to leave the ground. Other students and spectators watch in the background, indicating this is a school athletic activity or field day event.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** *Why can a person jump into the air and then come back down?*\n\nThis image captures the fundamental interaction between **forces and motion**. When the student pushes their legs down against the ground with force, the ground pushes back with an equal and opposite force (Newton's Third Law). This upward force is greater than the student's weight, causing them to accelerate upward into the air. Once airborne, gravity pulls the student downward, bringing them back to the ground. The student's muscles generated the initial force, demonstrating how living things use energy to create motion.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Force:** A push or pull that can change how something moves. In jumping, the student's leg muscles push down on the ground.\n\n* **Motion:** A change in position or place. The student moves upward through the air and then downward back to the ground.\n\n* **Gravity:** An invisible force that pulls objects toward Earth. Gravity is what brings the student back down after jumping.\n\n* **Newton's Third Law of Motion:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The student pushes down on the ground; the ground pushes up on the student with equal force.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching force and motion with this image, have students first *feel* forces on their own bodies before explaining them abstractly. Ask students to push against a wall and feel the wall push back, or jump and feel gravity pull them down. Concrete, kinesthetic experiences help Fourth Graders internalize these invisible concepts.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Representation:** Use slow-motion video of jumping to help students see the stages of motion more clearly. Provide labeled diagrams showing forces as arrows (push down, push up, gravity pulling down) so visual learners can see force directions.\n\n**Action & Expression:** Allow students to demonstrate their understanding by creating their own jumping sequences, drawing force diagrams, or building simple lever systems rather than relying only on written responses.\n\n**Engagement:** Connect jumping to real-world contexts students care about—sports, dance, playground games—to make the concept personally relevant.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n4-PS3-3: Ask questions and predict outcomes about the changes in energy when objects collide, objects are pushed or pulled over a distance, and/or objects are dropped to make work easier. *(Forces and Motion)*\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n* [[NGSS:DCI:4-PS2.A]] *Forces and Motion* – Objects are pushed or pulled by forces, and forces can change the direction or speed of an object's motion.\n* [[NGSS:DCI:4-PS2.B]] *Types of Interactions* – Electric and magnetic forces between a two objects act even when the objects are not in contact; contact forces, such as frictional force, act only when objects are touching.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] – The student's leg muscles (cause) produce a push force that creates upward motion (effect).\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]] – The student's chemical energy from food is converted into mechanical energy (motion) during the jump.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What forces are acting on the student while they are in the air?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why does the student come back down to the ground instead of staying in the air?** (Bloom's: Explain | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If the student jumped on the Moon instead of Earth, how would the jump be different, and why?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **How could the student jump even higher, and what force would need to change?** (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Force:** A push or pull that can make something start moving, stop moving, or change direction.\n\n* **Gravity:** An invisible force that pulls things toward Earth and keeps us from floating away.\n\n* **Motion:** The act of moving from one place to another.\n\n* **Push:** A force that moves something away from you.\n\n* **Newton's Third Law:** The rule that says when one thing pushes on another, the other thing pushes back just as hard.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Jump Height Challenge:** Have students jump while you measure how high they jump using a meter stick or tape on a wall. Then ask them to predict how their jump height would change if they bent their knees more before jumping, jumped with one leg, or swung their arms. Test predictions and measure again. This connects to force (more bend = more push force) and motion (different forces = different heights).\n\n2. **Force Detective Walk:** Take the class on a \"force walk\" around the school playground. Students identify and sketch examples of forces in action—pushing on swings, friction on the slide, gravity pulling the ball down. Have them label each force as a push, pull, or gravity, and explain how it changes motion.\n\n3. **Design a Better Jump:** Provide students with simple materials (foam blocks, boxes, ramps) and ask them to design a landing zone that would help them jump safely over obstacles. Challenge them to explain how their design works using force and motion vocabulary. This connects physics to engineering and safety.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *Push and Pull* by Lola M.

    "fifthgrade": "# Force and Motion: Jump Over the Cone\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a student in mid-air, jumping over an orange cone during an outdoor athletic activity. The student's body is in a dynamic jumping position, demonstrating the motion created when muscles push against the ground with force. Other students and spectators can be seen in the background, indicating this is part of an organized physical activity or competition.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** *How does a person jump into the air and land safely?*\n\nThis photograph captures the moment when a student applies a large downward force through their leg muscles to push against the ground. According to Newton's Third Law of Motion, when the student pushes down on Earth with force, Earth pushes back up on the student with an equal force. This upward force is greater than the pull of gravity for a brief moment, causing the student to accelerate upward and become airborne. The student's mass, muscle strength, and the speed of the push all affect how high they jump and how long they stay in the air before gravity pulls them back down.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Force and Motion:** A force is a push or pull that causes an object to start moving, stop moving, or change direction. The student's leg muscles apply a large force downward, which creates the jumping motion.\n\n* **Newton's Third Law of Motion:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The student pushes down on the ground; the ground pushes up on the student with equal force.\n\n* **Gravity:** This invisible force pulls all objects toward Earth. As the student rises into the air, gravity continuously pulls them back downward, ending the jump.\n\n* **Acceleration:** The student's velocity (speed and direction) changes rapidly during takeoff due to the net force acting on them. This change in velocity is called acceleration.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nStudents often struggle to visualize forces that aren't visible. Use slow-motion video replays of jumps to help fifth graders \"see\" the acceleration phase. Have them observe how the student's body position changes from crouched to extended—this visible change helps them understand the invisible forces at work.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple means of engagement by offering choice in how students demonstrate understanding: kinesthetic learners can perform and measure their own jumps, visual learners can create force diagrams or annotated photos, and verbal learners can explain jumping mechanics to peers. Use a force scale or pressure mat (if available) to give quantitative feedback that appeals to different learning preferences.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n5-PS2-1: Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-PS2.A]] *Forces and Motion:* An object is pushed or pulled by a force, which can have a magnitude and direction. The direction and magnitude of forces on an object determine the changes that will occur.\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-PS2.B]] *Types of Interactions:* Objects in contact exert forces on each other (friction, normal forces). Some forces act at a distance (gravitational, magnetic, and electrostatic forces).\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] The student's muscle force causes motion; gravity causes the student to return to the ground.\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]] The jumping system includes the student's muscles, bones, the ground, and gravity all working together.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What forces are acting on the student while they are in the air?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **Why does the student come back down to the ground after jumping?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 1)\n\n3. **How would the student's jump be different on the Moon, where gravity is weaker than on Earth?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **What changes would the student need to make to jump higher—more force, less force, or the same amount of force?** (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move, stop, or change direction.\n* **Gravity:** An invisible force that pulls objects downward toward Earth.\n* **Acceleration:** A change in how fast something is moving or the direction it is moving.\n* **Motion:** A change in position; the act of moving from one place to another.\n* **Newton's Third Law:** The rule that says for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Jump Height Challenge:** Have students perform standing broad jumps and measure the horizontal distance. Then have them perform vertical jumps and measure how high they can reach on a wall. Students can graph their results and compare jump distances across the class, exploring how leg strength and technique affect distance.\n\n2. **Force Investigation with a Bathroom Scale:** Have students stand on a bathroom scale (which measures the normal force pushing up). Ask them to predict what happens to the scale reading when they crouch to jump, during the jump, and when they land. Record the numbers and discuss why the reading changes—connecting it to Newton's Third Law.\n\n3. **Design a Jump Course:** Challenge students to design an obstacle course with cones at different heights and distances. Have them predict which jumps will be hardest and why (based on distance, height, and required force). Test predictions and discuss how mass, muscle strength, and technique affect performance.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Gravity* by Jason Chin (simple explanations with illustrations of gravity in action)\n- *Forces Make Things Move* by Kimberly Bradley (explores different types of forces through everyday examples)\n- *What Makes Things Move?* by Kathleen Weidner Zoehfeld (beginner-friendly exploration of force and motion)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"Newton's Third Law Explained\"** by Crash Course Kids — A clear, engaging explanation of action-reaction forces with real-world examples.
