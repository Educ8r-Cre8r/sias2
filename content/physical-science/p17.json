The reflection captures the blue sky and clouds, adding depth to the composition. The building's design includes vertical lines and geometric shapes, contributing to its contemporary aesthetic.\n\n# 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates light reflection and refraction. The glass panels reflect the surrounding environment, creating a mirrored effect due to the smooth surface of the glass. Light bounces off the glass at the same angle it hits, which is why we see clear reflections. Additionally, the thickness and material of the glass can slightly refract (bend) light, but this effect is minimal in this image.\n\n# 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1\\. **Light Reflection**: When light bounces off a surface, such as glass or a mirror.  \n2\\. **Refraction**: The bending of light as it passes through different materials, like glass.  \n3\\. **Transparency and Opacity**: How materials allow light to pass through (transparent) or block it (opaque).\n\n<pedagogical-tip>  \nEngage students in a hands-on activity using mirrors or reflective surfaces. Ask them to observe how their reflection changes when they move closer or farther from the surface.
