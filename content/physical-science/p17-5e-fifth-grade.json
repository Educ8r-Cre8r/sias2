Identify materials as transparent, translucent, or opaque based on how light passes through them.\n2. Explain that light reflects off surfaces and can create reflections and shadows.\n3. Predict how different materials will interact with light based on their properties.\n4. Describe how the properties of materials determine how light behaves (reflects, passes through, or is blocked).\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about light and reflections using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital display of the photograph (p17.jpg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Display the Photograph (2-3 minutes)**\nProject or display the photograph on screen or printed on chart paper where all students can see clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\n**Step 2: Facilitated Discussion (7-10 minutes)**\nAsk students these specific questions in sequence:\n\n1. *\"What do you notice about the windows in this building? Describe what you see through them.\"* (Listen for: reflections of other buildings, clear glass, colors, images)\n\n2. *\"Why do you think we can see other buildings reflected in the glass windows? Where is that light coming from?\"* (Elicit thinking about light bouncing off surfaces)\n\n3. *\"Look at the metal frames between the windows. Do they look shiny or dull compared to the glass? Why might that be?\"* (Guide toward understanding that different materials interact with light differently)\n\n4. *\"If you looked at this building at night when it's dark outside, what do you think you'd see in the windows? Why?\"* (Activate thinking about light sources and visibility)\n\n**Step 3: Wonder Prompt (1-2 minutes)**\nWrite this on chart paper: *\"I wonder why some materials let us see through them, while others don't...\"*\n\nInvite 2-3 students to share their initial ideas.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore how different materials interact with light, just like the glass, metal, and buildings in this photograph. We'll discover why some things are clear, some are shiny, and some are dark.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how light interacts with different materials through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Clear plastic wrap\n- Wax paper (translucent)\n- Construction paper (black or dark color—opaque)\n- White paper\n- Aluminum foil (reflective)\n- Flashlight or small LED light source\n- Dark cloth or paper to create a low-light investigation area (optional: use a corner of the classroom or under a desk)\n- Chart labeled \"Material Investigation Sheet\" (printed or on clipboard)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (to be read aloud and posted visibly):**\n\n1. **Get your investigation materials.** Your group will receive five different materials: clear plastic wrap, wax paper, black construction paper, white paper, and aluminum foil.\n\n2. **Create a testing station.** Place your materials on a flat surface. Turn on your flashlight or light source.\n\n3. **Test each material one at a time.** For EACH material, do the following:\n   - Hold the material between the light source and a dark area (or your group's eyes if indoors).\n   - Shine the light on the material.\n   - Observe: Can you see light coming through? Is there a reflection? Is there a shadow?\n\n4. **Record your observations.** On your \"Material Investigation Sheet,\" write or draw what you observe for each material in these categories:\n   - **Light passes through:** (Yes/No/Partially)\n   - **Creates a reflection:** (Yes/No)\n   - **Creates a shadow:** (Yes/No)\n   - **Drawing:** Sketch what you see\n\n5. **Compare materials.** Look at all your observations. Which materials act most like the glass in the building photo? Which act like the metal frames?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups with guiding questions, not answers:\n  - *\"What happens when you angle the material differently?\"*\n  - *\"How is the clear plastic wrap different from the wax paper?\"*\n  - *\"Why do you think the foil is so shiny compared to the black paper?\"*\n- Prompt groups to observe more carefully if their observations are incomplete.\n- Do NOT explain concepts yet—allow discovery.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify that clear plastic wrap allows light to pass through with minimal obstruction.\n- Students recognize that wax paper allows some light through but creates a diffused effect (translucent).\n- Students observe that black paper blocks light and creates a distinct shadow.\n- Students notice that aluminum foil reflects light brightly (like the glass building reflection).\n- Students produce an investigation sheet with drawings and written observations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph (p17.jpg) displayed again\n- Investigation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes)**\n- Select 2-3 groups to share their observations (30-45 seconds each).\n- Ask: *\"Which material was most like the glass in the photograph? How do you know?\"*\n- Create a class tally or list on chart paper summarizing which materials allowed light through, which reflected it, and which blocked it.\n\n**Step 2: Introduce Key Vocabulary (7-10 minutes)**\nDisplay the photograph again. Introduce each term with a clear definition, then point to examples in the photo:\n\n**Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n1. **Transparent** - A material that lets light pass straight through so you can see clearly what's on the other side. (*Example in photo: the glass windows in the building*)\n\n2. **Translucent** - A material that lets some light pass through, but you can't see clearly through it—things look blurry or hazy. (*Example: frosted or textured glass you might see on some building windows*)\n\n3. **Opaque** - A material that blocks all (or almost all) light so you can't see through it at all. (*Example: the metal frames and the solid buildings reflected in the windows*)\n\n4. **Reflection** - Light bouncing off a shiny surface back to our eyes. (*Example: the image of another building visible in the glass of this building*)\n\n5. **Shadow** - A dark area created when an opaque object blocks light from passing through. (*Example: the dark shadows cast by the metal framework visible in the windows*)\n\n**Step 3: Connect Back to the Photograph (2-3 minutes)**\n- *\"This building has so much glass because glass is transparent—light can pass through it. The metal frames are opaque, so they create shadows and don't let light pass through. The glass is also smooth and shiny, so it reflects light and creates reflections of other buildings. That's why we can see other buildings in this glass building!\"*\n\n**Step 4: Check for Understanding (1-2 minutes)**\nAsk individual students:\n- *\"If I show you this [hold up wax paper], would it be transparent, translucent, or opaque?\"*\n- *\"Why does a mirror create a reflection?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary terms (transparent, translucent, opaque, reflection, shadow) correctly in context.\n- Students can explain why the glass building looks the way it does using these concepts.\n- Students make connections between their exploration materials and real-world examples.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by designing their own transparent, translucent, or opaque building.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic sheets or transparency film\n- Wax paper or frosted plastic sheets\n- Black or colored construction paper\n- Aluminum foil\n- Tape\n- Scissors\n- Small boxes or paper towel tubes (to serve as building frames)\n- Flashlight or light source\n- Chart paper: \"Building Design Challenge\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Building Design Challenge (student-centered):**\n\n1. **Explain the challenge:** *\"Your group will design a small 'building' using different materials to show what you've learned. You'll build a structure and then test how light interacts with it.\"*\n\n2. **Distribute design planning sheet** with these prompts:\n   - Which material will you use for the 'walls'? (transparent, translucent, opaque)\n   - Why did you choose this material?\n   - What will happen when we shine a light on your building?\n   - Will people be able to see inside? Why or why not?\n\n3. **Building construction (10-12 minutes):**\n   - Groups select materials and wrap/cover a small box or tube with their chosen material(s).\n   - Groups may mix materials (e.g., some transparent windows, some opaque sections).\n   - Tape materials securely.\n\n4. **Testing and observation (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Dim lights slightly.\n   - Shine flashlight on each group's building.\n   - Observe and discuss: What do you see? How does light interact with this building?\n   - Compare to the photograph: *\"Is this more like the glass building in the photo, or different? How?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate material selection without directing specific choices.\n- Ask: *\"What will happen to light when it hits your material?\"*\n- Encourage groups to predict before testing.\n- Validate all design choices as long as students can explain their thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply vocabulary terms in explaining their design choices.\n- Students predict how light will behave based on material properties.\n- Students recognize that buildings can be designed with different materials to control how light enters.\n- Students produce a physical model demonstrating understanding of transparent, translucent, and opaque materials.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light interaction with materials and their properties.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- **During Explore:** Observe investigation sheets for accuracy and completeness of observations.\n- **During Explain:** Listen to student responses during vocabulary check-in questions.\n- **During Elaborate:** Assess student explanations for their building design choices—do they use correct vocabulary and logic?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nProvide each student with a small ticket (index card) with these three prompts. Students may draw, write, or both:\n\n1. **Draw or describe a transparent material. Why is it transparent?**\n\n2. **If you looked at the glass building in the photograph on a sunny day versus a cloudy day, would you see the same reflections? Why or why not?**\n\n3. **Which material from our exploration (clear plastic, wax paper, black paper, foil) is most like the glass in this building? Explain your choice using one complete sentence.**\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student correctly identifies at least one transparent and one opaque material.\n- Student uses at least one science vocabulary word (transparent, translucent, opaque, reflection, or shadow) correctly.\n- Student provides a logical explanation connecting material properties to how light behaves.\n- Student makes reference to the photograph or real-world context.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- **Objective 1 (Identify materials):** Review exit tickets and investigation sheets. Students should correctly categorize materials as transparent, translucent, or opaque.\n- **Objective 2 (Explain reflection/shadows):** Listen for use of vocabulary during group discussions and exit ticket responses that show understanding of how light bounces and is blocked.\n- **Objective 3 (Predict interactions):** Assess building design predictions—do students predict outcomes accurately based on material properties?\n- **Objective 4 (Describe properties):** Review exit tickets and observation sheets for connections between material properties and light behavior.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for students struggling with concepts):\n\n1. **Vocabulary anchor chart:** Create a visual reference chart with pictures and words for transparent, translucent, and opaque. Keep it displayed throughout all phases. Pair struggling students with strong partners during Explore and Elaborate.\n\n2. **Guided investigation template:** Provide a more structured investigation sheet with sentence frames:\n   - *\"Light passes through this material: _____ (yes/no)\"*\n   - *\"I can see a reflection: _____ (yes/no)\"*\n   - Instead of open-ended recording, offer multiple-choice or picture-matching responses.\n\n3. **Simplified building task:** Allow students to use only one type of material for their building (e.g., only transparent OR only opaque) rather than mixing. Reduce the number of materials to choose from (e.g., only 2-3 options instead of 5).\n\n4. **Sentence stems for explanation:** Provide structured prompts during Explain and Evaluate:\n   - *\"This material is transparent because...\"*\n   - *\"Light reflects off the foil because it is...\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Investigate light angles:** Ask: *\"Does the angle at which light hits a material change how much light is reflected? Design an experiment to test this.\"* Students can measure reflection intensity at different angles using a protractor and light meter (if available) or estimate using observation.\n\n2. **Real-world application extension:** *\"Research and report: Why do architects choose to use so much glass in skyscrapers? What are the advantages and disadvantages? How does this connect to what we learned about transparent materials?\"* Students present findings using text, diagrams, or digital media.\n\n3. **Explore beyond the visible spectrum:** Introduce the concept that light has different wavelengths and colors. Ask: *\"Why does the building in the photograph look a certain color? What would happen if light couldn't pass through the glass?\"* This bridges to future learning about light wavelengths and color.\n\n4. **Challenge building task:** *\"Design a building that controls how much light enters at different times of day. Use a mix of materials and explain your choices.\"* Students must consider time of day, sun angle, and practical building function in their design.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Shadow Art Investigation (15-20 minutes):**\n   Students explore shadow creation by placing objects between a light source and a white poster board or wall. They trace shadows, measure them, and explore how moving the object or light source changes the shadow size and shape. Connection: *\"How do shadows on the building in the photograph change throughout the day?\"* Students can sketch shadow patterns around the metal framework at different times.\n\n2. **Reflection Exploration Scavenger Hunt (20-30 minutes, can be homework):**\n   Students go on a classroom or school scavenger hunt to find reflective surfaces (mirrors, glass, foil, shiny paper, water in a cup, etc.). They photograph or sketch each reflection and label what type of material creates it and why. Extension question: *\"Which reflections are clearest? Which are fuzzy or distorted? Why?\"*\n\n3. **Building Interview and Design Project (homework or extended task):**\n   Students interview a family member or research online about why certain buildings are made with lots of glass versus more solid materials. They create a poster or digital presentation comparing two buildings (one glass-heavy like the photograph, one more opaque) and explain how the choice of materials affects light, energy, and what people can see inside and outside. This connects to NGSS 5-PS1-3 (properties of materials) and real-world design thinking.\n\n---\n\n**Notes for Implementation:**\n\n- **Timing flexibility:** This lesson can be condensed into a single 90-minute block or extended across two 45-minute sessions. Day 1 (Engage, Explore, begin Explain) and Day 2 (finish Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) works well.\n- **Safety reminder:** When using flashlights or light sources, remind students not to shine directly in eyes. Keep investigation areas well-supervised.\n- **Accessibility:** Ensure students with visual impairments can participate by describing observations aloud, feeling material textures to infer properties, and having a peer describe what is seen through transparent materials.\n- **Connection to future learning:** This lesson builds foundational understanding for future Grade 5-6 learning about light energy (5-PS3-1) and prepares students for Grade 3-4 concepts of light being absorbed, reflected, or transmitted, and Middle School physics concepts about waves and energy.",
