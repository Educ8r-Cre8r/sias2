ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by examining how light allows us to see inside systems and containers.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on interactive board or printed copies (one per pair)\n- Small opaque cup (non-transparent)\n- Small transparent plastic cup\n- Yellow or colored water in a pitcher\n- Flashlight or light source\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board. Ask students to look closely at the engine compartment image, specifically the large white container with yellow liquid visible inside.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the white container in the middle of the picture? What's inside it?\"\n   - \"How can you see the yellow liquid through the white plastic? What allows you to see through it?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the engineers who designed this car chose a *clear* container instead of a solid black one?\"\n   - \"If this container were made of metal instead of plastic, could you see what's inside? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Conduct a quick mystery activity:** Hold up an opaque cup filled with colored water and an identical transparent cup filled with colored water. Ask: \"Which container lets me see what's inside? How does light help us see things?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"Today, we're going to investigate how materials like clear plastic help us see liquids in containers, and why this matters for things like cars, machines, and science experiments.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now that you've thought about how we see through clear materials, let's explore this idea with our own investigation.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate transparency and design a simple system to observe liquid movement.\n\n**Materials (per pair):**\n- 2 clear plastic cups (or similar transparent containers)\n- 1 opaque cup (paper or foam)\n- Clear plastic straws (2-3 per pair)\n- Tape (clear, wide tape works best)\n- Yellow or blue food coloring\n- Water pitcher\n- Paper towels\n- Scissors\n- Small pieces of different materials: aluminum foil, wax paper, plastic wrap, white paper\n- Flashlight or access to window light\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Testing Materials for Transparency (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** to each pair. Explain: \"You are going to test different materials to see which ones let light pass through and allow you to see through them.\"\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - Place a small sample of each material (foil, wax paper, plastic wrap, white paper) in front of a light source or window.\n   - Look through or hold each material up to the light.\n   - Record on a simple chart: Can you see clearly through it? Can you see partially? Cannot see through at all?\n   - Predict: Which materials would be GOOD for a container where you need to see the liquid inside?\n\n3. **Teacher facilitation:** Circulate and ask questions without giving answers: \"What do you notice when light hits the aluminum foil? What's different about the plastic wrap?\"\n\n**Part 2: Designing a Liquid Observation System (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Challenge:** \"Design a simple system using two clear cups, a straw, tape, and water with food coloring. The system should let you see the colored liquid moving from one cup to another.\"\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - Use tape to attach straws between two transparent cups to create a simple \"liquid transport system.\"\n   - Add a drop of food coloring to water in one cup.\n   - Carefully pour water into the first cup and observe if it travels through the straw to the second cup.\n   - Observe: Can you see the colored water moving? What allows you to see it?\n   - Draw a diagram labeling which materials are transparent and why you chose them.\n\n3. **Teacher role:** Observe students, ask: \"Why did you choose a clear cup instead of an opaque one? What would happen if you used a solid black container?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that transparent and translucent materials allow light to pass through, making contents visible.\n- Students create a working prototype of a simple transport system.\n- Students document observations about which materials work best for seeing through.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize learning with vocabulary and scientific explanations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student diagrams from Explore phase\n- Visual examples of transparent, translucent, and opaque materials\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 pairs to show their transparent systems.\n   - Ask: \"Why did this system work? Which materials helped you see the liquid?\"\n   - Record student observations on chart paper.\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Instruction (10-15 minutes):**\n   - Connect back to the photograph: \"Just like in your experiment, the engineers who designed this car chose a *clear plastic* reservoir so people can see how much liquid is inside without opening the cap.\"\n   - Introduce and define vocabulary using the chart:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Transparent:** Materials that let light pass straight through so you can see clearly through them (example: clear plastic, glass, water)\n- **Translucent:** Materials that let some light pass through but scatter it, so you can see shapes but not clear details (example: wax paper, frosted plastic)\n- **Opaque:** Materials that do not let light pass through at all, so you cannot see through them (example: metal, wood, thick cardboard)\n- **Reflection:** Light bouncing off a surface (helps us see objects when light reflects from them into our eyes)\n- **Transmission:** Light passing through a material (how we see *through* clear objects)\n\n3. **Connection to the Photograph:**\n   - \"The white container in your picture is made of *translucent* or *transparent* plastic. This allows mechanics and drivers to see the golden liquid (coolant) inside. If it were made of metal, you wouldn't be able to see when the liquid was getting low—that would be dangerous!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"If I made a container out of aluminum foil, would you be able to see the water inside? Why not?\"\n   - \"What property of the clear plastic cup made your liquid transport system work?\"\n   - Show pictures of different containers (medicine bottles, juice bottles, car parts) and ask: \"Why is this container clear?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use correct vocabulary to describe material properties.\n- Students explain that light must pass through (be transmitted or reflected from) a material for them to see objects.\n- Students connect the photograph to the concept of transparency in real-world applications.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding to a new design challenge involving energy transfer and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic bottles (various sizes)\n- Pipe cleaners or flexible straws\n- Tape\n- Food coloring\n- Water\n- Small objects (beads, pebbles) that can be seen through water\n- Funnels\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge: Design a \"Liquid Motion Observation Device\"**\n\n1. **Present the scenario:** \"Water treatment plants, car engines, and scientific laboratories all need to monitor liquids moving through pipes. Your job is to design a device that uses clear materials to let people *see* a liquid moving through a system AND lets them watch small objects moving with that liquid.\"\n\n2. **Student Design Task (design and build: 12-15 minutes):**\n   - Using transparent bottles, straws, and food-colored water, design a system where:\n     * Liquid can move from one container to another (showing energy transfer)\n     * Observers can see the liquid AND small objects inside moving with it\n     * At least two different materials are used\n   - Add labels explaining which materials are transparent and why those materials were chosen\n   - Test your system: Pour water in and observe movement\n\n3. **Refinement Questions (teacher-guided):**\n   - \"Can someone watching from the side see the movement? If not, how could you redesign to make it more visible?\"\n   - \"What if you added food coloring to make the movement even more obvious? Why would that help?\"\n   - \"How is your device similar to the car part in the original photograph?\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:** Facilitate problem-solving: \"Your straw isn't letting water through—what might be blocking it? How could transparency help us figure out what's stuck?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply the concept of transparency to a new context (observation and monitoring systems).\n- Students integrate energy transfer concepts (liquid moving through the system) with light transmission (being able to see it happen).\n- Students refine designs based on the principle that clear materials enable observation.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of transparency, light transmission, and material properties.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student experiments during Explore phase: Are they choosing transparent materials intentionally?\n- Listen to student explanations: Are they using vocabulary correctly?\n- Review student diagrams: Do they label materials and explain why transparency matters?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with a slip of paper or digital form with these questions:\n\n1. **Picture/Scenario Observation:** Show an image of a fuel gauge in a car or similar transparent reservoir with liquid inside. Ask: \"Why did the engineer make this container clear instead of black? Explain what would happen if it were made of metal.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Application:** \"Sort these materials into transparent, translucent, or opaque: clear plastic, frosted glass, aluminum foil, clear water, wax paper. Explain how you decided.\"\n\n3. **Light and Visibility:** \"Light reflects from the yellow liquid in the photograph and enters your eye, allowing you to see it. Draw a simple arrow diagram showing how light helps you see the liquid inside a clear container.\"\n\n4. **Design Thinking:** \"If you were designing a new container to hold a special liquid and you wanted people to see the liquid without opening it, what material would you choose? Why?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n\n✓ Students correctly identify and define transparent, translucent, and opaque materials.\n\n✓ Students explain that light must pass through (or reflect from) materials for us to see objects.\n\n✓ Students apply transparency concepts to real-world applications (car parts, containers, observation systems).\n\n✓ Students design systems using transparent materials intentionally to solve an observation problem.\n\n✓ Students use evidence from their experiments to support their explanations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 75% of students score proficient on the exit ticket, demonstrating understanding of transparency and light transmission.\n- Students can articulate why engineers choose specific materials based on properties (especially transparency).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visual aids:** Provide a picture chart showing examples of transparent, translucent, and opaque materials with photographs. Allow students to match and sort before naming the property.\n\n2. **Structured exploration guide:** Provide a worksheet with sentence frames: \"This material is _____ because I can/cannot see through it. Light _____ through it.\" Students fill in blanks during Explore.\n\n3. **Paired work with advanced peer:** Assign struggling students to work with a strong partner during the design challenge. Peer explanations often reinforce understanding.\n\n4. **Reduced design complexity:** Instead of creating a two-container transport system, provide pre-assembled containers and straws; students focus on observing and explaining why transparent materials matter.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Introduce refraction and optics:** Advanced students can investigate how curved transparent materials (plastic domes, bottles) bend light differently. Challenge: \"Does curved plastic change how clearly you can see through it compared to flat plastic?\"\n\n2. **Real-world application research:** Ask advanced students to research and present on one system that uses transparent containers (aquariums, car fluid reservoirs, laboratory equipment). They explain the engineering choice to use transparent materials.\n\n3. **Design optimization challenge:** \"Design a system where the liquid can move AND be observed from multiple angles (top, side, bottom). Which angle is best for seeing the movement? Why?\" This adds spatial reasoning and multi-perspective thinking.\n\n4. **Connect to electromagnetic spectrum:** For advanced students ready for extension, briefly introduce that visible light (the light our eyes can see) is what allows us to see through transparent materials; other types of light (infrared, X-rays) behave differently with the same materials.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Design a Science Lab Container\"** (Take-home or follow-up lesson)\n   - Provide students with a design brief: A scientist needs a container to hold and observe a chemical reaction that produces colored gas. The container must be safe, durable, and allow observation from all sides. Have students sketch and label a design, explaining which materials (transparent/translucent) they would use and why. This bridges to chemistry and material properties.\n\n2. **Transparent Pathway Project** (Small group, 1-2 class periods)\n   - Challenge students to create a more complex \"liquid highway\" using multiple clear bottles, straws, tape, and funnels. Liquid must travel through at least 3 containers, over obstacles, and down slopes—all while being visible. Students diagram their pathway and explain how transparency allows observation of energy transfer (moving water) through their system.\n\n3. **\"See-Through Structures\" Gallery Walk** (Class activity, 15-20 minutes)\n   - Have students bring in or draw pictures of structures/objects that use transparent materials (greenhouses, aquariums, windows, phone screens, car windows, laboratory beakers). Set up a gallery walk where students post images/drawings and add sticky notes explaining WHY transparency is important for each example. Discuss patterns: visibility, safety, beauty, observation, durability.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\nThis lesson bridges 4-PS4-2 (light allowing us to see objects) with practical material properties. The photograph serves as an authentic, relatable anchor (car maintenance), making abstract concepts about light transmission concrete and observable. The progression from observation → experimentation → explanation → design strengthens conceptual understanding and allows students to see themselves as engineers making intentional material choices.",
