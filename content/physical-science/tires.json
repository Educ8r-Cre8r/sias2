The tread has many small ridges and grooves that help the tire grip the ground. In the background, we can see a metal wheel rim and part of a vehicle.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why do tires have bumpy patterns instead of being smooth?\n\n**Scientific Explanation:** Tires have tread patterns (those bumpy ridges and grooves) because they help vehicles grip and hold onto the ground—similar to how your shoes have bumpy soles to keep you from slipping. The grooves channel water away when it rains, and the ridges increase the contact area between the tire and the road surface. This is an example of how **texture affects friction**, a fundamental physical science concept. The bumps create more points of contact, which increases grip and traction, making vehicles safer to drive.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Texture and Surface Properties:** Tires have a rough, bumpy texture instead of a smooth surface. This texture helps tires grip the ground better.\n\n* **Friction:** The bumpy tread pattern creates friction—a force that helps the tire grip the road and prevents skidding. More bumps = more grip.\n\n* **Purpose and Function in Design:** Tires are designed with tread patterns on purpose. Humans created this pattern to solve a problem (keeping vehicles from sliding).\n\n* **Observation and Properties:** We can observe and describe the physical properties of objects using our senses (sight, touch). The tread has texture, color, and a specific pattern.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFor Kindergarteners, use the **compare and contrast strategy**: Have students feel smooth and bumpy objects (a smooth plastic toy vs. a textured sponge). Ask, \"Which one grips better when you push it across the table?\" This concrete experience helps them understand *why* tires need bumps before showing them the tire photo.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Provide a tactile exploration station with sandpaper, smooth plastic, bumpy rubber, and textured fabric so students can feel different surfaces. Some learners benefit from hands-on sensory engagement before abstract photo analysis. You might also use a simple diagram showing a smooth tire vs. a treaded tire.\n\n**Multiple Means of Engagement:** Let students choose whether they want to examine real tire samples (safely), draw tire patterns, or act out what happens when a car tire tries to move on different surfaces. This choice increases motivation for diverse learners.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Kindergarten Performance Expectation:**\nK-PS2-1: Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that vibrations make sound.\n*(While this PE focuses on sound, the **friction and grip** concept relates to K-PS2 Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions)*\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n* [[NGSS:DCI:K-PS2.A]] - Forces and Motion: Objects can move in different ways (fast, slow, straight, round).

    "firstgrade": "# First Grade Science Lesson: Tire Tread & Friction\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\nThis image shows the bumpy, grooved pattern on a tire called tread. The deep ridges and raised bumps on the tire surface are designed to help cars grip the road safely. You can see how the tread pattern creates a textured surface that looks very different from a smooth wheel.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why do tires have bumpy patterns instead of smooth surfaces?\n\n**Scientific Explanation:** Tire tread exists to create **friction**—a force that happens when two surfaces rub together. The bumpy grooves and ridges increase the contact area between the tire and the road, helping the tire grip better and preventing slipping. Smooth tires would slide more easily on wet or icy roads because there's less surface area for friction to work. The deeper the tread, the better the tire can push water and debris away, maintaining grip even in bad weather.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Texture & Surface Properties:** Objects have different textures (bumpy, smooth, rough). The texture of tread affects how a tire interacts with the road.\n\n2. **Friction:** Friction is a force that slows things down or stops them from sliding. Bumpy surfaces create more friction than smooth surfaces.\n\n3. **Cause & Effect:** The design of the tire tread (cause) affects how well a car can stop and turn (effect).\n\n4. **Materials & Wear:** Tires are made from rubber that wears down over time. The deeper the tread grooves, the safer the tire; shallow tread means the tire needs replacing.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\n**Engagement Tip:** Start the lesson by asking students to rub their fingertips on a smooth desk, then on a bumpy textured surface (like tree bark or sandpaper). Have them compare how each feels and predict which would help a car stop better. This tactile experience builds understanding of friction before introducing tire tread concepts.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Provide both visual inspection of tires AND tactile exploration of textured materials. Show photographs and real tire samples. Use simple diagrams with labels showing how bumps help grip the road.\n\n**Multiple Means of Action & Expression:** Allow students to demonstrate learning through drawing tires with and without tread, physically moving toy cars across smooth vs. textured surfaces, or creating rubbings of tire tread patterns.\n\n**Multiple Means of Engagement:** Connect to student experience: \"Have you ever slipped on ice?\" or \"Why do rain boots have bumpy bottoms?\" This makes the phenomenon personally relevant.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 1-PS3-1 Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that vibrating objects can make sound and that various materials can be used to solve the problem of unwanted sound.\n*(Note: While this PE focuses on sound, tire friction investigations support the foundational understanding of how objects interact with surfaces.)*\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-PS2.A]] Forces and Motion - Objects can move in different ways, and the amount and type of motion can be changed by pushing or pulling.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] - Simple cause-and-effect relationships exist in everyday life (bumpy tread causes better grip).\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns in the natural and human-designed world can be observed and used to solve problems (tire tread patterns solve grip problems).\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What would happen if a tire had NO bumps and was completely smooth? Why?**\n   *(Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 2)*\n\n2. **Where else do you see bumpy patterns that help things NOT slip? Can you find an example in our classroom?**\n   *(Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)*\n\n3. **Why might a tire get \"bald\" (lose its bumps) after a car drives for many miles?**\n   *(Bloom's: Explain | DOK: 2)*\n\n4. **How is the bumpy tread on a tire similar to the bumpy bottom of your shoes or sneakers?**\n   *(Bloom's: Compare | DOK: 3)*\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Tread:** The bumpy, grooved pattern on a tire that helps it grip the road.\n* **Friction:** A force that happens when two surfaces rub together and makes it harder for things to slide.\n* **Grip:** When something holds on tightly without slipping (like a tire gripping the road).\n* **Texture:** How something feels when you touch it—bumpy, smooth, rough, or sticky.\n* **Rubber:** The stretchy material that tires are made from.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Tire Tread Rubbings & Comparisons:**\n   Set out paper and crayons near a tire (or a photo). Have students make rubbings of the tread pattern, then compare it to rubbings of other textured items (tree bark, leaf veins, bumpy toys). Display these side-by-side and discuss which have the deepest patterns.\n\n2. **Slipping Experiment with Toy Cars:**\n   Create two ramps—one smooth (plastic wrap or aluminum foil) and one textured (sandpaper or bumpy shelf liner). Let students roll toy cars down each ramp and observe which one stops more easily. Connect this to how tire tread helps real cars stop. *Safety note: Use low ramps and ensure toy cars don't fly off.*\n\n3. **Explore Objects with Helpful Bumps:**\n   Take a classroom \"bump hunt\" where students find and discuss objects with purposeful textured surfaces: pencil grips, stair treads, shoe bottoms, dish sponges, and climbing gym handholds. Create a display with sketches or photos labeled \"Things with Bumps That Help Us.\"\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Cars* by DK (Simple Machines) - Introduces vehicle parts including tires in accessible language.\n- *The Wheels on the Bus* by Pam Schiller (Illustrated Edition) - A classic that can be extended to discuss why wheels have tread.\n- *How Do Wheels Work?* by Isaac Asimov (Easy Astrophysics Series) - Age-appropriate exploration of wheels and tire function.\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"Why Do Tires Have Grooves?\" - National Geographic Kids**\n  A short, animated explanation of tire tread and friction designed for young learners.\n  [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=why+do+tires+have+grooves+national+geographic+kids](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=why+do+tires+have+grooves+national+geographic+kids)\n\n- **\"Friction for Kids\" - ScienceKids.co.nz**\n  An introduction to friction with simple demonstrations and real-world examples, including tires.\n  [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=friction+for+kids+sciencekids](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=friction+for+kids+sciencekids)\n\n---\n\n**Implementation Note:** This lesson builds foundational physics understanding through observation and hands-on exploration, preparing first graders for more complex motion and forces concepts in later grades.",
    "secondgrade": "# Tire Tread Analysis: A Second Grade Science Lesson Guide\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows car tires with deep grooves and patterns carved into the rubber surface. The tread (the bumpy, patterned part) helps tires grip the road and push water away. You can see how the tire tread is designed with special shapes that help cars stop safely and drive smoothly on different surfaces.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why do tires have bumpy patterns on them?\n\nTire tread exists because of friction and water displacement. The grooves in tire tread create grip (friction) between the tire and the road, which helps cars stop, start, and turn safely. The patterns also channel water away from the tire's contact point, preventing skids on wet roads. This is an example of how humans design objects based on understanding how materials interact with their environment.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Friction:** The force that happens when two surfaces rub together. Tire tread increases friction between the tire and road, making it harder for the tire to slip.\n\n* **Material Properties:** Rubber is flexible, stretchy, and grips well. These properties make it perfect for tires, but the rubber alone isn't enough—the tread pattern makes tires work even better.\n\n* **Design and Function:** Objects are designed in specific ways to help them work better. The bumpy tread pattern on tires is intentionally designed to solve a problem (slipping and skidding).\n\n* **Wear and Erosion:** Over time, tires wear down from friction with the road. The tread becomes smoother and shallower, which makes the tire less safe.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nHelp students understand tread by making a connection to their own shoes: Ask them to examine the soles of their sneakers. Compare smooth-soled shoes to shoes with bumpy soles. Which shoes grip better on a slippery surface? This concrete comparison helps Second Graders understand why tires need tread without requiring abstract thinking about cars.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple representations: (1) Tactile exploration—let students feel real tire tread samples or shoe soles with different patterns, (2) Visual models—show pictures of worn vs. new tires side by side, and (3) Kinesthetic activity—have students walk on smooth tile and textured carpet to feel the difference in grip. This multi-sensory approach supports learners with different strengths and learning preferences.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\nK-2-ETS1-2: Develop a simple sketch, drawing, or physical model that represents how the shape of an object helps it function to solve a given problem.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-PS2.A]] Forces and Motion: Pushes and pulls can change the speed or direction of an object's motion.\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-2-ETS1.B]] Developing Possible Solutions: Designs can be tried, tested, and improved.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] The shape and materials of objects relate to what they can do.\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]] Objects have parts that work together.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What would happen if tires were completely smooth like a rubber ball?** (Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **Why do you think tire tread looks different from the tread on the bottom of your shoes, even though they both need to grip?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n3. **How do you think a tire's tread changes after someone drives a car for many years?** (Bloom's: Infer | DOK: 2)\n\n4. **If you were designing a tire for a race car on a wet track, what would you change about the tread pattern and why?** (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Tread:** The bumpy, grooved pattern on the bottom of a tire that helps it grip the road.\n\n* **Friction:** A force that happens when two things rub together and makes it harder for them to slide past each other.\n\n* **Grip:** When something holds onto another thing tightly so it doesn't slip.\n\n* **Groove:** A long, narrow cut or channel in a surface.\n\n* **Wear:** When something gets thinner, smoother, or damaged from being used over and over.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n**Activity 1: Texture Testing**\nProvide students with various materials (sandpaper, smooth plastic, textured rubber, cloth). Have them predict which materials have the most \"grip,\" then test each one by seeing which material can hold a toy car best on a tilted board. Record observations and discuss why rougher textures grip better.\n\n**Activity 2: Design Your Own Tread**\nGive students modeling clay or playdough and ask them to create a tire with a tread pattern they design. Have them predict what their tread pattern should do (stop cars, move through mud, drive in snow), then test their models on different surfaces to see if their designs work. Discuss what worked and what they would change.\n\n**Activity 3: Tire Wear Investigation**\nShow students pictures or video of new tires versus extremely worn tires with barely any tread. Ask: \"Why is a tire with very little tread dangerous?\" Create a simple safety poster as a class about why tire tread matters.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Cars* by Leslie Pate Mackinnon (simple introduction to how cars work)\n- *Tires* by Rebecca Stefoff (part of the \"How It Works\" series; explains tire design for early readers)\n- *Wheels* by Mick Manning (explores different wheel and tire designs across transportation)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"Why Do Tires Have Tread?\"** by SciShow Kids (2:45 minutes)\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-yLWrnsDlU\n  Clear explanation of tire tread function with engaging visuals appropriate for Second Grade.\n\n- **\"How Are Tires Made?\"** by National Geographic Kids (3:10 minutes)\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVW5Mz_3Yk8\n  Shows the manufacturing process and highlights why tread patterns matter for safety.",
    "thirdgrade": "# Third Grade Science Lesson: Tire Tread and Friction\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis photo shows a close-up view of a car tire's tread pattern—the deep grooves and bumpy texture on the rubber surface. The tread has many small channels and raised blocks that help the tire grip the road. You can also see a shiny car wheel rim in the background.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why do tires have bumpy patterns with grooves instead of smooth rubber?\n\n**Scientific Explanation:** Tire tread exists because of **friction**—the force that happens when two surfaces rub together. The bumpy, grooved pattern increases the tire's surface area and helps it grip the road better, especially on wet or slippery surfaces. The channels in the tread also move water away from the tire, preventing slipping. Without this special pattern, tires would slide too easily, making it dangerous for cars to stop or turn safely.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Friction:** A force that slows down or stops objects from sliding past each other. The textured tread on tires creates more friction with the road surface.\n\n* **Surface Texture and Function:** Objects are designed with specific textures (rough, smooth, bumpy) to help them do their job better. A tire's tread pattern is designed to work well with different road conditions.\n\n* **Material Properties:** Rubber is flexible and grippy, which makes it perfect for tires. The material choice affects how well the tire works.\n\n* **Wear and Maintenance:** Over time, friction and use cause the tread to wear down, reducing the tire's ability to grip the road safely. Tires eventually need replacement.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nBuild prior knowledge by having students touch various textured objects (sandpaper, smooth plastic, bumpy rubber) before discussing tires. This tactile experience helps Third Graders understand how texture connects to friction in a concrete way.

Students race them down an inclined ramp and measure how far they travel. Discuss why textured wheels might perform differently and relate findings back to real tires.\n\n2. **Design Your Own Tire:** Give students clay or play dough and ask them to create a tire with a tread pattern they think would work well on rainy roads. Have them test it by \"rolling\" it across a wet paper towel and observing what happens. Share designs and explain their thinking.\n\n3. **Friction Exploration Station:** Set up a station with different materials (rubber bands, sandpaper, plastic wrap, cloth) and have students test each material's friction by sliding it across different surfaces (wood, tile, carpet). Create a chart showing which combinations created the most and least friction, then connect findings to why tires need good texture.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Tires* by Patricia Hubbell (explores how tires work in simple language)\n- *How Do Wheels Work?* by David Adler (part of the \"How Do...\" series with accessible explanations)\n- *Cars* by Seymour Simon (includes a section on tires and road safety)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"How Tires Work\"** by National Geographic Kids (2:45 min) — Explains tire design and friction in kid-friendly terms.

The grooves in tire tread are engineered to increase the contact area between the tire and the road surface, which increases friction. This greater friction helps tires grip wet, icy, or slippery surfaces, preventing the car from sliding. The pattern also allows water and mud to escape from under the tire, keeping the rubber in direct contact with the road. Without tread, tires would have much less grip, making it harder for drivers to control the vehicle, especially in wet conditions.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Friction** – A force that occurs when two surfaces rub against each other; it can slow things down or help them grip surfaces. Tire tread increases friction between tires and roads.\n\n2. **Material Properties** – Rubber tires are made from specific materials chosen because they are flexible, durable, and create good friction with asphalt and concrete.\n\n3. **Design and Engineering** – The tread pattern is deliberately designed to solve a real-world problem: keeping vehicles safe by maintaining grip on various road conditions.\n\n4. **Surface Area** – The grooves in tire tread create more surface area for the rubber to contact the road, which strengthens the grip and improves traction.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching about tire tread, help students make a personal connection by asking them to think about their own shoes. Do their sneakers or rain boots have special patterns on the bottom? This bridges everyday observation to the scientific principle of friction and grip.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple ways for students to explore this concept: tactile (touching real tire tread samples), visual (examining high-quality photos or videos), and kinesthetic (sliding objects across smooth vs. textured surfaces). Allow students to demonstrate understanding through drawings, verbal explanations, or physical models—not just written responses.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n4-PS3-1: Use evidence to construct an explanation relating the speed of an object to the energy of that object.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-PS3.A]] – Energy can make things move; friction is a force that affects motion\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-ETS1.A]] – Defining and delimiting engineering problems involves understanding the constraints of real-world solutions\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] – Tire tread causes increased friction, which affects how well a vehicle can grip the road\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] – The structure (grooves and patterns) of the tire serves the function of improving safety and traction\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think would happen if a tire had no tread at all—just a smooth, flat surface?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **Why might tire tread be especially important on rainy days or icy roads?** (Bloom's: Explain | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **How is the tread pattern on a tire similar to the tread pattern on the bottom of your shoes?** (Bloom's: Compare | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **If you were designing a tire for a race car that only drives on dry roads versus a tire for a truck that drives in snow, how might you make them different?** (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Tread:** The raised pattern or grooves on a tire that help it grip the road.\n* **Friction:** A force created when two surfaces rub together that can slow things down or help them stick to each other.\n* **Traction:** The ability of a tire or shoe to grip a surface without slipping.\n* **Groove:** A long, narrow valley or channel cut into the surface of a tire.\n* **Grip:** The ability to hold onto or stay attached to a surface.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Friction Shoe Experiment:** Have students examine the tread patterns on different types of shoes (sneakers, rain boots, dress shoes).

    "fifthgrade": "# Fifth Grade Science Lesson: Tire Wear and Material Properties\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows several vehicle tires with deep tread patterns—the grooves and ridges molded into the rubber surface. The treads are visibly worn down and dirty, showing how tires change over time from repeated use on roads. In the background, you can see a car wheel and metal rim, which helps you understand how tires are part of a vehicle's system.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** *Why do tire treads wear down over time?*\n\nTire tread wears away due to **friction**—the force created when the rubber tire surface rubs against the road. Every time a car drives, the tire makes contact with the pavement, and tiny bits of rubber are scraped away. This happens repeatedly over thousands of miles of driving. The friction also creates heat, which can speed up the wearing process. Additionally, the weight of the vehicle pressing down on the tire adds pressure that increases wear. Eventually, when treads become too shallow, the tire no longer grips the road safely, and it must be replaced.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Friction:** A force that occurs when two surfaces rub against each other, causing resistance and wear. Friction between the tire and road is what slows down a car and allows it to grip the road.\n\n* **Material Properties and Wear:** Rubber is a material that can be worn away by repeated rubbing and friction. Different materials (like rubber, plastic, or metal) wear at different rates depending on their properties.\n\n* **Force and Motion:** The weight of the vehicle (a downward force) combined with the motion of driving creates continuous stress on tires, which causes them to gradually break down.\n\n* **Energy Transfer:** Friction converts some of the energy from a moving car into heat and wear, which is why tires get warm during driving and eventually deteriorate.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nConsider bringing a worn tire tread gauge or an actual worn tire to class so students can observe the depth difference between new and old treads. This concrete visual makes the abstract concept of friction's effects much more tangible for fifth graders who are still developing abstract reasoning skills.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Representation:** Provide high-contrast close-up photos of tire treads alongside diagrams showing the friction process. For kinesthetic learners, use a worn piece of sandpaper and a smooth piece to physically demonstrate how surfaces change with friction. **Action & Expression:** Allow students to choose between drawing a labeled diagram, creating a digital slide, or building a model to explain tire wear.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n5-PS2-1: Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is downward.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n* [[NGSS:DCI:5-PS2.A]] (Forces and Motion)\n* [[NGSS:DCI:5-PS2.B]] (Types of Interactions)\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]]\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]]\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think would happen to a tire if someone drove a car in circles in the same spot over and over?** (Bloom's: Predict/Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **Why might a race car driver need to change tires more often than someone who drives slowly on quiet streets?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n3. **How could tire companies design a tire that lasts longer without wearing out as quickly?** (Bloom's: Create/Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **Explain the connection between friction, heat, and tire wear. Why do all three happen together?** (Bloom's: Understand/Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n---\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Tread:** The grooved pattern on the surface of a tire that helps it grip the road and channels water away.\n\n* **Friction:** A force that resists motion when two surfaces rub together; it slows things down and can create heat and wear.\n\n* **Wear:** The gradual damage or loss of material that happens when something is used repeatedly over time.\n\n* **Grip:** The ability of a tire to hold firmly to the road surface without slipping.\n\n* **Material Properties:** The characteristics of a substance that describe how it looks, feels, and behaves (like hardness, flexibility, or resistance to wear).\n\n---\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Tire Tread Measurement Lab:** Provide students with pennies, a ruler, and pictures of different tires (or actual tire cross-sections if available). Have them measure tread depth using a penny (inserting Lincoln's head to see how deep the groove is). Students can compare new tires to worn ones and graph their findings. This makes the invisible wear visible and quantifiable.\n\n2. **Friction Exploration Station:** Set up three surfaces (smooth tile, carpeted floor, sandpaper) and have students roll a toy car down ramps of equal height onto each surface. Students measure and record how far the car travels on each surface, then write a conclusion about which surface causes more friction and why this relates to tire wear.\n\n3. **Design a Better Tire Challenge:** In small groups, have students sketch or build a prototype tire (using clay, rubber bands, or other safe materials) that they think would last longer. Students must explain the scientific reasoning behind their design choices (e.g., thicker rubber, different tread patterns, harder material). They can test prototypes by dragging them across sandpaper and comparing wear.\n\n---\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *Tires* by Mari Schuh (Simple Machines series) – Explains how tires work and why they're important.\n* *How Do Wheels Work?* by Thomas K. and Heather Adamson – Covers tires, friction, and vehicle systems in accessible language.\n* *What Do Wheels Do?* by Robin Page – Picture book exploring wheels, tires, and motion.\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n* **\"How Tires Are Made\" by National Geographic Kids** (3 min) – Shows the manufacturing process and explains tire materials; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mzLmx2-FN0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mzLmx2-FN0)\n\n* **\"Friction for Kids\" by ScienceStruck** (5 min) – Animated explanation of friction with relatable tire examples; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj4e6KDVy1k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj4e6KDVy1k)\n\n---"
