ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about motion and electricity using the trolley photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the trolley\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Students' personal experience with transportation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and introduction:** Show students the photograph of the electric trolley. Display it large enough for all students to see clearly. Ask them to look for 30 seconds without talking and notice everything that is \"moving\" or could \"move\" in this picture.\n\n2. **Discussion questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is this vehicle?\"\n   - \"How do you think this trolley moves forward? What makes it go?\"\n   - \"Look at the wires above the trolley. Why might those wires be there? What could they be doing?\"\n   - \"Have you ever ridden on a train, bus, or trolley? How was it different from a car?\"\n\n3. **Prediction/wonder prompt:** \"Let's imagine the trolley is sitting still on its tracks. What do you think needs to happen to make it start moving? Could you push it with your hands, or does it need something else?\" Record student ideas on chart paper without confirming or denying them. Save this to revisit at the end of the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Today, we're going to become investigators and discover what really makes the trolley move. We're going to do some experiments with our own moving vehicles to find out.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how different amounts of force affect how objects move, creating evidence similar to what powers the trolley.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small toy cars or wheeled vehicles (4-5 available, or use the same car rotated between groups)\n- Straight tracks or smooth table surfaces (or clear a smooth floor path, or use a meter stick as a \"track\")\n- Rubber bands (various thicknesses/strengths)\n- Tape (masking tape to mark starting lines and finish lines)\n- Meter sticks or measuring tapes\n- Student recording sheets (one per student pair or group)\n- Pushes or pulls: Students' hands, rubber band \"motors,\" or spring-loaded starters (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **Setup:** In pairs or small groups, set up your \"trolley track\" on a table or cleared floor space. Use tape to mark a starting line and a finish line about 1 meter (3 feet) apart.\n\n2. **Investigation 1 - Gentle push:** Place your toy car at the starting line. Give the car a *gentle push* with your finger. Observe: How far does it go before stopping? Measure the distance and record it on your sheet. Write or draw what happened.\n\n3. **Investigation 2 - Medium push:** Place the car back at the starting line. This time, give it a *stronger push*. How far does it go now? Measure and record. Compare: Is it farther or shorter than the gentle push?\n\n4. **Investigation 3 - Strong push:** Place the car at the starting line one more time. Push it as *hard as you can* (keeping it safe and on your track). Measure how far it travels. Record this distance.\n\n5. **Investigation 4 - Rubber band power (if available):** If your teacher provided rubber band \"motors,\" attach one to your car and stretch it before releasing. This simulates how electrical energy powers the trolley. Record how far the car travels.\n\n6. **Record and draw:** On your recording sheet, draw three simple pictures showing: the gentle push car, the medium push car, and the strong push car. Label which traveled the farthest.\n\n**How this connects to the photograph:** \"Just like your gentle push, medium push, and strong push made the car go different distances, the electric trolley's motor can go faster or slower depending on how much electrical power it gets from those overhead wires. More power = faster movement!\"\n\n**What students should record or document:**\n- Measured distances for each push (in meters or feet)\n- Drawings comparing the three scenarios\n- A statement or simple sentence: \"When I pushed harder, the car went _____ (farther/shorter).\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the distance when you pushed harder?\" and \"Does a stronger push always make things go farther?\"\n- Prevent pushing cars off tables; ensure safety.\n- Help students measure if needed, but allow them to estimate and discover.\n- Do NOT explain why—let them observe.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \nStudents will discover and document that *greater force (stronger push) causes objects to move farther and faster*. They will also observe that all cars eventually stop, providing a foundation for discussing balanced and unbalanced forces.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect hands-on discoveries to the trolley photograph using formal science language.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of trolley (displayed again)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Visual anchor chart with vocabulary words and simple pictures\n- Student-friendly vocabulary cards (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore phase:** Ask 2-3 groups to share their results briefly. \"Who discovered that a stronger push made their car go farther?\" (Most hands will raise.) Write on chart paper: \"Stronger force = Car goes farther.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with Third Grade-friendly definitions:**\n\n   - **Force:** A push or a pull. When you push the car, you're using force. The trolley's motor creates a force that makes it move.\n   - **Motion:** When something is moving or changing position. The car moving down the track is motion.\n   - **Energy:** Power that makes things work or move. Electricity is a type of energy. Your muscles have energy too!\n   - **Speed:** How fast something is moving. A gentle push made the car move at a slow speed. A hard push made it move at a fast speed.\n   - **Electric motor:** A machine that uses electrical energy to create a force that makes things spin or move. The trolley has an electric motor that uses power from those overhead wires!\n\n3. **Connections back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Look at the trolley again. See those black wires above it? Electric power travels through those wires into the trolley's motor. The motor creates a FORCE that pushes the wheels forward—just like your hands pushed the car!\"\n   - \"The trolley's wheels on the track work like your car on the table. The track keeps it going straight, just like the tape on your table guided your car.\"\n   - \"When the trolley needs to go faster, the motor gets MORE electrical energy. When it needs to slow down, it gets LESS energy. This is like your gentle push versus your strong push!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding strategy:**\n   - Ask: \"If I want the trolley to go faster, should I send MORE electrical energy or LESS electrical energy?\"\n   - Ask: \"What is the force in our experiment?\" (Your push!)\n   - Ask: \"What is the force in the trolley?\" (The electrical motor!)\n   - Use thumbs up/middle/down to assess: \"Thumbs up if this makes sense, thumbs middle if you're not sure, thumbs down if you're confused.\" Clarify as needed.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Force** | A push or pull that can make something move or change how it moves. |\n| **Motion** | When something is moving or changing position from one place to another. |\n| **Energy** | Power that makes things work. Electricity is energy, and so is the energy in your muscles. |\n| **Speed** | How fast something is moving. Fast or slow. |\n| **Electric motor** | A machine that uses electricity to create movement. It uses electrical energy to push or pull things. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \nStudents will understand that force causes motion, stronger forces cause faster/farther motion, and electricity powers the trolley's motor to create the force that moves it. They will use vocabulary in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of force and motion to a new scenario and predict motion patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Toy cars from Explore phase\n- Ramps (or create simple ramps using textbooks and cardboard)\n- Rulers or meter sticks\n- Masking tape for marking distances\n- Prediction worksheets or whiteboards\n- Optional: Videos of trolleys/trains in action (30 seconds)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **New scenario - Gravity creates a different force:** \n   - Introduce a ramp. \"We've been using our hands to push cars. But there's another force in the world called gravity—it's a pull, not a push. Gravity pulls things down. Let's see what happens when gravity gives the car a force.\"\n   - Show students releasing a car from the top of a ramp.\n\n2. **Prediction activity:**\n   - Ask: \"If I release this car from the TOP of the ramp, how far do you think it will go compared to our gentle push? What about our strong push? Why do you think that?\"\n   - Have students draw or write their prediction.\n\n3. **Investigation with ramp:**\n   - Release the car from the top. Measure how far it travels.\n   - Ask: \"Was your prediction right? Did gravity's force make the car go farther than your push?\"\n   - Release it again from halfway down. Compare distances.\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the car went different distances? What was different?\"\n\n4. **Connection back to trolley:**\n   - \"The trolley can't roll down a ramp, but it does change speed. Imagine the trolley going UP a big hill. The gravity pulling it down would make it move slower because it's working against the motor's force. When the trolley goes DOWN a hill, gravity and the motor's force work together, so it might go faster! That's why the trolley's electrical power has to be really strong.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Ask questions that guide discovery: \"What was different this time?\" \"Do you think the force was stronger or weaker?\"\n- Help students connect gravity (a new force) to their understanding of force and motion.\n- Celebrate when students revise their predictions based on evidence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \nStudents will observe that different forces (human push, gravity, electric motor) cause motion and speed changes. They will understand that forces can work together (motor + gravity on downhill) or against each other (motor vs. gravity on uphill).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of force, motion, and how energy powers the trolley.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessments used during the lesson:**\n- Observation during Explore: Did students notice the relationship between push strength and distance traveled?\n- Thumbs up/middle/down check during Explain: Could students answer the \"more/less energy\" question?\n- Prediction accuracy in Elaborate: Did students make reasonable predictions and revise them based on evidence?\n\n**Exit ticket (end of Session 1 or 2):** \nGive each student a simple exit ticket with 2-3 questions. They can draw, write, or circle answers:\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Draw or write:** \"What makes the trolley move forward?\" (Accept: electricity, electrical power, motor, wires)\n\n2. **Circle the right answer:** \"When a force is STRONGER, does the trolley go ___?\"\n   - Faster / Slower / The same speed\n\n3. **True or False (or draw yes/no):** \"The overhead wires give electrical energy to the trolley's motor.\" ___\n\n4. **Bonus:** \"If the trolley needs to climb a big hill, would it need MORE electrical energy or LESS electrical energy? Why?\"\n\n**Success criteria for student understanding:**\n- ✓ Student can identify that electricity/electrical energy powers the trolley.\n- ✓ Student can explain that stronger force causes faster or farther motion (demonstrated through Explore, Elaborate, or exit ticket).\n- ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary word correctly (force, motion, energy, speed, or motor).\n- ✓ Student makes a reasonable prediction about how forces affect motion and can compare it to results.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \nMost third graders will demonstrate understanding that force causes motion and that stronger forces cause greater changes in motion. Some will use precise vocabulary; others will use their own words. All should understand the basic connection between the trolley's overhead wires, electrical energy, and motion.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Visual anchors and vocabulary pictures:** Create a large classroom anchor chart with pictures of FORCE (arrow pushing car), MOTION (car with movement lines), and ENERGY (lightning bolt next to trolley). Post it permanently and reference it throughout.\n\n2. **Partner with a strong learner:** During Explore, pair a student who struggles with recording/measurement with a peer who can help document distances. The struggling student can focus on observing and making predictions.\n\n3. **Simplified recording sheet:** Offer a pre-made recording sheet with blanks to fill in rather than expecting independent writing. Example: \"When I pushed GENTLY, the car went _____ units. When I pushed STRONGLY, the car went _____ units. Stronger push = car goes _____.\"\n\n4. **Concrete vocabulary connections:** Instead of abstract definitions, use real-world examples: \"Force is like a push—like when you push a swing\" or \"Energy is like fuel that makes things go—like food makes YOUR body move!\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Investigate multiple variables:** Ask advanced students: \"What if the table was bumpy? What if the car was heavier or lighter? How would that change how far the force makes it go?\" Have them design and conduct their own investigation with one variable.\n\n2. **Deeper math connection:** Have students create a bar graph comparing distances from their three push strengths. Ask: \"How much farther did the strong push go than the gentle push?\" (Simple subtraction and comparison.)\n\n3. **Real-world research question:** \"How do you think the trolley's driver controls how fast it goes? What would happen if they sent less electrical energy to the motor? More?\" Encourage them to research or predict based on analogy to the car experiment.\n\n4. **Explain balanced and unbalanced forces:** Introduce the concept: \"You noticed the car stopped eventually. That's because friction (rubbing) and air are forces pushing BACK against the motion. When the push force is stronger, the car goes farther. That's UNBALANCED forces. When forces balance, nothing moves. Can you think of an example?\" (Car parked and not moving = balanced forces.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Build and test a simple electric circuit (connection to energy):** \n   - In a follow-up lesson, show students a basic battery, wire, and small motor. Demonstrate how electrical energy flows from the battery through the wire to make the motor spin. Connect this to the trolley's overhead wires delivering electrical energy to its motor. This deepens understanding of electrical energy as a real, transferable power source. (Requires electrical safety training; must be teacher-supervised.)\n\n2. **Trolley route mapping and speed prediction:**\n   - Provide a simple map of a trolley route with hills, flat sections, and curves. Ask students to predict where the trolley might go fastest, slowest, and where the motor might need the most electrical power. Have them color-code the route (green = fast, yellow = medium, red = slow) and explain their reasoning based on forces and energy. This applies motion concepts to real-world planning.\n\n3. **Design a paper car ramp challenge:**\n   - Give students a small ramp, a paper car they decorate, and a challenge: \"Design the ramp so your car travels exactly 2 meters. You can change the height of the ramp, the weight of the car (by adding pennies), or the surface texture (by adding tape or sandpaper).\" This deepens their understanding of how different forces and conditions affect motion and encourages scientific design thinking.\n\n4. **Field trip or virtual tour (if available):**\n   - If your school is near a trolley or light rail system, plan a brief field trip to observe the trolley in action. Students can watch the overhead wires, observe it speeding up and slowing down, and count how many people it carries. If not possible, use a 2-3 minute video of a trolley in action and have students narrate what forces they think are acting (motor power, gravity, friction, brakes).\n\n---\n\n## Reflection for Teachers\n\nThis lesson successfully bridges the abstract concept of electrical energy with the concrete, observable relationship between force and motion. By having students physically experience how force affects motion before explaining the trolley's electric motor, they build a genuine, experiential foundation for understanding energy conversion. The trolley photograph serves as both a hook and a real-world anchor—students recognize that the concepts they discovered apply to actual vehicles that move people in their communities.\n\nThe progression (hand-push forces → gravity forces → electrical energy) gradually builds complexity while maintaining engagement. Third graders naturally understand pushing and gravity through play; connecting these to invisible electrical energy is the intellectual leap, supported by the Explore and Elaborate phases.\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n- Collect student predictions at the start and revisit them at the end to show growth.\n- Take photos or video of student cars moving to create a visual record of different speeds/distances.\n- If time is limited, skip the ramp section and focus on the core hand-push investigations and trolley connection.",
