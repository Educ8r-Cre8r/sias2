Describe the observable properties of different materials (strong, flexible, rigid, light, heavy) using their own observations and words.\n2. Classify materials by their properties and explain why certain materials work better for specific jobs.\n3. Identify that machines like cranes are made from strong materials that help us lift and move things we couldn't move by ourselves.\n4. Plan and conduct a fair test to find out which material is best for holding a heavy load.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the truck with crane (displayed on smartboard, projector, or printed poster)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Introduction:** Project or display the photograph of the white Ford truck with the extended boom crane. Ask students to look carefully for 15 seconds without talking—just observe.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe what the big arm on top of the truck is doing.\"\n   - \"Why do you think this truck has such a long arm sticking out? What job is it trying to do?\"\n   - \"Do you think a person could lift that big round ball hanging from the rope without this machine? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What parts do you notice on the crane? Point to the metal parts, the ropes, the hook.\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what this machine is made of and why those materials were chosen. Let's find out what makes some materials better for lifting heavy things!\"\n\n4. **Prior Knowledge Activation:** Ask students to turn to a partner and share: \"Have you ever used a tool or machine to help you do something? What was it, and how did it help?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become material scientists and find out which materials are strongest for building lifting machines, just like this crane!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover properties of materials through hands-on testing.\n\n**Materials:** (Per group of 2-3 students)\n- Various material samples: aluminum foil, plastic wrap, paper towel, paper coffee filter, fabric scrap, newspaper, tissue paper, aluminum soda can (empty), plastic cup (empty), cardboard piece\n- 5-10 small washers or metal weights (or substitute with pennies in a small plastic bag)\n- String or yarn (one piece per group, about 12 inches)\n- Tape (masking tape works well)\n- Ruler\n- Small bucket or container\n- Chart paper titled \"Material Testing Record\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"You are going to test different materials to see which ones are strong enough to hold weights. Your job is to be careful scientists.\"\n\n2. \"Pick one material from your pile. Feel it in your hands. Does it feel stiff or bendy? Is it thick or thin?\"\n\n3. \"Create a 'sling' by taping your material to a piece of string, like a hammock. Make sure it's secure. Your teacher will show you how.\"\n\n4. \"Hold the string ends and carefully place weights into the material sling, one at a time. Count how many weights it holds before it tears, breaks, or stretches too much.\"\n\n5. \"Record your results on the chart: the material name, how it felt (bendy/stiff), and how many weights it held.\"\n\n6. \"Repeat with 3-4 different materials.\"\n\n7. \"When done, look at all your results. Which material held the most weights? Which one broke first?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and observe without providing the answer to which material is \"strongest.\"\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about that material? Why do you think it held more weights?\"\n- Help students record data accurately on their chart.\n- Ensure students are being safe and not dropping heavy objects.\n- Prompt students to use descriptive words: \"Is this material stiff like a board, or bendy like a rubber band?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will discover that materials like aluminum cans and cardboard hold more weights than tissue paper or plastic wrap.\n- Students will observe and record the physical properties of each material (stiffness, thickness, flexibility).\n- Students will create a data record showing the weight-holding ability of each tested material.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student data charts from Explore phase\n- Large poster or chart with vocabulary words and pictures\n- The original photograph of the crane (displayed again)\n- Picture cards of different materials (metal, plastic, wood, fabric)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Invite 2-3 groups to share their results. Ask the whole class: \"Why do you think the aluminum can held so many weights? What did you notice about how it felt compared to the tissue paper?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary:**\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Material** | What something is made of—like plastic, metal, paper, or fabric. |\n| **Property** | A characteristic or feature you can observe about something, like if it's hard, soft, bendy, stiff, thick, or thin. |\n| **Strong** | A material that doesn't break or tear easily when force is applied to it. |\n| **Flexible/Bendy** | A material that can bend without breaking (like rubber). |\n| **Rigid/Stiff** | A material that doesn't bend easily and keeps its shape (like metal or cardboard). |\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - \"Look at the crane truck again. What material do you think it's made of? Yes—metal! Metal is very strong and stiff. That's why the crane can lift such a heavy ball.\"\n   - Point to the boom (extended arm): \"This is made of metal because it needs to be rigid—it can't bend or sag under the weight.\"\n   - Point to the cables/ropes: \"These are made of strong material like steel wire because they need to hold the heavy load without breaking.\"\n   - \"The truck bed is made of strong metal too, because it has to support the weight of the boom and the things it lifts.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we made this crane boom out of tissue paper instead of metal, what would happen? Why?\"\n   - \"Which material from our test would be best for making the hook on the crane? Why did you choose that?\"\n   - Partner talk: \"Turn to your neighbor and explain why machines that lift heavy things need to be made from strong, rigid materials.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Material:** What something is made of (plastic, metal, paper, fabric, wood).\n- **Property:** A feature you can see, feel, or observe about something (hard, soft, smooth, rough, bendy, stiff, heavy, light).\n- **Strong:** Doesn't break or tear easily when force is applied.\n- **Rigid:** Stiff; doesn't bend; keeps its shape.\n- **Flexible:** Bendy; can bend without breaking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can use the vocabulary words to describe the materials they tested.\n- Students understand that the crane is made of strong, rigid materials because it needs to lift heavy objects.\n- Students can explain (in their own words) why material choice matters for a job.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of material properties to a new, real-world context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or magazine cutouts showing: a bridge, a tent, a drinking straw, a boat, a shovel, a rope\n- Large paper or poster board\n- Markers\n- Optional: foam/craft materials to build a simple model\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Material Matching Challenge**\n\n1. Display pictures of different objects (bridge, tent, drinking straw, boat, shovel, strong rope).\n\n2. Show students 4-5 material samples (strong cardboard, thin plastic wrap, aluminum foil, fabric, thick paper, metal washer, wooden stick).\n\n3. \"Now you're going to match materials to jobs! For each object, choose which material you think it should be made from. Why did you choose that material? What property does it need?\"\n\n4. Students work in small groups to match and explain their thinking on a chart:\n\n| **Object** | **Best Material** | **Why? (What property does it need?)** |\n|---|---|---|\n| Bridge | Metal/Steel | It needs to be very strong and rigid to hold up cars. |\n| Tent | Fabric | It needs to be flexible so it can fold up, but strong enough to protect us from weather. |\n\n5. Facilitate discussion: \"Look at the bridge match. Why can't we make a bridge out of tissue paper? What would happen?\"\n\n**Option B: Design Challenge (If Time Allows)**\n\n\"Engineers at construction companies need to design a new crane boom. What materials would you use? Build a simple model using classroom materials that shows which parts need to be strong and rigid.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Guide students to explain their thinking using the vocabulary (strong, rigid, flexible, property).\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"Does this object need to be bendy or stiff? Does it need to hold weight or be light?\"\n- Affirm correct reasoning about material properties matching job requirements.\n- Challenge students: \"What if the material wasn't strong enough? What would go wrong?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can justify material choices based on observable properties and job requirements.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that different jobs need different material properties.\n- Students apply concepts from their testing to new, real-world scenarios.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of material properties and their connection to machine function.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Can they accurately describe material properties? Do they record data carefully?\n- Monitor group discussions in Elaborate phase: Are students using vocabulary correctly? Can they explain why materials matter?\n- Listen to student explanations: Do they reference observable properties when making choices?\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple worksheet or ask them to draw and write answers to these questions:\n\n1. **Picture prompt:** Show a picture of a heavy object (like a truck engine or a refrigerator). Ask: \"What material should we use to make a box to carry this heavy object? Circle one: tissue paper, plastic wrap, or thick metal. Why did you choose that?\"\n\n2. **Explanation question:** \"Why is the crane truck made of metal instead of plastic? Use a word from our vocabulary list in your answer.\" (Students write or dictate 1-2 sentences.)\n\n3. **Observation question:** \"Name one material we tested that was strong and stiff. Name one that was bendy. What property makes them different?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Student correctly identifies a strong, rigid material for holding heavy objects (not tissue paper or plastic wrap).\n\n✓ Student explains their choice using at least one property word (strong, stiff, rigid, etc.).\n\n✓ Student can describe the difference between flexible and rigid materials.\n\n✓ Student makes a connection between the material's property and its job in the crane or lifting machine.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most second graders can identify metal/strong cardboard as better than fragile materials for heavy lifting.\n- Students use at least one property-based vocabulary word in their explanation.\n- Students show understanding that material choice is connected to what a machine needs to do.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Material Choices:** Provide only 3-4 clearly different materials (aluminum can, tissue paper, plastic bag, thick cardboard) rather than 8-10 options. Reduce cognitive load.\n\n2. **Guided Charting:** Pre-draw the recording chart with pictures of each material. Students only need to mark how many weights it held, not write descriptions. Provide sentence frames: \"This material is _____ (bendy/stiff). It held _____ weights.\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary Visual Support:** Create a classroom poster showing each vocabulary word with a picture and a simple symbol (stiff = straight arrow, bendy = curved arrow, strong = flexed muscle). Point to the poster during discussions.\n\n4. **Partner Pairing:** Pair struggling readers/writers with a confident student during Explore and Elaborate. The partner helps record and read aloud the vocabulary.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Hypothesis Prediction:** Before testing, ask: \"Which material do you think will hold the most weights? Why do you predict that?\" Have students write or draw their prediction. After testing, compare: \"Was your prediction correct? What did you learn?\"\n\n2. **Material Combination Testing:** \"What if we combined two materials—like tape a piece of plastic wrap to the aluminum can? Would it be stronger or weaker? Let's test it!\" This introduces the concept that combining materials can change properties.\n\n3. **Design a Stronger Crane:** \"The crane in the picture lifts one big ball. If it needed to lift two balls twice as heavy, what changes would you make to the crane? What materials would you use? Draw and label your design.\"\n\n4. **Research Extension:** Provide simple pictures/text about real-world machines (bulldozers, excavators, bridges). Ask: \"What materials do you see? Why do you think the engineers chose those materials?\" Students create a poster explaining their findings.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Materials Around the Classroom\" Scavenger Hunt:**\n   Students walk around the classroom identifying objects made from different materials (metal scissors, plastic pencil box, wooden desk, fabric chair). They sort pictures into a chart: \"Strong and Stiff,\" \"Flexible and Bendy.\" Discuss why each material was chosen for that object.\n\n2. **Build a Paper Crane (Non-Moving Version):**\n   Provide origami directions to fold a simple paper crane. Afterward, discuss: \"We can fold paper into a crane shape, but a real crane machine is made of metal. Why can't a paper crane actually lift things?\" This reinforces the concept that the material limits what the machine can do.\n\n3. **\"Test a New Material\" Investigation at Home:**\n   Send a note home asking families to help their child test a material found at home (plastic bag, aluminum foil, dish towel, newspaper) using the same method: \"Can it hold pennies without tearing?\" Students bring results back to share. Create a class chart of all tested materials. Celebrate that scientists test many materials!\n\n---\n\n**Lesson Completion Notes for Teachers:**\n\nThis lesson directly addresses the 2-PS1-1 and 2-PS1-2 standards by having students observe, describe, and classify materials by their properties, then analyze data to determine which materials work best for specific purposes (lifting heavy loads). The photograph of the crane provides an authentic, engaging context that helps second graders understand why material choice matters in real engineering and design. The hands-on testing in the Explore phase is crucial—students discover relationships independently before formal vocabulary is introduced, which deepens understanding and retention.",
