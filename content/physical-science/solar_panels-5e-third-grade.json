ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of solar panels.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of solar panels on a rooftop (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small flashlight\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Give students 1-2 minutes to look silently and observe without commenting.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see on top of this building? What are these blue-black rectangle shapes?\"\n   - \"Why do you think these panels are placed on the roof where the sun shines, and not under the house in the shade?\"\n   - \"What do you think these panels are doing? What purpose might they have?\"\n   - \"Have you ever felt the sun warm your skin? What if we could capture that warmth and energy to use it?\"\n\n3. **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Ask, \"What does your home or school need electricity for? Where does electricity come from?\" Record ideas on chart paper.\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** Say, \"I wonder if the sun could be like a battery that powers things. Today, we're going to investigate how sunlight can be caught and turned into energy that makes things work!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore how sunlight becomes energy by doing our own investigation with materials that act like mini solar panels.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the relationship between sunlight direction and energy capture through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per pair/small group):**\n- Flashlight (or access to sunny window)\n- Small solar calculator OR small solar-powered toy (if available—these work well without batteries)\n- Black construction paper\n- White construction paper\n- Small object to power (solar toy car, solar fan, or solar light)\n- Notebook or paper for recording observations\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring angle)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Test 1: Sunlight Position Matters**\n   - Take your solar-powered device (e.g., solar calculator) or use a flashlight pointed at a toy with a small solar panel.\n   - Shine the light **directly at the panel** for 10 seconds. Record what happens. Does it turn on? How bright or strong is the response?\n   - Now shine the light **at an angle** (tilted, not straight on). Record what happens. Is the response different?\n   - Finally, shine the light **to the side or away from the panel**. Record what happens.\n   - **Question to investigate:** Does the direction of sunlight matter for solar panels to work?\n\n2. **Test 2: Sunlight Obstruction**\n   - Place **black construction paper** between the light source and the solar panel. What happens?\n   - Place **white construction paper** between the light source and the solar panel. What happens?\n   - Record your observations. Which color blocks more light?\n\n3. **Test 3: Angle of the Sun**\n   - Angle the flashlight so it hits the panel straight on (90-degree angle).\n   - Then tilt the flashlight so the light hits at a shallow angle (30 degrees).\n   - Which angle makes the solar panel work better? Why might that be?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to each group and ask guiding questions: \"What did you notice when you changed the direction of light?\" \"What happened when you blocked the light?\"\n- Avoid explaining; instead, encourage students to make their own observations: \"What do YOU think is happening?\"\n- Help groups manage materials and stay focused on the investigation.\n- Remind students to record **what they see, hear, and feel** during their tests.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students discover that solar panels work best when light hits them **directly and straight on**.\n- Students observe that **blocking light stops the energy transfer**.\n- Students record observations showing cause (sunlight direction/intensity) and effect (panel response/power).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect discoveries to the photograph and real-world solar technology.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of solar panels (displayed again)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Vocabulary cards with images\n- Diagram of how sunlight becomes electricity (simple, drawn or printed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask each group: \"What did you discover about sunlight and solar panels?\"\n   - Record findings on chart paper using student language.\n   - Guide them to notice patterns: \"Everyone found that direct light works better. Why might that be?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Write and define each term on vocabulary cards with simple drawings:\n\n   | **Vocabulary** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Solar** | \"Related to the sun; solar means 'from the sun.'\" |\n   | **Solar Panel** | \"A special flat tool that catches sunlight and turns it into electricity.\" |\n   | **Energy** | \"Power that makes things work and move. Sunlight is one kind of energy.\" |\n   | **Electricity** | \"Energy that flows through wires to power lights, computers, and other things in your home.\" |\n   | **Cause** | \"What happens first—in our case, sunlight shining on a panel.\" |\n   | **Effect** | \"What happens because of the cause—the panel producing electricity.\" |\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the solar panels on the rooftop in the photograph.\n   - \"These panels are positioned on the roof because that's where sunlight hits most directly and strongly. The sun's energy is caught by the panels and turned into electricity. That electricity goes through wires and pipes to power the lights and appliances inside the building!\"\n   - \"Just like in our investigation, these real panels work best when the sun shines straight on them.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think solar panels are on top of buildings, not in basements?\"\n   - Ask: \"What would happen to a solar panel if clouds covered the sun all day?\"\n   - Ask: \"Can you point to the cause and effect in our investigation?\" (Cause: we shined the light; Effect: the panel powered up)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Solar:** Related to or coming from the sun.\n- **Solar Panel:** A device that captures sunlight and changes it into electricity.\n- **Energy:** Power that makes things work, move, and change. The sun provides energy.\n- **Electricity:** Energy that travels through wires and powers our lights and devices.\n- **Cause:** The reason something happens (the sunlight).\n- **Effect:** What happens as a result (the solar panel producing power).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that solar panels **use sunlight energy to make electricity**.\n- Students can explain the **cause-and-effect relationship**: sunlight (cause) → electricity (effect).\n- Students recognize why solar panels must face the sun and be positioned to receive direct light.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing and testing a solution to a real-world energy problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small cardboard boxes or foil/reflective material\n- Solar-powered toy or light\n- Various materials to test: aluminum foil, white paper, black paper, plastic wrap, cloth\n- Tape\n- Ruler or protractor (optional, for measuring angles)\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge: Design a Better Solar Collector**\n\nExplain: \"Imagine you want to collect as much sunlight as possible for your solar panel. What could you build around it to help? Some people use mirrors and reflectors to bounce more light onto the panel.\"\n\n**Student Task:**\n\n1. Your group will design and build a **simple reflector or shade structure** around your solar panel to test whether you can make it work better (collect more light) or protect it from too much heat.\n\n2. **Options for investigation:**\n   - **Option A:** Use aluminum foil or reflective material to build a **reflector** around the panel. Can you bounce more light onto it? Does it work better?\n   - **Option B:** Use materials to build a **shade or protective cover**. Does blocking some sunlight help or hurt the panel?\n\n3. **Steps:**\n   - Sketch your design on paper first.\n   - Build your structure using the materials provided.\n   - Test it with your solar panel using the flashlight.\n   - Measure or observe: Does your design work? Is the effect stronger or weaker?\n   - Record your results.\n\n4. **Share Your Design:**\n   - Each group shows their creation and explains what they discovered.\n   - \"What did you design? What were you trying to improve? Did it work? How do you know?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Provide an example of a simple reflector made with foil to demonstrate the task.\n- Ask probing questions: \"What do you think will happen if you angle the reflector this way?\"\n- Encourage iteration: \"Your first idea didn't work as expected. What would you try differently?\"\n- Celebrate effort and scientific thinking, not just success.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students design and build a functional structure to test their hypothesis about light and solar energy.\n- Students provide evidence (observations from testing) that their design either improved or did not improve solar panel performance.\n- Students apply cause-and-effect thinking to a new problem: \"If I add a reflector (cause), more light hits the panel (effect), so it produces more power (effect).\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of cause-and-effect relationships with solar energy and their ability to ask questions about energy transfer.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore: Do they test different light directions? Do they record observations?\n- Listen to student explanations during Group Share-Out in Explain phase.\n- Assess Design Task: Can students explain their design reasoning and test results?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) — Administer at the end of Session 2:**\n\nProvide each student with a sheet containing these prompts:\n\n1. **Draw and label a cause-and-effect diagram:**\n   - On the left, draw the SUN shining on a solar panel.\n   - Draw an arrow to the right.\n   - On the right, draw what HAPPENS (electricity/power).\n   - Label your drawings with words or the teacher can scribe.\n\n2. **Answer these questions (students can draw, write, or tell the teacher):**\n   - \"What does a solar panel do?\"\n   - \"Why do you think solar panels are put on rooftops instead of in dark basements?\"\n   - \"What would happen to a solar panel if thick clouds covered the sun all day?\"\n\n3. **Ask a Question:**\n   - \"What is ONE question you have about solar panels or sunlight energy?\" (Students ask questions; teacher records them.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Correctly identify **sunlight as the cause** and **electricity/power as the effect**.\n- ✓ Explain that solar panels **use sunlight to make energy**.\n- ✓ Recognize that **direct sunlight is needed** for solar panels to work well.\n- ✓ Ask **at least one meaningful question** about how solar energy works (e.g., \"Can solar panels work in winter?\" \"What happens on cloudy days?\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students provide evidence through drawings and explanations that they understand cause-and-effect with solar energy.\n- Students articulate why solar panel placement matters.\n- Students pose questions showing curiosity about energy from the sun, indicating readiness for deeper exploration.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Investigation:** Provide pre-made solar panels or solar calculators. Focus only on two conditions (direct light vs. angled light) rather than three. Allow students to use picture cards to record results instead of writing.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:** Pre-teach vocabulary using images and real objects. Create a word wall with solar panels, sunlight, electricity, and energy. Use consistent, repeated language during discussions.\n\n3. **Structured Note-Taking:** Provide a template with sentence frames:\n   - \"When I shined the light ______, the panel _______.\"\n   - \"The solar panel works best when _______.\"\n   - Scribe responses for students who struggle with writing.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Angle Measurement:** Have advanced students use a protractor or ruler to measure the angle of light in each test. Ask them to graph their results: \"At what angle does the solar panel produce the most energy?\" This connects to 3-PS2-2 (making measurements to predict motion/patterns).\n\n2. **Real-World Research:** Ask students to research and report: \"Where do solar panels work best in the world—places with lots of sun or places with fewer sunny days? Why?\" They can create a map or infographic.\n\n3. **Design Challenge Extension:** \"Design a solar panel system for a location that doesn't get much direct sun. How could you still collect solar energy?\" (Examples: reflective mirrors, tracking systems that follow the sun, or positioned at different angles.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Solar Energy Around Our School:** Take students on a walk around the school/neighborhood to look for solar panels, solar lights, or solar-powered devices. Document with photos or drawings. Return to class and discuss: \"Why do you think people installed solar panels here? What does it power?\" Create a class map marking solar energy locations.\n\n2. **Build a Solar Oven:** Use a pizza box, plastic wrap, aluminum foil, and black paper to build a simple solar oven. Place it in sunlight and measure the temperature inside over time. Test: Can it warm water or melt chocolate? This demonstrates energy transfer from light to heat in a tangible, engaging way.\n\n3. **Energy Diary:** For one week, students keep an \"Energy Diary\" noting when they see the sun and what it does (warms them, helps plants grow, powers solar panels, etc.). Create a classroom chart of all the ways solar energy affects their daily lives. This connects to real-world observation of energy around them.\n\n---",
