Observe and describe the physical properties of bubble solution (texture, color changes, flexibility).\n2. Explain how light interacts with the thin soap film to create the rainbow colors seen on bubbles.\n3. Predict and test how different forces affect bubble formation and movement.\n4. Classify materials based on their properties (what makes a good bubble solution).\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about bubbles and activate prior knowledge about light and color.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph projected on screen or printed copies for small groups\n- One pre-made bubble wand with bubble solution (teacher demonstration)\n- Outdoor space or well-ventilated indoor area\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image of the hand with the iridescent bubble. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds before speaking.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What colors do you see on this bubble? Where do you think those colors come from?\" (Students often assume paint or food coloring; this activates misconceptions.)\n   - \"Why do you think the bubble has all these different colors when it's made from soap and water?\"\n   - \"What do you notice about the shape of the bubble? Is it solid or can it bend and move?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a bubble pop? What do you think happens to the soap and water inside?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder if all bubbles make rainbow colors, or if something special is happening here. Let's investigate!\"\n\n4. **Teacher Demonstration:** Blow 2–3 bubbles slowly while students observe the colors. Ask, \"Did you see colors before the bubble popped? What changed?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become bubble scientists and discover why bubbles have rainbows and how we can control them with our hands and tools.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate bubble properties and discover the relationship between thin films, light, and color through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3–4 students):**\n- Bubble solution (pre-made: 1 cup water + 2 tablespoons dish soap + 1 tablespoon corn syrup)\n- Various bubble wands: plastic wands, pipe cleaner wands, string loops, straws\n- Small shallow cups or bowls for bubble solution\n- Paper towels\n- Observation sheet (printed template below)\n- Flashlight or access to natural light near a window\n- Optional: dark construction paper to hold behind bubbles\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Bubble Creation & Observation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute Materials:** Assign each group a bubble solution cup and various wands.\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Dip your wand into the solution slowly. Do NOT shake it.\"\n   - \"Gently blow or wave the wand to create a bubble.\"\n   - \"Observe the bubble carefully. Draw or write what you see:\"\n     - What colors appear on the bubble?\n     - Are the colors in the same place each time?\n     - Is the bubble shiny or dull?\n     - What shape is it?\n   - \"Try creating bubbles in different light (by the window, in dimmer areas). Do the colors change?\"\n\n3. **Record Findings:** Students sketch the bubble and label the colors they observe. They note whether the colors changed when they moved the bubble to different lighting.\n\n**Part B: Testing Bubble Movement (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Create a bubble. Now, try these things very gently:\"\n     - Touch the bubble lightly with your finger. What happens?\n     - Move the wand quickly through the air. How does the bubble move?\n     - Blow gently at a floating bubble. Does it move? Does it pop?\n   - \"Record: What force or action made the bubble move? What made it pop?\"\n\n2. **Teacher Facilitation Role:**\n   - Circulate without correcting; ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Did you expect that?\"\n   - Use a clipboard to note which students observe color changes and which notice the bubble's flexibility.\n   - Avoid explaining why colors appear; save that for Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and document multiple colors on bubbles (typically blue, pink, yellow, green).\n- Students discover that bubbles are flexible and can move with gentle force.\n- Students notice that colors seem to shift or change as the bubble moves or ages.\n- Records include sketches and written observations (even if invented spelling is used).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and scientific concepts about light, thin films, and properties of matter. Connect observations to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Whiteboard or chart paper\n- Markers\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: diagram of light reflecting off soap film (teacher-prepared)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3–4 groups to show their bubble sketches and share what colors they observed.\n   - Ask: \"Did everyone see the same colors? Why might the colors have been different?\"\n\n2. **Mini-Lesson: The Science of Bubbles (10 minutes)**\n\n   Begin with the photograph on screen again.\n\n   **Explain using student-friendly language:**\n   \n   \"When you blow a bubble, you create a **thin film** of soapy water. This film is so thin you can barely see it, but it's special! Here's what makes the colors:\n   \n   - When white light from the sun (or a light bulb) hits the thin soap film, something amazing happens.\n   - The light bounces off the **outside** of the film AND the **inside** of the film.\n   - These bouncing lights interfere with each other, and depending on the thickness of the film right there, different colors come out.\n   - As the bubble gets older, the film gets thinner in some spots and thicker in others. That's why colors change and move around!\n   - When the film gets too thin, it can't hold together anymore—POP!\"\n\n   **Use a diagram or hand gestures** to show light entering and bouncing off the soap film.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Introduction:**\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Thin Film** | A very thin layer of liquid (like the soapy water in a bubble) that is so delicate and see-through you can see light bouncing through it. |\n   | **Light Reflection** | When light bounces off a surface (like when you see your face in a mirror). In bubbles, light bounces off the soap film in special ways. |\n   | **Iridescent** | Showing different colors that seem to change and shift when you look at them from different angles or as light moves. Bubbles are iridescent! |\n   | **Properties** | The special characteristics of a material—like its color, texture, flexibility, or how it reflects light. |\n   | **Force** | A push or pull that can make something move, change direction, or change shape. Your hand creates force when it makes bubbles. |\n\n4. **Connect Back to Photograph:**\n   - Point to the image: \"See how the hand is making the bubble? That's force. And look at all those beautiful colors—that's light bouncing off the thin soap film!\"\n   - \"The colors keep changing because the thickness of the film is changing all the time.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If a bubble has all these rainbow colors, what do you think is happening to the light?\" (Pause for 3–4 student responses.)\n   - Show a brief clip of a bubble popping in slow motion (if available online). Ask: \"What happened to the thin film?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain that bubbles have rainbow colors because of how light bounces off the thin soap film.\n- Students understand that the word \"iridescent\" describes the shifting colors.\n- Students connect force (pushing and pulling) to bubble movement and creation.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding of thin films and light to new scenarios and test how material properties affect bubble quality.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Three different bubble solutions (pre-made in labeled cups):\n  - **Solution A (control):** 1 cup water + 2 tablespoons dish soap\n  - **Solution B:** 1 cup water + 2 tablespoons dish soap + 1 tablespoon corn syrup\n  - **Solution C:** 1 cup water + 2 tablespoons dish soap + 1 tablespoon sugar\n- Bubble wands (same type for fair testing)\n- Data collection sheet (below)\n- Outdoor space or well-ventilated room\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Comparative Investigation: Which Solution Makes the Best Bubbles?**\n\n1. **Set Up the Question:**\n   - \"We've learned that bubble solutions have special properties. But do all solutions work the same way? Today, we're testing which additive—corn syrup or sugar—helps bubbles last longer and show better colors.\"\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - Assign each group one solution to test (or rotate stations).\n   - \"Create 5 bubbles with your solution. For each bubble, measure:\"\n     - How long the bubble floats before popping (count slowly: \"1-Mississippi, 2-Mississippi...\").\n     - What colors you see.\n     - How strong the film seems (does it pop easily?).\n   - Record data in a table.\n\n3. **Data Collection Sheet Template:**\n\n   | **Solution Type** | **Bubble 1 Time** | **Bubble 2 Time** | **Bubble 3 Time** | **Colors Observed?** | **Notes** |\n   |---|---|---|---|---|---|\n   | Solution A (soap only) | ___ seconds | ___ seconds | ___ seconds | Yes / No | |\n   | Solution B (soap + corn syrup) | ___ seconds | ___ seconds | ___ seconds | Yes / No | |\n   | Solution C (soap + sugar) | ___ seconds | ___ seconds | ___ seconds | Yes / No | |\n\n4. **Discussion After Testing:**\n   - \"Which solution made bubbles last the longest? Why do you think that happened?\"\n   - \"Which solution showed the best rainbow colors?\"\n   - \"What property of the solution made the difference?\" (Help students understand that thickness, viscosity, and surface tension affect bubble quality.)\n   - \"How does this connect to what we learned about thin films? If a bubble lasts longer, what's happening to the film?\"\n\n5. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - \"Did you know that scientists and engineers study bubbles to understand how to make better coatings, paints, and even medicines? They use the same ideas about thin films and how light works!\"\n\n**Teacher Facilitation Role:**\n- Ensure each group tests fairly (same wand type, similar blowing technique).\n- Encourage students to explain *why* they think one solution worked better, rather than just reporting numbers.\n- Connect longer-lasting bubbles to stronger thin films that keep their properties longer.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students collect and organize data comparing three bubble solutions.\n- Students predict and explain why certain additives (corn syrup) make stronger films.\n- Students articulate the relationship between material properties (thickness, stickiness) and bubble longevity.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light interaction with thin films, bubble properties, and the relationship between force and motion.\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Note which students observe color changes and document their findings systematically.\n- **Discussion Questions in Explain:** Listen for students who connect light bouncing to the rainbow colors.\n- **Data Collection in Elaborate:** Review whether students accurately record measurements and make logical predictions.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5–7 minutes)**\n\n**Provide each student with a printed exit ticket (or display on screen if using digital response):**\n\n---\n\n**BUBBLE SCIENTIST EXIT TICKET**\n\n**Name: _______________________ Date: _____________**\n\n**1. Draw a bubble. Label the colors you would expect to see on it.**\n\n**2. Why do bubbles have rainbow colors? Use the word \"light\" in your answer.**\n\n**3. In the photograph at the start of our lesson, the person's hand is touching the bubble. What do you call the push or pull the hand makes on the bubble?**\n   - ☐ Gravity\n   - ☐ Force\n   - ☐ Reflection\n   - ☐ Friction\n\n**4. If you added more corn syrup to bubble solution, what do you think would happen to how long the bubble lasts? Why?**\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| **Criteria** | **Developing** | **Proficient** | **Advanced** |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Understanding of Light & Color** | Student labels 1 color or gives vague explanation of colors. | Student labels 2+ colors and explains that light bounces off the soap film. | Student explains that light bounces off inside and outside of the film, and colors change as film thickness changes. |\n| **Vocabulary Use** | Student does not use correct vocabulary. | Student uses \"force,\" \"thin film,\" or \"light reflection\" correctly in context. | Student uses 2+ vocabulary terms correctly and explains connections between them. |\n| **Predicting Material Properties** | Student does not make a prediction or prediction shows no logic. | Student predicts that more corn syrup would make bubbles last longer and gives a reason. | Student predicts effect with reasoning about how additives change the film's properties. |\n\n---\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n- **Objective 1 (Observe properties):** Students accurately documented colors, shapes, and behaviors in their sketches and recordings during Explore.\n- **Objective 2 (Explain light interaction):** Students articulated on the exit ticket that colors come from light bouncing off the soap film.\n- **Objective 3 (Predict and test forces):** Students successfully tested bubbles with different forces and recorded results; they identified \"force\" on the exit ticket.\n- **Objective 4 (Classify materials by properties):** Students compared bubble solutions and made evidence-based predictions about which properties made better bubbles.\n\nIf fewer than 75% of students score \"Proficient\" or \"Advanced\" on the exit ticket, plan a brief re-teaching session in the next class using the bubble photograph to review light reflection and thin films.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Cards:** Provide illustrated cards with \"light,\" \"force,\" \"bubble,\" and \"color\" so students can reference definitions during activities. Allow students to point to or use these cards during discussions rather than generate language independently.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Template:** Create a partially completed observation sheet during Explore with visual prompts:\n   - \"Draw the color(s) you see here: ___\"\n   - \"The bubble is shaped like: ○ (circle) □ (other)\"\n   - \"Did it pop? Yes / No\"\n   - Students fill in blanks rather than creating their own records.\n\n3. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair struggling readers/writers with stronger communicators during group work. Assign roles: one person blows bubbles, one person observes and describes, one person records. Rotate roles so all students participate in each mode.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extended Investigation:** Challenge students to test whether different soap brands or different water temperatures affect bubble color and longevity. Have them design their own data table and write a hypothesis before testing. This requires them to control variables and think deeper about material properties.\n\n2. **Light Spectrum Connection:** Introduce the concept of the visible light spectrum (ROYGBIV). Ask: \"Bubbles show all these colors. Does that mean all the colors of light are bouncing off the film? Why might some colors appear in some spots and not others?\" Students research or discuss how different film thicknesses reflect different wavelengths of light.\n\n3. **Real-World Application Research:** Have advanced students research and present on how scientists use bubble and thin-film technology in:\n   - Anti-reflective coatings on glasses or solar panels\n   - Bubble wrap and protective packaging\n   - Foam and insulation materials\n   - Pharmaceutical delivery systems\n   \n   Students create a brief poster or digital presentation explaining the connection to what they learned about thin films.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rainbow Bubble Art Project (At-Home or Classroom):**\n   - Students create bubble solution with food coloring (different color per group).\n   - They blow bubbles onto large paper to make prints, capturing the iridescent effect in photographs or by popping bubbles on paper to leave soap residue marks.\n   - Students label their artwork with vocabulary: \"thin film,\" \"light reflection,\" \"iridescent.\"\n   - Display in hallway with a sign explaining the science.\n\n2. **Gravity and Bubbles Investigation:**\n   - Revisit NGSS 5-PS2-1 by testing how gravity affects floating bubbles.\n   - Prediction: \"If I blow a bubble upward, will it fall down because of gravity? How long does it take?\"\n   - Students blow bubbles at different angles and measure how long until they drop or pop.\n   - Discussion: \"Why do all objects fall down because of Earth's gravity? Did the bubble follow this rule?\" (Advanced idea: air density and buoyancy.)\n\n3. **Engineer a Bubble Wand:**\n   - Provide string, pipe cleaners, wire, and straws. Challenge students to design and build their own bubble wand.\n   - Test the wands: Which shape produces the biggest bubble? The most bubbles? The longest-lasting bubbles?\n   - Students make predictions and record data, connecting to their learning about thin films and how wand shape affects the soap film created.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Bubble Solution Prep:** Make solutions the day before. The corn syrup solution works best and visibly shows more vibrant iridescent colors. Keep solutions in sealed containers to prevent evaporation.\n- **Outdoor Recommendation:** If possible, conduct Explore and Elaborate outside. Wind and natural light enhance the colors and reduce cleanup concerns.\n- **Safety Reminders:** Ensure students do not put bubble solution in their mouths or rub eyes if they touch their faces. Have paper towels available.\n- **Photography Tip:** If students finish early, have them photograph bubbles at different times of day or in different lighting to compare how light affects the colors—reinforcing the concept that light interaction creates the colors.\n- **Connection to Next Unit:** This lesson is an excellent bridge to learning about waves (light waves, sound waves) in subsequent lessons. Refer back to \"how light bounces off the film\" when introducing light as a wave.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is fully aligned to Fifth Grade NGSS Physical Science standards and uses the 5E model to scaffold students from curiosity through independent application. The photograph of the iridescent bubble is central to all five phases, ensuring coherence and engagement throughout.",
