The poles hold thick black wires that carry electricity to homes and buildings. At the top, there is a large gray container called a transformer that helps control the electricity flowing through the wires.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why do we have poles and wires running through our neighborhoods?\n\nElectricity travels through wires from power plants to our homes and schools. The transformer (the gray box) changes the electricity so it is the right strength for people to use safely. The wires are held up high on poles so they don't touch the ground or get in the way of cars and people. This is a system that brings energy to our community every single day.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n- **Energy Transfer:** Electricity is a form of energy that travels through wires from one place to another. We use this energy to power lights, computers, and other things in our homes and schools.\n\n- **Conductors and Materials:** Wires are made from copper metal because it allows electricity to flow easily. The plastic coating around the wires keeps the electricity inside and keeps people safe.\n\n- **Safety and Design:** Poles, wires, and equipment are placed high up and arranged carefully so that electricity can reach people safely without causing danger.\n\n- **Interconnected Systems:** Power lines connect many buildings and homes to one power source, creating a network that shares electricity across a whole community.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching about electricity to first graders, use the \"water flow\" analogy: electricity flows through wires like water flows through pipes. This concrete comparison helps young learners visualize an invisible phenomenon. Always emphasize safety rules about not touching wires or electrical outlets.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple representations: Use a simple diagram showing electricity traveling through wires, a tactile model of a wire (thick rope), and a real-world connection (point out power lines near the school). Allow students to draw, label, or build with blocks to represent their understanding in different ways.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n**Zoom In - Microscopic Level:**\nElectricity is made of tiny particles called electrons that move through metal wires. When electrons move very fast through the copper wire, they create the energy that powers our lights and devices. The plastic covering around the wire is an insulator—it stops electrons from escaping and keeps them traveling safely inside the wire.\n\n**Zoom Out - Community System:**\nPower lines connect to a larger electrical grid that serves an entire town or city. Transformers, poles, and wires work together as one big system. This system starts at a power plant (where electricity is made), travels through major transmission lines, then down to smaller neighborhood lines like the ones in the photo, finally reaching individual homes and schools where people use the electricity.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n- **Misconception:** \"Electricity flows out of the wires and floats in the air.\"\n  - **Clarification:** Electricity stays inside the wires and only flows where there is a complete path for it to travel. The plastic coating keeps it safe inside.\n\n- **Misconception:** \"The wires are just holding up the transformer.\"\n  - **Clarification:** The wires carry electricity from one place to another. The transformer changes the electricity to make it safe for homes to use.\n\n- **Misconception:** \"All the electricity comes from a battery.\"\n  - **Clarification:** The electricity in our homes comes from power plants far away. It travels through wires on poles to reach us.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** \n1-PS4-1: Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that vibrating materials can make sound and that sound can make materials vibrate.\n\n**Related Performance Expectation:**\nK-PS2-1: Plan and conduct investigations to compare the effects of different strengths or different directions of pushes and pulls on the motion of an object.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-PS2.A]] (Forces and Motion)\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-PS4.A]] (Wave Properties)\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-ETS1.A]] (Engineering Design)\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]]\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]]\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]]\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. \"What do you think happens to the electricity after it leaves these wires?\" \n   - *Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 1*\n\n2. \"Why do you think the wires need to be so high up on the poles instead of on the ground?\" \n   - *Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2*\n\n3. \"If you trace the wires from this pole, where do you think they go?\" \n   - *Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3*\n\n4. \"Why is the plastic covering on the wires important?\" \n   - *Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2*\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Electricity:** A form of energy that flows through wires and powers things like lights and computers.\n\n* **Wire:** A thin metal cord that carries electricity from place to place.\n\n* **Transformer:** A box on a power pole that changes electricity so it is safe for people to use in their homes.\n\n* **Conductor:** A material (like copper) that lets electricity flow easily through it.\n\n* **Insulator:** A material (like plastic) that stops electricity from escaping and keeps it safe inside.\n\n* **Power Lines:** Wires that carry electricity above or below ground to homes and buildings.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Power Line Mapping Walk:** Take students on a safe neighborhood walk to observe power lines, poles, and transformers. Have them sketch or photograph what they see. Back in the classroom, create a large map showing where the power lines go in relation to the school.\n\n2. **Wire and Conductor Exploration:** Provide students with safe, battery-powered circuits (age-appropriate kits) where they can see how electricity flows through wires. Let them experiment by adding different materials to see which ones conduct electricity (complete the circuit) and which ones block it (break the circuit).\n\n3. **Draw a Power Journey:** Students draw or paint a picture showing electricity's journey from a power plant, through poles and wires, to their home. Use this as an assessment of their understanding of the electricity system.\n\n## 🔗 Cross-Curricular Ideas\n\n- **Math:** Measure the height of a power pole using non-standard units (steps, rope lengths). Count the number of wires on a pole or estimate the distance between poles on a street.\n\n- **English Language Arts:** Read books about energy and electricity. Write or dictate sentences about what they learned. Create rhyming poems about power lines and electricity.\n\n- **Social Studies:** Discuss how electricity helps communities. Talk about jobs of people who work with electricity (electricians, power company workers). Map where electricity comes from and where it goes in the local community.\n\n- **Art:** Create collages using pictures of power lines and poles from magazines. Design colorful posters about electricity safety (e.g., \"Don't Touch Power Lines!\").\n\n## 🚀 STEM Career Connection\n\n1. **Electrician:** An electrician is a person who installs, fixes, and maintains wires and electrical equipment in homes, schools, and buildings.
