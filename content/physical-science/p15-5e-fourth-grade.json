ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the bubble photograph (or printed copies on a document camera)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Bubble solution and wands (to have on hand for demonstration)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation. Then ask: *\"What do you notice in this picture? What is happening to the bubble?\"*\n\n2. **Pose these guiding discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing think-pair-share time):\n   - *\"What do you think made this bubble grow so big? What's inside helping it expand?\"*\n   - *\"Do you see the wavy lines on the bubble? What could those be, and why do you think they're there?\"*\n   - *\"If you touched this bubble very gently, what do you think would happen? Why?\"*\n   - *\"How is a bubble different from a solid object like a pencil? What makes it special?\"*\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** *\"I wonder if we could predict which bubbles will pop first and which will last longer. What would we need to test to figure that out?\"*\n\n4. **Real bubble demonstration** (optional): Blow a single large bubble and let it float. Ask students to track its movement and describe what they see happening to its shape.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to become bubble scientists! We'll make bubbles, watch them carefully, and discover the secrets of how they move and change.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- Bubble solution (store-bought or homemade: 1 cup water, 2 tablespoons dish soap, 1 tablespoon corn syrup)\n- Multiple bubble wands (various shapes: round, square, wand with handle)\n- Shallow trays or cups for bubble solution\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Observation recording sheets (provided template with drawings and sentence starters)\n- Magnifying glasses (optional, for detailed observation)\n- Stopwatch or timer\n- Fan (optional, to observe bubble movement)\n\n**Activity: \"Bubble Energy Investigation\"**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **Before blowing:** *\"Look at your bubble wand. Draw it on your recording sheet. What shape is it? Do you think the shape of the wand will affect the bubble?\"*\n\n2. **First test — Making bubbles:**\n   - Dip the wand into the solution.\n   - Blow gently to make a small bubble. Then blow harder. Record: *\"What happened when I blew harder? Did the bubble get bigger faster or slower?\"*\n   - Try a second wand with a different shape. Compare the bubbles made.\n\n3. **Second test — Bubble movement:**\n   - Blow a bubble and let it float.\n   - Observe what happens to it. Does it move? Does it change shape?\n   - Gently wave your hand near it (without touching). What happens?\n   - Record: *\"How did the bubble move? What made it move?\"*\n\n4. **Third test — Looking for patterns (waves):**\n   - Blow one larger bubble and look very closely (use a magnifying glass if available).\n   - Can you see the wavy lines on the surface like in the photograph?\n   - Tap the table gently near the floating bubble. Do the waves get bigger or smaller?\n   - Record: *\"What did the bubble do when I made the table shake?\"*\n\n5. **Fourth test — How long does it last?**\n   - Blow a bubble and time how long it floats before popping.\n   - Try three times. Record each time.\n   - *\"Was the time the same or different? Why do you think that is?\"*\n\n**How the activity connects to the photograph:**\nThe photograph shows a bubble in motion with visible wave patterns on its surface. Students will observe similar features and begin to understand that the energy from air movement causes the waves and motion they see.\n\n**What students should record or document:**\n- Drawings of the bubble shapes they made\n- Answers to sentence starters: *\"When I blew harder, the bubble...\"* and *\"I saw waves on the bubble when...\"*\n- Timing data for bubble duration\n- Observations about what made bubbles move\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nCirculate among groups. Ask probing questions without giving answers:\n- *\"What changed when you blew harder?\"*\n- *\"Can you describe the movement you see?\"*\n- *\"What do you think made that happen?\"*\n\nRedirect students who are too rough with bubbles toward gentler observation. Allow for play and discovery — this is intentional.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that faster air movement (blowing harder) creates larger bubbles more quickly.\n- Students will notice that bubbles move in response to air currents and vibrations.\n- Students will identify visible wave patterns on bubble surfaces.\n- Students will discover that bubbles don't last forever and will attempt to explain why.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Diagram of a bubble cross-section (teacher-prepared or drawn together)\n- Bubble solution and wands for demonstration\n- Video clip (optional, 2-3 minutes): Time-lapse or slow-motion bubble formation (search \"bubble formation slow motion\" on YouTube)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 different groups to share one discovery from their Explore activity.\n   - Record findings on chart paper using student language first, then introduce formal terms.\n   - Celebrate careful observations.\n\n2. **Teacher-led instruction with demonstration (10 minutes):**\n\n   **Introduce vocabulary and concepts:**\n   - Hold up a bubble wand and blow a bubble slowly while talking. *\"See this bubble? It's made of a very thin layer of soap and water. Inside is air. The air pushing outward and the soap layer pushing inward create this round shape.\"*\n   \n   - Draw or project a simple cross-section diagram showing:\n     - Air molecules inside\n     - Thin soap film layers\n     - Air pressure pushing out\n   \n   - Point to the photograph again: *\"These wavy lines you see? Those are called waves. They're patterns of energy moving through the soap film. Just like when you drop a rock in water, energy travels outward in waves.\"*\n   \n   - Blow a bubble and gently shake the table near it. *\"When I vibrate the table, the energy travels through the air to the bubble, and you see the waves change. Energy moved from my hand → to the table → to the air → to the bubble.\"*\n\n3. **Check for understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: *\"Where is the energy in a bubble coming from?\"* (Answer: The air inside; the movement we created by blowing)\n   - Ask: *\"What do the waves tell us?\"* (Answer: Energy is moving through the bubble)\n   - Have students show with their hands the motion of a wave: up and down, up and down.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Energy** | The ability to make things move or change. It can move from one place to another. |\n| **Wave** | A pattern that travels through something (like air or water), carrying energy from one place to another. Waves go up and down or side to side. |\n| **Pressure** | A pushing force. Air pressure inside the bubble pushes outward against the soap film. |\n| **Vibration** | A fast back-and-forth shaking movement. Vibrations create waves. |\n| **Soap film** | A very thin layer of soap and water that holds the bubble together. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and identify waves on a bubble.\n- Students understand that energy comes from inside (air) and from outside (movement, vibrations).\n- Students can explain in simple terms why bubbles have their round shape (pressure pushing in and out).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bubble solution and multiple wand shapes (round, square, triangle, or homemade wands from pipe cleaners)\n- Large shallow trays for bubble solution\n- Straw or bubble-blowing tool made from straws or index cards rolled into a cone\n- Recording sheet or chart for predictions and results\n- Optional: colored bubbles (add food coloring to solution — bubbles won't change color but the solution will help visibility)\n\n**Activity: \"Design a Bubble-Blowing Tool\"**\n\n1. **Challenge presented:** *\"Now that we're bubble experts, here's a new challenge: Can you design a tool that will blow the BIGGEST bubble? Or the FASTEST moving bubble? Or the bubble that lasts the longest? You get to choose which one you want to try!\"*\n\n2. **Student design process:**\n   - Students sketch their bubble tool design on paper.\n   - They predict: *\"I think my tool will create a big/fast/lasting bubble because...\"*\n   - They test their tool with the bubble solution.\n   - They observe and record results: *\"My tool made a bubble that was... bigger/smaller/same size as the wand bubbles.\"*\n   - They refine: *\"Next time, I would change... because...\"*\n\n3. **Connection to real-world application:**\n   - Discuss: *\"Bubbles aren't just for fun. Scientists and engineers use bubbles to test ideas about movement, energy, and waves. Some bubbles are used to deliver medicine inside our bodies!\"*\n\n4. **Gallery walk (if time permits):**\n   - Display different bubble tools and results.\n   - Students walk around and notice which designs worked best and why.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask: *\"What made your tool work better or worse than the wand?\"*\n- Guide students to think about the relationship between tool design and bubble size/movement/longevity.\n- Encourage experimentation without fear of failure.\n- Keep the focus on observation and evidence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design a functional bubble-making tool.\n- Students make predictions based on earlier observations.\n- Students test, observe, and refine their ideas.\n- Students use evidence to explain why their design worked or didn't work.\n- Students demonstrate understanding of how tool shape, air speed, and solution thickness affect bubble formation and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of energy, waves, and bubble physics.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Note which students correctly identify waves, describe motion, and make logical predictions.\n- **Vocabulary checks during Explain:** Listen for students using terms like \"energy,\" \"wave,\" and \"pressure\" correctly in sentences.\n- **Question responses during Elaborate:** Assess whether students' design choices and predictions show understanding of cause-and-effect relationships.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nDistribute an exit ticket (can be digital or paper). Students respond to the following:\n\n**Question 1 (with drawing):**\n*\"Draw a bubble. Show where you see energy in your drawing. Label: the air inside, the waves on the surface, and the soap film. Explain in 2 sentences how energy is moving in your bubble.\"*\n\n**Question 2 (multiple choice):**\n*\"When you blow a bubble harder, what happens?\"*\n- A) The bubble stays the same size.\n- B) The bubble gets bigger faster because more energy pushes the air out.\n- C) The bubble pops immediately.\n- D) The bubble moves backward.\n\n**Question 3 (open-ended):**\n*\"Explain: How are the waves you see on a bubble like the waves you see when you drop a pebble in water? Use the word 'energy' in your answer.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student can identify waves on a bubble, explain that energy from blowing makes bubbles form and move, and make a logical prediction or design choice based on observations.\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student can identify some features of bubbles and attempts to explain energy transfer, but reasoning may lack full detail.\n\n✓ **Beginning:** Student observes bubbles but struggles to connect observations to energy, waves, or motion concepts.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 75% of students can correctly identify waves on a bubble.\n- 70% of students can explain that energy from air movement causes bubbles to grow and move.\n- 65% of students can design a bubble tool and make a prediction based on earlier observations.\n- Most students can use at least 2 vocabulary terms correctly.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Visual anchor chart:** Create and keep displayed a chart with:\n   - Pictures of waves (on water, on bubbles)\n   - The word \"ENERGY\" with arrows showing movement\n   - Sentence starters: *\"I see waves when...\" \"Energy makes the bubble...\"*\n   - Students can reference this during activities.\n\n2. **Paired exploration:** Partner struggling students with strong observers. Assign roles: one blows bubbles, one records observations. Rotate roles.\n\n3. **Simplified recording sheet:** Provide a template with pictures and fill-in-the-blank sentences rather than open-ended writing. Example: *\"The bubble moved because __________ made it move.\"*\n\n4. **Pre-teach vocabulary:** Meet with these students before Explain phase. Show pictures of waves, point to a bubble's soap film, demonstrate pressure with a balloon. Use these visuals during the lesson.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Quantify waves:** Challenge students to count the waves on a bubble or measure their height with a ruler. Ask: *\"Do all bubbles have the same number of waves? Why or why not?\"*\n\n2. **Energy conversion task:** Present a scenario: *\"If you blow a bubble and it travels across the room and pops, trace the energy: Where did it start? Where did it go? What happened to it?\"* Students create a visual energy map.\n\n3. **Design a bubble maze:** Challenge students to design a path that a bubble must follow using fans, tubes, or obstacles. Ask: *\"How must you move the air to keep the bubble on your path? What does this tell us about energy and waves?\"*\n\n4. **Research extension:** Have advanced students investigate: *\"Why do some bubbles last longer than others? What could make a bubble stronger?\" They can test variables like solution recipes or find scientific articles to read.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bubble race:** Create a bubble competition where students race bubbles across a table by blowing or using straws at different angles. Students predict which angle will make the bubble go fastest and test their predictions. Discussion: *\"How is energy directed by the angle you blow from?\"*\n\n2. **Bubble art and analysis:** Have students create bubble prints by blowing bubbles into paint and letting them pop on paper. Students observe and document the wave patterns left behind. Discussion: *\"What does the print tell us about the waves that were on the bubble?\"*\n\n3. **Sound and bubble vibration:** Play different musical notes or sounds near floating bubbles. Ask: *\"Does the bubble move differently to high sounds vs. low sounds? What does this tell us about how vibrations from sound carry energy?\"* (Connects to 4-PS3-2 about sound transferring energy.)\n\n4. **Bubble size and surface area investigation:** Have students predict whether bigger bubbles or smaller bubbles will pop faster. Test this, record data, and graph results. Discussion: *\"Why might size affect how long a bubble lasts?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Materials Checklist\n\n**You will need:**\n- [ ] Bubble solution (store-bought or ingredients for homemade)\n- [ ] Multiple bubble wands (round, square, various sizes)\n- [ ] Shallow trays or cups for solution\n- [ ] Paper towels and cleanup supplies\n- [ ] Observation recording sheets (printed or digital)\n- [ ] Magnifying glasses\n- [ ] Stopwatches or timers\n- [ ] Chart paper and markers\n- [ ] Pipe cleaners, straws, and index cards (for Design phase)\n- [ ] Optional: fans, slow-motion video clip, colored food coloring\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure bubble solution stays out of eyes.
