Make observations to explain that objects in darkness cannot be seen without light.\n2. Describe how different materials (shiny, clear, dull) interact with light in different ways.\n3. Demonstrate understanding that light allows us to see colors and shapes of objects.\n4. Predict how objects will look when light is added to or removed from them.\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about light and visibility using the photograph of the brightly colored locomotive and car.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (displayed on screen or as a poster)\n- Flashlight or classroom lamp\n- Small toy car or toy train (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display Setup:** Show the photograph on a large screen or printed poster. Begin with the room lights dimmed slightly to create intrigue.\n\n2. **Opening Question:** \"Why can we see the red car and the yellow train so clearly in this picture? What helps us see them?\"\n\n3. **Guided Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"Can you see the bright colors of these machines? What makes the colors visible?\"\n   - \"What do you notice about the windows on the train? Why do you think they have windows?\"\n   - \"If we turned off all the lights in our classroom, could we still see these colors? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What is helping light reach our eyes so we can see these machines?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we turned off all the lights right now. Would we still be able to see the color of this car? Turn and tell your partner what you think.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Let's investigate how light helps us see things. We're going to do some experiments with light and objects to discover the answer together.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how light affects visibility through hands-on exploration with objects and light sources.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small cardboard boxes (1 per pair or small group)\n- Toy cars, blocks, or small objects to place inside boxes\n- Flashlights (1 per pair or small group)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording observations\n- Different materials: clear plastic wrap, aluminum foil, black construction paper, white paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: The Mystery Box Investigation**\n\n1. **Setup:** Divide students into pairs or small groups. Give each pair a cardboard box with a small toy car or object hidden inside. Close the lid completely so the box is dark inside.\n\n2. **Step 1 - Darkness Test:**\n   - Ask students: \"Can you see what's inside the closed box without opening it?\"\n   - Record their responses (most will say \"no\").\n\n3. **Step 2 - Adding Light:**\n   - Give each pair a flashlight.\n   - Instruct them: \"Now, shine your flashlight through the opening at the top of the box. What do you see now?\"\n   - Have students describe what appears when light enters the box.\n\n4. **Step 3 - Observation Recording:**\n   - Ask students to draw or tell you what they observed:\n     - \"What did you see when the box was dark?\"\n     - \"What did you see when you shined the light?\"\n\n**Part B: Material and Light Exploration**\n\n1. **Setup:** Provide each group with a small toy or object and three different materials: clear plastic wrap, aluminum foil, and black paper.\n\n2. **Investigation Steps:**\n   - \"Try to see your object when it's covered with this material. Can you see it clearly?\"\n   - Test each material one at a time.\n   - Record observations: Can you see through it? Is it shiny? Does light pass through?\n\n3. **Documentation:**\n   - Students draw or sort materials into \"light passes through\" vs. \"light doesn't pass through\" piles.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What happened when you added light?\" \"Can you see the car now?\" \"Why do you think we can see it?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answer—let them discover through observation.\n- Encourage students to make predictions before testing: \"What do you think will happen if we use the shiny foil?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that objects in darkness cannot be seen.\n- Students observe that light reveals colors and shapes.\n- Students notice that different materials let light through differently.\n- Students begin to understand that light is necessary for seeing.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding about light and visibility after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the locomotive and car (displayed again)\n- Flashlight or lamp\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- Large pictures of objects in light vs. darkness\n- Small objects for demonstration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite pairs to share what they discovered: \"What did you learn about light and seeing objects?\"\n   - List their observations on chart paper.\n   - Ask: \"Why could we see the toy car when the flashlight was on, but not when it was dark?\"\n\n2. **Connect to Photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Return to the photograph of the locomotive and red car.\n   - Point out: \"In this picture, we can see the bright yellow and red colors very clearly. That's because light from the sun is shining on these machines. The light bounces off them and comes to our eyes, so we can see them.\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary Introduction (5 minutes):**\n\n   Use simple, direct language with visual demonstrations:\n\n   - **Light:** Energy that helps us see things. Show the flashlight. \"This flashlight makes light. The light helps us see this toy car.\"\n   \n   - **Bright:** When there is a lot of light, and we can see very well. Turn on the classroom lights fully. \"Now it's bright! We can see everything clearly.\"\n   \n   - **Dark:** When there is no light, and we cannot see. Dim the lights. \"Now it's darker. It's harder to see things.\"\n   \n   - **Reflect:** When light bounces off a shiny object. Show aluminum foil in light. \"The light bounces off the shiny foil. That's called reflection.\"\n   \n   - **See/Visible:** To look at something with your eyes and know what it is. \"When light reaches our eyes, we can see.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Quick physical response activity: \"Thumbs up if you need light to see a toy. Thumbs sideways if you're not sure. Thumbs down if you don't need light.\"\n   - Ask simple yes/no questions: \"Can we see in complete darkness?\" (Pause for response.) \"Do we need light to see colors?\" (Pause for response.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Light:** Energy that helps us see things and makes things bright.\n- **Dark:** A place with no light where we cannot see.\n- **Bright:** When there is lots of light and we can see very clearly.\n- **Reflect:** When light bounces off something shiny.\n- **See:** To look at something with your eyes.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain that light is needed to see objects.\n- Students understand that darkness means there is no light.\n- Students recognize that different materials interact with light differently.\n- Students can use vocabulary terms in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of light and visibility to new situations and real-world contexts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Red, yellow, and other colored construction paper\n- Flashlights\n- Darkened corner or closet space (if safe and available), OR a large box with a blanket over it\n- Pictures of real-world scenarios: car headlights, streetlights, lighthouses, flashlights in dark places\n- Optional: glow sticks or other light sources\n\n**Activity - Choice 1: Color in Light and Darkness**\n\n1. Give students colored paper (red, yellow, blue, etc.).\n2. Under bright light, ask: \"What color is this paper?\"\n3. Shine only a flashlight on it: \"What color do you see now?\"\n4. If available and safe, take the paper into a darkened space with no external light: \"Can you see the color now?\"\n5. Discussion: \"Why can we see the color better in the bright room? What does the flashlight do?\"\n6. Students draw or write: \"I can see colors when there is ______.\"\n\n**Activity - Choice 2: Light in Real Life**\n\n1. Show pictures of things that help us see in the dark:\n   - Car headlights (helping drivers see the road)\n   - Streetlights (helping people walk safely at night)\n   - Flashlights (for emergencies or camping)\n   - Glow sticks (for fun or safety)\n\n2. Ask: \"Why do we need these lights? What would happen without them?\"\n\n3. Students select one picture and draw or dictate: \"We need [this light] because ________.\"\n\n4. Connect back to the photograph: \"The red car and yellow train are easy to see because the sun provides light. If this picture was taken at night with no light, what would we see?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to connect their investigations to real-world situations.\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"Where else do we need light to see?\"\n- Validate all responses and encourage reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply the concept that light enables vision to new contexts (cars, homes, streets).\n- Students can predict what would happen in darkness without light.\n- Students understand that light sources are tools for seeing.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light and visibility through formative and summative assessment strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student explanations during group discussions.\n- Listen to vocabulary use during Explore and Explain phases.\n- Monitor hands-on investigations for understanding of cause and effect.\n- Ask clarifying questions: \"Can we see in a dark room? What happens when I turn on the light?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket (5 minutes) - Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide students with a simple drawing or photograph showing an object. Ask them to respond (drawing, dictating to teacher, or verbally):\n\n**Question 1:** \"Look at this picture. Can we see what this is? Why or why not?\" (Show an object in bright light.)\n\n**Question 2:** \"What would happen if we turned off all the lights?\" (Student responds or draws.)\n\n**Question 3:** \"What would help us see the object in the dark?\" (Student identifies: flashlight, lamp, light bulb, etc.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Beginning:** Student recognizes that light helps us see but cannot explain why.\n- **Developing:** Student explains that we need light to see objects and identifies one light source.\n- **Proficient:** Student clearly states that objects cannot be seen in darkness and identifies multiple light sources or explains how light allows us to see colors.\n- **Advanced:** Student explains that light bounces off objects and reaches our eyes, enabling us to see colors and shapes.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most first graders will demonstrate understanding that light is necessary for vision.\n- Students will confidently identify light sources.\n- Students will make predictions about visibility in different lighting conditions.\n- Some students may begin to understand reflection or light travel (advanced thinking).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce Language Complexity:** Use shorter sentences and repeat vocabulary multiple times. Example: \"Light helps us see. No light means dark. We cannot see in the dark.\"\n\n2. **Provide Visual Supports:** Use pictures of light and dark instead of only describing them verbally. Show the contrast by dimming and brightening the room repeatedly.\n\n3. **Pair with Peer Mentors:** During Explore activities, pair struggling students with confident peers who can model behavior and provide language support.\n\n4. **Simplify Exit Ticket:** Offer choices instead of open-ended responses. \"Can we see in the dark? YES / NO / I DON'T KNOW.\"\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Introduce Light Reflection:** Show shiny and dull materials side-by-side. Ask: \"Why does the shiny one look brighter? What is the light doing?\" Guide them to understand that shiny things reflect light, and dull things absorb it.\n\n2. **Extend to Multiple Light Sources:** Provide several flashlights and ask: \"What happens if we use two flashlights instead of one? Is it brighter?\" Have students predict and test.\n\n3. **Real-World Application:** Ask: \"Why does the yellow train in the picture look brighter than the black parts? What color reflects more light?\" Create a prediction chart: \"Which colors will be brightest in light?\"\n\n4. **Connect to Speed of Light Concept (introduction only):** \"Light travels very fast from the sun to Earth. That's why we see things almost instantly.\" This plants seeds for future grades.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Nighttime Safety Walk (Classroom or Outdoor Field Trip):**\n   - During morning or afternoon (representing daytime), take students on a short walk around the classroom or school grounds.\n   - Ask: \"What can you see? Is it bright?\"\n   - Then show pictures or videos of the same place at night with and without lights.\n   - Discuss: \"Why do we need streetlights at night? Why do cars have headlights?\"\n   - Students draw or write: \"At night, we need light to see because ________.\"\n\n2. **Create a Light Scavenger Hunt:**\n   - Give students a checklist or picture cards of light sources: flashlight, lamp, window, sun, computer screen, phone light, glow stick.\n   - Students find and circle or place checkmarks next to light sources they can identify around the classroom or home.\n   - Return to discuss: \"What did you find that makes light? Why do we use it?\"\n\n3. **Shadow and Light Exploration (Introduction to Light Blocking):**\n   - Using the photo as inspiration (the car blocks light and creates a shadow), provide white paper and flashlights.\n   - Students place small objects (hands, toys, blocks) between a light source and paper.\n   - Observe the shadows created.\n   - Ask: \"What made the shadow? The light is blocked. What happens to the light?\"\n   - This connects to 1-PS4-3 by exploring how objects made of different materials affect light paths (shadow investigation).\n\n---\n\n**Note for Teachers:** This lesson plant firmly grounds first-grade students in the foundational concept that light is essential for vision (1-PS4-2). The hands-on investigations with the \"mystery box\" and material testing (1-PS4-3 preparation) ensure students discover concepts through direct experience rather than lecture. The photograph of the brightly colored vehicles serves as both an engaging hook and a concrete reference point throughout the lesson, supporting young learners' need for visible, relatable examples. All vocabulary is simplified for first graders, and assessments use multiple modalities (drawing, verbal responses, physical responses) to accommodate diverse learners.",
