If strict adherence to the provided PS standards is required, this lesson may be adapted to incorporate 1-PS4-1 by exploring how motion creates vibrations/sound.)*\n  - **Alternative alignment:** 1-PS4-1 (investigating vibrations and sound—applicable when skateboard wheels create sound as they move)\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Observe and describe** how pushes and pulls make objects move (using the skateboard as an example).\n2. **Predict and test** what happens when you push a skateboard or toy with different amounts of force.\n3. **Identify** that smooth surfaces allow objects to move more easily than rough surfaces.\n4. **Explain** in simple words that moving objects have energy and that pushes and pulls change how things move.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the skateboard jump.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph (8.5\" × 11\" or larger) or digital display (smartboard/projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: toy skateboard or picture of one\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** large enough for all students to see clearly. Say: \"Look at this amazing picture! A person is doing something very exciting with a skateboard. Let's look carefully at what's happening.\"\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see the person doing? Can you describe the position of their body?\"\n   - \"Do you think the skateboard is moving fast or slow? What makes you think that?\"\n   - \"How do you think the skateboard started moving? What did the person do to make it go?\"\n   - \"Have you ever pushed something and made it move? What did you push?\"\n\n3. **Record student responses** on chart paper. Use their language to build vocabulary.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we gently pushed a skateboard, and then what would happen if we pushed it really hard. Would it move the same way?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's try pushing some toy skateboards ourselves and see what happens when we use different pushes!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity using pushes with toys on different surfaces.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4–5 toy skateboards, roller skates, toy cars, or wheeled toys (one per small group)\n- Smooth surfaces (large tile, laminate, poster board, or waxed paper on floor)\n- Rough surfaces (carpet, towel, sandpaper taped to floor, or grass outside)\n- Tape (painter's or masking tape) to mark starting and ending lines\n- Student recording sheets (simple templates with pictures showing \"soft push,\" \"hard push,\" and space to draw or mark where the toy stopped)\n- Meter stick or measuring tape (for teacher reference)\n- Optional: skateboard sounds recording device (phone to record wheel sounds)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into small groups of 3–4.** Assign each group a station or rotation.\n\n2. **Station Setup:**\n   - **Station 1 (Smooth Surface):** Mark a starting line with tape. Students will take turns gently pushing the toy skateboard (or car) and watching where it stops. They repeat with a harder push.\n   - **Station 2 (Rough Surface):** Repeat the same activity on a rough surface (carpet or sandpaper area).\n   - **Station 3 (Sound Investigation):** As toys move, students listen carefully. Do the wheels make sound? Does it sound different on smooth vs. rough surfaces?\n\n3. **Step-by-step student directions** (use simple, visual language):\n   - \"Stand at the line. Place your toy skateboard in front of you.\"\n   - \"Give it a **gentle push** with your hand. Watch it roll. How far did it go?\"\n   - \"Now try a **hard push**. Which push made it go farther?\"\n   - \"Try this on the bumpy (rough) surface. Is it easier or harder to push?\"\n   - \"Draw or put a sticker where the toy stopped each time.\"\n\n4. **What students should record:**\n   - Simple drawings or X marks showing where the toy stopped after a gentle push vs. a hard push\n   - A picture or word showing which surface made the toy go farther (or a simple \"smooth\" vs. \"rough\" label)\n   - Optional: A tally mark or smiley face if they heard sound from the wheels\n\n5. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate to each station. Ask open-ended questions: *\"What did you notice? Why do you think it stopped there? What was different?\"*\n   - Do NOT tell students the answer; instead, prompt: *\"Let's watch what happens next. What do you see?\"*\n   - Help students record without writing for them—use pictures, marks, or stickers.\n   - Listen for student language about pushes, distance, and surfaces.\n\n6. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students will observe that **harder pushes make toys go farther.**\n   - Students will discover that **smooth surfaces allow toys to travel farther** than rough surfaces.\n   - Students will notice that **pushing requires effort and creates motion.**\n   - Some students may spontaneously notice that wheels make sound and that the sound differs by surface.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration, connecting findings back to the photograph and real-world context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple illustrations\n- Printed photograph from Engage phase\n- Toy skateboard for demonstration\n- Index cards with pictures (optional, for vocabulary)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students back together.** Display the skateboard photograph again.\n\n2. **Facilitate a group share-out:**\n   - \"Let's talk about what you discovered. Who pushed a toy and watched it move? What happened?\"\n   - \"Did you notice that a soft push and a hard push made different things happen?\"\n   - \"How was your toy skateboard like the real skateboard in this picture?\"\n   - Validate all observations. Build on student language.\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary with First Grade-friendly definitions:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Push:** Using your hand or body to make something move away from you. *(Demonstrate by pushing a toy skateboard.)*\n   - **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or change how it's moving. *(Show: \"The force of my push made the toy go far!\")*\n   - **Motion:** When something is moving or changing position from one place to another. *(Point to moving toy.)*\n   - **Smooth:** A surface that is flat and easy to slide on, like a tile floor. *(Let students touch smooth and rough surfaces.)*\n   - **Rough:** A surface that is bumpy and harder to slide on, like carpet. *(Let students compare.)*\n\n4. **Make connections to the photograph:**\n   - \"The person in the picture is using a big push (a big force) to make the skateboard go very fast and jump up. That's because of the push!\"\n   - \"The skateboard park is made of smooth concrete, just like the smooth surface you pushed your toy on.\"\n   - \"When you pushed softly, the toy didn't go as far. When the skater in the picture uses a big, strong push, the skateboard flies!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding strategy:**\n   - Ask students to mime a **push** motion. Say: \"Show me a soft push. Now show me a hard push. Great!\"\n   - Point to the photograph and ask: \"Is this a soft push or a hard push?\" (Point to skater's stance.)\n   - Ask: \"If I put our toy skateboard on this carpet, will it go far or not far?\"\n   - Use a thumbs-up/sideways/down system for quick self-assessment: \"If you understand that pushes can make things move, show me a thumbs-up!\"\n\n6. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students can **use the words push, force, and motion** in simple sentences.\n   - Students understand that **stronger pushes cause objects to move farther or faster.**\n   - Students recognize that **surfaces matter**—smooth surfaces are easier to move things on.\n   - Students can **connect the toy activity to the skateboard photograph.**\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by exploring pushes and pulls in a new, engaging context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Toy skateboards, cars, or balls (multiple toys)\n- Ramps made from foam blocks, cardboard tubes, or books\n- Starting lines (tape)\n- Obstacles (small blocks, cones, or cutout paper shapes)\n- Optional: inclined surfaces at different angles\n- Recording sheet: \"Where Will It Go?\" (simple picture frame with three scenarios: soft push, hard push, with obstacle)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce a new challenge:** \"Now that we know how pushes work, let's try something harder. What if we put something in the way? What if we use a ramp?\"\n\n2. **Set up exploration scenarios** (students can choose or rotate through):\n   - **Scenario A – The Obstacle Course:** Place a small block or cone in the path. Push the toy gently and harder. Does it go around? Does it bump? Record what happens.\n   - **Scenario B – The Ramp:** Build a simple ramp (books stacked under a board). Push the toy up the ramp gently, then harder. What's different? Which takes more effort?\n   - **Scenario C – Prediction Challenge:** Show a setup and ask, \"If I push this toy gently, where will it stop?\" Then test it. Were you right?\n\n3. **Step-by-step student directions:**\n   - \"Look at the challenge station. Make a guess: What will happen if I push the toy?\"\n   - \"Try a soft push first. Watch carefully. What happened?\"\n   - \"Now try a hard push. Is it different?\"\n   - \"Draw or mark on your paper what you saw.\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Ask: *\"Why do you think that happened? Can you show me what you mean?\"*\n   - Encourage trial-and-error: *\"That didn't work the way we expected. What should we try next?\"*\n   - Help students compare their predictions to what actually happened.\n   - Celebrate curiosity and experimentation.\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students apply the concept of **force to new situations** (ramps, obstacles).\n   - Students demonstrate **prediction and testing skills.**\n   - Students can **explain in simple terms** why different amounts of force (push) create different results.\n   - Students may discover that **direction and obstacles affect motion,** extending the concept beyond the original Explore phase.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pushes, forces, and motion using formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** As students work, note whether they:\n  - Use the words \"push,\" \"force,\" or \"motion\" in their own language\n  - Make predictions before testing\n  - Connect their toy activity to the skateboard photograph\n  - Ask questions or wonder about why things happen\n  \n- **Think-Pair-Share (during Explain phase):**\n  - \"Think: What made your toy skateboard move the farthest?\"\n  - \"Turn to your neighbor and share your idea.\"\n  - Call on 3–4 pairs to share aloud. Listen for understanding of force/pushes.\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit card (can be oral responses if writing is challenging):\n\n**Option A – Picture-Based Exit Ticket:**\nShow three pictures:\n1. A person gently touching a toy (soft push)\n2. A person pushing hard (hard push)\n3. A skateboard on grass vs. on concrete\n\nAsk students to:\n- **Point or circle** which shows a bigger push.\n- **Say or draw** what would happen if you pushed a toy hard vs. soft.\n- **Complete the sentence:** \"A push makes things _____.\" (Answer: move)\n\n**Option B – Verbal Exit Ticket:**\nAsk students individually or in small groups:\n1. \"Show me with your hands what a push looks like.\"\n2. \"If you push a toy gently, does it go far or not far?\"\n3. \"Look at the skateboard picture. Is that person using a soft push or a hard push?\"\n\n**Option C – Movement-Based Exit Ticket:**\n- Show a toy skateboard. Ask: \"If I push this gently, everyone walk slowly to the corner. If I push it hard, run!\"\n- Observe whether students understand the relationship between push force and motion distance.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student can **identify a push** and show it with their body.\n- ✓ Student explains or demonstrates that **bigger pushes make things move farther.**\n- ✓ Student **connects the toy activity back to the skateboard** in the photograph.\n- ✓ Student recognizes that **smooth surfaces make movement easier** than rough ones.\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary words like \"push,\" \"force,\" or \"move\" appropriately.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most First Graders will successfully demonstrate understanding of basic push/force and motion concepts.\n- Students will show confidence in predicting and testing outcomes.\n- Some students may spontaneously extend learning to direction, obstacles, or sound (which can be celebrated and encouraged for future lessons).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pair with a buddy:** Assign a student who is confident with the skateboard/toy activities to partner with a student who needs support. The buddy can model predictions and help with recording.\n\n2. **Simplify the task:** Focus on **soft push vs. hard push ONLY**—remove variables like rough surfaces or ramps in early attempts. Once the basic concept is solid, add complexity.\n\n3. **Use larger manipulatives:** Provide bigger, easier-to-push toys (larger toy cars, balls, or wooden blocks with wheels) that require less fine motor control and produce more obvious results.\n\n4. **Verbal scaffolding:** Instead of asking \"What do you notice?\" (open-ended), ask: \"Did it go far or not far?\" or \"Do you see it moving?\" (yes/no with prompt).\n\n5. **Hand-over-hand support:** For students who struggle with the pushing motion, gently guide their hand through a push motion while using language: \"We're pushing. Watch it go!\"\n\n### Challenge (for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Predict and measure:** Provide a meter stick or tape measure. Ask: \"Can you predict how far your toy will go with a soft push? A hard push? Let's measure!\" This introduces measurement and data recording.\n\n2. **Investigate friction:** Set up stations with different surfaces (glass, plastic, fabric, sand) and ask: \"Which surface lets the toy go the farthest? Why?\" This deepens understanding of how friction interacts with force.\n\n3. **Design a ramp experiment:** Provide materials (blocks, cardboard, tape) and ask: \"Can you build a ramp that makes the skateboard go really far?\" Students apply multiple concepts and problem-solve.\n\n4. **Predict the outcome:** Provide a photograph of a different scenario (e.g., a toy on a hill, a toy being pushed backward, a toy on ice) and ask: \"What will happen? Why? How is this like what we did?\"\n\n5. **Extend to sound:** Ask: \"Did you notice the toy makes sounds as it rolls? Where is the sound coming from? Does it sound the same on smooth and rough surfaces?\" This bridges to 1-PS4-1 (sound investigations).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Push or Pull?\" Walk:** Take students on a classroom or hallway walk. Identify objects that require pushes (door, wagon, vacuum) and pulls (rope, drawer, window shade). Create a two-column chart with pictures of each. Discuss: \"Which takes more force? How do you know?\"\n\n2. **Skateboard Park Design:** Provide paper, markers, and materials (blocks, ramps, tape). Ask: \"Design a skateboard park. What surfaces would make the skateboard go fast? What surfaces would make it slow down?\" Students draw or build, then explain their choices using vocabulary from the lesson.\n\n3. **Push and Pull Sorting Game:** Create a basket of household items (toy cars, balls, a book on a slippery surface, a rope, a door). Students sort them by \"things we push\" vs. \"things we pull.\" Discuss exceptions and why some things can be both.\n\n4. **Story Writing/Drawing:** \"Draw a picture of someone pushing a skateboard. Write (or tell) what happens. Does it go fast or slow? Why?\" Use simple sentence frames: \"I push the skateboard. It goes _____.\"\n\n5. **Real-World Connection:** Invite a local skateboarder or roller skater to visit the classroom (with safety gear). Ask them: \"How do you use pushes to make your skateboard move? What's the difference between a gentle push and a big push?\" Students ask questions and observe real-world application.\n\n6. **Obstacle Course Challenge:** Build a simple obstacle course with pillows, tape lines, and cones. Ask: \"Can you push a toy skateboard through this course? Is it harder or easier than pushing it in an open space? Why?\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Classroom Management Tips\n\n- **Safety first:** Ensure all wheeled toys are in good condition and spaces are clear of tripping hazards.\n- **Noise management:** Expect excitement and noise during Explore and Elaborate phases. Set a clear signal (raise hand, bell, lights off) for transitions.\n- **Accessibility:** Adapt for students with mobility differences by allowing them to verbally direct peers, use pointer sticks, or investigate while seated.\n- **Photograph engagement:** Return to the skateboard photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. Ask different questions each time to deepen analysis.\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Use push/force/motion language consistently in your own speech so students hear and internalize these terms naturally.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson plan successfully uses the skateboard photograph as a concrete, engaging springboard for understanding forces and motion—foundational physics concepts appropriate for First Grade. The 5E model ensures students move from curiosity to investigation to understanding to application, with multiple checkpoints for assessment along the way.**",
