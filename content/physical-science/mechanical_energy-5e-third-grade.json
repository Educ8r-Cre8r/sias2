ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed image of the truck with pulley system and suspended ball\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\nDisplay the photograph to the entire class. Ask students to observe carefully for 1-2 minutes without speaking, then facilitate this discussion:\n\n1. **\"What do you see in this picture? What's happening here?\"** (Allow 2-3 responses; students will likely notice the truck, the rope, and the ball in the air.)\n\n2. **\"Why do you think someone would use that truck and all that equipment just to lift a ball? Could they just pick it up with their hands? Why or why not?\"** (Guide students to consider that the ball might be too heavy, or the equipment might make it easier or safer.)\n\n3. **\"Look at the rope attached to the ball. What is pulling the ball up? What is trying to pull it down?\"** (Establish the concept of opposing forces: the rope pulls up, gravity/weight pulls down.)\n\n4. **\"If the worker pulls the rope harder, what do you think will happen to the ball? If they pull more slowly, what happens?\"** (Connect force strength to motion.)\n\nRecord student predictions on chart paper (these will be revisited in the Explain phase).\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become scientists and test how we can use pulleys—special tools like the one on that truck—to lift things. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- Rulers or meter sticks\n- Plastic cups or small buckets\n- String or yarn (at least 4 feet per group)\n- Tape\n- Pennies or small weights (washers, blocks, or clay)\n- Pencils or dowels (for pulley axles)\n- Paper clips\n- Stopwatch (or teacher provides timing)\n- Chart paper or data recording sheet\n\n**Activity:**\n\nOrganize students into small groups. Provide each group with the materials above and follow these step-by-step directions:\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Build a simple pulley:**\n   - Secure a pencil or dowel horizontally across the edge of a desk or table using tape, so it can spin freely.\n   - Thread string around the pencil (this acts as a pulley).\n   - Attach one end of the string to a plastic cup (your \"load\").\n   - Keep the other end free to pull.\n\n2. **Test pulling down vs. lifting by hand:**\n   - First, try to lift the empty cup with your hand. Record how it feels (easy, medium, hard).\n   - Now, fill the cup with 5 pennies and try to lift it by hand. Record how it feels.\n   - Now use the pulley: pull down on the string to lift the cup with pennies. Record how it feels.\n\n3. **Investigate force and motion:**\n   - Pull the string slowly. Observe: How far does the cup move? How long does it take to lift?\n   - Pull the string quickly (harder). Observe: How far does the cup move now? How long does it take?\n   - Record your observations in words or drawings.\n\n4. **Predict and test:**\n   - Predict: If you add more pennies (more weight), will the cup go up faster, slower, or at the same speed when you pull with the same force?\n   - Add 5 more pennies to the cup (10 total).\n   - Pull with the same force as before. Record what happens.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\nCirculate among groups without giving answers. Use these facilitating questions:\n- \"What force is pulling the cup down?\" (Gravity/weight)\n- \"What force is pulling the cup up?\" (The tension in the string from your pull)\n- \"Are those forces balanced or unbalanced when the cup starts to move?\" (Unbalanced—one is stronger)\n- \"What changed when you pulled harder?\" (The force increased; motion was faster/quicker)\n- Encourage groups to use the pencil-and-paper to draw what's happening.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should discover:\n- Pulling down on the string lifts the cup (change of direction: downward force causes upward motion).\n- Stronger/harder pulls cause faster or quicker motion.\n- Adding more weight makes it harder to lift (requires more force for the same motion).\n- A pulley changes the direction of the force, making it easier or more convenient to pull.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers (for vocabulary anchor chart)\n- Projected photograph (truck image)\n- Student data sheets/observations from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share one thing they discovered during exploration.\n   - Record their observations on chart paper.\n   - Point out patterns: \"I notice many of you found that pulling harder makes the cup move faster. That's a pattern we can predict!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   \n   Create an anchor chart with these terms and student-friendly definitions:\n\n   - **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or change its motion.\n   - **Gravity:** A force that pulls things down toward Earth.\n   - **Balanced forces:** Forces that are equal and opposite, so an object stays still or moves at the same speed.\n   - **Unbalanced forces:** Forces that are not equal, so an object starts to move, stops, or changes speed.\n   - **Pulley:** A simple machine made of a wheel and rope that changes the direction of a force and can make lifting easier.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Project the truck image again.\n   - Point to the rope and ball: \"The worker is pulling on the rope (force) to lift the ball. The rope goes around a pulley at the top of the truck's boom.\"\n   - Ask: \"Is the force pulling the ball up balanced or unbalanced?\" (Unbalanced—the rope's pull is stronger than gravity, so the ball moves up.)\n   - Ask: \"Why use a pulley instead of just pushing up on the ball?\" (The pulley changes the direction—you pull down, and the ball goes up. It also spreads the force to make it easier. Some pulleys have more than one wheel, so you need less force.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Show a simple drawing of the pulley system on the board.\n   - Ask: \"If the worker pulls the rope with a strong force, what will happen to the ball?\" (It will move up quickly.)\n   - Ask: \"If the ball is heavier, what will the worker need to do?\" (Pull with more force to make it move up.)\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart:**\n- **Force:** A push or pull that can move or stop something or change how fast it moves.\n- **Gravity:** The force that pulls all things down toward the ground.\n- **Balanced Forces:** Two forces that are equal and push against each other, so nothing moves.\n- **Unbalanced Forces:** Two forces that are not equal, so something starts to move or changes its motion.\n- **Pulley:** A wheel with a rope around it that helps change the direction of a force and makes it easier to lift heavy things.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should understand:\n- Forces are pushes and pulls that cause motion.\n- When two forces are unbalanced, an object moves in the direction of the stronger force.\n- A pulley changes the direction of a force (down becomes up) and can help lift heavy objects.\n- The strength of the force affects how fast or slow something moves.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Previous pulley systems (from Explore)\n- Additional pennies/weights\n- String\n- Copies of a simple \"challenge card\" (see below)\n- Rulers for measurement\n- Clipboards\n\n**Activity:**\n\nPresent students with this **real-world application challenge:**\n\n\"Imagine you work at a construction site (like the one in the photograph). Your boss gives you this job: Lift a bucket of supplies 2 feet off the ground, but your team must use the LEAST amount of force possible. You have a pulley system. What will you do?\"\n\n**Challenge Questions (on a card for each group):**\n\n1. **Measure and predict:** If your bucket weighs 20 pennies, do you predict you can lift it with a gentle pull, a medium pull, or a strong pull? Why?\n\n2. **Test different strategies:** \n   - Try lifting with one pulley (as you did before).\n   - Now, try creating a system with TWO pulleys (thread the string around two pencils/dowels). Which uses less force?\n\n3. **Record:** How does adding more pulleys change how hard you have to pull?\n\n4. **Apply:** Looking at the truck photograph again, why might the truck's boom have a system of pulleys and gears? What advantage does it give?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Observe which groups try different pulley arrangements.\n- Ask: \"How did adding another pulley change the force you needed?\" and \"Can you explain why that happened?\"\n- Guide students to notice that more pulleys = less force needed (but sometimes you have to pull longer or more times).\n- Validate hypotheses; don't correct—let discoveries happen.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should demonstrate:\n- Understanding that different pulley arrangements affect the force needed.\n- Ability to predict outcomes based on their observations from Explore.\n- Recognition that simple machines (like pulleys) are designed to make work easier in real-world jobs.\n- Evidence of cause-and-effect thinking: \"We added another pulley, and now the force needed to lift is less.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during the Engage discussion (predictions about the photograph).\n- Circulate during Explore and note which students correctly identify forces and pulley function.\n- Listen to group explanations during the Explain share-out.\n- Ask follow-up questions during Elaborate: \"Show me how the forces are balanced or unbalanced in your pulley. Why did you predict that?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper. They can respond with words, drawings, or both. **Ask one of the following:**\n\n1. **\"Look at this picture of a child pulling down on a rope attached to a pulley lifting a ball. Draw and label the forces you see. Is the ball moving up, down, or staying still? Explain why.\"** (Provide a simple diagram with the pulley and ball.)\n\n2. **\"If you wanted to lift a heavier ball using a pulley, what would you have to do to the force you pull with? Why?\"**\n\n3. **\"Describe what a pulley is and explain one reason why someone might use one instead of just lifting something with their hands.\"**\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Student correctly identifies at least one force (pull, gravity, tension).  \n✓ Student explains that changing force affects motion (stronger pull = faster motion, or heavier object = more force needed).  \n✓ Student demonstrates understanding that pulleys change the direction of force.  \n✓ Student provides reasoning with \"because\" statements showing cause-and-effect thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents who have met the objectives will:\n- Clearly explain the relationship between force and motion using the pulley example.\n- Predict what will happen if force increases or the load becomes heavier.\n- Describe the pulley's purpose using vocabulary from the lesson.\n- Show evidence of testing and observing during the hands-on investigation.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified pulley setup:** Provide pre-assembled pulley systems so students focus on force and motion, not construction. Use fewer pennies initially (5 instead of 20).\n\n2. **Sentence frames for exit ticket:** Provide sentence starters such as:\n   - \"The force pulling up is _____. The force pulling down is _____.\"\n   - \"When I pulled harder, the cup moved _____.\"\n   - \"A pulley helps because _____.\"\n\n3. **Peer partnerships:** Pair struggling students with confident peers during Explore so they can observe and participate with support.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-pulley investigation:** Provide materials for students to design and test a 2-pulley or 3-pulley system. Ask: \"How does the force needed change with each additional pulley? Can you create a system that lifts the load with only half the force?\"\n\n2. **Measurement and data graphing:** Have students measure the exact force needed (using a spring scale if available) with 1, 2, and 3 pulleys, then create a line graph showing the relationship. Write a conclusion: \"As pulleys increase, the force needed _____.\"\n\n3. **Real-world connection:** Challenge students to find pictures of pulleys in their community (flagpoles, construction sites, elevators) and explain how forces are at work in each example.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Simple Machines Around Us (Homework or Follow-Up):**\n   Students draw or find pictures of 3 simple machines in their home or school (pulleys, levers, wheels, inclined planes). For each, they label the forces at work and explain how it helps people do jobs more easily. They present one to the class in the next session.\n\n2. **Build a Pulley Lift System (Hands-On Extension):**\n   In groups, students design and build a system using multiple pulleys to lift a \"supply bucket\" (weighted cup) and move it horizontally across the room to a target. They test and refine their design, recording which pulley arrangement works best. This connects to the construction theme and 3-PS2-1 (investigating effects of forces).\n\n3. **Force Detective Game (Indoor/Outdoor Activity):**\n   Create a simple scavenger hunt where students identify 5-6 locations/objects in the classroom or school where forces are being used (door hinges, playground equipment, book shelves, water fountain, etc.). For each, they answer: \"What forces are at work here?\" and \"Is it a push, a pull, or both?\" This reinforces force vocabulary and real-world applications beyond the pulley.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis 5E lesson guides third graders from observing a real-world photograph of a pulley system at work to hands-on investigation, formal concept introduction, and practical application. Students develop understanding of balanced and unbalanced forces, cause-and-effect relationships, and the purpose of simple machines—all aligned with 3-PS2-1 and 3-PS2-2. The photograph serves as an authentic hook and a reference point throughout, making abstract force concepts concrete and observable.",
