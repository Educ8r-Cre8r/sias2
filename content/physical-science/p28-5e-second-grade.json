ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photo of the light rail vehicle (one per student or display on screen)\n- Chart paper and marker for recording student ideas\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Show the image of the modern light rail vehicle. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions** (ask in sequence, allowing think-pair-share time):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is this vehicle?\"\n   - \"Look at the wheels. What shape are they? Why do you think wheels are round instead of square?\"\n   - \"This vehicle is very heavy—it carries many people. How do you think it moves so smoothly down the track?\"\n   - \"What do you notice about the metal lines (rails) on the ground? Why might they be there instead of the vehicle rolling on plain concrete?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if the wheels rolled on bumpy, rough ground instead of smooth metal rails, what would happen? Would the vehicle move more easily or with more trouble?\"\n\n4. **Record Prior Knowledge:** Write student predictions on chart paper. Celebrate curiosity; don't correct misconceptions yet.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an experiment with wheels and different surfaces to find out what helps things roll better!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials** (per student pair or small group):\n- 1 toy car or rolling object with wheels\n- 1 piece of sandpaper (rough surface)\n- 1 piece of aluminum foil (smooth, shiny surface)\n- 1 piece of construction paper or cardboard (medium texture)\n- 1 wooden ruler or measuring tape\n- 1 small ramp (can be made by propping a clipboard at an angle)\n- Data recording sheet (see below)\n- Pencils\n\n**Activity: \"Wheels on Different Surfaces\"**\n\n**Student Directions** (provide as a visual anchor chart or read aloud):\n1. Place your car at the top of the ramp.\n2. Let the car roll down the **rough surface (sandpaper)** one time. Measure how far it rolls.\n3. Record the distance in the chart (use drawings or words).\n4. Do steps 2-3 again using the **smooth surface (aluminum foil)** and then the **medium surface (paper)**.\n5. Compare your three measurements. Which surface made the car roll the farthest?\n6. Talk with your group: \"Why did the car roll different distances?\"\n\n**Data Recording Sheet Template:**\n| Surface Type | How Far Did the Car Roll? | Picture or Words |\n|---|---|---|\n| Rough (Sandpaper) | _____ cm | |\n| Smooth (Aluminum Foil) | _____ cm | |\n| Medium (Paper) | _____ cm | |\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group. Ask prompts, not answers: \"What do you notice? Is the distance the same or different? Why might that be?\"\n- If students struggle with measurement, allow them to use comparison words: \"longer,\" \"shorter,\" \"same.\"\n- Do NOT tell students which surface is best; let them discover it.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that the car rolls farther on smooth surfaces than rough surfaces.\n- Students make a connection between surface texture and how easily wheels roll.\n- Students record observations using pictures, numbers, or words.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster board or whiteboard\n- Printed photograph of light rail (displayed again)\n- Visual vocabulary cards with pictures (pre-made or drawn together)\n- Chart paper with student predictions from Engage phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their findings: \"Which surface let your car roll the farthest?\"\n   - Record results on chart: most groups should find smooth surfaces worked better.\n   - Celebrate that they all discovered the same pattern!\n\n2. **Connect to the Photograph:**\n   - Point to the metal rails in the photo: \"Look! The light rail has smooth metal tracks, just like the aluminum foil in our experiment!\"\n   - Point to the wheels: \"The wheels are round and smooth, like your toy car wheels.\"\n   - Explain: \"The smooth wheels roll on smooth rails, so the car can move easily—even though it's very, very heavy!\"\n\n3. **Introduce Vocabulary** (use gestures, demonstrations, and simple language):\n\n   | Vocabulary | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Wheel** | A round object that spins to help something move. |\n   | **Surface** | The outside or top of something (rough or smooth). |\n   | **Friction** | A force that makes things slow down when they rub together. Rough surfaces have more friction. |\n   | **Force** | A push or pull that makes something move or stop. |\n   | **Material** | What something is made of (metal, rubber, plastic, wood, etc.). |\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Show the rough sandpaper and smooth foil again. Ask: \"Which one has more friction? Which one helps the wheel roll better?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why did we use smooth metal rails for the light rail instead of bumpy concrete?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that smooth surfaces reduce friction.\n- Students can name materials used in wheels and rails (metal, rubber).\n- Students recognize that friction affects how easily wheels roll.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Toy cars (same as Explore phase)\n- Variety of scrap materials: sandpaper, aluminum foil, plastic wrap, cloth, bubble wrap, wax paper\n- Ramp or incline\n- Measuring tools\n- Drawing paper and crayons/markers\n\n**Activity: \"Design the Best Track\"**\n\n1. **Scenario:** \"A new toy car company is building a track. They want the car to go as far as possible. What surface should they use?\"\n\n2. **Investigation:**\n   - Groups choose which scrap materials to test on their ramp.\n   - They test 2-3 materials and measure distance.\n   - They create a simple bar graph or picture showing which material worked best.\n\n3. **Apply to Real World:**\n   - Ask: \"Real light rails use metal tracks and metal wheels. Why do you think they chose those materials?\"\n   - Discuss: \"What if light rails had bumpy, textured wheels and rough tracks? What problems might that cause?\"\n\n4. **Create a Poster:**\n   - Students draw and label a light rail or wheel and rail system, showing why smooth surfaces are important.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to notice patterns without telling them the answer.\n- Ask: \"What's the same about the surfaces that worked best? What's different about the surfaces that didn't work well?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can predict which materials work best for wheels and tracks.\n- Students understand that smooth materials reduce friction better than rough materials.\n- Students can apply this concept to explain real-world designs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Do students test surfaces systematically? Do they measure? Do they notice differences?\n- Listen during group discussions: Can students explain why smooth surfaces work better?\n- Observe vocabulary use in Explain phase: Do students use words like \"wheel,\" \"smooth,\" and \"roll\" correctly?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nChoose one format based on your students' abilities:\n\n**Option A: Picture and Words (for emerging writers)**\n- Draw a light rail wheel rolling on its track.\n- Write or dictate: \"The wheel rolls better because the track is ________\" (smooth/rough).\n- Draw an arrow showing the direction the wheel moves.\n\n**Option B: Short Answer**\n- \"Which surface helps wheels roll better: rough or smooth? Why?\"\n- \"Look at this light rail picture. Point to a smooth part. Point to a round part (wheel). Why are these parts smooth and round?\"\n\n**Option C: Performance Task**\n- Show two material samples (one smooth, one rough).\n- Ask: \"Which one would you use for a light rail track? Explain why.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies smooth surfaces as better for rolling wheels.\n- ✓ Student connects this to the light rail in the photograph.\n- ✓ Student uses one vocabulary word correctly (wheel, smooth, friction, material, or force).\n- ✓ Student can give a reason for their choice (not just a guess).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify smooth surfaces as better for rolling.\n- Students can explain that wheels and smooth tracks help heavy vehicles move.\n- Students can connect the classroom experiment to the real light rail vehicle.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n1. **Simplified Recording:** Instead of measuring exact distances, use visual comparison (draw pictures of how far the car rolled—bigger picture = farther distance).\n2. **Pre-Teaching Vocabulary:** Use tactile learning—let students touch rough sandpaper and smooth foil multiple times before the experiment, naming them repeatedly.\n3. **Reduced Testing:** Have students test only 2 surfaces (rough and smooth) instead of 3, reducing cognitive load.\n4. **Peer Support:** Pair struggling students with strong communicators during group work; assign roles (\"You release the car,\" \"You measure,\" \"You record\").\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n1. **Three-Variable Experiment:** Test different wheel sizes/materials on the same surface. Which wheel type rolls farther? Introduce the idea that wheel design matters too.\n2. **Real-World Application:** Research and present: \"Why do trains use metal wheels and metal tracks? What would happen if they used rubber or plastic?\" (Create a poster or simple presentation.)\n3. **Data Analysis:** Create a bar graph showing all class results. Ask: \"Why do you think some groups got different measurements? What could we do to make results more fair?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Build a Ramp Challenge\"** (Next lesson)\n   - Students design and test a ramp using different materials.\n   - Question: \"If you change the angle of the ramp, does the car roll farther? Why?\"\n   - (Introduces variables in motion and forces.)\n\n2. **\"Wheels in Our Classroom Hunt\"** (Real-world observation)\n   - Students walk around school and identify things with wheels (carts, chairs, doors, toys).\n   - Record on a chart: What are the wheels made of? What surface do they roll on?\n   - Connect: \"Wheels are everywhere! Do they all roll on smooth surfaces?\"\n\n3. **\"Friction Experiment: Spin and Stop\"** (Home activity or extension)\n   - Give students a spinning top or fidget spinner.\n   - Challenge: Spin it on different surfaces at home (table, rug, sand, ice).\n   - Record: Which surface makes it stop fastest? (This is friction slowing it down—advance concept, but 2nd graders love the discovery!)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure ramps are stable and won't collapse. Supervise toy car testing so cars don't roll into students' faces.\n- **Prep Time:** 20 minutes to gather materials and print/prepare visual aids.\n- **Flexible Pacing:** If students are deeply engaged in Explore, extend that phase to 30 minutes. You can shorten Elaborate or split the lesson across three sessions.\n- **Connection to Prior Knowledge:** Many 2nd graders have played with toy cars and ramps. Leverage this! \"You've played with ramps before. Today, you're scientists figuring out why some ramps work better than others.\"\n- **Real-World Relevance:** Students ride buses, see cars, and notice wheels daily. This lesson validates their observations and teaches *why* wheels work the way they do.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson brings the light rail photograph to life by letting students *discover* through exploration before formalizing concepts. The progression from hands-on testing → group discussion → real-world connection keeps Second Grade learners engaged and builds genuine understanding of force, motion, and materials.",
