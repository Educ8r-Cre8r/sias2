Observe and describe how light makes objects visible and creates shadows.\n2. Investigate what happens to shadows when objects are moved closer to and farther from a light source.\n3. Identify and compare how different materials (shiny, dull, dark, light) interact with light differently.\n4. Predict and test how moving an object changes the size and shape of its shadow.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the blue robot (or display on smartboard/projector)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: small toy robot or similar object for classroom demo\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display Setup:** Show the photograph to the whole class using a projector, smartboard, or large printed version. Ask students to sit in a semicircle where all can see clearly.\n\n2. **Hook:** \"Look at this mysterious blue robot! It's outside in the sunshine. What do you notice?\" Allow 30 seconds of silent observation before taking responses.\n\n3. **Discussion Questions (calibrated for First Grade):**\n   - \"Do you see a dark shape under the robot? What do you think that is?\" (Guide toward \"shadow\")\n   - \"Why can we see the robot so clearly? What's making it bright?\" (Light from the sun)\n   - \"If this robot was inside a dark classroom with no lights on, do you think we could see it? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"Notice the grass and the concrete ground. They look different colors. Why do you think that is?\" (Different materials, different amounts of light hitting them)\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we moved the robot closer to the sun... or farther away? Would the shadow get bigger or smaller? Let's be scientists and find out!\"\n\n5. **Record on Chart Paper:** Write student predictions and wonderings on a chart titled \"Our Questions About Light and Shadows\" to revisit during Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to do our own investigations with lights and objects to discover how shadows work, just like real scientists!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One flashlight per pair of students (or 1 for teacher demo + 2-3 student stations)\n- Small objects of varying materials: plastic toy, metal spoon, wooden block, piece of cloth, eraser\n- White paper or white wall space for shadow projection\n- Chart for recording observations\n- Optional: tape to secure paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Shadow Discovery Station (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Pair Setup:** Divide class into 2-3 pairs. Set up 2-3 shadow investigation stations around the room, each with a flashlight, white paper, and a collection of test objects.\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Pick one object from the table.\"\n   - \"Hold it up in front of the white paper.\"\n   - \"Shine the flashlight on the object so the shadow appears on the white paper behind it.\"\n   - \"Look carefully: What does the shadow look like? Is it big or small? Is it dark or light?\"\n   - \"Trade objects with your partner and try again.\"\n   - \"Write or draw what you see on your observation sheet.\"\n\n3. **Documentation:** Students draw 2-3 objects and their shadows on a simple graphic organizer (template provided):\n   ```\n   Object: _____________\n   What did the shadow look like? _______________\n   Was it dark or light? _______________\n   ```\n\n4. **Rotation:** After 5 minutes, rotate pairs to a new station with different objects or materials.\n\n**Part B: Moving the Light (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Revised Activity:** \"Now we're going to see what happens when we move the flashlight. Keep the same object, but move the light closer... and then farther away. What happens to the shadow?\"\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Hold your object still on the white paper.\"\n   - \"Shine the flashlight close to the object. Look at the shadow. Is it big or small?\"\n   - \"Now move the flashlight far away. Look at the shadow again. Did it change?\"\n   - \"Draw or write: When the light is close, the shadow is _______. When the light is far, the shadow is _______.\"\n\n3. **Teacher Role:** \n   - Circulate and ask probing questions without revealing answers: \"What did you notice? Can you describe the shadow? What changed?\"\n   - Take quick photos of student work or shadows for later reference.\n   - Prompt students to compare their observations: \"Did everyone's shadow change the same way?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that light creates shadows.\n- Students recognize that shadows change size/shape based on light position.\n- Students observe that different materials may cast slightly different shadows (plastic reflects light differently than dull wood).\n- Students record observations through drawings and simple words.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of robot (reprinted or displayed again)\n- Photos taken during Explore phase (if available)\n- Simple picture cards showing light, shadow, object\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Gather students in a circle with their observation sheets.\n   - Ask 3-4 volunteers to share what they discovered: \"What happened when you shined the light on the object?\"\n   - Chart student language on anchor paper titled \"What We Discovered About Light and Shadows.\"\n\n2. **Direct Instruction with Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n\n   Use the photograph and student work to introduce concepts:\n\n   - **Light:** \"This is light. Light comes from the sun, or from a flashlight, or from a lamp. Light helps us see things.\"\n   \n   - **Shadow:** \"A shadow is the dark shape you see when light is blocked by an object. See the dark shape under the robot? That's a shadow!\"\n   \n   - **Illuminated/Illumination:** \"When light shines on something, we say it's illuminated. The robot is illuminated by the sun, so we can see it clearly.\"\n   \n   - **Object:** \"An object is a thing—like a robot, a toy, or a book. When light hits an object, a shadow forms.\"\n   \n   - **Visibility:** \"Visibility means whether we can see something or not. The robot has good visibility because the sun is shining on it.\"\n\n3. **Concrete Connections:**\n   - Point back to the robot photo: \"The robot's shadow is dark because the sunlight is being blocked. The light can't get past the robot, so we see a dark shadow on the ground.\"\n   - Show photos from the Explore activity: \"Remember when we moved the flashlight? When it was close, the shadow was bigger. When it was far, it got smaller. That's the same science!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Show an object in a dark corner and ask: \"Can we see this clearly? Why not? What do we need to make it visible?\" (Light!)\n   - Shine a flashlight on it: \"Now what changed? Is it visible? Why?\"\n   - Ask students to turn and talk to a partner: \"Tell your partner: What makes a shadow?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Light** | Energy from the sun, flashlight, or lamp that helps us see things. |\n| **Shadow** | A dark shape that appears when light is blocked by an object. |\n| **Illuminated** | When light shines on something and makes it visible and bright. |\n| **Object** | A thing that light can shine on—like a toy, book, or robot. |\n| **Visibility** | Whether we can see something or not; depends on light. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use words like \"light,\" \"shadow,\" and \"illuminated\" to describe what they observed.\n- Students explain in simple words: \"Light hits the object and makes a shadow.\"\n- Students can predict: \"If there's no light, I can't see the object.\"\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding in a new context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Flashlights (same as Explore)\n- 3D objects of varied heights and shapes: block, cylinder, ball, cone, toy figure\n- White paper or wall space\n- Chart for predictions\n- Optional: colored cellophane or tissue paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Shadow Shape Challenge:**\n\n1. **Setup:** Display 3-4 different 3D objects (block, sphere, tall cylinder, short figure).\n\n2. **Prediction (3 minutes):**\n   - Display each object one at a time.\n   - Ask: \"If I shine the light on this object, what shape will the shadow be?\" \n   - Students draw their prediction on a chart with two columns: \"Object\" and \"Shadow Shape I Think.\"\n\n3. **Investigation (10 minutes):**\n   - Shine the flashlight on each object and project the shadow clearly.\n   - Ask: \"Was your prediction right? What shape do we see?\"\n   - Discuss why different shapes make different shadows: \"A ball makes a round shadow. A block makes a square shadow.\"\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - Return to the robot photo: \"The robot has a round head, so its head shadow is round. The body is more curved, so that shadow looks different. The robot is made from objects with different shapes!\"\n   - Ask: \"Where do you see shadows outside? On sunny days? On cloudy days? Is the shadow smaller or bigger when the sun is high in the sky versus when it's near the horizon?\" (Accept varied observations; point out the sun's position affects shadow size.)\n\n5. **Optional Extension:** If time permits, place colored cellophane over the flashlight. \"What happens to the shadow when we add color to the light?\" (Students observe colored shadows, deepening understanding of how light behaves.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate predictions without judging correctness.\n- Help students see the connection between object shape and shadow shape.\n- Ask: \"Why do you think the shadow has that shape?\"\n- Connect back to the robot and outdoor light observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students predict and test shadow shapes for new objects.\n- Students articulate: \"The shape of the object makes the shape of the shadow.\"\n- Students apply learning to real-world contexts (outdoor shadows, time of day effects).\n- Students develop deeper understanding that light behaves predictably.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light, shadows, and visibility.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student predictions, investigations, and explanations during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Use a simple checklist:\n  - ☐ Student can identify a shadow in the photograph.\n  - ☐ Student can predict what happens to a shadow when light moves.\n  - ☐ Student can explain that light is needed to see objects.\n  - ☐ Student can use vocabulary: light, shadow, illuminated.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5–10 minutes):**\n\nChoose one or combine for a richer assessment:\n\n**Option A: Drawing & Dictation**\n- Show a student the robot photograph again.\n- Ask: \"Draw what you see. Point to the shadow. Why is there a shadow?\"\n- Scribe student's response or have student write simple words.\n\n**Option B: Picture Sort**\n- Show 4 images: (1) object in sunlight with clear shadow, (2) object in shadow/shade, (3) object in darkness, (4) object well-lit with no visible shadow.\n- Ask: \"Which picture shows the best light? Which would make the biggest shadow? Which could we NOT see well?\"\n\n**Option C: Think-Pair-Share + Written Prompt**\n- Prompt: \"Our robot friend is playing hide-and-seek. Is it easy to see the blue robot in the bright sunshine? Why? If we played inside a dark room, could we see it? Why not? What would we need?\"\n- Students draw and label: object, light source, and shadow.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Developing:** Student can identify a shadow and name one light source.\n- **Proficient:** Student can explain that light makes shadows and that objects need light to be seen.\n- **Advanced:** Student can predict how shadow size or shape will change based on light position or object shape, and use vocabulary correctly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students (80%+) will be able to identify a shadow and explain it's made by light.\n- Most students will predict that objects in darkness cannot be seen without light.\n- Advanced students will explain the relationship between light position and shadow size/shape.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Scaffold:**\n   - Use only 2-3 core words: \"light,\" \"shadow,\" \"dark.\"\n   - Create a visual anchor chart with pictures (sun = light, dark shape = shadow) that stays visible.\n   - Pair student with a buddy during investigations for peer language modeling.\n\n2. **Guided Handholding During Explore:**\n   - Work with this group in a small station first.\n   - Demonstrate with a flashlight and object before they try.\n   - Ask one yes/no question at a time: \"Do you see a dark shape? Is it big?\"\n   - Scribe observations for them rather than expecting written responses.\n\n3. **Reduced Complexity in Elaborate Phase:**\n   - Provide only 2 objects to investigate (not 4) for shadow shape prediction.\n   - Use a pre-drawn template with the object picture and a blank space for shadow shape.\n   - Reduce the number of questions asked.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Multi-Variable Investigation:**\n   - Provide a \"Science Challenge\": \"Can you make the shadow VERY big? Can you make it TINY? Test different distances and positions. Draw your results.\"\n   - Students measure shadow size informally (using hands, paper markings) and compare.\n\n2. **Light Source Exploration:**\n   - Ask: \"What if we used two flashlights instead of one? What happens to the shadows? What if we used different colored lights?\"\n   - Students predict and test, then explain why two lights might create two shadows or why colors change the shadow appearance.\n\n3. **Real-World Application Project:**\n   - Assign a homework or follow-up task: \"Find three shadows at home or outside. Take pictures or draw them. Which shadow is biggest? Why?\"\n   - Have student present findings to the class, explaining how the sun's position or object placement affected the shadow.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Shadow Puppet Theater (Fine Arts Integration):**\n   - Create a simple shadow screen using a white sheet and a bright light source (flashlight or lamp).\n   - Provide cut-outs or have students create silhouettes of animals, objects, or characters.\n   - Students place objects/silhouettes between light and screen to create a shadow show.\n   - **Connection:** This reinforces that light, an object, and a surface are needed for shadows; students create meaning through play while practicing light concepts.\n\n2. **Sun and Shadow Tracking Over Time (Environmental Science / Light Observation):**\n   - On a sunny day, place an object outside (like the robot in the photo) and mark its shadow position and size on the ground with chalk.\n   - Repeat observations every 1-2 hours and mark where the shadow is.\n   - Discuss: \"The shadow moved! The sun moved in the sky! The shadow grew bigger and smaller!\" \n   - **Connection:** Students see real-world evidence that light source position affects shadows and deepens understanding of how light behaves over time.\n\n3. **Illuminate the Classroom (Light Sources Exploration):**\n   - Take a walk around the school or classroom with a partner.\n   - Find and label light sources: windows, lamps, glowing devices, reflective surfaces.\n   - Create a class map or chart titled \"Where Is Light in Our School?\"\n   - Discuss: \"Which room is brightest? Which is darkest? Where would our robot be easiest to see?\"\n   - **Connection:** This extends learning beyond the lesson to student's environment, building awareness of how light enables visibility in real spaces.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Classroom Management Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure flashlights are used safely (never pointed at eyes) and are durable classroom flashlights.\n- **Pacing:** If completing in two sessions, end Session 1 after Explore and do Explain–Evaluate in Session 2. This allows reflection time and deepens retention.\n- **Space:** Investigate stations work best in a semi-darkened room or corner. Close blinds if possible to see shadows clearly.\n- **Engagement:** First graders love hands-on exploration. Keep whole-group time brief (Engage and Explain combined ≤ 25 min) and maximize hands-on phases.\n- **Accessibility:** Ensure all students can see the photograph and projected shadows. Use large, printed images for students who need them close.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson builds from concrete observations (light makes shadows) to formal vocabulary to application and prediction—following the 5E model while keeping First Grade developmental stages in mind. Students engage with the mysterious robot, explore light's effects, explain what they learned, apply knowledge to new objects, and demonstrate understanding through drawings and explanations.",
