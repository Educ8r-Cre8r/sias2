Explain that sound is created by vibrations and travels as waves through air.\n2. Describe how the size and speed of a vibration affects the loudness and pitch of sound.\n3. Demonstrate that sound energy can be detected by observing how sound waves move objects.\n4. Identify real-world examples of sound waves being used to send information or create music.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring the photograph of musicians on stage.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the band/brass section performing on stage (printed or digital display)\n- Sound recording device (phone or classroom computer) to play a short trumpet or brass section audio clip (30 seconds)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector and ask students to observe quietly for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you think is happening in this picture? How can you tell?\"\n   - \"These musicians are playing brass instruments. What do you think they have to do to make sound come out of those instruments?\"\n   - \"If you were sitting in the audience watching this, what would you experience besides seeing the instruments? What else would reach you from the stage?\"\n   - \"How do you think the sound gets from the trumpet all the way to the back of the room where people are sitting?\"\n\n3. **Play a 30-second audio clip** of a brass section or trumpet solo. Ask:\n   - \"What's traveling from that speaker (or musician) to your ears right now?\"\n   - \"Raise your hand if you could feel any vibration or movement in the air.\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... if sound is made by vibrations, can we actually SEE or FEEL a vibration making sound?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Today we're going to become sound scientists. We're going to investigate how vibrations make sound and see if we can actually watch sound waves do their job.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how vibrations create sound and how sound energy can move objects.\n\n**Materials (per student pair or small group):**\n- 1 rubber band\n- 1 empty paper cup or container (paper bowl works well)\n- 1 plastic spoon\n- 1 small handful of dry rice or salt\n- 1 sheet of aluminum foil\n- Masking tape\n- 1 tuning fork (or a stretched balloon as alternative)\n- Optional: a bell or smartphone app that plays a single frequency tone\n\n**Activity — Investigation: Make Sound Waves Move Objects**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **Preparation:** Stretch a rubber band tightly around a paper cup or container (teacher may pre-prepare these for younger fourth graders).\n\n2. **Create a vibrating surface:** Place a small piece of aluminum foil loosely over the rubber band (don't press it down—let it rest lightly on top).\n\n3. **Add the \"detector\":** Sprinkle a few grains of rice or salt onto the aluminum foil surface.\n\n4. **Make vibrations:** Using a plastic spoon, gently tap the rubber band repeatedly in a steady rhythm. Observe what happens to the rice/salt grains.\n\n5. **Increase the vibration:** Tap harder and faster. Record observations: Do the grains move more? Do they jump higher?\n\n6. **Alternative method:** If using a tuning fork, strike it on a soft surface and hold it near (but not touching) the aluminum foil surface. Observe how the grains respond.\n\n7. **Draw conclusions:** Sketch what you observed. Label: the vibration, the rice grains moving, and the direction the grains traveled.\n\n**Connection to photograph:** \"Just like when the trumpet player blows into the instrument, the metal tubing vibrates. Those vibrations create sound waves that travel through the air—just like the vibrations from the rubber band made the rice grains jump!\"\n\n**What students should record or document:**\n- Drawings showing rice grains before and after vibration\n- Written or verbal descriptions: \"When I tapped the rubber band, the rice grains ___.\"\n- Observations about whether harder vibrations caused more movement\n- A simple diagram labeling the vibrating object and the moving grains\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group and ask guiding questions: \"What's causing the grains to move?\" and \"Does the rice move the same way every time you tap?\"\n- Resist providing answers; instead, ask students to compare their observations: \"How was your result different when you tapped harder?\"\n- Prompt students to predict: \"What do you think will happen if you tap even faster?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and record that vibrations cause nearby objects to move.\n- Students discover that larger or faster vibrations cause more noticeable movement.\n- Students make the connection between vibration, sound, and energy transfer (without formal terminology yet).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect concepts to the photograph and exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled diagram of a sound wave\n- Photograph of the band (from Engage phase)\n- Optional: diagram of a trumpet showing where air vibrates the tubing\n- Student science notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Invite 2–3 student pairs to share their observations. Record key words they use on chart paper (vibration, shaking, movement, energy, jumping).\n\n2. **Introduce formal vocabulary (7 minutes):** Use student observations to build definitions together:\n\n   **Vocabulary with Fourth Grade-friendly definitions:**\n   - **Vibration:** A very quick back-and-forth movement of something. (Show by gently wiggling your hand back and forth rapidly.)\n   - **Sound wave:** An invisible wave of energy that travels through the air when something vibrates. It can reach our ears.\n   - **Amplitude:** How big or strong a vibration is. A bigger vibration (amplitude) makes a louder sound.\n   - **Pitch:** How high or low a sound is. Fast vibrations make high sounds; slow vibrations make low sounds.\n   - **Sound energy:** The power that sound carries as it travels through the air from one place to another.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the trumpet player: \"When this musician blows into the trumpet, what happens inside? The metal tubing starts to vibrate.\"\n   - Draw a simple diagram showing: vibration → sound wave → travel through air → reach audience's ears\n   - Ask: \"Where is the vibration starting? Where does the sound wave travel? How does it reach all the way to the back of the theater?\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:** Ask students to turn and talk to a partner:\n   - \"In one sentence, what has to happen FIRST before we hear a trumpet?\" (Something has to vibrate.)\n   - \"How is what we did with the rubber band like what happens inside a trumpet?\" (Both create vibrations that make sound.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and define the key vocabulary terms.\n- Students understand the sequence: vibration → sound wave → travels through air → reaches ears.\n- Students connect their exploration activity to the real-world example of musicians playing instruments.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by creating and testing sound wave models in a new context.\n\n**Materials (per student pair or group):**\n- 1 long slinky toy (or a spring)\n- 1 rope (4–6 feet long) per group\n- Masking tape\n- Meter stick or measuring tape\n- Chalk or whiteboard markers\n- Chart paper for recording data\n- Balloon (optional, for sound vibration test)\n\n**Activity — Investigation: Model How Sound Waves Travel**\n\n**Part A: Visualizing a Sound Wave (8 minutes)**\n\n1. Students work in pairs with a rope or slinky stretched on the floor or table (secured at one end with tape).\n\n2. One student holds one end of the rope steady while the other gently wiggles it up and down in a continuous rhythm, creating a wave pattern.\n\n3. Students observe and discuss:\n   - \"Does the rope move in the same direction the wave travels?\" (No—the rope goes up and down, but the wave moves forward.)\n   - \"If the rope is like air and the wave is like a sound wave, what is traveling? The air, or the energy?\" (The energy travels; the air just vibrates.)\n\n4. Students measure with a meter stick: \"How far did the wave travel in 5 seconds?\"\n\n**Part B: Amplitude Test (7 minutes)**\n\n1. Students make the rope vibrate with **small movements** (small amplitude) and observe the wave pattern.\n\n2. Students then make the rope vibrate with **large movements** (large amplitude) and observe the difference.\n\n3. Record and compare:\n   - Which wave looked taller/bigger?\n   - Which would be like a loud sound vs. a quiet sound?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask: \"Which rope movement is like the brass players in the photograph playing loudly?\"\n- Encourage students to make predictions before testing: \"If we make bigger waves, do you think the sound would be louder?\"\n- Facilitate group discussion about real-world examples: \"When a speaker is turned up loud, what's happening to the vibrations inside?\"\n\n**Real-world connection:** \"When the band in the photograph played loudly for the whole audience to hear, their instruments were vibrating with BIG amplitude—making big sound waves that traveled all the way to the back of the room.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that waves transfer energy without moving the medium (rope/air) forward.\n- Students connect amplitude to loudness.\n- Students can describe and draw a model of how sound travels from the source (instrument) to the receiver (ear).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of sound waves, vibrations, and energy transfer.\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Did students correctly identify that vibrations caused the rice grains to move?\n- **Turn and talk (Explain phase):** Listen for students to articulate that vibrations must happen first before sound is heard.\n- **Rope/slinky activity:** Can students predict what will happen with different amplitudes before testing?\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes)**\n\nProvide students with a simple exit ticket (written or verbal for younger writers). Choose one of the following formats:\n\n**Option 1: Drawing and Label**\n- \"Draw a trumpet player making sound. Show: 1) the vibration inside the trumpet, 2) the sound wave traveling through the air, 3) the ear hearing the sound. Label each part.\"\n\n**Option 2: Multiple Choice and Short Answer**\n- \"What has to happen FIRST before you hear a trumpet?\" \n  - A) The sound wave travels through the air. \n  - B) The trumpet tubing vibrates. ✓ \n  - C) Your ear receives the sound.\n\n- \"When a musician plays a trumpet very loudly, what is different about the vibrations?\" (Amplitudes are bigger/larger/stronger.)\n\n**Option 3: Quick Write (2-3 sentences)**\n- \"Explain to someone who has never seen a trumpet how a musician makes sound come out of the instrument. Use the word 'vibration' in your answer.\"\n\n**Success Criteria — Students demonstrate understanding if they:**\n- Correctly identify vibration as the cause of sound (4-PS3-2).\n- Explain that vibrations create waves that travel through air (4-PS4-1).\n- Connect the size of vibration (amplitude) to the loudness of sound (4-PS4-1).\n- Apply learning to a real-world context (the band in the photograph).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners):\n\n1. **Pre-teaching vocabulary:** Before the Explain phase, show pictures of vibrating objects (speaker cone, drum head, tuning fork in slow motion video) so students see the concept concretely before formal naming.\n\n2. **Scaffold the rice grain observation:** Provide sentence stems for recording observations:\n   - \"When I tapped gently, the rice grains ___.\"\n   - \"When I tapped harder, the rice grains ___.\"\n   - \"This is like ___ because ___.\"\n\n3. **Simplify the exit ticket:** Use a picture-matching format where students match the stage photograph to a sound wave diagram, with teacher/aide verbal explanation of each part.\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners):\n\n1. **Investigate pitch:** Provide materials to explore how vibration *speed* (frequency) affects pitch. Students can use different rubber band thicknesses, different containers, or pluck rubber bands at different tensions to discover that faster vibrations = higher pitch.\n\n2. **Design and test:** Challenge students to design a \"sound shield\" using household materials to block or absorb sound waves. Test predictions: \"Which material best stops sound from traveling?\"\n\n3. **Real-world research:** Ask students to investigate how concert halls or recording studios are designed to manage sound waves. Students research and present how walls, shapes, and materials affect sound travel.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Instrument Investigation Stations:** Set up 4–5 stations with different instruments or sound-makers (tuning forks, drums, whistles, straws for water column pitch). Students rotate and predict which will have faster/slower vibrations based on the sound produced. Record predictions vs. observations.\n\n2. **Sound Wave Relay:** Students stand in a line (like a wave traveling). Call out commands:\n   - \"Small vibration!\" → Students sway gently side to side.\n   - \"Big amplitude vibration!\" → Students sway widely.\n   - \"Fast vibrations!\" → Students move quickly back and forth.\n   This kinesthetic activity reinforces that energy moves through a medium even though the medium doesn't travel forward.\n\n3. **Home Connection—Family Sound Hunt:** Send home an assignment: \"Find three sounds in your home. For each one, draw the source of the vibration, the sound wave traveling, and where your ear detects it. Bring back your drawings to share with the class.\" This extends the learning into the real world and engages families.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
