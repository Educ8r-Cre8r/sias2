ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about electricity, motion, and energy transfer using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected photograph of the light rail (visible to all students)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board without commentary. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (write them on the board as you go):\n   - *\"What do you see moving in this picture? What is making it move?\"*\n   - *\"Do you see any wires or cables connected to this train? Why might they be there?\"*\n   - *\"How is this train different from a car you might ride in? What does it use for power instead of gasoline?\"*\n   - *\"If this train is moving very fast, do you think it needs more or less energy than a train moving slowly? Why?\"*\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Say, *\"I wonder what would happen if we cut one of those overhead wires? What do you think?\"* Pause for responses. Emphasize that we need electricity flowing through those wires to keep the train moving.\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper. Don't correct misconceptions yet — these will be addressed in the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Let's find out exactly how electrical energy gets to this train and makes it go — and then we'll build our own version!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate energy conversion by building a simple electric motor device that demonstrates how electrical energy becomes motion.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3–4 students):**\n- 1 AA or 9V battery with battery holder\n- 1 small electric motor (pre-assembled; available from educational supply companies like Arbor Scientific, Carolina Biological, or PASCO)\n- 2–3 rubber bands or tape\n- 1 plastic cup or small container\n- 1 wooden dowel or pencil\n- Markers\n- Safety goggles (1 per student)\n- **Optional:** String, tape, small toy figures to place on the device\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Assemble the device (Teacher pre-assembles OR students assemble with clear visuals):**\n   - Secure the motor to the cup using rubber bands or tape.\n   - Attach the wooden dowel through the motor's axle so it spins freely.\n   - Connect the battery to the motor using pre-assembled wires with alligator clips.\n\n2. **Observe and Record:**\n   - Before connecting the battery, predict: *\"How fast do you think the dowel will spin?\"* (slow, medium, or fast). Write your prediction on your data sheet.\n   - Connect the battery. Observe what happens. Describe the motion using words like *spinning*, *slow*, *fast*, *smooth*, *jerky*.\n   - Count how many times the dowel spins in 10 seconds. Record this number.\n\n3. **Test Energy Changes:**\n   - **Test 1 (More Energy):** If using a 9V battery, switch to it after testing the AA battery. Predict whether the motor will spin faster, slower, or the same. Test and record.\n   - **Test 2 (Less Energy):** If possible, partially disconnect one battery wire to reduce power. Predict and test what happens to the speed.\n   - Tape a small paper flag or string to the dowel. Observe how the moving dowel moves objects around it.\n\n4. **Record Observations:**\n   - Students complete a simple data table:\n     - Battery type / Connection strength | Speed prediction | Actual speed (fast/slow/medium) | Spin count in 10 seconds\n\n5. **Reflection Question:** *\"How is what we just saw similar to the light rail in the photograph? What gave the energy in both cases?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"What changed when you switched batteries? Did it get more or less energy? How do you know?\"*\n- Do **not** explain the relationship between energy and speed; let students discover it through observation.\n- Assist with assembly only; encourage students to make predictions before testing.\n- Ensure goggles are worn and that battery connections are safe.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe that **more electrical energy → faster motion**.\n- Students recognize the **energy transfer**: electrical energy (from battery) → kinetic energy (spinning motion).\n- Students begin to see the parallel: the light rail receives electrical energy from overhead wires, just like the motor received it from the battery.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts, connecting the Explore activity to the photograph and real-world applications.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Projected photograph of the light rail\n- Prepared vocabulary cards with images (optional)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3–4 student groups to share one discovery from their motor activity.\n   - Listen for observations about speed changes and energy amounts.\n   - Validate all observations and gently redirect misconceptions.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Write each term on the board. Use simple definitions and point to the photograph or motor device as you define:\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Electrical Energy** | Energy that comes from electricity, like power from a battery or power lines. It can make things move, light up, or heat up. |\n   | **Kinetic Energy** | The energy of motion — energy that something has when it is moving. A faster-moving object has more kinetic energy. |\n   | **Energy Conversion (or Energy Transfer)** | When one type of energy changes into a different type. In our motor, electrical energy converted into motion energy. |\n   | **Power Source** | Something that supplies energy. Our batteries were power sources; the overhead wires on the train are power sources. |\n   | **Catenary Lines** | The overhead wires that deliver electricity to trains and light rails. (Point to the wires in the photograph.) |\n\n3. **Explicit Connection (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again.\n   - Say: *\"Just like your battery gave electrical energy to the motor to make it spin, those overhead wires give electrical energy to the light rail train. The train's motor uses that electrical energy to make its wheels turn and move the whole train down the tracks — that's kinetic energy. The faster the train goes, the more kinetic energy it has.\"*\n   - Ask: *\"What would happen to the train's speed if we gave it less electrical energy? What if we gave it more?\"* (Students should predict: less energy = slower; more energy = faster, based on their motor observations.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"Can you show me with your hands what happens to the motor when we add more energy?\"* (Students mime spinning faster.)\n   - Ask: *\"Where does the light rail get its electrical energy?\"* (From the overhead wires.)\n   - Ask: *\"What type of energy does the electrical energy become?\"* (Motion/kinetic energy.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Electrical Energy:** Energy that comes from electricity; can be used to make things move, light up, or heat up.\n- **Kinetic Energy:** Energy of motion; the energy something has when it is moving.\n- **Energy Conversion:** When one type of energy changes into a different type.\n- **Power Source:** Something that supplies energy (batteries, power lines, etc.).\n- **Catenary Lines:** Overhead wires that deliver electricity to trains and light rails.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that electrical energy and motion energy are connected.\n- Students can name the overhead wires as the train's power source.\n- Students predict that more energy results in faster motion.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply energy conversion concepts to a new challenge: designing a train-like vehicle powered by a motor.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3–4 students):**\n- Motor device from Explore phase (with battery still attached)\n- Small plastic container or paper cup (to be the \"train car\")\n- Tape and markers\n- 4 small wheels or bottle caps with axles (pre-assembled or provided)\n- String or yarn\n- Small objects (blocks, toy figures) to load as \"cargo\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge (Present to students):**\n\n*\"The light rail in the photograph carries people and things from place to place. Your challenge is to design a toy train car that your motor can pull or push. The train car must be able to carry a load (blocks or toy figures). The more electrical energy you give the motor, the faster your train should go and the more 'cargo' it can move!\"*\n\n**Student Steps:**\n\n1. **Design:** Sketch a simple plan: Should the motor push or pull the car? Where should the wheels go? How will you attach the motor to the car?\n\n2. **Build:** Tape wheels to your container. Attach the motor to the front or back using tape and rubber bands. Attach string from the motor axle (or tape string to the dowel) to pull the car forward.\n\n3. **Test with No Load:** Connect the battery. Does the car move? How fast?\n\n4. **Add Cargo:** Place blocks or figures in the car. Test again. Does it move as fast?\n\n5. **Adjust Energy:** If possible, try a different battery or connection to add more energy. Does the car move faster now?\n\n6. **Reflect:**\n   - *\"How did adding cargo affect the car's speed?\"*\n   - *\"How is your train car like the light rail? How is it different?\"*\n   - *\"If a real light rail train is very heavy and needs to move fast, what might need to happen?\"* (It needs a lot of electrical energy.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate with guiding questions rather than solutions: *\"What happens when you add more weight? Do you think you need more or less energy?\"*\n- Encourage students to test and refine their designs.\n- Celebrate creative solutions and evidence-based predictions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students demonstrate understanding that **more energy → faster motion**, even when load increases.\n- Students make predictions based on evidence from their motor investigations.\n- Students connect their toy train to the real light rail and explain the energy transfer.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of energy conversion and the relationship between energy and motion.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n\n- **During Explore:** Observe whether students make predictions before testing and whether they adjust predictions based on evidence.\n- **During Explain:** Listen to student responses to check-for-understanding questions. Can they name the energy types? Can they point to the power source?\n- **During Elaborate:** Assess whether designs show understanding that energy powers motion and that more cargo requires more energy.\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5–10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket with one of these options:\n\n**Option A (Visual):** \n- Draw the light rail with arrows showing:\n  - Where the electrical energy comes from (overhead wires)\n  - What type of energy is created (motion)\n  \n**Option B (Written – for stronger writers):**\n- *\"Explain how the motor in our experiment is like the light rail train. Where does it get energy? What does it do with that energy?\"*\n\n**Option C (Verbal – for younger/lower readers):**\n- Teacher conducts a 1-minute conversation: *\"Tell me one thing you learned about how electricity makes things move. Use the light rail or your motor as an example.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they can:\n\n✓ Identify a power source (battery or overhead wires)  \n✓ Name two types of energy (electrical and kinetic/motion)  \n✓ Explain that electrical energy causes motion  \n✓ Predict that more energy results in faster motion (using evidence from their motor)  \n✓ Connect their toy motor to the real light rail  \n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nExit tickets reveal whether students:\n- Understand electrical energy as a power source\n- Can name kinetic energy as the result\n- Can make a real-world connection to the light rail photograph\n- Can use evidence from their exploration to support predictions\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-assembled Motor & Simplified Data Sheet:**\n   - Provide a fully assembled motor so students focus on observation rather than assembly.\n   - Use a simple 2-column chart: *\"Battery Type | Fast or Slow?\"* instead of a detailed data table.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Word Bank:**\n   - Provide a laminated card with pictures and simple labels (electrical energy, kinetic energy, power source) that students can refer to during discussions.\n\n3. **Guided Questions in Explore:**\n   - Use sentence frames: *\"When I connected the battery, the motor started to _____.\"* or *\"The motor spins _____ (faster/slower) with more energy.\"*\n\n4. **Partner with Stronger Peer:**\n   - Pair struggling students with peers who can model prediction-making and help with recording observations.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Energy Efficiency Investigation:**\n   - Ask: *\"Which battery makes the motor spin fastest? Which battery lasts the longest? Is the most energy the same as the longest time?\"* Have students design a test comparing AA, AAA, and 9V batteries for both speed and battery life.\n\n2. **Catenary Line Engineering Challenge:**\n   - Provide string, cups, and a small motor-powered car. Challenge students to design their own \"catenary system\" where a string (like overhead wires) delivers motion to a cart moving along a track. How could they transfer energy without direct contact?\n\n3. **Real-World Research Project:**\n   - Have students research and present: *\"How do electric buses, hybrid cars, or electric scooters use electrical energy to move? How is it the same as or different from the light rail?\"* Students can find images and create a comparison poster.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Design a Roller Coaster Powered by Electricity:**\n   - Using craft supplies, tape, and their motor devices, students design a roller coaster where the motor pulls a car uphill. How high can they make the car climb before gravity pulls it down? Discuss the energy conversion: electrical → kinetic (motion up) → potential (height) → kinetic (rolling down).\n\n2. **Light Rail Route Planning (Math + Science Connection):**\n   - Provide a map of a pretend city with different neighborhoods. Students calculate: *\"If a light rail train using 100 units of energy travels 10 miles in 20 minutes, how many units of energy does it need to travel 30 miles?\"* Connects energy to distance and speed in a real context.\n\n3. **Interactive Poster: \"Energy All Around Us\":**\n   - Students create a classroom bulletin board showing 5–6 appliances or vehicles (fan, toaster, electric car, light rail, phone charger, TV) and draw arrows showing: electrical energy → [what it becomes] (light, heat, motion, sound). Reinforce that energy conversion is everywhere.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\nThis lesson builds student understanding that **energy is not just an abstract concept — it's visible, measurable, and powers the world around them.** By starting with a hands-on motor activity that mirrors the light rail system, students internalize the relationship between electrical energy and motion before learning formal vocabulary. The photograph serves as a powerful anchor throughout, helping students see how classroom science connects to real infrastructure in their community.\n\nThe two-session structure allows time for deepening understanding: Session 1 (Engage, Explore) introduces the phenomenon through investigation; Session 2 (Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) formalizes vocabulary and applies learning. Adjust timing based on your students' pace and prior experience with circuits.",
