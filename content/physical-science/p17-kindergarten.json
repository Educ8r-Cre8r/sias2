The glass acts like a big mirror showing the other building's shape and windows.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe **Anchoring Phenomenon** demonstrated here is **reflection of light**. When light hits the smooth glass surface of the building, it bounces back like a ball bouncing off a wall. The glass windows act as mirrors because they are smooth and shiny. This creates a clear image of the nearby building appearing in the glass surface. The reflection happens because light travels in straight lines and follows predictable patterns when it hits different surfaces.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Light Reflection**: Light bounces off smooth, shiny surfaces like glass and mirrors\n2. **Properties of Materials**: Different materials (glass, metal, concrete) interact with light in different ways\n3. **Observable Patterns**: Reflections create predictable images that can be seen and described\n4. **Light Sources and Vision**: We can see reflections because light bounces from objects to our eyes\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use a flashlight and small mirror during circle time to demonstrate how light bounces. Have students predict where the reflected light will appear on the wall, then test their predictions together.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to explore reflection: tactile experiences with different textured materials, visual demonstrations with flashlights, and kinesthetic activities where students act out light \"bouncing\" off surfaces.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** At the microscopic level, light is made of tiny packets of energy called photons. When these photons hit the smooth glass surface, they bounce off at the same angle they arrived, creating the reflection we see.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This building reflection is part of urban heat island effects in cities. Glass buildings reflect sunlight and heat throughout the city, affecting local weather patterns and energy use across entire metropolitan areas.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"The other building is inside the glass\"\n   **Clarification:** The building image is a reflection bouncing off the outside of the glass, not actually inside it\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"Only mirrors can show reflections\"\n   **Clarification:** Any smooth, shiny surface can create reflections, including water, glass, and polished metal\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"Reflections are always exactly the same size as the real object\"\n   **Clarification:** Reflections can appear different sizes depending on distance and the shape of the reflecting surface\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** K-PS2-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to compare the effects of different strengths or different directions of pushes and pulls on the motion of an object\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:K-PS2.A]]\n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you notice about the building in the glass? (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n2. Why do you think we can see one building reflected in another building's windows? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n3. What other things have you seen your reflection in besides mirrors? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n4. How might the reflection change if it was nighttime instead of daytime? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Reflection:** When light bounces off a surface like a ball bouncing off a wall\n* **Surface:** The outside part of something you can touch\n* **Mirror:** A smooth, shiny surface that shows reflections clearly\n* **Light:** Energy that helps us see things around us\n* **Glass:** A smooth, clear material used to make windows\n* **Shiny:** A surface that reflects light well and looks bright\n\n## 🔗 Cross-Curricular Ideas\n\n1. **Math - Counting and Patterns:** Count the windows in the reflection and compare to the actual building. Create patterns using square and rectangle shapes to represent windows. Use this to explore symmetry and repeating patterns.\n\n2. **ELA - Descriptive Language:** Read \"Moonbear's Shadow\" and have students describe what they see in the reflection using descriptive words (shiny, bright, clear, dark). Create a class word wall with reflection-related vocabulary and encourage students to use these words in their own sentences and drawings.\n\n3. **Art - Mirror Painting and Collage:** Create \"reflection art\" by folding paper in half and painting on one side, then folding to make a symmetrical design. Use mirrors and shiny materials (aluminum foil, metallic paper) to create classroom reflections and discuss how different materials reflect light differently.\n\n4. **Social Studies - Community Helpers:** Discuss the people who work in tall buildings and keep them clean, including window cleaners. Talk about how keeping glass windows clean helps reflections show up better, connecting to jobs in our community that help maintain our buildings.\n\n## 🚀 STEM Career Connection\n\n1. **Architect:** An architect is a person who designs buildings. They think about how windows and glass will look and how light will bounce off the building. They draw plans so builders know how to construct tall buildings like the ones in the photo. **Average Salary: $82,320 USD**\n\n2. **Window Cleaner:** A window cleaner makes the glass on buildings shiny and clear so that reflections show up nicely. They use special tools and equipment to safely clean windows high up on tall buildings. Their work helps keep buildings looking bright and beautiful. **Average Salary: $35,240 USD**\n\n3. **Lighting Designer:** A lighting designer is a person who figures out how light will work in and around buildings. They think about reflections, shadows, and how light bounces off glass and other materials to make buildings look good at different times of day. **Average Salary: $51,840 USD**\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- Moonbear's Shadow by Frank Asch\n- Shadows and Reflections by Tana Hoban\n- Light by David Dreier",
