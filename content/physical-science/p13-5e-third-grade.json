ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about forces and motion using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy of the photograph (or display via projector/smart board)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph.** Show students the image of the blue balloon with confetti pieces suspended and falling around it. Ask them to observe silently for 10 seconds.\n\n2. **Pose Discovery Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see happening in this picture? Describe what the confetti pieces are doing.\"\n   - \"What do you think made the confetti move like that? What could have pushed it?\"\n   - \"If we let the balloon go in your classroom, where do you think the confetti would land? Why?\"\n   - \"Do you think all the confetti pieces moved in the same way, or did some move differently? Why might that be?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder if we can make confetti move the same way using a balloon in our classroom. What would we need to do?\"\n\n4. **Record Student Ideas:** Write student predictions and observations on chart paper. Acknowledge curiosity without correcting misconceptions yet.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become scientists and test your ideas by investigating how balloons can move objects!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how air pressure from a balloon creates a force that moves objects.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- 1 round balloon (pre-inflated and tied)\n- Small pieces of confetti, tissue paper, or lightweight paper pieces (about 20 pieces per group, stored in a container)\n- 1 black or dark surface (construction paper, poster board, or dark table surface)\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring distances)\n- Paper towel or cloth (for cleanup)\n- Small notebook or paper for recording observations\n\n**Activity – Hands-On Investigation:**\n\n1. **Setup:** Give each pair/group a balloon and have them place the dark surface in front of them. Scatter confetti pieces loosely on the surface.\n\n2. **Student Directions (Read aloud and demonstrate once):**\n   - \"Place your inflated balloon about 6 inches above the confetti pieces.\"\n   - \"Gently push the balloon down toward the confetti. Observe what happens. Record in your notebook: Did the confetti move? Which direction? How far?\"\n   - \"Now try pushing the balloon down faster or with more force. What happens to the confetti? Is it different from before? Record your observation.\"\n   - \"Try releasing the balloon quickly from a higher point above the confetti. What happens? Record what you see.\"\n   - \"Try moving the balloon sideways above the confetti (without touching it). Does the confetti move? Record what you observe.\"\n\n3. **Recording Strategy:** Students draw pictures or write simple sentences describing each trial:\n   - Trial 1 (gentle push): \"The confetti moved a little bit.\"\n   - Trial 2 (faster push): \"The confetti went farther.\"\n   - Trial 3 (released from high): \"The confetti scattered everywhere.\"\n   - Trial 4 (sideways motion): \"The confetti moved side to side.\"\n\n4. **Connection to Photograph:** Ask: \"How was what happened in your experiment similar to what we see in the photograph?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What made the confetti move? What happened when you used more force? What do you think would happen if you went even faster?\"\n- Resist explaining; instead, ask students to observe patterns and compare trials.\n- Ensure students are recording observations, not just playing.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that greater force (faster balloon movement) causes larger or more scattered confetti movement.\n- Students recognize that the direction of balloon movement affects the direction confetti moves.\n- Students document their observations in drawings or sentences, creating a record of their trials.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the science behind their observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words written in advance\n- The photograph (displayed again)\n- Student notebooks from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Call on 3–4 groups to share one observation: \"What happened when you pushed the balloon?\"\n   - Record responses on chart paper, grouping similar observations.\n   - Ask the class: \"Why do you think the confetti moved the same way in different groups?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Present each term using the students' own observations as anchors.\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n\n   - **Force:** A push or a pull that makes something move or change direction. (Point to the balloon: \"The balloon is a push force.\")\n   - **Motion:** Movement—when something changes position or location. (Ask: \"When the confetti moved, what were we watching? Motion!\")\n   - **Unbalanced Force:** A push or pull that is stronger in one direction, making something move. (Demonstrate: \"The balloon pushes down hard. That's unbalanced—the confetti has to move!\")\n   - **Speed:** How fast or slow something moves. (Ask: \"When you pushed the balloon faster, did the confetti move slower or faster?\")\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph and Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again. Point to the confetti pieces suspended in air and falling.\n   - \"In this picture, what force do you think was applied? What caused all that confetti to move?\" (Answer: A balloon released its air in an upward force.)\n   - Compare: \"In your experiment, you pushed the balloon down and the confetti moved. In the photograph, the balloon pushed air upward, and the confetti moved up and down. Both are forces causing motion!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students to stand if they hear a sentence with a force: \"The wind pushed the leaves. The blocks fell down. The ball is red.\"\n   - Correct and clarify as needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify force and motion in their own investigations and in the photograph.\n- Students use the word \"force\" to describe what the balloon did.\n- Students understand that stronger forces cause bigger changes in motion.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of forces to design and predict motion in a new context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-inflated balloons (different sizes if possible: small, medium, large)\n- Confetti or lightweight objects (tissue, feathers, small paper balls, foam pieces)\n- Meter stick or measuring tape\n- Chart paper labeled \"Prediction & Results\"\n- Markers\n\n**Activity – Design & Predict Challenge:**\n\n1. **Pose a Design Problem (2 minutes):**\n   \"We learned that balloons can push confetti. Now, let's use that knowledge to answer a new question: **Can we predict how far confetti will travel if we use balloons of different sizes?**\"\n\n2. **Make Predictions (5 minutes):**\n   - Show students two balloons (one smaller, one larger).\n   - Ask: \"If we use the small balloon, will the confetti go far or not far? If we use the large balloon, will it go farther? Why?\"\n   - Have students vote with thumbs up/down and write predictions on chart paper.\n   - Example prediction: \"The big balloon will push the confetti farther because it has more air.\"\n\n3. **Test Predictions (8 minutes):**\n   - Demonstrate with small and large balloons, releasing them from the same height above confetti on a measured surface.\n   - Students observe and measure (using marked lines) how far confetti travels.\n   - Record results on the chart paper.\n\n4. **Reflect on Accuracy (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Were your predictions correct? What did we discover? Why do you think the bigger balloon moved the confetti farther?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the investigation; keep trials consistent (same height, same confetti type, same surface).\n- Ask: \"Does this match what you predicted? Why or why not?\"\n- Encourage students to explain their reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students make and test predictions based on patterns they observed.\n- Students recognize that the size of the force (larger balloon) affects the distance of motion.\n- Students apply their understanding to a new scenario.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces and motion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe student predictions and reasoning during the Explore phase (Do they notice patterns?).\n- Listen to student explanations during group share-out (Can they connect their observations to force and motion?).\n- Check student notebooks for accurate drawings and descriptions.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5–7 minutes):**\n\nAdminister one of the following:\n\n**Option A – Visual & Written (Recommended for Grade 3):**\n\nProvide a simple drawing showing a balloon above scattered objects. Ask students to:\n1. **Draw an arrow** showing the direction the balloon will push the objects.\n2. **Write or dictate one sentence:** \"The balloon is a _____ that makes the objects _____.\"\n3. **Draw where you think the objects will land** after the balloon pushes them.\n\n**Option B – Oral Assessment:**\n\nAsk each student:\n- \"What is a force? Can you give me an example from our experiment?\"\n- \"If I use a bigger balloon next time, what do you predict will happen to the confetti?\"\n- \"Why did the confetti move when the balloon pushed it?\"\n\n**Option C – Quick Check (Whole Class):**\n\nShow the original photograph again and ask:\n- \"Point to where you think the force came from.\" (Students point upward/to the balloon.)\n- \"Why is the confetti moving?\" (Listen for: \"Because the balloon pushed it,\" \"It's a force,\" \"The air moved it.\")\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- Correctly identify a force (push or pull) in their investigation and the photograph.\n- Describe how a force changes motion (moves objects, speeds up, changes direction).\n- Make at least one accurate prediction about how force affects motion.\n- Use vocabulary: force, motion, push, or direction in their explanations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will successfully identify forces and describe motion patterns.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding through drawings, written responses, or verbal explanations.\n- Exit ticket responses will show that students connect their hands-on experience to the formal vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Scaffolding for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Guided Observation Sheet:** Provide a pre-made worksheet with sentence frames:\n   - \"When I pushed the balloon ___, the confetti ___.\"\n   - \"The force made the confetti move ___.\" (Supply answer choices: up, down, sideways.)\n   - This reduces the cognitive load of generating observations from scratch.\n\n2. **Partner with a Peer:** Pair students with a stronger partner during Explore. The peer can help operate the balloon while the student focuses on observing and recording. Rotate roles.\n\n3. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use shorter definitions and anchor them to movements students can see:\n   - \"A **force** is a push.\" (Demonstrate by pushing a pencil across the desk.)\n   - Don't introduce \"unbalanced force\"—keep it to \"push and pull.\"\n\n### Challenge (Extensions for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Quantitative Investigation:** Ask advanced students to measure and graph how distance traveled changes with balloon size. Provide meter sticks and graphing paper. Question: \"Can you make a bar graph showing which balloon size moved the confetti the farthest?\"\n\n2. **Multiple Trials & Variables:** Challenge students to test if the **type of object** matters. \"Does tissue paper move the same distance as a foam ball? Why do you think different materials move differently?\" This introduces the concept of mass and material properties.\n\n3. **Design a Prediction Tool:** Ask: \"Can you make a chart or drawing that helps another student predict how far confetti will move if we tell them the balloon size?\" This requires synthesis of observations and communication.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Balloon Rocket** (Take-Home or Classroom Physics):\n   - Students inflate a balloon and let it go without tying it to observe the force of escaping air.\n   - They measure how far the \"rocket\" travels and record predictions for next time.\n   - Connects to real-world application: How rockets use force to move.\n\n2. **Building a Balloon-Powered Car** (STEM Integration):\n   - Provide cups, straws, balloons, and tape. Challenge students to build a simple car powered by a balloon.\n   - Test which design travels farthest, connecting to engineering and force again.\n   - Requires planning, testing, and iterating—builds deeper understanding of forces.\n\n3. **Create a Forces Photo Essay** (Literacy Integration):\n   - Students take or draw pictures of forces in their daily lives (playground, home, sports).\n   - They label each with a push or pull and describe the motion that results.\n   - Creates a classroom bulletin board: \"Forces All Around Us!\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure balloons are pre-inflated by you or a trusted adult. Teach students not to overinflate or pop balloons intentionally. Have a plan for managing confetti cleanup (sealed bags, vacuum available).\n- **Timing:** The lesson is designed for two sessions, but can be compressed into one 90-minute block by shortening Elaborate.\n- **Vocabulary Spiral:** Revisit \"force\" and \"motion\" in future lessons on different topics (gravity, friction, magnetism) to deepen understanding.\n- **Photography Tie-In:** The photograph is powerful because it shows a real-world, visually striking example. Returning to it multiple times anchors abstract concepts in concrete observation.",
