ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about how machines are built and taken apart.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of motorized LEGO machines (displayed on whiteboard, smartboard, or printed)\n- One pre-built motorized machine (if available) that students can observe but not touch yet\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board and give students 30 seconds of silent observation time. Ask them to just look and notice what they see.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause for responses after each):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What's moving or what could move?\" (Students identify motors, wheels, gears, figures)\n   - \"What materials do you think were used to build these machines? What do they look like?\" (Students name plastic, rubber, metal—describe colors, shapes, textures)\n   - \"If I took this machine apart, could I build something different with the same pieces? Why or why not?\" (Students predict whether pieces are reusable)\n   - \"Which parts do you think help the machine move? Why would those parts be made from rubber or plastic instead of something else?\" (Students begin thinking about material properties and function)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"Today, you're going to be machine builders AND breakers. You'll build a motorized machine, take it apart, and rebuild it into something completely new. I wonder what amazing creations you'll make!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Before you become builders, let's explore what different building materials can do and why they're special.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate properties of different materials through hands-on exploration and discover why certain materials are used in machines.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Building brick sets (LEGO or similar modular building system) with motors, wheels, gears, and connectors\n- Containers or trays with sorted materials:\n  - Plastic bricks (various colors)\n  - Rubber wheels and connectors\n  - Metal gears and axles\n  - Small sample objects to test (soft fabric scraps, hard plastic pieces, flexible rubber bands, rigid wooden sticks)\n- Paper and pencils for recording observations\n- \"Material Investigation Sheet\" (simple template with pictures of materials and space to draw/write)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide students into pairs or small groups** (3-4 students). Give each group a tray with a variety of building materials.\n\n2. **Direct students to explore** using these steps (write on board with pictures):\n   - Pick up each material and look at it closely. What color is it? What shape?\n   - Touch each material. Is it hard or soft? Smooth or bumpy? Bendy or stiff?\n   - Try to bend it, twist it, or flex it. What happens?\n   - If you have a wheel or gear, roll it or turn it. Does it move easily?\n   - **Record observations** by drawing the material and writing or telling a partner what it's like (hard, squishy, smooth, bumpy, bendy, etc.)\n\n3. **Facilitate investigation** by asking guiding questions:\n   - \"What material feels the hardest? The softest?\"\n   - \"Which materials bend easily? Which ones stay stiff?\"\n   - \"If you needed a wheel that rolls smoothly, which material would you pick? Why?\"\n   - \"If you needed a strong frame to hold the machine together, would you use something flexible or stiff?\"\n\n4. **Connect to the photograph:** Show the photograph again and ask: \"Now that you've felt these materials, point to the plastic parts, the rubber parts, and the metal parts in this machine. Why do you think they used plastic for the body, rubber for the wheels, and metal for the gears?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate among groups with curiosity rather than answers.\n- Ask students to explain their thinking: \"Tell me why you think that material is bumpy.\"\n- Encourage descriptive language and repeat student observations back to them.\n- Help groups refocus if they drift into off-task play.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students generate a list of observable properties (hard, soft, bumpy, smooth, flexible, stiff, rolls easily, colorful, etc.)\n- Students begin making connections between material properties and how they function in machines (wheels roll, gears have teeth, plastic is lightweight, rubber is flexible)\n- Materials Investigation Sheet filled with drawings and descriptive words\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary about material properties and explain how different materials serve different purposes in a machine.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Pre-printed vocabulary cards with pictures (for classroom display)\n- Photograph of motorized machines (for reference)\n- One simple motorized machine model (for teacher demonstration)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share what they discovered about one material.\n   - Record their observations on a chart titled \"Material Properties We Discovered.\"\n   - Affirm observations and add teacher language: \"So plastic is hard and smooth. That's why it makes a great frame!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Display and discuss these terms with student-friendly definitions and examples from the exploration:\n\n   - **Hard:** Materials that don't bend or break easily. (Point to plastic brick: \"This plastic brick is hard. It stays the same shape and keeps the machine together.\")\n   - **Flexible (or Bendy):** Materials that can bend or stretch without breaking. (Point to rubber wheel or connector: \"This rubber is flexible. It can bend a little, and that helps it absorb bumps when the wheel rolls.\")\n   - **Smooth:** A surface that feels even and slippery. (Point to a wheel: \"The smooth wheel rolls easily without getting stuck.\")\n   - **Rough (or Bumpy):** A surface with bumps or texture. (Point to a gear: \"These bumpy teeth on the gear catch other gears so they can turn together.\")\n   - **Property:** A quality or characteristic of a material that you can see or feel.\n\n3. **Explain the Connection to Function (4 minutes):**\n   - Hold up or display the motorized machine photograph.\n   - Point to different parts: \"Engineers—people who design machines—choose materials based on what they need the part to do. The plastic frame is hard so it doesn't break. The rubber wheels are a little flexible so they grip the ground. The metal gears are hard and have bumpy teeth so they can lock together and turn the wheels.\"\n   - Ask: \"If the wheels were made of plastic instead of rubber, what might happen?\" (Students predict: it might slip, it might not grip, it wouldn't work as well)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"Show me something hard. Show me something smooth. Which material would you use for a wheel? Why?\"\n   - Listen for evidence that students understand the link between material properties and function.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Hard:** Does not bend or break easily; stays its shape.\n- **Flexible:** Can bend or stretch without breaking.\n- **Smooth:** Even surface that is slippery or easy to slide on.\n- **Rough/Bumpy:** Surface with texture or ridges.\n- **Property:** A quality of a material you can see or feel (color, texture, hardness, etc.).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name at least two material properties.\n- Students can explain why one material works better than another for a specific part of a machine (e.g., wheels are rubber because rubber is flexible and grips well).\n- Students understand that engineers choose materials based on what a part needs to do.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by constructing and then deconstructing a motorized machine, and making a new design from the same pieces.\n\n**Materials:**\n- LEGO or modular building sets with motors (1 set per pair or small group)\n- Instruction cards or simple diagrams showing how to build a basic motorized machine (car, spinner, or similar)\n- Digital camera or tablet (optional, for documenting designs)\n- \"Before and After\" design sheet (template for drawing original design and new design)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Build Phase (8 minutes):**\n   - Provide each group with a building set and a simple instruction card.\n   - Direct students: \"Using your materials, build the machine shown on the card. Work together to connect the pieces. Think about why each material was chosen for its part.\"\n   - As groups build, ask: \"Which part is hard? Which part is flexible? Why is this wheel made of rubber?\"\n   - Once complete, allow students to turn on the motor and observe the machine in action.\n\n2. **Deconstruct and Redesign Phase (7 minutes):**\n   - Once the original machine is working, announce: \"Now comes the fun part—you're going to be breakers! Take your machine completely apart and rebuild it into something new.\"\n   - Give students freedom to redesign. Suggest possibilities: \"You could make a spinning top, a rolling vehicle with a different shape, a machine that wobbles, or a creature that moves.\"\n   - Challenge them: \"Use the same pieces. Make something that still moves but looks totally different!\"\n   - Students test their new design. Does it move? Does the motor work? What changed?\n\n3. **Reflection:**\n   - Ask each group to show their new creation and explain: \"What did you build? How is it different from the first machine? Did you use the same materials? Why did you move pieces to different places?\"\n   - Have students draw or record their original design and new design on a \"Before and After\" sheet.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and encourage creativity while ensuring safety (no throwing pieces, shared materials handled gently).\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"Tell me about your new design. Which parts did you move? Why?\"\n- Help students recognize that disassembly and reassembly shows the same pieces can create different objects.\n- If a group finishes early, challenge them: \"Can you rebuild it one more time in a different way?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each group successfully disassembles their original machine.\n- Students create a new motorized design using the same pieces.\n- Students can articulate that the same materials (plastic, rubber, metal) were used in both designs.\n- Visual or written record showing the original and new designs.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of material properties, disassembly/reassembly, and the relationship between material choice and function.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during Elaborate phase):**\n- Observe students as they build, deconstruct, and redesign. Note which students:\n  - Understand that pieces can be reused in new ways\n  - Recognize the same materials are used in different configurations\n  - Explain connections between material properties and function (e.g., \"We used rubber for the wheel because it's bendy and grips\")\n  - Collaborate and problem-solve when a design doesn't work\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nAdminister orally or in writing (draw + label) at the end of the lesson:\n\n1. **Show students a picture of a wheel and a plastic brick.** Ask: \"Which one should you use for a wheel? Why?\" \n   - **Success Criteria:** Student identifies rubber/flexible material and explains it needs to roll or grip.\n\n2. **Hold up the motorized machine photograph again.** Ask: \"Look at this machine. Can you point to three different parts and tell me what material they're made of and why that material works for that part?\"\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student identifies at least 2 parts, names the material (plastic, rubber, metal), and gives a reason (hard, flexible, smooth, rough, etc.).\n\n3. **Ask: \"If I gave you these pieces from a machine you just broke apart, could you build something completely different? What's the same? What's different?\"**\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student explains that the same pieces can be rearranged to make new objects (addresses 2-PS1-3).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that materials have observable properties.\n- Students explain how material properties relate to function in a machine.\n- Students articulate that the same pieces can be disassembled and reassembled into new objects.\n- Students use descriptive language (hard, soft, flexible, smooth, bumpy) to explain material choices.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Material Vocabulary:** Pair students with a \"Material Properties Chart\" showing pictures of materials with just two properties each (hard/soft, smooth/bumpy). Encourage them to point to and say the property rather than generating independent descriptions.\n\n2. **Pre-Built Machine Deconstruction:** Instead of building from scratch, provide an already-built motorized machine for students to carefully disassemble step-by-step with adult guidance. Use numbered pieces so they can reassemble in the same configuration first, then redesign. This reduces cognitive load while maintaining the core learning (disassembly/reassembly).\n\n3. **Paired Building:** Pair each struggling reader/learner with a peer or adult. Assign clear roles: one student assembles while the partner retrieves materials and checks the instruction card. Switch roles mid-activity.\n\n4. **Simplified Instructions:** Use photo-based, wordless instruction cards rather than written directions. Point to photos together and say: \"Find the red brick. Find the wheel. Snap them together.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Material Replacement Challenge:** After building the original machine, ask: \"What if we couldn't use rubber for the wheel? What other material could work? Why? Build it and test it.\" Students experiment with alternative materials and evaluate how function changes.\n\n2. **Engineering Design Improvement:** After redesigning, ask: \"How could you make your machine move faster? Farther? In a different pattern?\" Students modify their design to improve performance and explain the changes they made and why (e.g., \"We made the wheels bigger so it rolls faster\").\n\n3. **Create a New Machine Type:** Ask advanced students to sketch a completely original motorized machine (not based on an instruction card), then build it. They must identify which materials they'll need and explain why each was chosen before building. This adds planning and justification to the engineering process.\n\n4. **Material Research:** Challenge students to investigate and report back: \"How many different materials can you find in our classroom? What properties do they have? Which ones could be used in a machine? Why?\" Extend thinking beyond the building set.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Fix It\" Challenge (5-10 minutes, within lesson or separate session):**\n   - Present a \"broken\" motorized machine (one with a wheel that doesn't roll smoothly or a disconnected gear).\n   - Ask students: \"What's wrong with this machine? What material problem do you see?\" (The wheel is cracked, a gear is missing teeth, etc.)\n   - Have students diagnose the problem and suggest which material property is missing or damaged: \"The wheel isn't smooth anymore, so it doesn't roll. We need a new wheel.\"\n   - This reinforces the connection between material properties and function.\n\n2. **Material Hunt in the Classroom (15-20 minutes, homework or follow-up lesson):**\n   - Give students a \"Material Hunt Sheet\" listing objects around the classroom or home: door handle, pencil, eraser, shoe sole, backpack zipper, window, etc.\n   - Students observe and record: What material is it made of? What property does it have? Why is that property good for that object? (e.g., \"The shoe sole is made of rubber. It's flexible. That helps it bend when we walk.\")\n   - Students bring findings back and create a classroom chart: \"Materials and Why We Use Them.\"\n   - This extends learning to everyday objects and deepens understanding of material properties in real-world contexts.\n\n3. **Simple Machine Art Display (ongoing, 2-3 days):**\n   - Have students photograph their \"Before and After\" machines (original design and redesigned machine) or draw colored sketches of both.\n   - Create a classroom gallery titled \"Engineers at Work: We Built It, We Broke It, We Built Again!\"\n   - Write captions for each design pair: \"First, we built a race car. Then we took it apart and made a spinning top. We used the same plastic bricks, rubber wheels, and metal gears in both machines.\"\n   - Display in the hallway or on a bulletin board for other classes to see and celebrate student learning.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
