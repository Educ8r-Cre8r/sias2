ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student interest and activate prior knowledge about pushes, pulls, and movement using the skateboard photograph.\n\n#### Materials\n- Large color printout or digital projection of the skateboard photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- A toy skateboard, roller skate, or wheeled toy (if available)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Step 1: Display the Photograph**\nProject or display the skateboard image where all students can see it clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n**Step 2: Ask Engaging Discussion Questions**\n\nAsk these questions one at a time, allowing 5–10 seconds of think time before students respond:\n\n1. **\"What do you see happening in this picture? Is the skateboard moving or staying still? How do you know?\"**\n   - *Look for responses about the skateboard being in the air, the person jumping, or the skateboard sliding.*\n\n2. **\"How do you think the person made the skateboard move? Did they push it or pull it? Show me with your body—can you push like that?\"**\n   - *Invite 2–3 students to mime pushing movements; accept all interpretations.*\n\n3. **\"Have you ever ridden on a skateboard, roller skates, or pushed something on wheels? What happened when you pushed it hard? What happened when you pushed it gently?\"**\n   - *Validate all experiences; guide toward \"fast\" and \"slow\" language.*\n\n4. **\"I wonder... if we had a skateboard right here in our classroom, what would happen if we gave it a big push? What if we gave it a tiny push?\"**\n   - *Record student predictions on chart paper: \"Big push = ?\" and \"Tiny push = ?\"*\n\n#### Transition\n\"Great questions, friends! Let's find out for ourselves how pushes and pulls make things move. We're going to be like skateboard scientists!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate the effects of different strengths and directions of pushes and pulls on objects.\n\n#### Materials\n- **For each small group (4 students):**\n  - 1 toy car, truck, or rolling toy (non-breakable)\n  - 1 small ball or rolling object\n  - Masking tape\n  - A smooth, level surface (table or floor section)\n  - Chart paper with two columns: \"PUSH\" and \"PULL\"\n  - Simple picture cards showing push and pull actions (optional visual support)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Setup:**\nDivide students into 4 small groups. Assign each group a station with one rolling toy and a clear workspace.\n\n**Step 1: Demonstrate the Setup (5 minutes)**\nShow all students a rolling toy on a flat surface. Say: *\"Watch what I'm going to do. I'm going to push this car very gently.\"* Demonstrate a soft push. *\"What happened?\"* (It moved slowly.) *\"Now I'm going to push it really hard.\"* Demonstrate a firm push. *\"What happened now?\"* (It moved fast!) Ask: *\"Was the push the same both times, or different?\"* Guide students to say \"different.\"\n\n**Step 2: Student Investigation (15 minutes)**\n\nGive each group these step-by-step directions (use pictures and hand motions as needed):\n\n1. **\"Put your toy at the tape line on your table. This is where your toy starts.\"**\n\n2. **\"Now everyone stand around the toy and watch. I'm going to push it with a TINY push first.\"** (Assign one student to gently push the toy.) *\"Where did it go? Did it go far or stay close? Draw a picture of what you saw on your chart.\"* (Provide simple drawings or let students mark the distance with fingers.)\n\n3. **\"Now let's try a BIG push!\"** (Same student or a new one pushes firmly.) *\"Where did it go now? Did it go farther or stay closer?\"* (Record response.)\n\n4. **\"Let's try pulling! Hold a string or pull the toy toward you.\"** (Attach a string beforehand if possible, or let students gently pull with their hand.) *\"What happens when we pull? Does it move? Which way does it go?\"* (Record.)\n\n5. **Repeat Steps 2–4 so every student gets a turn to push or pull.**\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate among groups and ask guiding questions: *\"What did you notice? Was it fast or slow? Did it move far or stay close?\"*\n- Do **not** tell students what will happen; let them discover it through trying.\n- Help students use their hands to show distance: *\"Can you show me how far it went with your arms?\"*\n- Encourage language: *\"Say: 'The big push made it go fast!' or 'The tiny push made it go slow!'\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students discover that **bigger pushes make objects move faster and farther**.\n- Students discover that **smaller pushes make objects move slower and closer**.\n- Students observe that **pulling makes objects move toward them**.\n- Students recognize that **changing the strength of a push or pull changes what the object does**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and connect discoveries to the skateboard photograph and real-world examples.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The skateboard photograph\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures (push, pull, fast, slow, force)\n- Real-world examples: toy car, ball, or a rolling toy\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Step 1: Group Share-Out (8 minutes)**\nGather students on the floor in a circle. Ask:\n- *\"What did you learn about pushes and pulls?\"*\n- *\"When you pushed your toy gently, what happened?\"*\n- *\"When you pushed it hard, what happened?\"*\n- *\"How is pulling different from pushing?\"*\n\nRecord key discoveries on chart paper with words and simple drawings.\n\n**Step 2: Introduce Vocabulary (7 minutes)**\n\nTeach these 5 vocabulary terms with Kindergarten-friendly definitions and hand motions:\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Hand Motion** |\n|----------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Push** | When you press something away from you to make it move. | Press hands forward away from body. |\n| **Pull** | When you grab something and bring it toward you to make it move. | Pull hands toward body. |\n| **Force** | The strength of a push or pull that makes things move. | Clench fist, then open—\"powerful!\"; then pinch fingers—\"tiny!\" |\n| **Fast** | Moving very quickly. | Move hand rapidly across the air. |\n| **Slow** | Moving gently and not very quickly. | Move hand slowly across the air. |\n\n**Step 3: Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes)**\nShow the skateboard image again. Say:\n*\"Look at this picture again. The person is doing a big push with their feet to make the skateboard move super fast and jump into the air! That's a **big force**—a strong push. The **big push** made the skateboard move **fast**. If the skateboarder pushed gently instead, what would happen?\"* (Guide to: it would go slow or not jump as high.)\n\n**Check for Understanding Strategy:**\nUse a physical response activity. Say:\n- *\"If I say 'PUSH,' everyone push your friend's hand gently.\"*\n- *\"If I say 'PULL,' everyone pull a friend's hand toward you.\"*\n- *\"If I say 'FAST PUSH,' everyone push as hard as you can!\"*\n- *\"If I say 'SLOW PULL,' everyone pull very gently!\"*\n\nObserve whether students are performing correct motions.\n\n#### Vocabulary Summary\n- **Push:** Press something away from you.\n- **Pull:** Bring something toward you.\n- **Force:** The strength that makes things move.\n- **Fast:** Moving very quickly.\n- **Slow:** Moving gently and not quickly.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\nStudents should:\n- Use the words \"push,\" \"pull,\" \"fast,\" \"slow,\" and \"force\" when describing motion.\n- Connect their exploration to the skateboard image.\n- Understand that **stronger pushes and pulls make bigger changes in how things move**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply their understanding of pushes and pulls to a new, engaging scenario: designing a \"ramp race.\"\n\n#### Materials\n- Books or blocks to build ramps (at least 3 per group)\n- Toy cars or rolling toys (same as Explore phase)\n- Masking tape\n- Chart paper with race-track drawings\n- Optional: colored tape to mark \"start\" and \"finish\" lines\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Setup:**\nRebuild small groups (same as Explore, or mix them for fresh partnerships).\n\n**Step 1: Introduce the Challenge (3 minutes)**\nSay: *\"The skateboarder in our picture jumped really high! Now we're going to be ramp designers. Your job is to make a ramp using books, and then push a car down it. Your goal: Can you make your car go **fast** down the ramp? What kind of push will help?\"*\n\n**Step 2: Build and Test (12 minutes)**\n\nGive groups these directions:\n\n1. **\"Stack 3 books to make a ramp. Tape down the books so they don't slide.\"**\n\n2. **\"Put your toy car at the top of the ramp. Now give it a gentle push down. What happened? Did it go fast or slow?\"** (Record: gentle push = ?)\n\n3. **\"Try again with a bigger push. What's different now?\"** (Record: big push = ?)\n\n4. **\"Can you use a PULL to help the car? Maybe pull a string attached to the car down the ramp. What happens?\"** (If a string is available; otherwise, skip.)\n\n5. **\"Which push or pull made the car go the fastest? Can you show your friends?\"**\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Ask: *\"Why do you think that push worked better?\"*\n- Encourage experimentation: *\"What if you made the ramp taller? What happens?\"*\n- Validate all attempts: *\"That's an interesting observation!\"*\n- Guide without giving answers: *\"Hmm, what do you think will happen if...?\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students apply the concept that **stronger forces cause greater motion**.\n- Students see that **different designs (ramp height, push strength) affect results**.\n- Students predict and test: *\"If I push harder, it will go faster.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of pushes, pulls, and how they affect motion.\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** During Explore and Elaborate, note which students:\n  - Use push/pull vocabulary correctly.\n  - Predict motion before pushing/pulling.\n  - Compare soft and hard pushes.\n  - Recognize that force affects motion.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes at the end of Day 2):**\n\nUse one of these options based on your students' readiness:\n\n**Option A: Drawing + Dictation (Best for Kindergarten)**\n- Provide a simple worksheet with two boxes labeled **\"Gentle Push\"** and **\"Hard Push.\"**\n- Say: *\"Draw what happens in each box. Then tell me what you drew.\"*\n- Record their explanation: *\"A gentle push makes the car go ___. A hard push makes the car go ___.\"*\n\n**Option B: Physical Demonstration**\n- Show a toy car. Say: *\"Show me a gentle push. Now show me a hard push. What's different about them?\"*\n- Ask: *\"What word describes the gentle push?\" (slow)* *\"What word describes the hard push?\"* (fast)\n\n**Option C: Picture Sorting**\n- Provide pictures of a toy rolling **slow** (near the start) and **fast** (far away).\n- Say: *\"Which one happened because of a gentle push? Which one happened because of a hard push?\"*\n- Have students point to or move the pictures.\n\n#### Success Criteria\n\nStudents have met the learning objectives if they:\n\n✓ **Correctly identify** that pushes and pulls cause motion (can point to or name push/pull in a picture).\n\n✓ **Explain** that a **bigger/harder push makes things go fast**, and a **gentle/soft push makes things go slow** (even if explanation is simple: *\"Big push = fast!\"*).\n\n✓ **Predict** what will happen when given a push or pull scenario: *\"If I push hard, it will go far!\"*\n\n✓ **Use vocabulary** like push, pull, fast, slow, or force in at least 2–3 sentences during the lesson.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this lesson:\n- **80% of students** can demonstrate the difference between a gentle and hard push on a rolling object.\n- **70% of students** use the words \"fast\" and \"slow\" to describe motion.\n- **Most students** understand that push and pull are ways to move things.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Tactile and Kinesthetic Focus:**\n   - Let these students do extra push/pull practice with their hands on the toy before group investigation. Use a toy they can grip easily.\n   - Pair them with a buddy who can model vocabulary and encourage participation.\n\n2. **Simplified Vocabulary:**\n   - Focus on just two terms: \"push\" and \"pull\" (or even \"go fast\" and \"go slow\").\n   - Use hand motions and physical demonstrations instead of words when needed.\n   - Repeat vocabulary multiple times with the same toy, building automaticity.\n\n3. **Shorter Investigation:**\n   - Have these students participate in only the \"gentle push\" and \"big push\" comparison (skip the pull component).\n   - Provide pre-made data sheets with pictures they can point to instead of drawing.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-Step Predictions:**\n   - Ask: *\"If I push this car hard down a tall ramp, what do you think will happen? Will it go fast, slow, or super fast? Why?\"*\n   - Challenge them to predict *and explain* their thinking.\n\n2. **Introduce Direction:**\n   - Expand beyond fast/slow to include **direction**: *\"How could we make the car go to the left instead of straight? What if we push it that way?\"*\n   - Have them design a ramp that makes the car go in different directions.\n\n3. **Variables and Comparisons:**\n   - Ask: *\"What makes a bigger difference: pushing on a flat floor or pushing down a ramp? How do you know?\"*\n   - Let them test multiple variables and record which makes the biggest change.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Push-Pull Walk Around the School** (15–20 minutes)\n   - Take students on a classroom or hallway walk.\n   - Ask them to identify things they could **push** (doors, chairs) and things they could **pull** (handles, drawers, strings).\n   - Create a class list: *\"Pushes in Our Room\"* and *\"Pulls in Our Room.\"*\n   - Return and draw pictures of 2–3 items.\n\n2. **Skateboard and Roller Skate Research** (homework or library time)\n   - Send home a simple sheet: *\"What sports or activities use pushes and pulls? Draw or write about something you push or pull.\"*\n   - Suggestions: skateboarding, roller skating, pushing a swing, pulling a wagon, kicking a ball.\n   - Bring responses back and create a class book or poster.\n\n3. **Design a Push-Pull Obstacle Course** (30 minutes, follow-up lesson)\n   - Set up stations around the classroom:\n     - **Push Station:** Students push bean bags across a mat.\n     - **Pull Station:** Students pull scarves or ribbons across the floor.\n     - **Ramp Station:** Students push cars down ramps of different heights.\n   - Students rotate through and record what happens at each station with drawings or stickers.\n   - Discuss: *\"Which station used the biggest pushes? The smallest pushes?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Reflection for Teachers\n\nThis lesson uses the skateboard image as a relatable, exciting entry point into forces and motion. The progression from observation → hands-on exploration → vocabulary → application ensures that Kindergarteners build understanding through doing, not just listening.\n\n**Key Teaching Notes:**\n- Allow plenty of time for exploration and talk; Kindergarteners learn through trial and error.\n- Use the skateboard photo repeatedly—it's a strong visual anchor for an abstract concept.\n- Celebrate all attempts and predictions, even incorrect ones; they're evidence of thinking.\n- Keep language simple and repeat key terms in multiple ways (e.g., \"big push,\" \"strong push,\" \"push hard\").",
