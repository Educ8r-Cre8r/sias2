Each material is chosen for specific uses based on how it behaves.\n- **Purpose of Material Selection:** Different materials are used in this utility pole setup because they have properties suited to specific jobs (metal conducts electricity, rubber insulates, wood supports weight, ceramics resist heat and electricity).\n- **Observable Properties:** Students can identify properties like hardness, flexibility, color, texture, and what materials do or do not do (conduct vs. insulate, bend vs. stay rigid).\n- **Real-World Applications of Materials:** This everyday infrastructure demonstrates how scientists and engineers choose materials based on testing and understanding what properties are needed for a task to work safely and reliably.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Picking the Perfect Materials: What Makes a Utility Pole Work?**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** 2nd Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or one 90-minute block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** 2-PS1-1, 2-PS1-2\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Observe and describe the observable properties of different materials (color, texture, hardness, flexibility).\n2. Identify which materials are used in a utility pole and explain why each material is chosen based on its properties.\n3. Test different materials to determine which properties make them useful for specific jobs.\n4. Classify materials based on how they behave and what job they can do.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the materials in the photograph and what makes them useful.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of utility pole (displayed on smartboard, projector, or printed large)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: photos of other utility poles, telephone poles, or power line structures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph prominently. Give students 30 seconds of silent observation time, then ask:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture?\" (Accept all answers—electrical lines, a tall pole, metal parts, wires, etc.)\n   - \"What different *things* or *materials* can you spot? Point to them and tell me what they're made of.\" (Guide them to notice: wood pole, metal wires, metal/ceramic insulators, bolts, cables.)\n   - \"Why do you think this pole has so many different materials on it instead of being made of just ONE material?\" (This is the key question—let them think hard!)\n   - \"If we made the whole pole out of rubber, what would happen? If we made all the wires out of wood, what would happen?\" (Create brief, fun scenarios to spark thinking.)\n\n2. Record student ideas on chart paper: \"Why does the pole have different materials?\" Keep this visible throughout the lesson.\n\n3. Show wonder: \"I'm wondering if different materials have different *powers*—like maybe some are strong, some are bendy, some are slippery. How could we find out?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become material scientists! We'll test different materials to discover their special properties, and then we'll figure out why they're used on this utility pole.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students hands-on investigate observable properties of materials and sort them by behavior.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 5-6 different materials in identical sizes/quantities (approximately 3-4 inches):\n  - Metal paperclip or piece of aluminum foil\n  - Rubber band\n  - Wooden stick or pencil\n  - Plastic straw or plastic spoon\n  - Ceramic tile or unglazed ceramic piece (or clay tile)\n  - Wire (insulated wire from hardware store is safest, or use a twist-tie)\n- Ziplock bags labeled with material names (one bag per student pair)\n- Testing station cards with pictures and instructions (see below)\n- Chart: \"What Can This Material Do?\" (columns: Bend? Break? Conduct Heat? Flexible? Hard?)\n- Safety goggles (optional but recommended)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n*Teacher Preparation:* Set up 5-6 testing stations around the room, each with one material and a card showing what to test.\n\n*Student Directions:*\n\n1. \"You will work with a partner. Each pair gets a bag with a material inside.\"\n2. \"At your station, you will test your material by doing these things:\" (Demonstrate each slowly):\n   - **Look & Feel:** What does it look like? Is it shiny or dull? Is it rough or smooth? Hard or soft?\n   - **Bend Test:** Try gently bending or twisting it. Does it bend easily? Does it stay bent? Does it break?\n   - **Hold Test:** Hold it in your hand. Does it feel cold or warm? (This introduces the idea that some materials conduct heat differently.)\n   - **Flexibility Test:** Can you flex/wiggle it? Is it stiff or floppy?\n3. \"Draw or write what you discover on your recording sheet. Use words like: shiny, dull, hard, soft, bendy, stiff, rough, smooth, thick, thin, heavy, light.\"\n4. \"After 4 minutes, move to the next station. You'll test a new material.\"\n5. \"Rotate through all 5-6 stations.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What happens when you bend that? Is it flexible or stiff? How is it different from the last material you tested?\"\n- Do NOT tell students what properties materials have; let them discover through testing.\n- Encourage careful observation and description.\n- Ensure safety (no breaking materials forcefully; no materials going in mouths).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students complete a recording sheet for each material with drawings and words describing properties.\n- Students notice patterns: some materials bend, some don't; some feel smooth, some rough; some are hard, some soft.\n- Students begin to see that materials are *different* on purpose.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect discoveries to the utility pole photograph and real-world purpose.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student recording sheets from Explore phase\n- Large chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n- Utility pole photograph (displayed again)\n- Visual reference cards with material pictures and properties labeled\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Call the class together. Ask: \"What did you discover? Tell me about ONE material you tested and what it was like.\"\n   - Invite 4-5 students to share (one sentence each).\n   - Record their words on chart paper: \"Properties We Discovered.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Present each term with a picture or example:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Property:** A characteristic or quality of something—how it looks, feels, or acts. Example: \"Rubber is stretchy. That's a property of rubber.\"\n   - **Flexible:** Able to bend without breaking. Example: \"Rubber bands are flexible. You can stretch them.\"\n   - **Rigid (or Stiff):** Does not bend easily; stays in one shape. Example: \"A wooden stick is rigid. It doesn't bend much.\"\n   - **Conductor:** A material that lets heat or electricity move through it easily. Example: \"Metal is a conductor. It feels cold because it lets heat leave your hand.\"\n   - **Insulator:** A material that stops or slows heat or electricity from moving through it. Example: \"Rubber is an insulator. It keeps electricity from moving and keeps you safe.\"\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Pole (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Display the utility pole photograph again.\n   - Point to the metal wires: \"Why do you think the wires are made of *metal*? Remember, metal is flexible AND it's a conductor. Electricity travels through metal really well. That's why we use it for wires!\"\n   - Point to the rubber coating on some wires and the ceramic insulators: \"Why do you think there's rubber and ceramic here? These are insulators. They STOP electricity from going places we don't want it to go. They keep the electricity safe inside the wires.\"\n   - Point to the wooden pole: \"The pole is made of wood. Wood is rigid—it stays stiff and strong. It holds everything up! If the pole was made of rubber, it would be too floppy. If it was made of metal, electricity might travel into it and be dangerous.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why do we use *metal* for wires instead of rubber?\" (Metal is flexible and conducts electricity.)\n   - Ask: \"Why do we use *rubber* on the outside instead of metal?\" (Rubber is an insulator—it stops electricity.)\n   - Ask: \"Would you want a wooden wire or a metal wire carrying electricity to your house? Why?\" (Metal, because it conducts electricity well.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that materials are chosen because of their *properties*.\n- Students know what \"flexible,\" \"rigid,\" \"conductor,\" and \"insulator\" mean.\n- Students see that the utility pole is an example of scientists choosing the RIGHT material for EACH job.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new scenario and classify materials for a purpose.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real objects or pictures of objects to sort (see list below)\n- Sorting mats or large paper divided into two columns: \"GOOD FOR THIS JOB\" and \"NOT GOOD FOR THIS JOB\"\n- Scenario cards with pictures\n- Scissors and glue (optional, if using pictures)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario 1: Building a Bridge (10 minutes)**\n- Present: \"We need to build a bridge that people can walk across. Which materials would be GOOD for the bridge, and which would NOT be good?\"\n- Materials to sort:\n  - Metal (for support—rigid and strong)\n  - Rubber (for bridge part—too flexible, not rigid enough)\n  - Wood (for support—rigid and strong)\n  - Plastic (could work, but not as strong as metal or wood)\n  - Ceramic (very hard but breaks easily)\n- Students sort materials onto a chart: \"Would you use this for a bridge?\"\n- Ask: \"Why is metal good? Why is rubber not good? What *property* makes the difference?\" (Rigidity, strength.)\n\n**Scenario 2: Making a Raincoat (5 minutes)**\n- Present: \"We need to make a raincoat to keep water out. Which material would be best: metal, rubber, wood, or ceramic?\"\n- Students discuss in pairs, then share: Why rubber? (It's flexible so you can move; it doesn't let water through—it's waterproof.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate thinking: \"Tell me why you put metal in the 'NOT GOOD' column. What property of metal makes it wrong for a raincoat?\" (It's rigid, not flexible.)\n- Affirm reasoning based on properties, not guessing.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply properties they discovered to NEW situations.\n- Students make connections: \"I'm choosing this material because it has this property, and that property is important for this job.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of material properties and their connection to function.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student recordings during Explore: Do they describe observable properties accurately?\n- Listen to share-outs in Explain: Can they name properties and give examples?\n- Watch sorting in Elaborate: Do they justify choices based on properties?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) - Administer at end of Session 1 or Session 2:**\n\nGive each student a simple exit ticket (can be verbal or written, depending on writing readiness):\n\n1. **Show a picture of the utility pole. Ask:**\n   - \"Point to the metal wires. Why are the wires made of metal, not rubber?\" \n     - **Success:** Student says something like: \"Metal can carry electricity\" or \"Metal conducts electricity.\"\n   - \"Point to the rubber part. Why is there rubber on this pole?\"\n     - **Success:** Student says: \"To keep electricity safe\" or \"Rubber doesn't let electricity go through.\"\n\n2. **Show a picture of a wooden spoon and ask:**\n   - \"Would you use this material to make an electrical wire? Why or why not?\"\n     - **Success:** Student says: \"No, wood doesn't conduct electricity\" or \"Metal is better for wires.\"\n\n3. **Give a scenario:**\n   - \"You need to make a rope that can stretch and won't break when you pull it hard. Would you use metal, rubber, or wood? Why?\"\n     - **Success:** Student chooses rubber and explains: \"Rubber is flexible\" or \"Rubber stretches.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student can name at least one property of a material (flexible, rigid, conductor, insulator, hard, soft, etc.).\n- Student can explain why a material is used in the utility pole based on its property.\n- Student can match a material to a new job based on properties.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most 2nd graders can identify 2-3 properties of materials they tested.\n- Most can explain at least one reason why metal, rubber, or wood is used on the utility pole.\n- Students understand that scientists and engineers choose materials on PURPOSE, not randomly.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Reduced Material Set:** Provide only 3 materials instead of 6 (metal, rubber, wood) so students focus deeply on fewer examples.\n2. **Word Bank:** Provide a chart of property words with pictures (flexible/stiff, hard/soft, shiny/dull) so students can point or circle words instead of generating them independently.\n3. **Sentence Frames for Exit Ticket:** Offer sentence starters:\n   - \"Metal is good for wires because _______________.\"\n   - \"Rubber is used on the pole to _______________.\"\n   - \"Wood is good for the pole because _______________.\"\n4. **Partner Support:** Pair struggling students with a strong peer during Explore stations; have the peer ask the guiding questions and record together.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Material Testing Extension:** Ask: \"Can you test a FOURTH property we didn't try? What if we tested how easily each material breaks, or how much weight it can hold? Design your own test!\"\n2. **Design Challenge:** \"Now YOU are an engineer. Design a new utility pole using at least 3 different materials. For each material, explain what property makes it good for that job. Draw it and label the materials.\"\n3. **Research Connection:** \"Find out what the ceramic things on the pole are called (insulators). Research why they have that bumpy shape. Why not make them smooth?\" (Bumps increase surface area and prevent electricity from traveling along the surface.)\n4. **Conductor vs. Insulator Deep Dive:** \"We tested some materials with our hands. In real life, electricity goes through some materials and not others. Can you predict which materials from the pole would let electricity through and which would stop it? Make a list and explain your reasoning.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Material Hunt Around School:** Take students on a brief walk around the school or classroom. Ask them to identify objects and name the materials they're made of, then describe properties: \"The desk is made of wood. Wood is hard and rigid. It doesn't bend.\" Create a class list: \"Materials We Found and Their Properties.\"\n\n2. **Testing Challenge: Build the Strongest Bridge:** Provide straws, popsicle sticks, string, and tape. Challenge pairs or small groups to build a bridge strong enough to hold a toy car. After building, discuss: \"Which materials did you use? Why? What properties did you need for your bridge?\" This connects to Elaborate scenario and real-world engineering.\n\n3. **Insulator Investigation:** Wrap different materials (foil, plastic wrap, rubber, cloth, newspaper) around containers of warm water. Check temperatures after 5 and 10 minutes. Chart which materials kept the water warmest (best insulators). Discuss: \"Why does an insulator work? What property stops heat from escaping?\" This expands the definition of \"insulator\" beyond electricity to include heat.\n\n---",
