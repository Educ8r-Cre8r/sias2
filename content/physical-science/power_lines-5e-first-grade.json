How Electricity Travels to Light Up Our World**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 40-50 minute sessions (or three 30-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 1-PS4-2: Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that objects in darkness can be seen only when illuminated.\n  - 1-PS4-4: Use tools and materials to design and build a device that uses light or sound to solve the problem of communicating over a distance.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- **Observe and describe** how lights help us see things that are dark or far away.\n- **Explain** that objects need light to be seen, using evidence from their own observations.\n- **Design and build** a simple light-based communication device using everyday classroom materials.\n- **Communicate** how electricity and light help people stay connected and safe.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest using the photograph and activate prior knowledge about light, darkness, and how we see things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed image of the power line pole with streetlight\n- A flashlight or lamp (for the classroom)\n- A dark corner or closet in the classroom (optional but effective)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently on the board or screen. Ask students to look carefully.\n\n2. **Pose these discovery questions:**\n   - \"What do you see on this tall pole? What is the round thing that looks like a light?\"\n   - \"Why do you think someone built a light way up high like that? What happens when it gets dark outside?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen lights like this on the street near your home? Why are they there?\"\n   - \"How does that light help people who are walking or driving at night?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... if that light wasn't there, could you see the street or road when it's nighttime? Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Quick demonstration:** Darken one corner of the room slightly (close blinds or use a dark space). Show students that they can barely see a toy or object in that shadowy spot. Then shine a flashlight on it. Ask: \"What changed? Can you see it now?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! You noticed that light helps us see things. Today, we're going to explore how light works and even build our own way to send messages using light, just like those lights on the poles help send information about safety!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover that objects in darkness cannot be seen without light, and that light can travel to help communicate.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- Flashlight or small LED light stick\n- A small toy, ball, or object (not sharp or fragile)\n- Dark fabric or blanket to create a dim space\n- Chart paper or large paper for recording observations\n- Crayons or markers\n- Optional: colored cellophane or tissue paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Exploring Darkness and Light (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide the class into small groups.** Assign each group a \"dark zone\" (a corner with a blanket draped to block some light, or a box with one opening).\n\n2. **Give students these step-by-step directions:**\n   - \"First, place your toy or object in the dark zone. WITHOUT using your flashlight, try to point to where it is. Can you see it clearly?\"\n   - \"Now, turn on your flashlight and shine it on the object. What do you see now? Is it easier to find?\"\n   - \"Move the light around. What happens? Does the light help you see different parts of the object?\"\n   - \"Turn off the light again. What happens to what you can see?\"\n\n3. **Have students record their observations** by drawing two pictures: one showing what they could see in darkness, and one showing what they could see with light. They should label these pictures with help from the teacher (e.g., \"Dark—Can't see,\" \"Light—Can see!\").\n\n**Part 2: Light as a Message (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce a simple communication challenge:** \"Now we're going to use light to send a message, like those lights on poles send messages about safety!\"\n\n2. **Pair students.** Give one student the flashlight and one a piece of paper.\n\n3. **Student with flashlight:** Shine the light on and off in a simple pattern (flash-flash-pause, flash-flash-pause) while facing their partner across the room.\n\n4. **Student with paper:** Hold up the paper to show when they see the light (write \"I see light!\" or draw a smiley face each time they see the flash).\n\n5. **Switch roles.**\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What happens when you cover the light with your hand? Do they still see your message?\"\n- Help students notice patterns: \"Did they get your message? How did they know when you were flashing?\"\n- Prompt thinking without giving answers: \"Why do you think the light has to point toward your partner?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students discover that objects are invisible without light.\n- Students observe that light helps them see details.\n- Students recognize that light can be controlled and used to send simple messages.\n- Students document their findings with drawings and observations.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to concepts about light, vision, and communication.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Enlarged copy of the power line photograph\n- Chart paper and markers for vocabulary anchor chart\n- Flashlight for demonstration\n- Simple props (a ball, a hand)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (8 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their drawings and observations from the dark zone experiment.\n   - Ask: \"What did you learn? Why couldn't you see the toy without light?\"\n   - Celebrate accurate observations: \"You discovered that light helps us see! Without light, our eyes can't see anything, no matter how hard we look.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Display the vocabulary anchor chart and write each term as you explain it.\n   \n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Light:** Energy that lets us see things. Light comes from the sun, lamps, flashlights, and even fire.\n   - **Dark/Darkness:** When there is no light. In darkness, we cannot see.\n   - **Illuminated (or lit up):** When something has light shining on it so we can see it.\n   - **Shadow:** A dark area that forms when light is blocked by an object.\n   - **Communicate:** To send a message from one person to another. Light can carry messages!\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the streetlight in the image. \"This light is illuminated by electricity. It shines down on the street and sidewalk to help people see when it's dark outside.\"\n   - \"That tall pole carries electricity through wires—kind of like how the light travels from your flashlight to your partner!\"\n   - \"The light from that streetlight communicates an important message: 'It's safe to walk here; you can see!' Just like your light messages told your partner, 'I'm flashing!'\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show the flashlight beam. Ask: \"Is this light illuminating anything right now? What can we see because of this light?\"\n   - Hold your hand in front of the light. \"What happened? Can you see this shadow? Why?\"\n   - Quick true/false: \"A light bulb is dark.\" (false) \"We can see in complete darkness.\" (false) \"Light helps us see.\" (true)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students use vocabulary to describe what they observed.\n- Students understand that light is necessary for vision.\n- Students connect the streetlight in the photo to the concept of illumination.\n- Students begin to see light as a tool for communication and safety.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing and building a simple light-based communication device.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Flashlights or LED light sticks (1-2 per group)\n- Paper towel tubes or paper cups\n- Aluminum foil or shiny reflective material\n- Tape (masking or painter's tape preferred)\n- Colored cellophane or tissue paper (optional)\n- String or yarn\n- A target to \"illuminate\" at a distance (a poster board, piece of paper on the far side of the room)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember how the streetlight on the pole illuminates the street from far away? You're going to design your own light signaler to send a message across the room!\"\n   - \"Your job: Build a simple device using your flashlight that can send a light message to a partner on the other side of the room. Your message should be bright enough to see clearly!\"\n\n2. **Design and build phase (10 minutes):**\n   - Students work in pairs to construct a simple \"light signaler.\"\n   - **Simple design option:** Tape aluminum foil around a paper towel tube to create a reflector for the flashlight. The foil bounces and focuses the light.\n   - **Alternative design:** Wrap colored cellophane around the flashlight to create a colored light signal.\n   - Students test their device: Does the light reach across the room? Is it bright? Can a partner see it clearly?\n\n3. **Communication test (4 minutes):**\n   - Pair groups up and place them at opposite ends of the room.\n   - One group sends a light pattern using their device (on-off-on-off).\n   - The other group tries to \"receive\" the message by watching and responding (waving, raising a hand, or flashing their own light back).\n   - Switch roles.\n\n4. **Reflection (2 minutes):**\n   - \"How did your light device work? Did your partner see your message? What would happen if the room was brighter? What if it was darker?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Provide materials and clear instructions.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What happens when you point your light at the shiny foil? Does it get brighter?\"\n- Encourage problem-solving: \"The light isn't reaching far enough. What could you change?\"\n- Celebrate creative solutions and persistence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students build a functional light device using simple materials.\n- Students test their design and observe how light travels.\n- Students recognize that light can be used for real-world communication.\n- Students experience the relationship between light and visibility across distance.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light, vision, and light-based communication.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during the lesson):**\n- Observe student drawings during Explore and check for evidence that they understand darkness vs. illumination.\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain and note whether they use vocabulary correctly.\n- Watch student design and testing during Elaborate to see if they can apply concepts to a new context.\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple response sheet (can be verbal for early first graders or drawn/written with teacher support). Ask:\n\n**Question 1:** \"Draw or tell: What did you notice when you turned on your flashlight in the dark zone? What could you see?\"\n- **Success Criterion:** Student accurately describes that light made the object visible, or draws a picture showing a light illuminating something.\n\n**Question 2:** \"Can we see in complete darkness? How do we know?\" (Students can answer with words, drawings, or gestures.)\n- **Success Criterion:** Student indicates that we need light to see, referencing their experiment or the photograph.\n\n**Question 3:** \"Tell me or show: How did you use light to send a message to your partner?\"\n- **Success Criterion:** Student describes using the flashlight or light device to communicate, showing understanding that light can carry information.\n\n**Success Criteria for Overall Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student can identify that light is necessary for vision in darkness.\n- ✓ Student can describe an example of how light helps people (streetlight, home lamp, etc.).\n- ✓ Student demonstrates understanding that light can travel and communicate messages.\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary (light, dark, illuminated, shadow) appropriately.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Most students will successfully demonstrate that they understand light enables vision.\n- Most students will show evidence of building and testing a light device.\n- Most students will articulate a connection between their experiment and the real-world streetlight in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce sensory complexity during Explore:** Provide a well-lit dark zone (use a box with one opening rather than full darkness) so students aren't overwhelmed. Pair them with a more independent peer.\n\n2. **Scaffold vocabulary:** Provide a visual vocabulary card with pictures (sun = light, night = dark, lamp = illuminated). Allow students to point to cards instead of speaking words.\n\n3. **Simplify the communication challenge:** In Explore, let struggling students shine a flashlight on a large, colorful object (a red ball, for example) and simply observe. Ask, \"Do you see the red ball now?\" rather than expecting complex pattern recognition. For the device design, provide a pre-made reflector (foil already attached to a tube) so they can focus on the concept rather than construction.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extend the communication distance:** Challenge advanced students to send their light message across a larger space (outside, down a hallway, or across the gym if available). Ask: \"How far can your light travel? What happens to the brightness as it gets farther away?\"\n\n2. **Create a pattern code:** Have students design a specific light pattern (e.g., three flashes = \"hello,\" two flashes = \"goodbye\") and practice consistent signaling. Introduce the idea of a \"code\" as a way to send specific meanings with light.\n\n3. **Investigate materials:** Provide different materials (clear plastic, frosted plastic, black paper, aluminum foil) and ask: \"Which material makes the light brighter? Which blocks the light? Why?\" Record findings on a chart and discuss.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Streetlight Hunt:** Take students on a walk around the school or neighborhood (with appropriate supervision) to find and observe streetlights, traffic lights, and other light signals. Have them draw or photograph examples and create a class book titled \"Lights in Our Community: How Light Helps Us.\" Discuss why each light is important.\n\n2. **Shadow Theater:** Use light and objects to create shadow puppets. Shine a flashlight on a blank wall or white sheet and place objects (hands, toys, cut-out shapes) in front of the light. Students observe the shadows and discuss: \"Why do we see a shadow? What blocks the light?\" Create a simple shadow puppet story to reinforce understanding of light, objects, and shadows.\n\n3. **Home Light Scavenger Hunt:** Send home a simple worksheet asking families to find and list three lights in their home (lamp, overhead light, nightlight, etc.) and discuss why each light is useful. Students can draw or write about their findings and share during circle time the next day. This extends learning into the home environment and connects to real-world light use.\n\n---",
