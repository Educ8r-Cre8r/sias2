Some ice pieces are thick and some are thin.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image shows **icicle formation** as an anchoring phenomenon. Icicles form when snow or ice on a roof melts from warmth (sun or heat from inside a building), flows down as liquid water, and then refreezes when it reaches the colder air at the roof's edge. This creates the characteristic pointed, downward-hanging ice formations. The process demonstrates the water cycle in action and phase changes between solid and liquid states of matter.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **States of Matter**: Water exists in different forms - solid ice, liquid water, and can change between these states\n2. **Melting and Freezing**: Heat makes ice turn into water (melting), and cold makes water turn into ice (freezing)\n3. **Temperature Effects**: Warm temperatures cause melting, cold temperatures cause freezing\n4. **Gravity**: Water flows downward because gravity pulls it down\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use ice cubes in warm and cold water to demonstrate melting and freezing in real-time. Students can observe and predict what will happen, making the abstract concept concrete and observable.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to explore this concept: tactile experiences with ice, visual observations of melting, and kinesthetic activities like acting out water molecules moving fast (liquid) or slow (solid) to accommodate different learning preferences.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** At the molecular level, water molecules move faster when heated (becoming liquid) and slower when cooled (becoming solid ice). The molecules arrange themselves in organized patterns when frozen.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This icicle formation is part of the larger water cycle system where water continuously moves between solid, liquid, and gas states throughout Earth's atmosphere, contributing to weather patterns and seasonal changes.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"Ice is not water\" - Students may think ice and water are completely different substances.\n   **Clarification:** Ice and water are the same substance (H₂O) in different states.\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"Cold makes icicles grow down\" - Students may think cold pushes the ice downward.\n   **Clarification:** Gravity pulls the liquid water down as it flows and then freezes, creating the downward shape.\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"Icicles only form when it's snowing\" - Students may think active precipitation is needed.\n   **Clarification:** Icicles form from melting existing snow/ice, not from new snowfall.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** 1-PS4-3: Plan and conduct investigations to determine the effect of placing objects made with different materials in the path of a beam of light\n- **Disciplinary Core Idea:** [[NGSS:DCI:2-PS1.A]] - Different kinds of matter exist and many of them can be either solid or liquid\n- **Crosscutting Concept:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns in the natural world can be observed and used as evidence\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you think happened to make these ice sticks? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n2. Why do you think the icicles are pointing down instead of up? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n3. What would happen to these icicles on a very warm day? (Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 3)\n4. Where else have you seen ice change into water? (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Icicle:** A hanging piece of ice that forms when water freezes while dripping\n* **Melt:** When something solid becomes liquid because it gets warm\n* **Freeze:** When liquid water becomes solid ice because it gets cold\n* **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is\n* **Gravity:** The force that pulls things down toward the ground\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Snow is Falling* by Franklyn M.
