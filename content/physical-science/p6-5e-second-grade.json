Sorting and Sorting Again!**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or three 30-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-PS1-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to describe and classify different kinds of materials by their observable properties\n  - 2-PS1-2: Analyze data obtained from testing different materials to determine which materials have the properties that are best suited for an intended purpose\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Observe and describe** the properties of different natural and human-made materials (size, color, texture, shape)\n2. **Sort and classify** materials into groups based on observable properties in multiple ways\n3. **Explain why** certain materials work better for certain jobs based on their properties\n4. **Compare materials** and decide which properties make them useful for different purposes\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring the photograph as a mystery collection.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital display of the photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks or paper for recording\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Do not explain it yet.\n\n2. **Show and Tell Hook:** Say to students: *\"A scientist found this amazing collection of things. Look closely. What do you see? It's like nature's treasure box mixed with old things from a yard!\"*\n\n3. **Pose these specific discussion questions:**\n   - *\"What different things do you see in this picture? Can you name some?\"* (Listen for: seeds, pods, sticks, metal things, nails, old coins, rusty stuff)\n   - *\"Why do you think some things look shiny and some look rough?\"* (Introduce the idea that materials can look different)\n   - *\"If you could touch these things, which ones do you think would feel smooth? Which ones would feel bumpy?\"*\n   - *\"Has anyone seen things like these before? Where?\"* (Encourage connections to backyards, parks, playgrounds)\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** *\"We're going to be material detectives. We're going to collect things like what's in this picture, and we're going to sort them. What do you think we could use to sort them? By color? By size? By shape? By how they feel? Let's find out!\"*\n\n5. **Record student ideas** on chart paper titled \"How Can We Sort Things?\"\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to be just like the scientist in this picture. We'll collect and sort materials to discover how things are different and what we can do with them.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover material properties through hands-on sorting and comparison.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 collection per pair of students containing: 8-10 different items such as:\n  - 3 smooth, round items (river stones, wooden beads, plastic buttons)\n  - 3 rough, bumpy items (pinecones, seed pods, bark pieces)\n  - 3 thin, straight items (twigs, plastic straws, wooden craft sticks)\n  - 2-3 metal items (washers, bolts, nails, coins)\n  - Optional: magnifying glasses (1 per pair)\n- Paper plates or sorting mats (1 per pair)\n- Student recording sheets (see template below)\n- Pencils and crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Free Exploration (5 minutes)**\n- Distribute collections and say: *\"Spend a few minutes touching, looking at, and playing with these things. Don't sort them yet. Just get to know them. What do they look like? How do they feel?\"*\n- Circulate and listen to student language. Model descriptive words: *\"That one is really bumpy! That one is smooth and round.\"*\n\n**Step 2: First Sort (8 minutes)**\n- Say: *\"Now, sort your things into two piles. You decide how to sort them. You might sort by color, by how they feel, by size, or by shape. There's no wrong way!\"*\n- Provide student recording sheet with space for drawing or labeling their two groups\n- As students work, ask: *\"Tell me about your groups. Why did these go together?\"*\n\n**Step 3: Re-Sort (7 minutes)**\n- Say: *\"Now, mix all your things back together. Let's sort them a different way. Maybe you'll use a different rule this time.\"*\n- Provide a second recording sheet\n- Emphasize: *\"We can sort the same things in many different ways! Your sort might be different from your neighbor's, and that's great!\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions rather than suggesting sorts: *\"What do you notice?\" \"Why did you put those together?\" \"Could you sort these another way?\"*\n- Validate all attempts: *\"That's a smart way to sort! Can you tell me about your thinking?\"*\n- Take photos or notes of student sorts for reference during Explain phase\n- Encourage descriptive language by modeling: *\"I notice this one is bumpy and rough.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create at least two different groupings, demonstrating that properties can be used in multiple ways to organize materials\n- Student recording sheets will show evidence of sorting by at least two different attributes (e.g., color, texture, size, shape)\n- Students will verbalize reasoning for their groupings\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration. Connect discoveries back to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student recording sheets from Explore\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Picture cards or real examples of materials sorted by property (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Share Student Sorts (6 minutes)**\n- Call on 3-4 pairs to share their sorts\n- Ask: *\"How did you sort your things? What rule did you use?\"*\n- Display or draw the groupings on chart paper\n- Celebrate the variety: *\"Look! This group sorted by size. This group sorted by how it feels. This group sorted by color. All of these are right!\"*\n\n**Step 2: Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes)**\n- Write and define these terms on chart paper (keep displayed all week):\n\n| **Word** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Property** | Something you can see, feel, or notice about an object (like its color, size, shape, or how it feels) |\n| **Texture** | How something feels when you touch it—smooth or bumpy or rough |\n| **Material** | What something is made of (like wood, metal, plastic, or stone) |\n| **Sort/Classify** | To put things into groups that are alike in some way |\n\n- Use examples from their sorting activity: *\"When you decided that all the bumpy things go together, you were using the property of texture to sort!\"*\n\n**Step 3: Connect Back to the Photograph (4 minutes)**\n- Display the original photograph again\n- Say: *\"Look at this picture again. Now you're material detectives! What materials do you see? What properties do you notice?\"*\n- Guide students to identify:\n  - Smooth, round seed pods (property: shape and texture)\n  - Bumpy, rough seeds (property: texture)\n  - Shiny metal objects and rust (property: color and material)\n  - Thin twigs (property: shape and size)\n- Point out the rust: *\"See how these metal things have turned reddish-brown? That's rust. It happens to metal when it gets wet and sits outside for a long time. The metal is still the same, but its color changed.\"*\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Ask students: *\"If I showed you one of these things [hold up an object], could you describe its properties?\"*\n- Have students turn to a partner and say: *\"Tell your partner one property of this [item].\"*\n- Listen for use of descriptive language and vocabulary\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Property:** Something you can see, feel, or notice about an object (color, size, shape, texture)\n- **Texture:** How something feels when you touch it (smooth, bumpy, rough, soft)\n- **Material:** What something is made of (wood, metal, plastic, stone, seeds)\n- **Sort/Classify:** To put things into groups that are alike in some way\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the word \"property\" or \"texture\" when describing objects\n- Students will understand that the same objects can be sorted in different ways\n- Students will recognize that materials have observable properties\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to determine which materials are best suited for specific purposes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4 scenario cards (see below) with pictures or words\n- Same material collections from Explore phase\n- Paper and pencils\n- Chart paper titled \"What's the Best Material for the Job?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Material Matching:**\n\nPresent students with four real-world scenarios (one per pair or small group). Students must choose which materials from their collection would work best and explain why based on properties.\n\n**Scenario Cards:**\n\n1. **\"You want to build a bird's nest. Which material would work best? Why?\"**\n   - Expected answer: Twigs (because they're long and stiff and can be woven)\n\n2. **\"You need to make a toy ball that bounces. Which would work better: a smooth round stone or a soft, bumpy seed pod? Why?\"**\n   - Expected answer: Smooth stone (because it's hard and round; the pod is too soft)\n\n3. **\"You're building a bridge. Which materials are strong? Which might break?\"**\n   - Expected answer: Metal and wood are strong; seeds might break\n\n4. **\"You want something shiny to decorate with. Which materials are shiny?\"**\n   - Expected answer: Metal, smooth stones (connect to the coins and washers in the photo)\n\n**Student Task:**\n- Provide each pair with one scenario card and their material collection\n- Say: *\"Look at your scenario. Choose the material that works best for the job. Then, draw a picture or write about why that material is the best choice. Tell me about the properties that make it perfect!\"*\n- Provide a simple recording sheet:\n  - *\"The best material is ________\"*\n  - *\"I chose it because... [draw or write]\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group and ask: *\"Why did you choose that one? What property makes it work for this job?\"*\n- Push for evidence-based reasoning: *\"Tell me about this material. Is it smooth or bumpy? Is it hard or soft? How does that help?\"*\n- Record student explanations to assess understanding\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will match materials to purposes based on observable properties\n- Student explanations will reference at least one property (e.g., \"It's hard,\" \"It's smooth,\" \"It's long\")\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that material properties determine usefulness\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of material properties, sorting, and matching materials to purposes.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n\n- **Observation Checklist** (use during Explore and Elaborate):\n  - ✓ Student uses descriptive words for properties (bumpy, smooth, hard, soft, big, small)\n  - ✓ Student can sort items by at least two different attributes\n  - ✓ Student explains reasoning for groupings\n  - ✓ Student matches materials to purposes based on properties\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nAdminister one of the following (use pictures for non-readers or have students draw responses):\n\n**Option 1: Two-Question Exit Ticket**\n\n1. **\"Show me with a picture or tell me: What are TWO properties of this material?\"** [Show a sample object—a pinecone, washer, twig, or stone]\n\n2. **\"Would a soft seed pod or a hard stone be better for making a toy to throw? Why?\"**\n\n**Option 2: Material Scavenger Hunt**\n\n- Show students four objects from the lesson collection\n- Ask: *\"Which one is bumpy? Which one is shiny? Which one is smooth? Which one would be best for building?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents meet learning objectives if they:\n\n1. ✓ **Describe properties:** Student can name at least two properties of an object (e.g., \"It's round and smooth\" or \"It's bumpy and brown\")\n\n2. ✓ **Sort in multiple ways:** Student demonstrates sorting the same collection by at least two different attributes\n\n3. ✓ **Match to purpose:** Student selects a material for a given purpose and explains the choice using at least one property (e.g., \"I chose the stick because it's long and stiff\")\n\n4. ✓ **Use vocabulary:** Student uses words like \"smooth,\" \"bumpy,\" \"hard,\" \"soft,\" \"property,\" or \"texture\" when discussing materials\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents will demonstrate understanding by successfully describing material properties, sorting collections, and justifying why certain materials work better for specific jobs.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Reduce the Collection:** Provide fewer items (5-6 instead of 10) with very distinct properties (e.g., one smooth stone, one bumpy pinecone, one metal washer, one stick, one seed pod, one button). This reduces cognitive load and makes sorting more obvious.\n\n2. **Provide Sorting Categories:** Instead of asking students to decide how to sort, offer 2-3 specific categories: *\"Rough or Smooth?\" / \"Big or Small?\" / \"Wood or Metal?\"* Provide picture labels for each category.\n\n3. **Use Descriptive Word Bank:** Display or give students a card with texture words (smooth, bumpy, rough, soft, hard) with small pictures or tactile examples. Students can point to words instead of generating language.\n\n4. **Pair with a Peer or Adult:** During Explore, pair struggling learners with a more advanced student or classroom aide to model sorting and provide language support.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Three-Way Sorting:** Ask advanced students to sort their collections by three properties simultaneously or to create \"mystery sorts\" where a peer has to guess the sorting rule. Example: *\"Sort into three groups using one property, then re-sort using two properties at once.\"*\n\n2. **Introduce \"Reversible\" vs. \"Irreversible\" Change:** Show a picture of rust on metal and ask: *\"If I cleaned off the rust, would it look new again? What about a burnt match—could it go back to being fresh wood?\"* Connect to 2-PS1-4 for future lessons.\n\n3. **Design a Material for a Job:** Provide a challenge: *\"If you could create a new material to be the perfect toy ball, what properties would it have? Would it be smooth or bumpy? Hard or soft? Why?\"* Have students draw or describe their material.\n\n4. **Graph or Chart Data:** Challenge students to create a tally chart or simple bar graph showing how many items have each property (e.g., \"4 bumpy things, 3 smooth things, 3 shiny things\").\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Nature Walk & Collection:** Take students on a supervised outdoor walk to collect their own materials (twigs, leaves, rocks, seed pods). Return to class, sort, and compare with the original collection. Discuss: *\"What materials do we have in nature? Are they the same as in our picture?\"*\n\n2. **Material Properties Sensory Stations:** Create 4-5 stations around the classroom, each with a different material (smooth sandpaper station, bumpy pinecone station, soft fabric station, shiny metal station, rough bark station). Students rotate and record what they notice about each material's texture and properties using a recording sheet.\n\n3. **\"Treasure Box\" Creation:** Students design a small box or container from paper/cardboard and choose materials from the collection to decorate it based on the properties they want (e.g., *\"I'll use smooth stones because I like how they feel\" or \"I'll use shiny things because they're pretty\"*). Display finished boxes and have students explain their material choices.\n\n4. **Storybook Connection:** Read *\"The Three Little Pigs\"* and discuss material properties: *\"Why was wood not strong enough? Why did the brick house work best? What properties did brick have?\"* Create a chart of \"Pig Houses and Their Materials\" sorted by strength.\n\n5. **Real-World Match-Up:** Bring in pictures of common objects (pencils, coins, toys, spoons, sponges, rocks) and have students match them to property groups from their collection: *\"Which collection items are like a coin? (shiny, metal, round) Which are like a sponge? (soft, bumpy)\"*\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Photography Connection:** Explain to students that the original photograph was taken by a scientist who was observing nature. Scientists observe, sort, and ask questions—just like they did today!\n- **Vocabulary Spiraling:** These terms will be used throughout the year. Expect repetition and reinforcement across lessons.\n- **Safety Reminder:** If using real metal objects (nails, bolts), supervise closely. Sand any sharp edges. Ensure no pinecones with sharp scales are used if students have sensitive skin.\n- **Material Storage:** Keep student collections in ziplock bags or small containers for easy access during future lessons on properties, sorting, and material change.",
