ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about pushes and pulls using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital projection of the photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see. Show it silently for 15-20 seconds and let students look without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing time for responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is happening?\" (Point to the crane arm extended in the air.)\n   - \"Do you see the big ball hanging in the air? How do you think it got up there? Is someone pushing it or pulling it?\"\n   - \"Look at the truck. Is the truck helping the workers? How?\"\n   - \"Could a person pick up that big ball by themselves? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** Say, \"Today we're going to learn about pushes and pulls. A push moves something *away* from you. A pull moves something *toward* you or *up* into the air. Watch this truck's crane—it's pulling that heavy ball up! Can you show me with your hands what a push looks like? Now show me what a pull looks like.\"\n\n4. **Activate prior knowledge:** Ask students to stand up and demonstrate one push and one pull in the open space (e.g., pushing a pretend wall, pulling a rope).\n\n**Transition:** \"You just showed me pushes and pulls with your bodies! Now let's do some experiments to discover how pushes and pulls can move things in different ways.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how pushes and pulls affect motion through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Toy blocks or small boxes (foam blocks work well)\n- Lightweight plastic balls\n- Toy trucks or wheeled vehicles\n- Ropes or yarn for pulling activities\n- Open floor space\n- Small clipboards with pictures (optional, for younger K students)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station 1: Pushing and Pulling Blocks (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide the class into small groups of 3-4 students.\n\n2. **Give clear instructions:** \"We're going to see what happens when we push and pull things. First, put this block on the floor. Now, push it gently. What happened? Where did it go?\"\n\n3. **Students perform:** Each student gently pushes a block across the floor. Encourage them to observe where the block moved.\n\n4. **Next direction:** \"Now let's try pulling. Tie this rope to your block. Pull the rope. Did the block move? Where did it go?\"\n\n5. **Students record observations:** Have them point to where things moved. Ask: \"Which made it move faster—a gentle push or a stronger push?\" Let them try both.\n\n**Station 2: Pulling Wheeled Objects (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the activity:** \"Look at this toy truck. I'm going to pull it with this rope. Watch what happens.\"\n\n2. **Students perform:** Each student pulls a toy truck using a rope. Ask them to pull gently, then harder, and observe the difference.\n\n3. **Guided questioning:** \"When you pulled harder, what happened? Did the truck move faster? Did it go farther?\"\n\n4. **Change direction:** \"Now pull your truck in a different direction—maybe in a circle. Does the truck go the way you pull it?\"\n\n5. **Students record:** Have them use their fingers to trace the path the truck traveled in the air.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between stations, asking guiding questions: \"What happened?\" \"Did it move the way you wanted?\" \"What's different about a strong pull and a gentle pull?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answer; let them discover through trial and error.\n- Encourage students to repeat actions multiple times and notice patterns.\n- Ask students to compare: \"Whose block moved farther? Why?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that pushes and pulls make objects move.\n- Students observe that stronger pushes/pulls make bigger movements.\n- Students notice that the direction they push or pull changes where the object goes.\n- Students can point to or describe what happened (\"It went far!\" \"It moved fast!\").\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect discoveries to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with illustrations (teacher-prepared before lesson)\n- Photograph (enlarged or projected)\n- Picture cards showing pushes and pulls\n- Whiteboard or large paper for word wall\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Gather students in a circle. Ask:\n   - \"What did you discover about pushes?\" (Let 3-4 students share.)\n   - \"What did you discover about pulls?\" (Let 3-4 students share.)\n   - \"When you pushed hard, what happened? When you pulled hard, what happened?\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (7 minutes):** Write each term on chart paper with a simple illustration. Say the word clearly and have students repeat.\n\n3. **Make connections to the photograph (5-8 minutes):**\n   - Point to the crane in the photo. Say, \"The crane is pulling that heavy ball UP into the air. The rope is pulling it. This is a strong pull—much stronger than any one person could make!\"\n   - Point to the truck. Say, \"The truck and crane work together. The truck helps pull the ball. Without the truck and crane, the workers couldn't move something so heavy.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do we need the truck and crane? Could one person pull that ball by themselves?\" (Guide students to understand that machines make pushing and pulling stronger.)\n\n4. **Check for understanding (3-5 minutes):** \n   - Show picture cards or demonstrations. Ask: \"Is this a push or a pull?\" Have students show thumbs up for push, thumbs down for pull.\n   - Demonstration: Gently push a ball across the floor. Ask, \"Is that a push or pull?\" Then pull it back. Ask again.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Push:** A force that moves something *away from you*. When you push a block, it moves away.\n- **Pull:** A force that moves something *toward you* or *up*. When you pull a rope, it comes toward you.\n- **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or change direction.\n- **Stronger pull (or push):** A bigger, more powerful push or pull that makes things move faster or farther.\n- **Machine:** A tool that helps us do jobs, like a truck or crane that can pull heavy things.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name pushes and pulls.\n- Students understand that pushes and pulls make things move.\n- Students recognize that stronger forces create bigger movements.\n- Students begin to understand that machines amplify (make bigger) our pushing and pulling power.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to a new context and deepen understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Variety of objects with different weights (lightweight ball, small weighted box, foam block, book)\n- Ropes of varying lengths\n- Toy pulleys (or make a simple pulley system with a stick and string)\n- Open floor space\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Activity: \"Comparing Pushes and Pulls\" (12-15 minutes)**\n\n   **Set up:** Create a simple challenge course or station area.\n\n2. **Scenario introduction:** Say, \"Imagine you are workers helping to move supplies. Sometimes you need to push things, and sometimes you need to pull them. Let's test different objects and see which ones are easier to move.\"\n\n3. **Student exploration:**\n   - Give each student or pair several objects (ball, block, book).\n   - **Task 1:** \"Push each object. Which one needs a stronger push to move?\"\n   - **Task 2:** \"Now pull each object with a rope. Which one needs a stronger pull?\"\n   - **Task 3:** \"Let's imagine you need to move a heavy box. Would you push it or pull it? Try both. Which way is easier?\" (Many students will discover pulling is easier because you can lean back and use more strength.)\n\n4. **Introduce a challenge (optional, for advanced learners):**\n   - \"Now let's use a simple machine to help us pull.\" Set up a toy pulley or create one with a broomstick and rope.\n   - Show students that using the pulley makes pulling easier (or faster).\n   - Ask: \"Did the pulley help? How?\"\n\n5. **Discussion:** Bring students together and ask:\n   - \"Was it easier to push or pull the heavy object?\"\n   - \"Which objects were hardest to move? Why?\"\n   - \"How did the machine (pulley) help us?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to test multiple objects and compare results.\n- Ask, \"Which needed a stronger force?\" to highlight that different objects require different strengths of push or pull.\n- If using a pulley, demonstrate how the machine reduces the effort needed.\n- Do not give answers; let students discover through testing.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding of pushes and pulls to new objects.\n- Students compare the strength needed for different tasks.\n- Students recognize that some objects are easier to pull than push.\n- Students begin to understand that tools and machines can help us (extension concept for advanced learners).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pushes, pulls, and their effects on motion.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore stations: Do students demonstrate pushes and pulls? Do they notice differences in motion based on force strength?\n- Questions asked during Explain and Elaborate: Can students identify pushes vs. pulls? Can they explain what happens?\n- Thumbs up/down check during Explain phase.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket Activity (5-10 minutes)**\n\n**Choose one format based on your class's readiness:**\n\n**Option A: Picture Sort (For earlier K or struggling students)**\n- Display three pictures: one showing a push, one showing a pull, one showing neither.\n- Ask each student individually or in small groups, \"Is this a push or a pull?\"\n- Record their responses (use a checklist).\n\n**Option B: Demonstration & Verbal Response**\n- Show the photograph again.\n- Ask each student individually: \n  1. \"Show me a push.\" (Student demonstrates pushing motion.)\n  2. \"Show me a pull.\" (Student demonstrates pulling motion.)\n  3. \"In this picture, is the crane pushing or pulling the ball?\" (Student answers and briefly explains.)\n\n**Option C: Directed Drawing & Dictation**\n- Give each student a paper.\n- Provide verbal instructions: \"Draw a picture of something being pushed OR pulled. You can draw a person pushing a toy, or pulling a rope, or anything you want!\"\n- As they draw, ask each student: \"Tell me about your picture. Is that a push or a pull? What happens when you push (or pull) it?\"\n- Write their words under their picture.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify whether an action is a push or a pull.\n- ✓ Student can demonstrate a push and a pull correctly.\n- ✓ Student understands that pushes and pulls make objects move.\n- ✓ Student can observe that stronger forces create bigger movements (this may be an emerging skill).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will correctly identify and demonstrate pushes and pulls.\n- Most students will understand that pushes and pulls cause motion.\n- Some students may begin to connect stronger forces with larger movements.\n- Advanced students may start thinking about why machines are useful.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Use consistent, simple vocabulary:** Stick to just \"push\" and \"pull\" throughout the lesson. Do not introduce \"force\" or \"direction\" unless the student is ready.\n\n2. **Provide hand-over-hand modeling:** During the Explore phase, physically guide a student's hand to demonstrate pushing and pulling. Then gradually fade the support as they practice.\n\n3. **Use highly visible demonstrations:** When introducing concepts, use large, exaggerated pushes and pulls. Use objects with high contrast (white block on dark floor). Make movements slow and deliberate so students see clearly what's happening.\n\n4. **Pair students strategically:** Pair a student who struggles with a confident peer during station activities so they can observe and imitate.\n\n5. **Simplify the exit ticket:** Instead of drawing, ask the student to simply point to the push or pull in a picture you show. Accept one-word answers (\"Push!\" or \"Pull!\").\n\n---\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Introduce the concept of direction and prediction:** Ask, \"If I push the ball this way (point), where will it go? Can you predict?\" Have them test their prediction and discuss why it happened.\n\n2. **Explore multiple trials and patterns:** Ask, \"If I push the ball harder and harder, what pattern do you see? Does it move faster? Does it go farther?\" Encourage them to repeat the action and look for patterns.\n\n3. **Introduce simple machines:** Show a toy pulley or lever and ask, \"How does this machine help us? Does it make pulling easier? Why do you think that might be?\" (Note: This is an extension into K-PS2-2.)\n\n4. **Challenge design task:** \"Can you design a way to move a heavy box using pushes and pulls in a more clever way?\" Allow them to experiment with levers, pulleys, or teammates working together.\n\n5. **Connect to the photograph:** Ask advanced students, \"Why did the workers use a truck and crane instead of just their hands? What would be hard about lifting that ball by hand?\" Guide them to think about the limitations of human strength.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Exploring Different Directions\" (15-20 minutes)**\n   - Set up an obstacle course where students must push and pull objects in different directions: straight, around corners, up and down.\n   - Have them observe: Does the object always follow the direction of the push or pull?\n   - This connects to K-PS2-1 (comparing effects of different directions).\n\n2. **\"Strong and Gentle\" Sorting Activity (10-15 minutes)**\n   - Show pictures or videos of different activities (pushing a button, pushing a car, pulling a feather, pulling a heavy box).\n   - Have students sort them into \"gentle push/pull\" and \"strong push/pull\" categories.\n   - Discuss: Why do we sometimes need a gentle push? When do we need a strong pull?\n   - Extension: Bring in objects from around school (door, window, storage bin) and test which need gentle vs. strong pushes/pulls to move.\n\n3. **\"Machines Help Us\" Picture Walk & Class Book (20-30 minutes over multiple days)**\n   - Collect pictures of machines that use pushes and pulls (cranes, excavators, forklifts, bulldozers, see-saws, doors, drawers).\n   - Create a class book where each page shows one machine and students draw or label the push or pull.\n   - As a class, discuss why each machine is helpful and what job it does.\n   - Read the book together several times to reinforce vocabulary and concepts.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis 5E lesson uses the compelling image of a truck crane lifting a heavy ball to help kindergarteners understand pushes and pulls—a foundational concept in physics. The progression from observation (Engage) to hands-on discovery (Explore) to formal vocabulary introduction (Explain) to application (Elaborate) to demonstration of understanding (Evaluate) ensures students build deep, concrete understanding. The lesson honors kindergarteners' need for movement, multiple demonstrations, and concrete experience while scaffolding toward the NGSS performance expectations.",
