ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on a screen or printed large (8.5\" x 11\" or larger)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** of the soap bubble on a screen or as a large printout. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation—no talking yet. This builds anticipation.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What's happening to the bubble?\" *(Accept all observations—colors, shape, bubbles, reflections.)*\n   - \"Why do you think the bubble is floating in the air instead of falling down to the ground like a rock would?\" *(Guide toward thinking about air and upward forces.)*\n   - \"Look at the colors on the bubble—red, black, white. Where do you think those colors come from?\" *(Don't answer yet; accept wonder.)*\n   - \"Do you think this bubble will stay like this forever, or will something happen to it? What?\" *(Encourage predictions about popping.)*\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** \"I'm going to make bubbles today, just like the one in this photo. Before we start, I want you to think: **What forces do you think are working on a bubble to keep it floating? What forces might make it pop?** Turn and talk to your neighbor for one minute.\" Jot student responses on chart paper titled \"What Forces Act on Bubbles?\"\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Great predictions! Now we're going to be bubble scientists and test those ideas ourselves. Let's explore how forces shape and change bubbles.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bubble solution (store-bought or homemade: 1 cup water + 2 tablespoons dish soap + 1 tablespoon corn syrup)\n- Bubble wands (various shapes: round, square, star)\n- Shallow trays or containers for bubble solution (one per 2-3 students)\n- Paper towels\n- Observation sheets (template provided below)\n- Pencils\n- Spray bottle with water (for later variations)\n- Cotton swabs or thin sticks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud, then post on chart paper):**\n\n1. **Station Setup:** Work in groups of 2-3. You have a tray with bubble solution and wands.\n\n2. **Make Bubbles:** Dip your wand into the solution and blow gently to create a bubble. Make at least 3 bubbles.\n\n3. **Observe Motion:** Watch each bubble carefully. On your observation sheet, draw or write:\n   - Does the bubble float up, down, or sideways?\n   - How long does it stay floating before it pops?\n   - Does it pop right away, or does it float for a while?\n\n4. **Test Forces:** Now try these experiments (one at a time):\n   - **Gravity Test:** Let a bubble float in the air. Does it stay up or fall down? Why?\n   - **Air Test:** Blow gently toward a floating bubble. What happens? Blow hard. What happens?\n   - **Touch Test:** Gently tap a floating bubble with your finger. What happens? Try with a wet finger. Does it pop or stay?\n   - **Shape Test:** Use different wand shapes (round, square, star). Do the bubbles look different? Draw what you see.\n\n5. **Record Observations:** Use words or pictures to show what you discovered. Write or draw at least one thing that surprised you.\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** \"The bubble in the photo is floating just like yours. Watch for those pretty colors on your bubbles too. Can you see red, white, or black colors like in the picture?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups; do NOT tell students what will happen.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice about what happened when you...?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\" \"Can you try that again and watch more carefully?\"*\n- Encourage students to make predictions before testing: *\"What do you think will happen if we blow hard? Let's test it.\"*\n- Help students stay focused on observation, not just \"having fun\" (though fun is fine!).\n- If a student says, \"The bubble popped,\" ask: *\"What caused it to pop? What force did that?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe that bubbles float (upward forces balance downward gravity, at least briefly).\n- Students discover that gentle forces (breeze, tap) can move or reshape bubbles.\n- Students find that strong forces (hard blow, hard tap, dry finger) cause bubbles to pop.\n- Students record observations in pictures, words, or both.\n- Students may notice that wet fingers don't pop bubbles as easily as dry ones (tension of the film + friction concept for later).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of bubble displayed again\n- Simple diagram of a bubble with arrows (teacher-created or found)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Gather students on the carpet. Hold up observation sheets.\n   - \"Who had a bubble float UP? What does that tell us?\" *(Upward force is stronger than downward force.)*\n   - \"Who had a bubble pop when you blew hard? That's an unbalanced force!\"\n   - \"Who noticed their bubble stayed floating for a while? Those forces were balanced!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (write each term on chart paper as you introduce it):\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Force** | A push or a pull that makes something move, stop, change direction, or change shape. |\n   | **Balanced Forces** | When two forces are equal and push/pull on an object the same amount—the object stays still or moves at the same speed. |\n   | **Unbalanced Forces** | When forces are NOT equal—one pushes or pulls harder than the other. This causes something to move, speed up, slow down, or pop. |\n   | **Bubble Film** | The thin, stretchy layer of soapy water that holds the air inside a bubble. |\n   | **Air Pressure** | The push that air makes on everything around it. |\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Point to the bubble image: \"This bubble is floating because there's upward air pushing it UP and gravity pulling DOWN. Those forces are balanced right now—so the bubble stays floating!\"\n   - \"But look—you can see the bubble is starting to get thin on top (point). Soon, unbalanced forces will make it pop. Maybe air will escape or gravity will win.\"\n   - Show the colors: \"The pretty colors happen because light bounces off the thin bubble film—that's a FORCE pushing and pulling light!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I blow HARD on a bubble, are the forces balanced or unbalanced?\" *(Unbalanced—makes it pop.)*\n   - Ask: \"If a bubble is floating steady in the air, what does that tell us about the forces?\" *(Balanced!)*\n   - Ask: \"What force pulls everything DOWN toward Earth?\" *(Gravity!)*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents understand that:\n- Forces are pushes or pulls.\n- Balanced forces keep bubbles floating; unbalanced forces make them pop, move, or change.\n- Gravity pulls down; air pushes up.\n- Bubbles are made of a thin film holding air.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bubble solution and wands (fresh batches if needed)\n- String or yarn (cut into 12-inch pieces)\n- Straws (paper or plastic)\n- Shallow dishes with water\n- Food coloring (optional)\n- Cotton swabs\n- Index cards with challenge cards (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge-Based Exploration:** Provide students with \"force challenge cards\" and let them choose ONE to investigate:\n\n**Challenge Card 1: The Wet vs. Dry Challenge**\n- Make two bubbles. Try to touch one with a DRY cotton swab. What happens?\n- Now, dip a cotton swab in water and touch another bubble. What happens?\n- **Question:** Why do you think a wet swab doesn't pop the bubble? *(Hint: Think about forces and friction!)*\n- **Record:** Draw both bubbles and label \"popped\" or \"still floating.\"\n\n**Challenge Card 2: The Gravity Challenge**\n- Can you catch a bubble on a string without popping it? Try!\n- What forces are working on the bubble—gravity pulling down and the string pushing up?\n- **Challenge:** Can you make a bubble stay on the string for 10 seconds? 30 seconds?\n- **Record:** How long did your bubble stay on the string?\n\n**Challenge Card 3: The Moving Bubble**\n- Blow a bubble and let it float. Now, use a straw to blow air gently AROUND it (not at it).\n- Predict: Will the bubble move? Which direction?\n- **Record:** Draw arrows showing how the bubble moved and why.\n\n**Challenge Card 4: The Bubble in a Bubble**\n- Try to blow a bubble INSIDE another bubble. Is it possible?\n- Think about forces: Is the air inside pushing outward? Are there two bubble films?\n- **Record:** Draw what happened and your explanation.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Assign groups to challenges OR allow students to choose.\n- Ask open-ended questions: *\"What forces are you trying to test here?\" \"Is that balanced or unbalanced?\" \"Can you predict what will happen before you try it?\"*\n- Encourage students to try multiple times and notice patterns.\n- Have students explain their thinking, not just their observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate:\n- Deeper understanding of balanced/unbalanced forces in new bubble contexts.\n- Ability to predict outcomes based on force concepts.\n- Recognition that forces can be invisible but have visible effects.\n- Connection between force concepts and real bubble behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces and bubble behavior.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe student predictions and explanations during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Listen to student language: Are they using words like \"force,\" \"balanced,\" \"unbalanced,\" \"push,\" \"pull\"?\n- Check observation sheets for accuracy and detail.\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment:**\n\n**Provide each student with this ticket (read questions aloud for Third Grade; allow drawing + words):**\n\n---\n\n**BUBBLE FORCES EXIT TICKET**\n\n**Name: ________________  Date: ________________**\n\n**1. Draw or explain: Why does a bubble float in the air instead of falling to the ground like a rock?**\n   *(Look for: mention of upward force, air, or balanced forces)*\n\n**2. What happens to a bubble when you blow HARD on it? Why?**\n   *(Look for: mention of unbalanced forces, force is too strong, bubble pops)*\n\n**3. Finish this sentence: A force is a ___________ or ___________ that makes something move or change.**\n   *(Look for: push and pull)*\n\n**4. You see a bubble floating steady in the air. Are the forces on that bubble balanced or unbalanced? How do you know?**\n   *(Look for: balanced; because it's not moving or changing)*\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Developing (1 point):** Student attempts to answer but explanation is unclear or incomplete.\n✓ **Proficient (2 points):** Student correctly identifies balanced/unbalanced forces and provides a basic explanation.\n✓ **Advanced (3 points):** Student explains forces clearly, uses correct vocabulary, and connects to observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents who meet learning objectives will:\n- Accurately describe how forces (gravity, air pressure) act on bubbles.\n- Distinguish between balanced forces (floating bubble) and unbalanced forces (popping, falling).\n- Use words like \"push,\" \"pull,\" \"force,\" \"balanced,\" and \"unbalanced\" appropriately.\n- Predict bubble behavior based on force concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a pre-drawn bubble outline with checkboxes:\n   - ☐ Bubble floated up\n   - ☐ Bubble fell down\n   - ☐ Bubble popped when I touched it\n   - ☐ Bubble popped when I blew hard\n   - Students check boxes instead of writing/drawing from scratch.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Keep a large, colorful chart posted throughout the lesson with pictures of:\n   - Arrow pointing UP (balanced forces = floating bubble)\n   - Arrow pointing DOWN (gravity)\n   - Arrow pointing in two directions (unbalanced = popping)\n   - Students can point to the chart to communicate and remember terms.\n\n3. **Pair with a Stronger Reader/Observer:** Assign struggling students a buddy during Explore and Elaborate phases. The buddy helps record observations while both observe together.\n\n4. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Reduce to 2 questions and allow drawing answers primarily:\n   - \"Why does a bubble float?\" (draw)\n   - \"What makes a bubble pop?\" (draw or one-word label)\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Investigate Bubble Variables:** Provide a data table and ask advanced students to test:\n   - Does bubble size affect how long it floats? (Measure bubble diameters; time float duration)\n   - Does bubble solution recipe affect bubble strength? (Test store-bought vs. homemade)\n   - Students collect data, organize it, and make predictions about patterns.\n\n2. **Explain the Physics:** Provide a short text or diagram explaining surface tension and ask students to:\n   - Read about how soap reduces surface tension of water.\n   - Draw a picture showing how soap molecules arrange on the bubble film.\n   - Explain why a wet finger doesn't pop the bubble (surface tension + friction; soap on the finger reduces the barrier).\n\n3. **Design a Bubble Trap:** Challenge students to design a container or method to keep a bubble floating as long as possible.\n   - Predict which design will work best.\n   - Test and measure float time.\n   - Explain why their design worked (balanced forces, stable air, protection from disturbances).\n\n4. **Real-World Force Application:** Ask: \"Where else do you see forces pushing and pulling on things in real life?\" (Kites, balloons, parachutes, balls rolling, sliding on ice.)\n   - Students choose one and draw how balanced/unbalanced forces work in that example.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bubble Painting:** Mix bubble solution with washable paint (tempera or food coloring). Blow bubbles onto large paper. When bubbles pop, they leave colorful marks. Students observe the popping pattern (unbalanced forces) and predict where the next bubble will pop. This bridges to **patterns in motion** (3-PS2-2).\n\n2. **Bubble Olympics:** Set up stations—students compete to:\n   - Make the biggest bubble\n   - Make the smallest bubble\n   - Keep a bubble floating the longest\n   - Pop a bubble with the softest touch\n   - Catch a bubble on a string\n   \n   **Connection to Lesson:** After each challenge, discuss: \"What forces helped you succeed? How did you balance forces to achieve the goal?\"\n\n3. **Floating Bubble Investigation (Take-Home or Follow-Up):** Provide a bubble solution recipe and wand to families. Students blow bubbles outdoors and record observations:\n   - How does wind affect the bubble? (Unbalanced force)\n   - Does the bubble float higher on hot days or cold days? (Air density and buoyancy—extension of force concepts)\n   - Students bring data back to class and create a class graph or report.\n\n4. **Video or Photo Documentation:** Have students use classroom cameras or tablets to photograph or video their bubbles mid-experiment. Create a class \"bubble photo gallery\" with captions describing the forces visible in each image.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Preparation Notes\n\n- **Bubble Solution:** Make fresh solution the morning of the lesson. Homemade (water + dish soap + corn syrup) works well and is cost-effective. Corn syrup increases bubble durability.\n- **Safety Reminder:** Bubble solution is non-toxic but not for consumption. Remind students: \"Bubbles are fun to watch, not to taste!\"\n- **Cleanup:** Bubble solution is slippery. Place towels under trays and have paper towels ready. Designate a cleanup station.\n- **Photograph Visibility:** Ensure the bubble photograph is large and clear so all students can see colors and surface details during Engage and Explain.\n- **Student Motivation:** Third graders love bubble activities—use their enthusiasm to guide them toward deeper thinking about forces, not just playing.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly addresses NGSS 3-PS2-1 and 3-PS2-2 by having students plan/conduct investigations, make observations, and use evidence to understand how balanced and unbalanced forces affect object motion. The photograph serves as both a hook and a reference point throughout, grounding abstract force concepts in a concrete, visible phenomenon.**",
