Observe and describe the physical properties of materials used in electrical circuits (wires, plastic coating, metal terminals).\n2. Explain why different materials are used in circuits based on their observable properties (conductors conduct electricity; insulators protect).\n3. Assemble and disassemble simple circuits by connecting and disconnecting wires, and predict what happens when the pathway is broken.\n4. Classify materials as good or poor choices for making electrical pathways based on testing and evidence.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about electrical pathways and materials by examining the photograph and everyday electrical items.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the circuit terminal blocks and wires (displayed on screen or printed large)\n- Flashlight or lamp (unplugged for safety)\n- Various wires and cords from classroom (extension cords, phone chargers, etc.)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Ask students to sit in a circle where they can all see it clearly.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the colors and shapes?\"\n   - \"Why do you think these wires are different colors?\"\n   - \"What do you think this equipment does? What has electricity in your home?\"\n   - \"Have you ever wondered why some wires are plastic on the outside and metal on the inside?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** Hold up a flashlight or lamp and ask: \"If I wanted electricity to travel through this wire to light up the bulb, what would need to happen? What do you think the wires carry?\" Allow students to turn and talk with a partner, then share out 3-4 ideas.\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper as an anchor for the lesson. Affirm all responses.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be electrical engineers and discover why materials matter when electricity travels. We'll test different materials and figure out which ones work best for moving electricity safely.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the properties of materials used in circuits and observe what happens when pathways are complete vs. broken.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Simple circuits (pre-assembled by teacher): battery holders with 2 AA batteries, 2-3 feet of wire per student, small LED bulbs with holders, wire strippers (teacher-managed), terminal blocks or wire connectors (optional)\n- Samples of different materials to test: copper wire, aluminum foil, plastic rulers, rubber erasers, wooden pencils, paper clips, index cards\n- Safety goggles (1 per student)\n- Observation sheet (printed, 1 per student) with columns: \"Material,\" \"Color,\" \"Texture,\" \"Does it conduct electricity? (Yes/No)\"\n- Containers or bags to organize materials\n\n**Activity - Part A: Material Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute safety goggles** to all students and ensure they understand: \"These protect your eyes. We keep them on during the exploration.\"\n\n2. **Organize students in pairs.** Assign each pair a \"material station\" with 2-3 test materials.\n\n3. **Model the investigation first:**\n   - Show one piece of material (e.g., copper wire).\n   - Ask: \"What do you notice about this? What does it feel like? What color is it? Is it smooth or bumpy?\"\n   - Record observations on the anchor chart as students watch.\n   - Explain: \"We're looking for clues about what this material is made of and whether electricity can travel through it.\"\n\n4. **Direct students to their stations:**\n   - \"Feel each material. Describe what it looks and feels like.\"\n   - \"Try to bend it or stretch it gently. What happens?\"\n   - \"Write or draw what you observe on your observation sheet.\"\n   - Teacher circulates and asks: \"What makes this material different from that one? Do you think electricity can move through it?\"\n\n5. **Rotate stations** after 5-6 minutes so students test all materials.\n\n**Activity - Part B: Circuit Pathway Investigation (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Bring class together.** Show a pre-assembled circuit: battery holder connected to an LED with wire. \n\n2. **Model a complete circuit:** Connect the wires to the battery. The LED lights up. Ask: \"What happened? Why did the light turn on?\"\n\n3. **Break the circuit:** Pull one wire slightly loose. The light goes out. Ask: \"What changed? Where did the electricity go?\"\n\n4. **Reconnect the circuit:** The light comes back on. Ask: \"Can electricity travel if there's a break in the wire? What do you think happens inside the wires?\"\n\n5. **Give each pair a pre-assembled circuit kit.** Direct them:\n   - \"Make your light turn on by connecting the wires.\"\n   - \"Now, carefully pull one wire loose. What happens?\"\n   - \"Can you reconnect it to make the light come back on?\"\n   - \"Try disconnecting different wires. Does it matter which one you disconnect?\"\n\n6. **Record findings** on observation sheets: \"The light turned on when ___. The light turned off when ___.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and facilitate without solving problems for students.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What happened when you disconnected that wire?\" \"What do you think the electricity needs to do?\"\n- Ensure safety—monitor wire connections and battery placement.\n- Encourage peer teaching: \"Can you show your partner what you discovered?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that materials have different properties (texture, color, bendability).\n- Students observe that a complete wire pathway is needed for electricity to travel and light to work.\n- Students see that breaking the pathway stops the electricity flow and reversing the break restores it.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of how material properties connect to function in circuits.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart from Engage phase\n- Large labeled diagram of a circuit (battery, wires, LED) showing the pathway electricity travels\n- Samples of copper wire, plastic coating, and rubber insulation\n- Chart paper with vocabulary and definitions\n- Hand lenses (optional, for closer inspection)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather class together.** Display the circuit diagram and the photograph side-by-side.\n\n2. **Facilitate a group share-out:**\n   - \"What did you discover about the materials in your exploration?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the outside of the wire is plastic but the inside is metal?\"\n   - \"What happened to the light when you broke the pathway?\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary** (write each on chart paper with illustrations):\n\n   - **Conductor:** A material that lets electricity travel through it easily. Example: The copper or metal wire inside electrical cords.\n   - **Insulator:** A material that does NOT let electricity travel through it. It protects us from electricity. Example: The plastic coating on the outside of wires.\n   - **Circuit:** A pathway that electricity travels through. It must be complete (no breaks) for electricity to flow.\n   - **Pathway:** The route electricity takes from the battery, through the wire, to the light, and back to the battery.\n\n4. **Connect back to observations:**\n   - \"Remember when you tested copper wire? It conducted electricity—that's why it's inside. Remember when you tested plastic? It's an insulator—that's why it covers the wire to keep us safe.\"\n   - \"When you pulled the wire loose, you broke the pathway. Electricity needs a complete loop, like a circle, to keep moving.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding** using thumbs up/down or fist-to-five:\n   - \"Do you think aluminum foil is a conductor or insulator? Show me with your thumbs.\"\n   - \"If I break the wire here, will the light still work? Why?\"\n   - \"Can you point to a conductor in this circuit? An insulator?\"\n\n6. **Revisit student wonderings** from the Engage chart. Answer: \"Now we know why wires have plastic on the outside—it's an insulator that protects us!\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Conductor:** A material (like metal) that electricity can pass through.\n- **Insulator:** A material (like plastic or rubber) that stops electricity and protects us.\n- **Circuit:** The complete loop that electricity travels through.\n- **Pathway:** The route electricity takes when it flows.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that wires contain conductors and insulators for specific purposes.\n- Students can explain why breaking a circuit stops electricity flow.\n- Students use vocabulary terms to describe circuits and materials.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a safe circuit using the correct materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Circuit building kits (battery holders, wires, LEDs, terminal blocks or wire connectors)\n- Index cards (1 per pair)\n- Markers\n- Safety goggles\n- Optional: aluminum foil, paper clips, rubber bands for testing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present a design challenge:**\n   - \"You're an engineer tasked with building a circuit to power a light. But you must choose the RIGHT materials to keep everyone safe. You have a choice of materials. Which will you use for the wires? Why?\"\n\n2. **Distribute cards with material choices:**\n   - Card A: Copper wire with plastic coating\n   - Card B: Bare aluminum foil\n   - Card C: Rubber tubing with metal inside\n   - Card D: Paper wrapped around a pencil\n\n3. **Prompt student thinking:**\n   - \"Which material conducts electricity? Which insulates? Which combination keeps us safe?\"\n   - \"Draw or write your choice and explain why.\"\n\n4. **Allow pairs to build a working circuit** using the correct material (copper wire with plastic coating). Encourage them to:\n   - Explain to a partner WHY they chose this material.\n   - Try to light up the LED by completing the pathway.\n   - Predict what will happen if they use the wrong material.\n\n5. **Optional extension:** Challenge students to build a circuit with TWO light bulbs in series (one after the other). Ask: \"Does the pathway change? What happens if you disconnect one bulb?\"\n\n6. **Share findings:**\n   - Invite 2-3 pairs to show their circuits and explain their material choices.\n   - Ask: \"Why is the plastic coating important for safety?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without directing—let students make choices and test them.\n- Ask: \"What properties of this material make it a good choice?\" and \"How do you know electricity is flowing?\"\n- Challenge advanced students: \"Could you use two wires instead of one? What would happen?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply knowledge of conductors and insulators to make safe design choices.\n- Students recognize that material properties directly affect function.\n- Students explain their thinking using vocabulary from the Explain phase.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of material properties, circuits, and electrical pathways.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n- Observe student investigations during Explore: Can they identify and compare material properties? Do they predict what will happen when the circuit pathway changes?\n- Listen to explanations during Explore: Do they use words like \"conductor,\" \"insulator,\" and \"pathway\"?\n- Check observation sheets: Are descriptions of materials accurate? Do drawings show a complete circuit?\n- During Elaborate: Can students justify their material choices based on properties?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nDistribute an exit ticket with these prompts (read aloud for second graders; they may draw or dictate responses):\n\n1. **Draw a wire.** Label the outside part and the inside part. What is each part made of?\n2. **Circle the material that lets electricity travel through it:**\n   - Plastic     Copper     Rubber\n3. **Draw what happens to the light when you break the wire pathway.** Explain why.\n4. **Why is the plastic coating on a wire important?**\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students accurately identify that wires contain both conductors (metal) and insulators (plastic).\n- Students select copper as a conductor and understand it carries electricity.\n- Students draw and explain that a broken pathway stops electricity flow.\n- Students explain that plastic insulation keeps people safe from electricity.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify conductors and insulators.\n- 80% of students explain that a complete pathway is needed for electricity to flow.\n- 75% of students justify material choices based on observable properties and safety.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that disassembling and reassembling the circuit is reversible.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary** during a small group session before Engage. Use hands-on objects: copper wire, plastic covering, rubber eraser. Let students feel and compare before the lesson.\n\n2. **Provide sentence frames** during Explore and Elaborate:\n   - \"This material is ___. It feels ___.\"\n   - \"The light turned on when ___ and off when ___.\"\n   - \"I chose this material because it is a ___.\"\n\n3. **Use simplified observation sheets** with pictures to point to instead of writing. Offer a word bank: conductor, insulator, light, pathway, complete, broken.\n\n4. **Pair with a stronger peer** during circuit building so they can observe how wires connect and help guide the process.\n\n**Challenge (Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Expand the circuit design challenge:** Ask students to design a circuit with two LEDs in series and predict what happens to brightness. Can they draw a diagram showing the pathway electricity takes?\n\n2. **Test additional materials:** Provide pencil lead, foil, steel wool, and salt water. Ask: \"Which of these materials are conductors? Can you rank them from best to worst conductor?\"\n\n3. **Design a safety poster:** Ask students to create a labeled diagram explaining why circuit wires are designed the way they are—why do we need both conductors AND insulators?\n\n4. **Investigate reversibility:** Challenge them to explore: \"When you disconnect and reconnect a wire, can you always make the light come back on? Is this change reversible?\" (This connects to 2-PS1-3 and 2-PS1-4.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Circuit Safety Scavenger Hunt:** Have students explore the classroom and identify items that use circuits (flashlights, computers, interactive whiteboard). For each item, they sketch the pathway electricity takes and label conductors and insulators they can see. Discuss: \"Why is each part important?\"\n\n2. **Design a Circuit Pathway Game:** Create large floor circuits using tape (pathways) and students move along them to understand how electricity travels. Students work in small groups to create different pathways and predict which ones allow \"electricity\" (a ball or beanbag) to travel through.\n\n3. **Material Property Investigation Journal:** Over one week, have students collect pictures or draw materials they find at home that are insulators (rubber, plastic, wood) and conductors (metals, foil). Create a class chart organizing materials by properties. This reinforces 2-PS1-1 and 2-PS1-2.\n\n---",
