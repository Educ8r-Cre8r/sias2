Observe and describe how light helps us see objects clearly.\n2. Explain that objects in darkness are hard to see, and objects in light are easy to see.\n3. Investigate how different materials block or let light through in different ways.\n4. Predict and observe how objects of different sizes make shadows of different sizes.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about light, darkness, and shadows using the ship photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the cargo ship\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: flashlight (for brief demonstration)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a smartboard or large printed copy where all students can see it clearly. Show it for 30 seconds without speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause after each to allow think-pair-share):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me the colors you notice.\"\n   - \"Why do you think the bottom of the ship looks so dark and the water looks so light? What makes one darker than the other?\"\n   - \"If it were nighttime and there were no sun, would you still be able to see this big ship? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"Do you see any dark areas below the ship? What do you think those dark areas are?\"\n\n3. **Record student responses** on chart paper. Accept all answers without correction at this stage.\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we blocked the light from a flashlight with different things. Would they all make the same dark shadow? Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to be light detectives. We'll do experiments to learn how light helps us see things, and what happens when we block the light.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how light creates visibility and how different materials interact with light.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Flashlights (one per pair of students, or enough for whole-group if preferred)\n- Variety of objects: clear plastic cup, white paper, black construction paper, aluminum foil, translucent plastic bag, wooden block\n- White wall or white poster board (for shadow projection)\n- Dark area of classroom (or create one with a large box or curtain)\n- Chart paper with two columns labeled \"You Can See Light Through It\" and \"Light Stops at It\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Light and Visibility (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up a dark area** by closing blinds or using a large appliance box. Have students gather in this semi-dark space.\n\n2. **Turn on a flashlight** and shine it on the white poster board. Ask: \"Can you see where the light is? Why can you see it?\" (Because light is there.)\n\n3. **Shine the flashlight on different objects** (a book, a toy, a piece of paper). Ask: \"Can you see this object? Why?\"\n\n4. **Turn off the flashlight.** Ask: \"Can you see the object now? Why is it so hard to see?\" Guide them to understand: *Light helps us see things.*\n\n5. **Turn the light back on.** Celebrate with students: \"There it is again! Light makes it easy to see!\"\n\n**Part 2: Materials and Light (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Pair up students.** Give each pair a flashlight and two objects: one clear (plastic cup) and one opaque (wooden block).\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Shine your flashlight behind the clear cup. Can you see the light through it? Write what you see—or draw it.\"\n   - \"Now shine your flashlight behind the wooden block. Can you see the light through it? What happens?\"\n   - \"Move around the room and test other objects the same way. Which ones let light through? Which ones stop the light?\"\n\n3. **As students explore,** they place objects in one of two categories on the chart paper.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What happens when light hits that material? Can you see through it?\"\n- Do not tell students the answers; allow them to discover through observation.\n- Take photos of student shadows or document observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that light is necessary to see objects.\n- Students discover that some materials are transparent/translucent (light passes through) and some are opaque (light does not pass through).\n- Students begin to notice that objects block light and create shadows.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize learning with vocabulary and connect observations to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Explore (categorized objects)\n- Photograph of ship (displayed again)\n- Picture cards or real objects for vocabulary introduction\n- Index cards with vocabulary words (prepared ahead)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs: \"Which objects let light through? Which ones stopped the light?\"\n   - Record their observations on a new, neat chart titled \"What We Learned About Light.\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (7 minutes)** using the objects from the activity and the photograph:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Light:** Energy that lets us see things. (Point to the flashlight and the sunlight in the photograph.)\n   - **Shadow:** A dark area made when something blocks light. (Show shadows in the photograph—under the ship's structures.)\n   - **Transparent:** You can see through it because light passes through. (Hold up clear plastic cup.)\n   - **Opaque:** You cannot see through it because it stops light. (Hold up wooden block. Point to the black hull of the ship—it's opaque.)\n   - **Illuminate:** To light something up so you can see it. (Point to how the sun illuminates the ship in the photo.)\n\n3. **Connect to photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at this big ship again. Why can we see it so clearly?\"\n   - \"What parts of the ship make dark shadows?\"\n   - \"The sun is illuminating this ship. The dark bottom part of the ship is opaque—it blocks the light and makes a shadow on the water!\"\n   - \"At night, without the sun's light, would you be able to see this ship in the dark ocean?\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - **Quick thumbs-up/sideways/down:** \"Thumbs up if you can see through clear plastic. Thumbs sideways if you're not sure. Thumbs down if you cannot.\"\n   - **Repeat with:** \"Can light pass through wood?\" (thumbs down)\n   - **Point to shadows in the photograph:** \"Is that a shadow? How do you know?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use new vocabulary to describe observations.\n- Students understand that light is necessary for vision.\n- Students recognize shadows as evidence of light being blocked.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply light concepts to a new, engaging scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Shadow puppet theatre (a white sheet or poster board in front of a light source)\n- Cutout ship shapes (pre-made or student-drawn and cut)\n- Flashlight or lamp\n- White wall or white poster board\n- Optional: colored tissue paper, translucent materials\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up a shadow puppet theatre** by hanging a white sheet with a light source (lamp or flashlight) behind it, or by taping white poster board to a wall with a flashlight positioned to cast shadows.\n\n2. **Show students how shadows work** by placing a ship cutout in front of the light:\n   - \"Watch what happens when I put this ship between the light and the white screen.\"\n   - The ship's shadow appears on the white surface.\n   - \"The light can't go through the ship, so it makes a dark shadow!\"\n\n3. **Student activity:**\n   - Students take turns placing different sized objects between the light and the white surface.\n   - They observe: \"Does a big object make a big shadow? Does a small object make a small shadow?\"\n   - They predict before placing the object: \"What size shadow do you think this will make?\"\n   - They record with drawings: \"Draw the object and its shadow.\"\n\n4. **Challenge (if time/interest allows):**\n   - Hold objects at different distances from the light: \"What happens to the shadow when I move it closer to the light? Farther away?\"\n   - Introduce colored tissue paper in front of objects: \"What happens to the shadow when we put colored plastic in front of the light?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What's happening to the shadow? Why?\"\n- Encourage predictions and comparisons.\n- Validate all observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding of light, shadows, and blocking light to a new context.\n- Students make predictions about shadows and test them.\n- Students understand that objects of different sizes make different sized shadows.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light, darkness, and shadows.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Were students able to identify transparent vs. opaque materials? Did they use the term \"shadow\"?\n- **Thumbs-up/sideways/down checks:** During Explain phase, gauge understanding in real time.\n- **Questioning during Elaborate:** Listen to student predictions and explanations. Do they reference light and shadows?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (provide at end of session or next day):**\n\n**Option 1 (Verbal, for whole group or individuals):**\n1. \"I'm going to show you a picture of something in a dark room. Can you see it? Why not? What would help us see it?\" (Expecting: \"We need light!\")\n2. \"This ship is black and the water is light blue. Why does the ship look darker?\" (Expecting: \"The black stops/blocks the light\" or \"It makes a shadow\")\n3. \"I have a clear water bottle and a wooden block. If I shine a flashlight behind them, which one will let light through?\" (Have student predict and then test.)\n\n**Option 2 (Drawing-based, for all students):**\n- Provide a simple outline drawing of a ship and water.\n- Ask: \"Draw where shadows would be on this ship. Why did you put shadows there?\"\n- **Success criteria:** Student shadows are in logical places (under structures, on water) and student can explain that light is blocked.\n\n**Option 3 (Three-part check, for all students):**\n1. Hold up a clear cup and opaque block. Ask: \"Which one lets light through?\" (Student points or identifies.)\n2. Point to the ship photo. Ask: \"Show me a shadow.\" (Student points to dark areas.)\n3. Ask: \"Can you see in the dark without any light?\" (Student answers \"no\" and can explain.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly identify that light is necessary for vision.\n- Students describe shadows as dark areas caused by objects blocking light.\n- Students distinguish between materials that allow light through and those that don't.\n- Students apply concepts to the photograph (recognizing shadows on the ship).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus only on \"light,\" \"shadow,\" and \"see.\" Introduce other terms later.\n2. **Simplified Explore:** Pre-select only 3 objects (one clear, one opaque, one translucent). Have the teacher shine the flashlight while students observe and point to where light goes through.\n3. **Hands-on guidance:** Pair struggling learners with a peer or aide who can assist with flashlight handling and observations. Provide a recorded checklist: \"Can you see light through it? Yes / No\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n1. **Shadow size investigation:** Ask students to predict and test: \"If I move the object closer to the light, what happens to the shadow? Farther away?\" Students record findings with labeled drawings.\n2. **Color and light exploration:** Provide colored tissue paper or cellophane. Ask: \"What happens to the shadow when we put red plastic in front of the light? Blue?\" Students make predictions and test.\n3. **Create a shadow story:** Students create a shadow puppet play using the theatre, narrate what's happening with light and shadows, and explain to a peer why shadows appear and disappear.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Shadow Walk (Outdoor observation):**\n   - Take students outside on a sunny day.\n   - Have them find shadows (their own, trees, buildings, playground equipment).\n   - Ask: \"Where is the light coming from? Why is that area dark?\"\n   - Students draw or photograph shadows and label them during recess.\n   - **At-home connection:** Ask families to look for shadows at home and photograph one to bring back to school.\n\n2. **Glow-in-the-Dark Investigation:**\n   - Introduce glow-stick bracelets or glow-in-the-dark paint on objects.\n   - In a dark space, observe that these objects emit their own light.\n   - Ask: \"Does this glow stick need sunlight to make light? What kind of light does it make?\"\n   - **Concept extension:** Some things create their own light (like the glow stick or a flashlight); some things only reflect light (like the ship, which reflects sunlight).\n\n3. **Shadow Puppet Story Theater (take-home activity):**\n   - Provide a simple shadow puppet theatre template (sheet of paper, flashlight instructions, paper cutout shapes).\n   - Students create a story using shadows and present it to family.\n   - **Reflection prompt:** \"Tell someone at home why shadows appear and disappear. Can you make a shadow without light?\"\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Safety reminder:** Brief students on flashlight use—flashlights should point down or to the side, never at faces or eyes.\n- **Timing flexibility:** The Explore and Elaborate phases can be condensed if you split this into a two-day lesson. Day 1 focuses on Engage, Explore, and Explain. Day 2 reviews concepts and does Elaborate and Evaluate.\n- **Inclusive considerations:** Provide tactile opportunities (feeling opaque vs. translucent materials) for students with visual processing differences. Pair peer support during hands-on activities.\n- **Connection to real world:** Emphasize that sailors and ship crews need light (sunlight, lighthouses, ship lights) to navigate and see. This builds empathy and relevance to the photograph.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson leverages the striking cargo ship photograph to ground abstract concepts of light and shadow in a concrete, observable example. First graders will move from curiosity about why the ship looks the way it does to understanding the physical science principles of light, visibility, and opacity. The progression from darkness to illumination mirrors their discovery process and keeps engagement high throughout all five phases.",
