Describe how environmental conditions (water, air, time) cause visible changes in the properties of metal objects.\n2. Explain that rust forms when metal objects interact with oxygen and water, releasing energy that changes the material.\n3. Predict how long it takes for rust to form on metal objects based on observations from the photograph.\n4. Design an experiment to observe how different conditions affect the rusting process.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by observing the photograph and wondering about what caused the changes they see.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of rusty nails, bolts, and weathered wood (projected on screen or printed copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the screen or distribute printed copies to small groups. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Pose an intriguing question:** \"Look carefully at these objects. What do you notice has changed about them? Why do you think they look this way?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate a brief whole-class discussion** using these guiding questions:\n   - \"What colors do you see on the metal objects? Have you ever seen objects that looked like this?\" (Answer: brownish, orange, rough texture—rust)\n   - \"Where might these rusty objects have been? What could have caused them to change?\" (Answer: outside, exposed to rain, water, air)\n   - \"If I told you that rust is energy being released, what do you think that means?\" (Answer: something is happening to the metal that changes it)\n   - \"How long do you think it took for these objects to get this rusty?\" (Accept all predictions without judgment)\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we buried a brand-new nail in wet soil versus a dry paper towel. Which one would rust faster? Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"To find out how rust forms and why it happens, we're going to become material detectives and create our own rusty objects to observe.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how different environmental conditions affect the rusting process by setting up controlled observations.\n\n**Materials per student pair:**\n- 4 clear glass jars or plastic containers (labeled A, B, C, D)\n- 4 clean steel nails or steel wool pads (same size for each pair)\n- Tap water\n- Dry soil or sand\n- Wet soil (pre-moistened)\n- Paper towels\n- Oil (cooking oil or mineral oil)\n- Masking tape and permanent markers for labeling\n- Observation sheet (template provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Obtain your four labeled containers (A, B, C, D). Each container will test a different condition to see how fast rust forms.\"\n\n2. \"Place one clean nail in each container according to these conditions:\n   - **Container A (Control):** Nail + dry soil (no water)\n   - **Container B (Water):** Nail + wet soil (add water until damp)\n   - **Container C (Oil):** Nail + paper towel + oil coating (coat the nail lightly with oil)\n   - **Container D (Air):** Nail on dry paper towel (exposed to air only)\"\n\n3. \"Draw a picture of what each nail looks like RIGHT NOW in your observation sheet. Use words like 'shiny,' 'silver,' 'smooth.'\"\n\n4. \"Place all four containers in the same location (a sunny windowsill is ideal) so that temperature stays the same.\"\n\n5. \"Tomorrow and for the next 3-4 days, observe each nail for 2-3 minutes each day. Record:\n   - Color changes (any orange, brown, or red spots?)\n   - Texture changes (still smooth or getting bumpy?)\n   - Which nail rusts first? Which rusts slowest?\"\n\n**How the activity connects to the photograph:**\nThe photograph shows nails and metal objects at different stages of rust formation. By creating our own rusty objects, students see the process unfold rather than just observing the end result.\n\n**What students should record or document:**\n- Daily drawings showing color and texture changes\n- Written observations using descriptive words\n- A prediction: \"Which condition made rust form fastest? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to check that nails are properly placed in containers\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice about Container B compared to Container A?\" Do NOT say \"Water causes rust\"—let students discover this.\n- Ensure daily observation happens at the same time\n- Prompt students to use magnifying glasses if available to notice fine details\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents will observe that:\n- Container B (wet soil) shows rust fastest\n- Container C (oil-coated) shows rust slowest\n- Container A (dry soil) shows slower rust than B\n- Container D (air only) shows moderate rusting\n- This evidence will support the idea that water + oxygen = faster energy transfer and rust formation\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to energy transfer concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary displayed\n- Photograph from Engage phase\n- Students' observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Whiteboard or doc camera to show close-up of a nail\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Let's share what we discovered. What did your nails look like each day?\"\n   - Create a class data chart on paper: \"Container A (Dry Soil) | Container B (Wet Soil) | Container C (Oil) | Container D (Air)\" with checkmarks showing which rusted fastest\n   - Guide students to notice a pattern: \"Which containers had water AND oxygen? Those rusted fastest!\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - **Rust:** A reddish-brown coating that forms when a metal like iron reacts with oxygen and water\n   - **Oxidation:** The chemical process where a metal combines with oxygen, releasing energy that changes the metal\n   - **Energy transfer:** When energy moves from one place to another (in this case, chemical energy is released when rust forms, causing visible changes)\n   - **Corrosion:** The gradual breaking down or eating away of a material due to chemical reactions\n   - **Conditions:** The environment around an object (wet, dry, hot, cold, exposed to air)\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph and Explore activity (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the rusty nails in the original photograph: \"These nails were left outside where water, air, and time all worked together. This is oxidation happening in the real world.\"\n   - Compare: \"In our experiment, the nails in Container B with wet soil oxidized fastest because they had the most water and oxygen together. The nails in Container C with oil oxidized slowly because oil blocked the oxygen. This proves that rust needs BOTH water AND oxygen.\"\n   - Emphasize energy: \"When rust forms, chemical energy is being released. That energy causes the metal to change color and texture. The metal is transforming!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Why did the nail in Container A (dry soil) NOT rust as fast as Container B (wet soil)?\" \n   - Wait for response. Expected answer: \"It didn't have water\" or \"It was dry\"\n   - Affirm: \"Exactly! Rust needs water to form quickly.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Rust** | A reddish-brown coating that forms when iron or steel meets water and air |\n| **Oxidation** | A chemical reaction where metal combines with oxygen; energy is released and the metal changes |\n| **Energy transfer** | When energy moves or is released and causes something to change |\n| **Corrosion** | The slow breaking down or damage of a material due to chemical reactions with its environment |\n| **Conditions** | The environment around something (like wet, dry, sunny, cold) that affects how it changes |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain that rust is caused by a chemical reaction between metal, water, and oxygen\n- Students understand that this reaction releases energy, which is why visible changes occur\n- Students can predict that objects with more water and oxygen exposure will rust faster\n- Students can identify rusty objects in the real world and explain WHY they rusted\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of rust and corrosion to a new real-world context and make predictions about preventing rust.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photos or images of real-world rusty objects: old cars, bridges, playground equipment, ship hulls, nails in old buildings (or bring in a small rusted object from school maintenance)\n- Drawing paper and colored pencils\n- Chart paper: \"How Can We STOP Rust?\"\n- Index cards with rust prevention methods (laminated or on paper)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option 1: \"Rust Detective Challenge\" (Real-World Application)**\n\n1. \"I'm showing you pictures of rusty objects from the real world. Look at a playground slide, an old car, a bridge.\"\n\n2. \"For each object, discuss with your partner: 'Why do you think this object got rusty? Where was it? Was it exposed to water and air?'\"\n\n3. \"Now, here's the challenge: How could we PREVENT this object from rusting in the future?\"\n\n4. \"Students brainstorm and record ideas on sticky notes:\n   - Painting it (covers the metal so oxygen can't reach it)\n   - Using plastic instead of metal\n   - Coating it with oil (like we did in Container C!)\n   - Keeping it dry (like Container A)\n   - Using special rust-resistant metal (stainless steel)\"\n\n5. Display ideas on chart paper titled \"How to Stop Rust.\"\n\n6. \"Draw a picture of ONE way to prevent rust on a real object. Write a sentence: 'This object won't rust because...'\"\n\n**Option 2: \"Design a Rust Preventer\" (Engineering Connection)**\n\n1. \"Your challenge: Design something that will keep a nail from rusting. You can use oil, plastic wrap, paint, aluminum foil, or a coating.\"\n\n2. \"Take a clean nail and apply your rust preventer. Predict: 'Will this work better than oil alone?'\"\n\n3. \"Add it to the window with the original containers to compare over the next week.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Validate all brainstorms—this is about applying thinking, not finding \"the right answer\"\n- Guide students to recognize that the BEST prevention blocks either water or oxygen (or both)\n- Encourage drawings and annotations\n- Photograph student designs for documentation\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply rust knowledge to novel situations (real-world objects)\n- Students predict multiple ways to prevent corrosion\n- Students show deeper understanding by explaining WHY their prevention method works (e.g., \"Paint blocks oxygen,\" \"Oil keeps water away\")\n- Students recognize that preventing rust is important for keeping objects safe and useful\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rust formation, energy transfer, and how conditions affect corrosion.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Are students recording daily observations carefully? Can they describe changes using vocabulary?\n- **Listen to explanations in Explain phase:** Can students articulate why Container B rusted fastest?\n- **Check predictions in Elaborate:** Do student drawings show understanding of rust prevention principles?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with an index card. Read aloud; students write or draw answers:\n\n1. **\"Why did the nail in the wet soil rust faster than the nail in the dry soil?\"**\n   - Expected answer: \"Because it had water and oxygen together\" or \"Water helps rust form\"\n\n2. **\"Look at this picture of a rusty chain on a playground [show image]. How could we stop it from rusting?\"**\n   - Expected answer: Should mention one of: paint it, coat it with oil, keep it dry, use different metal\n\n3. **\"If rust is energy being released, what changes do you see when energy is released?\"**\n   - Expected answer: Color change, texture change, the metal breaks down, becomes rough\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student identifies that water causes rust or can name one prevention method  \n✓ **Proficient:** Student explains that water + oxygen cause rust and suggests a logical prevention method  \n✓ **Advanced:** Student explains oxidation using energy transfer language and predicts how multiple conditions would affect rusting speed\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n- **Objective 1 (Describe changes):** Check observation sheets—do they show detailed daily descriptions?\n- **Objective 2 (Explain rust as energy transfer):** Exit ticket #3—do they connect visible changes to energy?\n- **Objective 3 (Predict rusting speed):** Check initial prediction and whether observations matched—did they revise their thinking?\n- **Objective 4 (Design experiment):** Do Elaborate drawings show logical rust-prevention thinking?\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n**Support (Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified observation sheet:** Provide a template with picture boxes and word banks (\"shiny,\" \"orange,\" \"bumpy,\" \"smooth\") so students can check or circle rather than write freely\n\n2. **Peer partnerships:** Pair with strong observers; assign one student to draw, one to record words—both participate fully\n\n3. **Scaffold the vocabulary:** Introduce only **rust** and **oxidation** in depth; keep others on a posted word wall with pictures; use consistent language throughout the lesson\n\n**Challenge (Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Quantify the corrosion:** Provide a ruler or calipers; have students measure rust thickness on each nail and create a graph showing \"Rate of Rust Formation\" (mm per day)\n\n2. **Test additional variables:** Have students design a fifth condition: \"What if we used salt water instead of fresh water?\" or \"What if we kept one container in the freezer?\" Record predictions and results\n\n3. **Research real-world applications:** Have students investigate how engineers prevent rust on ships, bridges, or cars; present findings to the class\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rust Prevention Poster Campaign:** Students create colorful posters for the school explaining \"How to Protect Our Playground Equipment from Rust\" (using classroom observations). Display in hallways.\n\n2. **Time-Lapse Photography Project:** If equipment is available, have students photograph their nail containers every day for 2 weeks and create a time-lapse video showing rust progression—adds visual evidence of energy transfer over time\n\n3. **Home Investigation:** Send nails in labeled containers home with families; ask them to place one in a window, one in a sink with water, one in a freezer, etc. Students report back on unexpected conditions they tested and how they affected rusting (real-world inquiry extension)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety reminder:** Rusty nails can have sharp edges. Ensure students handle with care and wash hands after activities.\n- **Timing:** Visible rust typically appears within 2-3 days in wet conditions. Plan the lesson so Explore observations span at least 4-5 days.\n- **Photograph student work:** Document daily nail observations to create a visual display showing the progression of rust—this becomes evidence for whole-class learning.\n- **Real-world connection:** Bring in or show photos of corroded objects from the school (rusty gate, old equipment) to make learning tangible.\n- **Connection to NGSS:** This lesson emphasizes **4-PS3-2** (energy transfer via oxidation—a chemical process) and **4-PS3-3** (predicting outcomes of material interaction). The rust forming IS energy being transferred at the material level.",
