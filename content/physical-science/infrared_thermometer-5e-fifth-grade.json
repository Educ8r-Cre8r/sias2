ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about heat and energy by observing a real tool and making predictions about temperature differences.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of infrared thermometer (printed or displayed on board/screen)\n- Optional: actual infrared or digital thermometer to pass around (if available)\n- Real classroom objects: brick or tile piece, white paper, black paper, metal spoon\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Hold it visible for at least 30 seconds without explanation.\n\n2. **Ask these focus questions** (pause for student responses after each):\n   - *What do you see in this picture? What is the person holding?*\n   - *Look at the number on the screen: 113.5. What do you think that number means? Could it be temperature?*\n   - *Why would someone want to measure how hot something is? Where have you felt heat in your own life?*\n   - *Look at the background—those are bricks in sunlight. Do you think all parts of the brick are the same temperature, or could some parts be hotter than others?*\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would be hotter if we measured it right now—a dark brick in the sun or the white mortar between the bricks?\"\n\n4. **Invitation to predict:** \"Today, we're going to become heat detectives. Before we investigate, turn to a partner and predict: Which material would be hotter—something dark or something light colored?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's find out if your predictions were right by doing our own heat-measuring investigation!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover that different materials absorb different amounts of heat energy from the sun (or a lamp).\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- One thermometer (analog or digital classroom thermometer—traditional will work; infrared is ideal but not required)\n- Chart paper or worksheet with columns labeled \"Material,\" \"Starting Temperature,\" \"After 10 minutes,\" \"Temperature Change\"\n- 4-5 test materials: dark construction paper, white construction paper, aluminum foil, dark cloth/fabric, light-colored plastic\n- One heat source per group:\n  - Option A (best): Sunny windowsill outdoors or indoors\n  - Option B (alternative): Desk lamp with incandescent bulb (not LED) positioned 6 inches above materials for 10 minutes\n- Small objects to hold thermometer in place (small stands, books, or tape if needed)\n- **Safety: Adult supervision near heat source**\n\n**Activity—Student Directions (Display on board in steps):**\n\n1. \"Place each material flat on a table in your investigation area. If using a lamp, position it 6 inches directly above the materials.\"\n\n2. \"Before turning on the lamp (or moving to sunlight), measure the temperature of the air near your materials. Record this number in your chart as the 'Starting Temperature.' This is your control.\"\n\n3. \"Now, place the thermometer bulb/sensor directly on the surface of **one material.** Wait 30 seconds for the thermometer to settle. Record the temperature.\"\n\n4. \"Repeat Step 3 for each of your other materials. Record all temperatures.\"\n\n5. \"Now, expose all materials to the heat source (sunlight or lamp) for exactly **10 minutes.** Keep track of time!\"\n\n6. \"After 10 minutes, quickly measure the temperature of each material again and record it.\"\n\n7. \"In the 'Temperature Change' column, subtract the starting temperature from the final temperature to see which material absorbed the most heat. (Provide example: 85°F − 75°F = 10°F temperature change)\"\n\n8. \"Look at your results. Which material got the hottest? Which stayed the coolest? Why do you think that happened?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group; ask clarifying questions: *\"What did you notice? Which material changed temperature the most? Why do you think dark colors absorbed more heat?\"*\n- Do **not** give answers—guide thinking: *\"Look at your measurements. What is the evidence telling you?\"*\n- Ensure students wait the full 10 minutes; use a timer and remind groups when time is up.\n- Check thermometer readings for accuracy; guide proper measurement technique.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students record temperature data for at least 4 materials.\n- Students notice that dark materials (dark paper, dark cloth) absorbed more heat and showed larger temperature changes than light materials.\n- Students may observe that shiny materials (foil) reflected heat and stayed cooler.\n- Students generate observations about why: \"Dark things get hotter because they absorb more light/energy.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize student discoveries with vocabulary and connect findings to energy concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed vocabulary cards or poster board\n- Student data charts from Explore phase\n- Photograph of infrared thermometer displayed again\n- Optional: simple diagram showing sun → energy → heat\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their data: *\"Which material was the hottest? How much did its temperature change?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"Did we all get the same results? If not, why might our measurements be slightly different?\"* (Introduce idea of measurement variation as normal.)\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes)** using Fifth Grade-friendly language:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Energy** | The power to make things move or change. It can come in different forms—like light from the sun, heat that makes things warm, or movement. |\n| **Heat** | The energy that makes something hot or warm. Heat always moves from hotter things to cooler things. |\n| **Temperature** | A measurement of how hot or cold something is, measured in degrees. |\n| **Absorb** | To take in or soak up. Dark materials absorb more light energy and turn it into heat. |\n| **Thermal energy** | The energy that makes particles in matter move faster. When something is hot, its particles are wiggling and jiggling very fast. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph and findings (4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the thermometer photo: *\"This tool measures thermal energy—how much heat is in materials. The number 113.5°F means that brick had a lot of thermal energy stored in it.\"*\n   - Point to the bricks in the photo: *\"Notice the dark bricks and light mortar between them? Based on our experiment, which do you think would read a higher temperature on this thermometer?\"*\n   - *\"Energy from the sun traveled to Earth and was absorbed by these bricks. The dark bricks absorbed more of that solar energy than the light mortar. That's why they got hotter!\"*\n\n4. **Check for understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: *\"If I put a dark cloth and a white cloth in the sun for 15 minutes, which will get hotter? Tell me why using the word 'absorb.'\"*\n   - Listen for responses using key vocabulary: \"Dark absorbs more energy...\" or \"Dark things take in more heat from the sun...\"\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (Display prominently):**\n- **Energy** = Power to make change\n- **Heat** = Energy that makes things warm\n- **Temperature** = How hot/cold something is (measured)\n- **Absorb** = To take in (dark materials absorb more light)\n- **Thermal energy** = Heat energy in matter\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use words like \"energy,\" \"heat,\" \"absorb,\" and \"temperature\" when describing their findings.\n- Students connect the thermometer in the photo to their own measurement activity.\n- Students articulate that dark materials absorb more solar energy and become hotter than light materials.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Deepen understanding by applying heat-absorption knowledge to a new scenario and exploring real-world implications.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real objects (if possible): dark shirt and white shirt, dark car toy and white car toy, or printed pictures\n- Thermometers (digital or traditional)\n- Optional: shoes, backpacks, or other items students wear in different colors\n- Chart paper for \"Heat Detective Summary\"\n\n**Activity—Choose one option based on materials available:**\n\n**Option A: Clothing and Heat (Recommended if materials available)**\n\n1. Present scenario: *\"Imagine it's summer and you're playing outside in the hot sun. Would it be better to wear a dark-colored shirt or a white-colored shirt to stay cooler?\"*\n\n2. Hypothesis: Have students predict and explain why.\n\n3. Investigation: If possible, place a dark shirt and white shirt in direct sunlight for 5-10 minutes, then use thermometers to measure the temperature of each. Record findings.\n\n4. Application discussion:\n   - *\"Why do people in hot desert countries often wear light-colored, loose clothing?\"*\n   - *\"Why do cars parked in the sun get so hot inside?\"*\n   - *\"How does this connect to our brick investigation?\"*\n\n5. Synthesis: Create a \"Heat Detectives' Guide to Staying Cool\" on chart paper listing real-world applications.\n\n**Option B: Comparison Challenge (Alternative)**\n\n1. Present scenario: *\"We need to keep food cool on a picnic. We have two coolers—one painted dark blue, one painted white. Which should we use? Why?\"*\n\n2. Have students apply their knowledge from the Explore phase to make an evidence-based recommendation.\n\n3. Discuss how solar energy absorption affects real-world choices (clothing, vehicles, buildings).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask probing questions: *\"How is this situation like our material experiment?\"*\n- Encourage students to use evidence: *\"What did we measure that helps you answer this?\"*\n- Record student thinking on chart paper to validate their reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students transfer their understanding to a new context (not just the lab materials).\n- Students explain reasoning using terms like \"absorbs,\" \"heat,\" and \"energy.\"\n- Students make real-world connections to daily life.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of heat energy, measurement, and material properties through multiple formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n\n- **Observation during Explore phase:** Do students measure correctly and record data? Do they notice patterns in their results?\n- **Listen-in during discussions:** Are students using vocabulary correctly? Can they explain what they observed?\n- **Question prompts during Explain:** Can students answer \"Which material got hotter? Why?\" with evidence?\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (End of Lesson, 5-10 minutes):**\n\n**Provide students with this written/verbal exit ticket (read aloud once; students write or respond verbally):**\n\n1. **\"Look at this picture of two buckets in the sun—one dark and one light. Draw an arrow pointing to the bucket that will get hotter. Explain why in 2-3 sentences using the words 'absorb,' 'heat,' or 'energy.'\"** (Image can be simple sketch or printed photo.)\n\n2. **\"What does a thermometer measure? Circle the best answer:**\n   - a) How much a material weighs\n   - b) How hot or cold something is (temperature)\n   - c) What color an object is\n\n3. **\"The sun's energy travels to Earth. What happens to that energy when it hits a dark material? Draw or write what you think.\"**\n\n4. **Bonus challenge (for advanced learners): \"Why do you think the person in the photo is using an infrared thermometer on the brick wall? What could they be trying to find out?\"**\n\n**Success Criteria (How to determine if students met objectives):**\n\n✓ **Learning Objective 1** (Measure and record temperature): Student thermometer readings are present on chart; data is organized and legible.\n\n✓ **Learning Objective 2** (Explain heat as energy from sun): Student can articulate that heat energy comes from the sun and is absorbed by materials (uses these words in exit ticket or verbal response).\n\n✓ **Learning Objective 3** (Compare materials' heat absorption): Student identifies that dark materials absorbed more heat; provides a temperature difference or comparative statement (\"The dark paper was hotter by ___°F\").\n\n✓ **Learning Objective 4** (Use evidence to support claims): Student references specific data from their experiment when making predictions or explanations; writes or says, \"Our data showed...\" or \"We measured...\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show accurate understanding of temperature measurement.\n- Students correctly predict that dark objects absorb more heat.\n- Students use at least 2 science vocabulary terms correctly in written or verbal responses.\n- Data from Explore phase is organized and supports conclusions.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-measurement vocabulary review:** Before Explore phase, review thermometer parts and how to read digital vs. analog displays. Model measuring once with the group.\n\n2. **Simplified data recording:** Provide a pre-made chart with materials listed and spaces only for three numbers: \"Starting Temp,\" \"After Heat,\" \"How Much It Changed.\" Show an example with numbers filled in.\n\n3. **Partner pairing during Explore:** Pair with a stronger reader/measurer. Assign roles: one student places the thermometer, the other records data and keeps time.\n\n4. **Vocabulary cards during Explain:** Provide printed vocabulary cards with pictures (e.g., a sun for \"energy,\" a thermometer for \"temperature\"). Students can point to cards while speaking.\n\n5. **Exit ticket modification:** Offer multiple-choice options instead of open-ended writing. Allow verbal response instead of written.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended measurement protocol:** Have students measure temperature at multiple time intervals (0, 5, 10, 15 minutes) and create a **line graph** showing temperature change over time. Discuss: *\"Why does the temperature rise faster at first?\"*\n\n2. **Variable investigation:** Challenge students to test a new variable, e.g., *\"Does the thickness of a material affect how much heat it absorbs?\"* or *\"Does proximity to the heat source matter?\"* Students design a mini-experiment with a control.\n\n3. **Real-world research:** Ask students to research and present: *\"Why do scientists use infrared thermometers instead of regular thermometers? When would each be better?\"* (Infrared can measure without touching; useful for very hot or very cold objects; measures radiating heat.)\n\n4. **Data analysis depth:** Have students analyze class data from all groups combined. Create a class graph. Discuss: *\"Did all groups' dark materials get the same temperature? Why or why not?\"* (Introduces measurement precision and variation.)\n\n5. **Writing extension:** Have students write a **persuasive paragraph:** *\"Imagine you're an engineer designing a new school building in a hot climate. Using what you learned about heat absorption, explain which colors you'd paint the roof and why.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Infrared Thermometer Exploration (If Available):**\n   - If your school has or can borrow an infrared thermometer (like the one in the photo), let students safely use it to measure temperatures around the classroom: sunny windowsill, shaded area, metal desk, wooden table, etc.\n   - Create a classroom map showing temperature \"hot spots\" and \"cool spots.\"\n   - Discuss: *\"Why is the sunny window hotter than the shaded corner?\"* (Direct solar energy)\n   - **This directly connects to the original photograph and provides hands-on experience with the tool.**\n\n2. **Energy from the Sun: Tracing a Meal:**\n   - Return to NGSS standard 5-PS3-1 by extending the concept: Create a visual \"energy chain\" showing how the sun's energy → plants (through photosynthesis) → animals (through eating plants) → **heat in our bodies** (through digestion/metabolism).\n   - Have students trace the journey: *\"This apple grew in the sun. The sun's energy helped grow the apple. When you eat the apple, your body uses that energy to keep you warm and help you move. The sun's energy is still at work inside you!\"*\n   - Draw or create a poster showing: Sun → Plant → Food → You → Warmth & Movement.\n   - **This deepens understanding of energy transformation and connects to real life.**\n\n3. **Investigation: Which Cooler Keeps Food Coldest?**\n   - Design a mini-experiment: Place ice in three different containers (one dark, one white, one shiny/reflective aluminum).\n   - Measure how long it takes for ice to melt in each container when placed in the sun.\n   - Conclusion: *\"Light-colored and shiny containers absorb less heat, so ice melts slower.\"*\n   - Real-world application: *\"This is why coolers are often white or reflective!\"*\n   - This extends the concept to **cooling** (opposite of heating) and real-world problem-solving.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Timing flexibility:** If you have only one 45-minute session, combine Explain and Elaborate into one discussion-based phase after students complete the Explore activity (20 min Explore + 25 min discussion/application).\n\n- **Heat source options:** If outdoor sunlight is unavailable, a standard incandescent desk lamp works well (LED bulbs do not produce sufficient heat). **Never use heat lamps or open flames.** Keep lamps 6+ inches from materials to avoid burns.\n\n- **Thermometer selection:** Any analog or digital thermometer works. Infrared thermometers are ideal if available (they directly connect to the photograph), but standard classroom thermometers are sufficient.\n\n- **Safety:** Supervise students around heat sources. Remind them not to touch the lamp or materials immediately after heating. Allow materials to cool slightly before touching.\n\n- **Vocabulary anchor:** Create a permanent classroom anchor chart with the five key vocabulary words. Leave it posted throughout the unit for reference.\n\n- **Photography connection:** Consider having students photograph their materials before and after heating (if available), creating a visual comparison of \"before\" and \"after\" states.\n\nThis lesson directly anchors to the photograph by using a real-world tool (infrared thermometer) to motivate inquiry into heat and energy, while maintaining rigorous physical science learning aligned with Fifth Grade NGSS standards.",
