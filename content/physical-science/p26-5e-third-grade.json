Exploring Forces in Water**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90-120 minutes (two 45-60 minute sessions, or three 30-40 minute blocks)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 3-PS2-1 (Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object)\n  - 3-PS2-2 (Make observations and/or measurements of an object's motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion)\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Observe and describe** how large, heavy objects like ships can float in water by explaining that the water pushes up with enough force to balance the ship's weight.\n2. **Investigate and predict** how adding weight to a floating object changes its motion, sinking, or floating behavior.\n3. **Explain the relationship** between an object's weight (mass) and the forces needed to make it move and keep it floating.\n4. **Compare and contrast** how different objects move through water based on their size, weight, and the forces acting on them.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph while introducing the puzzle of floating heavy objects.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large photograph of the cargo ship (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks or paper for recording predictions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or print it for each table group. Allow students 1-2 minutes of quiet observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about the ship.\"\n   - \"This ship is VERY heavy—it carries thousands of boxes of cargo. How do you think something so heavy can float on water instead of sinking?\"\n   - \"If you dropped a rock in water, what would happen? Why is the ship different from a rock?\"\n   - \"What do you think makes this ship move through the water?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Here's a puzzle: The ship is heavier than a rock, yet the rock sinks and the ship floats. Turn to a partner and say: 'I think the ship floats because…' Draw or write your idea in your notebook.\"\n\n4. **Collect 3-4 student predictions on chart paper** without correcting them. Display this \"Our Thinking\" chart for reference throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to do an experiment with objects in water to figure out why ships float and how they move. Let's become ship scientists!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate balanced and unbalanced forces through hands-on exploration with floating and sinking objects.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic bins or bowls filled with water (1 per pair/small group)\n- Small wooden blocks or foam pieces (various sizes)\n- Aluminum foil (sheets and formed boats)\n- Small metal washers, pebbles, or weights\n- Plastic cups\n- Paper for recording observations\n- Rulers or measuring sticks\n- Pencils for stirring/moving objects\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station 1: Why Things Float or Sink (10 minutes)**\n\n*Student Directions:*\n1. Gather your materials: a bin of water, a wooden block, aluminum foil, a pebble, and a plastic cup.\n2. Predict which items will float and which will sink. Write down your guesses.\n3. One by one, gently place each item in the water. Observe and record: Does it float or sink?\n4. **The puzzle:** The pebble sinks, but aluminum foil also sinks when you crumple it. Now, flatten your foil and shape it into a shallow boat. Place it gently on the water. What happens? Why?\n5. Draw a picture in your notebook showing the pebble sinking and the foil boat floating. Label which one sinks and which one floats.\n\n**Station 2: Adding Weight Changes Things (10 minutes)**\n\n*Student Directions:*\n1. Make a small aluminum foil boat (your teacher can demonstrate this once).\n2. Place it gently in the water. Does it float? Write down what you observe.\n3. One at a time, add small washers or pebbles to your boat. Count how many you add.\n4. Keep adding weights until your boat sinks. Record the number of weights it took.\n5. Draw two pictures: one showing your boat floating (empty) and one showing it sinking (full of weights). Label them.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between stations, asking guiding questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"What changed?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n- **Do not provide answers.** Use phrases like: \"That's an interesting observation. What else do you notice?\" and \"What would happen if we…?\"\n- Model the foil boat-folding technique once, then let students practice.\n- Ensure water stays contained; have paper towels available.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that **shape matters**: flat foil floats; crumpled foil sinks.\n- Students observe that **adding weight makes floating objects sink**.\n- Students document observations with pictures and simple labels.\n- Students begin to sense that an **upward push from water** is needed to float.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to the photograph and scientific concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of cargo ship\n- Vocabulary cards (printed or written on paper)\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students together.** Ask 4-5 students to share one observation from their station (e.g., \"Our foil boat floated until we added five washers\"; \"The pebble sank right away\").\n\n2. **Connect to the Cargo Ship:**\n   - \"Remember the puzzle from the beginning? The ship carries thousands of heavy boxes, yet it floats. Now we understand why! The ship is shaped like a boat—it's hollow and wide. That shape helps it float, just like your aluminum foil boat. But the ship is also very, very heavy. So how does it stay up?\"\n\n3. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** with demonstrations:\n\n   **Vocabulary Terms & Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n   - **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or change. *Example: When you push the boat across the water, you use a force.*\n   \n   - **Balanced Forces:** Pushes or pulls that are equal and opposite, so an object stays in one place or moves at the same speed. *Example: The water pushes up on the ship with the same strength the ship pushes down. The ship stays floating.*\n   \n   - **Unbalanced Forces:** Pushes or pulls that are NOT equal, so an object starts moving, speeds up, slows down, or stops. *Example: When the ship's engine pushes it forward, the forward push is stronger than the water's backward push, so the ship moves.*\n   \n   - **Weight (or Mass):** How heavy something is. *Example: A big ship weighs much more than a small rock.*\n   \n   - **Buoyancy (optional, for advanced learners):** The upward push of water that helps objects float. *Example: Water pushes UP on the boat with enough force to hold it up.*\n\n4. **Make Connections with Visuals:**\n   - Draw simple force arrows on the photograph: arrows pointing UP from the water (buoyancy), arrows pointing DOWN (weight of ship), arrows pointing FORWARD (engine force).\n   - Explain: \"The upward push from the water is strong enough to balance the ship's weight. The ship floats!\"\n   - \"The engine pushes the ship forward. This makes the forward force stronger than the backward push from the water. The ship moves!\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we add more boxes to the ship, does it get heavier or lighter?\" (Heavier.)\n   - \"Would a heavier ship float or sink?\" (It would sink if the water's upward push isn't strong enough—so the ship needs to be very big and shaped right to float.)\n   - \"What makes the ship move forward?\" (The engine pushes it; unbalanced forces make it move.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can **name and describe** balanced and unbalanced forces.\n- Students understand that **water pushes UP on floating objects**.\n- Students recognize that **the ship's shape and the water's push help it float**.\n- Students connect their exploration to the real cargo ship.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply force concepts to predict and test the motion of boats in a new scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic bins with water (same as Explore)\n- Aluminum foil boats from Explore phase (or make new ones)\n- Plastic straws (1 per boat)\n- Small paper flags or tape for boat identification\n- Measuring tape or meter stick\n- Stopwatch or timer\n- Student recording sheets (see below)\n\n**Activity: \"Racing Boats—Predicting Motion\"**\n\n1. **Set up a \"boat race track\"** in the water bin: mark a start line and a finish line (30 cm apart, using tape on the side of the bin or a measuring stick laid across).\n\n2. **Student Task:**\n   - \"We're going to blow our boats across the water using straws. Before we race, predict: Will a light boat or a heavy boat move faster? Why?\"\n   - Provide a simple prediction template:\n     ```\n     My boat has ____ washers in it (light / heavy).\n     I predict it will move: ☐ FAST  ☐ SLOW\n     Because: _________________________________\n     ```\n\n3. **Conduct the \"race\":**\n   - Students blow their boats from start to finish using a straw (consistent, gentle blow).\n   - Measure or estimate the time it takes to cross. Record.\n   - Do this 2-3 times and average the result.\n\n4. **Discuss patterns:**\n   - \"Which boats moved faster: the light ones or the heavy ones?\"\n   - \"Why do you think a heavier boat moves slower?\" (More weight = more force needed to move it; water pushes back harder.)\n   - \"The cargo ship is very heavy. What do you think the ship's engine must be like to move such a heavy load?\" (Very powerful! It needs a lot of push-force.)\n\n5. **Connect to Real World:**\n   - Show the photograph again. \"This ship's engine is HUGE—much more powerful than a straw's blow. That's why it can move through the ocean even though it weighs millions of pounds!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the predictions and races.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What's different between this boat and that boat?\" \"Why did that one go faster?\"\n- Encourage students to explain their observations using force vocabulary.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students **predict** that heavier boats move slower.\n- Students **observe** a pattern: weight affects motion speed.\n- Students **explain** this pattern using the concept of balanced and unbalanced forces.\n- Students connect small-scale models to the real cargo ship.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of balanced/unbalanced forces, floating, and motion prediction.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observe student predictions** during Engage: Do they show thinking about weight and water?\n- **Monitor Explore stations:** Can students explain why foil boats float but pebbles sink?\n- **Listen during Explain:** Do students use force vocabulary accurately?\n- **Review boat racing predictions:** Do students predict based on weight and justify their thinking?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a **\"Ship Science Check\"** sheet (can be written or drawn):\n\n**Question 1:** \n\"The cargo ship floats on the ocean even though it is very heavy. Draw a picture showing two forces acting on the ship: one pointing UP and one pointing DOWN. Label them.\"\n\n**Question 2:** \n\"If sailors add 100 more boxes to the ship, will it move faster or slower? Circle one: **FASTER / SLOWER**. Explain why:\"\n\n**Question 3:**\n\"Which sentence is true? Circle it:\n- A) Heavy objects always sink.\n- B) The shape of a boat helps it float.\n- C) Water does not push on objects.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student draws two opposing forces (UP and DOWN).\n- ✓ Student correctly predicts that more weight = slower motion.\n- ✓ Student selects answer B and can explain it.\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary: float, sink, weight, or force at least once.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- **Objective 1 (Observe floating):** Did students explain that water pushes up? (Check Explain discussion and exit ticket drawing.)\n- **Objective 2 (Predict with weight changes):** Did students predict sinking when weight was added in Explore and slower motion in Elaborate? (Check station work and boat racing predictions.)\n- **Objective 3 (Relationship between weight and forces):** Did students connect more weight to slower motion or sinking in their explanations? (Check Elaborate discussion and exit ticket answer 2.)\n- **Objective 4 (Compare objects):** Did students compare foil boat vs. pebble, light boat vs. heavy boat, empty boat vs. loaded boat? (Check Explore drawings and Elaborate predictions.)\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide simplified vocabulary cards** with pictures (force = arrow pushing; float = stays on top of water; sink = goes down in water). Allow students to reference these during all phases.\n\n2. **Use a graphic organizer for predictions:** Instead of open-ended writing, provide a fill-in-the-blank template:\n   ```\n   This object will: ☐ FLOAT  ☐ SINK\n   Because it is: ☐ LIGHT  ☐ HEAVY\n   ```\n\n3. **Pre-fold aluminum foil boats** for students who struggle with fine motor skills. Let them focus on the investigation rather than construction.\n\n4. **Pair struggling students with a partner** during Explore who can help record observations while both investigate together.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Introduce \"displacement\":** Ask, \"How much water does the boat push aside when it floats? Let's measure!\" Have them use a graduated cylinder or overflow cup to measure water displaced by boats with different weights. Connect this to Archimedes' principle in simple terms: \"The water pushed aside (displaced) weighs the same as the boat—that's why it floats!\"\n\n2. **Design challenge:** \"Design a boat shape (using foil) that floats as many washers as possible without sinking. Test three different shapes and record which one is best.\" Students must explain WHY their best shape worked.\n\n3. **Real-world research:** \"Ships are made of steel, which normally sinks. How do you think they make steel ships float? Draw or write your theory.\" (Answer: Steel is shaped into a hollow boat, and the large volume of air inside it makes it float.)\n\n4. **Graph boat racing data:** Have advanced students create a simple bar graph showing how many washers each boat carried vs. how fast it moved. Identify the pattern: more weight = slower speed.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Boat Building Challenge\" (20-30 minutes):** \n   - Give each student or pair a piece of aluminum foil and a container of small weights.\n   - Challenge: Build a boat that floats the most weights without sinking.\n   - Test, modify, and retest. Record: \"My boat floated ___ weights. I modified the shape by ____, and then it floated ___ weights.\"\n   - This extends 3-PS2-1 (investigating effects of balanced/unbalanced forces).\n\n2. **Cargo Ship Stability Experiment (15-20 minutes):**\n   - Introduce the concept that ships can tip over if weight is not balanced.\n   - Fill aluminum foil boats with washers placed on one side only. Tilt gently. Students observe the boat's tendency to tip.\n   - Then redistribute weights evenly. Tilt again. The boat is more stable.\n   - Discuss: \"Real ships have ballast tanks (water inside) that help balance the weight. This keeps the ship stable.\"\n\n3. **Water Resistance Investigation (15-20 minutes):**\n   - Give students a boat and ask: \"Does the shape of the boat affect how the water pushes back on it?\"\n   - Create two boats: one narrow and pointed (like a racing boat), one wide and flat (like a cargo ship).\n   - Blow them across the water with equal force. Which moves further?\n   - Discuss: \"The pointy boat has less water resistance. Cargo ships are wide and sturdy, so the water pushes back harder. That's why they move slower.\"\n\n---\n\n## Standards Alignment Summary\n\n| NGSS Standard | How This Lesson Addresses It |\n|---|---|\n| **3-PS2-1** (Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object) | Students investigate floating (balanced forces: water up = weight down) and motion of boats (unbalanced forces: engine push > water resistance). They test and observe patterns. |\n| **3-PS2-2** (Make observations and/or measurements of an object's motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion) | Students observe and measure boat speed with different weights. They predict that heavier boats move slower based on observed patterns. |\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Water management:** Set up water stations before the lesson. Use towels and have students wear aprons if available. Consider doing this lesson outdoors or in a cafeteria for easier cleanup.\n- **Time flexibility:** If time is tight, combine Explore stations into one station that all students rotate through in small groups rather than working simultaneously.\n- **Safety:** Remind students not to drink water or splash uncontrollably. Enforce calm, focused exploration.\n- **Real-world connection:** If possible, show a brief video (30 seconds) of an actual cargo ship being loaded or moving through water. This cements the connection between the photograph and the real world.\n- **Misconception alert:** Many students think heavy things always sink. Emphasize repeatedly that *shape and size matter*—a large, hollow object can float even if it's made of heavy material.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson transforms a striking photograph into a hands-on investigation of forces, motion, and floating—core Third Grade physical science concepts. Students move from wonder to discovery to explanation, building a robust understanding of why ships float and move.",
