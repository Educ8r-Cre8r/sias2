  "content": "# Forces in Motion: A Jumping Adventure\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Unbalanced forces:** The child's leg muscles push downward against the ground, causing an upward motion that launches the body into the air. This demonstrates how unbalanced forces change an object's motion.\n- **Newton's Laws of Motion (simplified):** When the child pushes hard on the ground, the ground pushes back with equal force, propelling the child upward. When airborne, gravity pulls downward, bringing the child back to Earth.\n- **Patterns in motion:** Objects follow predictable paths when forces act on them. A jumping motion follows a clear pattern: preparation, takeoff, flight, and landing.\n- **Force direction and magnitude:** The strength (how hard the muscles push) and direction (upward vs. downward) of the force determine how high and far the object moves.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Jump, Measure, and Predict: Investigating Forces That Move Us**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 3-PS2-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object.\n  - 3-PS2-2: Make observations and/or measurements of an object's motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Explain how pushing forces (unbalanced forces) cause objects or bodies to move in specific directions and distances.\n2. Plan and conduct a fair test comparing how different amounts of force affect how far or high something jumps.\n3. Measure and record data about motion to identify patterns and make predictions about future jumps.\n4. Use evidence from their investigation to describe the cause-and-effect relationship between force and motion.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about forces and motion using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital image of the child jumping over the orange cone\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Projector or document camera (optional, for group viewing)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Ask students to look carefully without talking for 15 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions** (pause for thinking time after each):\n   - \"What do you notice the child's legs doing in this picture? Can you show me with your own body?\"\n   - \"What made the child's feet come off the ground? What had to happen first?\"\n   - \"Do you think the child could jump this high if they pushed gently on the ground? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"If the child jumped again, do you think they would jump about the same height, or would it be different? How could we know?\"\n\n3. **Record predictions** on chart paper: \"What makes things jump higher?\" Accept all student ideas without judgment. This activates prior knowledge about force and motion.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder if we can make things jump higher by pushing harder. Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be scientists and test how different amounts of pushing force change how high or far things jump, just like the child in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how the strength of a force affects the motion of an object through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:** (per pair of students)\n- 1 ruler (12-inch)\n- 1 small block or eraser (approximately 2 inches long)\n- 1 tape measure or measuring tape\n- 1 index card or small piece of cardboard\n- Masking tape\n- Paper towels or a small cloth\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Setting Up the Investigation**\n\n1. **Demonstrate the apparatus:** Show students how to place a ruler on a table edge with about 6 inches hanging off (like a seesaw). Show how to place the small block on one end of the hanging ruler.\n\n2. **Explain the procedure:** \"We're going to push down on the short end of the ruler with a gentle push, a medium push, and a hard push. The block will fly across the table like a jumping motion. We need to measure how far it goes each time.\"\n\n3. **Have students set up:** Assign student pairs and have them:\n   - Tape the ruler securely to the table edge using masking tape\n   - Place the small block on the hanging end of the ruler\n   - Place a strip of masking tape at the edge of the table to mark where the block starts\n\n**Part B: Conducting Fair Tests**\n\n4. **Conduct three trials:**\n   - **Gentle push:** Partner 1 gently taps the short end of the ruler. Partner 2 measures how far the block traveled and records on data sheet.\n   - **Medium push:** Partner 1 pushes the ruler down with medium force. Partner 2 measures and records.\n   - **Hard push:** Partner 1 pushes the ruler down with maximum force. Partner 2 measures and records.\n\n5. **Record data:** Students complete a simple data table:\n\n| Push Strength | Distance Traveled (in inches) |\n|---|---|\n| Gentle | ___ |\n| Medium | ___ |\n| Hard | ___ |\n\n6. **Repeat:** Conduct 2-3 sets of trials to check for patterns.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and observe which pairs are using consistent technique.\n- Ask: \"Is your medium push always about the same? Why is it important to push the same way each time?\"\n- Help students measure accurately by ensuring the measuring tape is straight.\n- Guide students to notice the pattern forming without stating it directly: \"What do you notice about the numbers as you push harder?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that a harder push (greater unbalanced force) causes the block to travel farther.\n- Students produce a completed data table showing the relationship between force and distance.\n- Students observe a clear pattern: more force = greater motion.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after hands-on discovery.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper\n- Markers (multiple colors)\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Diagram showing a jumping stick figure (can be drawn or pre-made)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore:** \n   - Ask 2-3 pairs to share their data and patterns discovered.\n   - Create a class data table on chart paper combining all results.\n   - Ask: \"What pattern do we see across all our groups?\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** using student-friendly definitions:\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition | Classroom Connection |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Force** | A push or a pull that makes something move or change direction. When you push the ruler down, that's a force. | The child's legs push hard on the ground (force). |\n   | **Unbalanced force** | A push or pull that is stronger on one side than the other, causing motion. When we push the ruler, it's stronger than the ruler pushing back. | The child's leg push is stronger than gravity pulling down, so the child launches upward. |\n   | **Motion** | When something moves from one place to another. | The block sliding across the table is motion. The child jumping is motion. |\n   | **Magnitude** | How much or how strong something is. A big push is high magnitude; a gentle push is low magnitude. | A hard push has high magnitude; a gentle push has low magnitude. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the jumping child: \"The child's leg muscles created a strong push (unbalanced force) against the ground. This force gave the child an upward motion.\"\n   - \"The harder the push, the more motion we got in our experiment. The child must have pushed very hard to jump this high!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If this child jumped again using a gentler push with their legs, what would happen?\" (They wouldn't jump as high.)\n   - Ask: \"What is the unbalanced force in our ruler experiment?\" (Our push on the ruler.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Force:** A push or pull that causes something to move or stop.\n- **Unbalanced force:** When pushing or pulling power is stronger on one side, causing motion.\n- **Motion:** Movement from one place to another.\n- **Magnitude:** How strong or how much of something there is (like how hard you push).\n- **Direction:** The way something moves (up, down, left, right, forward, backward).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use new vocabulary correctly to describe their observations.\n- Students connect the ruler experiment to the jumping child in the photograph.\n- Students explain that a stronger push (greater force) causes greater motion.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by testing force and motion in a new context with a predictive element.\n\n**Materials:** (per pair of students)\n- Same ruler setup from Explore\n- Small block or eraser\n- Measuring tape\n- Optional: different-sized blocks or erasers\n- Prediction worksheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge:** \"Now that we know how force affects motion, we're going to make a prediction and test it. I want you to predict: If you pushed with a force that is between 'gentle' and 'medium,' how far do you think the block will travel?\"\n\n2. **Have students make predictions** on a worksheet:\n   - \"My prediction: The block will travel about ___ inches.\"\n   - \"I think this because _____.\"\n\n3. **Conduct the test:** Students perform the \"between\" push (gentle + medium combined) and measure the result.\n\n4. **Compare prediction to actual result:**\n   - \"Was your prediction close? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What does this tell us about how force and motion work together?\"\n\n5. **Real-world connection (optional extension):**\n   - \"Athletes like high jumpers and basketball players study how to use force to control their motion. How could understanding force help a basketball player make a better shot? A long jumper?\"\n   - Show images or videos of athletes (high jumpers, long jumpers, or soccer players) performing explosive movements.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to see that their prediction was likely close to the pattern, supporting predictability.\n- Ask: \"Why was your prediction close? What pattern helped you guess?\"\n- Encourage metacognitive reflection: \"What did you learn about how scientists make predictions?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students make reasonable predictions based on patterns from earlier trials.\n- Students conduct a controlled test to verify their prediction.\n- Students reflect on the predictability of motion when force is known.\n- Students apply the concept to real-world scenarios like sports.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces, motion, patterns, and predictions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- Observe student pairs during Explore phase for understanding of fair testing and accurate measurement.\n- Listen to student language during share-out in Explain phase—do they use \"force,\" \"motion,\" and \"push\" correctly?\n- Review prediction worksheets for logical reasoning based on patterns.\n\n**Exit Ticket (summative assessment):** Distribute a half-page exit ticket with these prompts:\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Show a picture of something jumping (stick figure, animal, or object). Label the push force with an arrow.\n\n2. **Answer in complete sentences:**\n   - \"When I pushed the ruler gently, the block didn't go very far. When I pushed hard, it went farther. Why did the block move farther with a harder push?\"\n   - \"If you wanted to jump as high as the child in the picture, should you bend your legs and push hard, or push gently? Explain your thinking.\"\n\n3. **Predict:**\n   - \"If you jumped from a lower position (bending less), would you jump as high? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student describes the relationship between force and motion (harder push = farther motion)\n- ✓ Student uses the term \"force\" or \"push\" correctly\n- ✓ Student makes a logical prediction based on observed patterns\n- ✓ Student provides reasoning or evidence for their answers\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify that stronger force causes greater motion.\n- 75% of students make a reasonable prediction based on the pattern.\n- 85% of students use evidence from the experiment to explain their thinking.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified data collection:** Provide a pre-made data table with just two force levels (gentle and hard) rather than three. Reduce the number of trials required.\n\n2. **Graphic support:** Provide a labeled diagram of the ruler setup before the investigation begins. Pair students with a more experienced measurer.\n\n3. **Sentence stems for explaining:** Give students frames like:\n   - \"The harder push made the block go ___ inches.\"\n   - \"I know this because ___.\"\n   - \"Force is a ___ or ___.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Variables exploration:** Have advanced students test how different block sizes or weights affect motion with the same force. Ask: \"Does a heavy block move the same distance as a light block with the same push?\"\n\n2. **Prediction with unknown force:** Show students the jump photograph again and ask them to estimate: \"Based on the height and distance, how much force (gentle, medium, or hard) do you think the child used? What evidence supports your answer?\"\n\n3. **Design a jumping machine:** Challenge students to design a simple contraption (using ruler, block, rubber band, or other classroom materials) that can jump an object a specific distance. Have them document their design and test it.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Jumping Olympics:** Hold a whole-class \"jumping competition\" where students test their own jumping distance. Measure and graph results. Discuss: \"Why did some students jump farther? Was it their force, their leg length, or both?\" This connects human motion to the ruler experiment.\n\n2. **Force and Sports:** Research how different sports use force and motion. Create a poster showing a basketball player, soccer player, and volleyball player with arrows indicating the forces they use. Display in the gymnasium or classroom.\n\n3. **Stop-Motion Video:** Have students use tablets or cameras to take a series of photos of their own jump, similar to the lesson photograph. Create a stop-motion video showing the phases of jumping (crouch, takeoff, flight, landing). Label each phase with the forces at work.\n\n---\n\nThis 5E lesson plan transforms the dynamic jumping photograph into a concrete, hands-on investigation that allows third-graders to discover cause-and-effect relationships between force and motion, build measurement skills, and practice making evidence-based predictions—all while connecting back to the inspiring image that started their scientific journey.",
