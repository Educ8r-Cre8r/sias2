Observe and describe how heat changes the appearance and texture of materials (like eggs).\n2. Identify heat energy as coming from different sources (fire, sunlight) and explain that heat causes changes.\n3. Recognize that some materials conduct or block heat energy.\n4. Make a simple prediction about how heat will affect a material before observing the change.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of a cooking egg.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printout or digital display of the thermal_energy.jpg photograph\n- Chart paper and markers (for recording observations)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a large printout where all students can see clearly. Make sure the blue flame, the hot pan, and the cooking egg are all visible.\n\n2. **Introduce with curiosity:** Say, \"Look at this picture! What do you see happening? What's changing?\" Allow 30 seconds of quiet observation before asking questions.\n\n3. **Ask specific discussion questions (calibrated for kindergarten):**\n   - \"What color is the flame under the pan? Have you seen fire before? Where?\"\n   - \"Look at the egg. What color is the yolk (the yellow part)? What color is the egg white (the clear part around it)? Do they look solid or runny?\"\n   - \"What do you think is happening to the egg? Is it getting hotter or colder?\"\n   - \"If you touched the pan, would it be hot or cold? How do you know?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what made the egg white turn from clear to white and solid. What do you think caused that change?\"\n\n5. **Chart student ideas** on a large piece of paper labeled \"What We Think About Cooking Eggs.\" Write their predictions in simple words or pictures.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an experiment to see what heat really does to food, just like the fire is doing to this egg!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how heat changes materials through a safe, hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **For each small group (2–3 students):**\n  - 1 white foam plate or shallow tray\n  - 1 small container of ice cubes (kept in a cooler)\n  - 1 small container of warm (not hot) water in a bowl\n  - 2–3 small objects to test: butter cube, chocolate square, small marshmallow, crayon, plastic toy\n  - Plastic spoons\n  - Thermometer (optional, for teacher reference)\n  - Paper towels\n  - Observation sheet with simple drawings (one picture per object, showing \"before\" and \"after\" states)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide students into small groups** (2–3 per group). Explain that they will NOT use fire or a real stove—this is much safer!\n\n2. **Provide step-by-step student directions:**\n   - \"First, touch the warm water with your finger for just one second. Tell your friends: Is it warm or cold?\"\n   - \"Now, place your butter cube in the warm water. Watch what happens for 30 seconds. Is the butter changing? How?\"\n   - \"Take the butter out. Feel it with your finger. Is it the same as before, or different?\"\n   - \"Now test the chocolate square the same way. What happens? Does it melt like the butter did?\"\n   - \"Try the other objects (marshmallow, crayon, plastic toy). Which ones change in the warm water? Which ones stay the same?\"\n   - \"Finally, hold an ice cube in your hand. What happens? Does it feel cold? Does it change?\"\n\n3. **How it connects to the photograph:** \"The egg in the picture is in warm heat from the fire, just like your butter and chocolate are in warm water. The heat is changing them!\"\n\n4. **Recording:** Students draw or dictate what happened to each object:\n   - Before heat (or in ice): What did it look like?\n   - After heat (or in warm water): What changed?\n\n5. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate to each group; ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice? Did it change? How is it different?\"\n   - Avoid telling students the answer; instead, guide them to observe: \"What does it feel like now? Is it the same as before?\"\n   - Ensure water is warm (not hot) and monitor student safety with thermometer checks.\n   - Encourage students to use words like \"soft,\" \"hard,\" \"melted,\" \"changed,\" \"warm,\" \"cold.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that butter, chocolate, and marshmallow soften or melt in warm water.\n- Students observe that ice melts into water in warm conditions.\n- Students notice that plastic and crayons resist melting.\n- Students discover that heat causes visible, observable changes in some materials.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to the original photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (same as Engage phase)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple pictures\n- Real items (if safe and available): a hard-boiled egg, a raw egg in a clear bowl, butter in solid and melted forms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather students in a circle. Ask:\n   - \"What did you discover about warm water? What happened to the butter? The chocolate? The ice?\"\n   - \"What stayed the same? What changed?\"\n   - Have 2–3 groups share their observations aloud.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with pictures and real examples:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Heat:** Energy that makes things warm and can change how things look and feel. (Point to the blue flame in the photo: \"That flame creates heat.\")\n   - **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is. (Show a warm bowl and cold ice: \"The warm water has a higher temperature than the ice.\")\n   - **Melt:** When something solid (like butter or ice) becomes soft or liquid because it gets warm. (Show melted vs. solid butter.)\n   - **Change:** Something becomes different. The egg's white changed from clear to white because heat made it change.\n   - **Cool/Cooling:** Getting colder. (Explain that ice is cold, and when it melts into water, it's still cooling things down.)\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"The egg in the picture is cooking. The blue fire below creates HEAT. That heat travels through the hot pan to the egg.\"\n   - \"Just like your butter melted in warm water, the egg white changed and became solid because of the HEAT from the fire.\"\n   - \"The yolk stayed yellow and more liquid—but it also got warmer from the heat.\"\n   - Point to the egg white and yolk in the photo: \"See how the white is now solid and white? It changed because of HEAT.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Does heat make things warmer or colder?\" (Warmer.)\n   - Ask: \"What happened to the ice when it sat in warm water?\" (It melted.)\n   - Ask: \"What do you think is making the egg change in the picture?\" (The hot fire and hot pan.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word \"heat\" to describe energy that makes things warm.\n- Students explain that heat causes observable changes (melting, cooking, warming).\n- Students connect the photograph to their exploration: the fire creates heat, the heat changes the egg.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to a new context and think about protecting things from heat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with drawings of the sun\n- Small containers or boxes (paper, cardboard, plastic, foil)\n- Crayons/markers\n- A sunny windowsill (if available) or heat lamp (teacher-supervised)\n- Small squares of dark paper, light paper, and aluminum foil\n- Simple data sheet with pictures for recording observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-world connection:** \"The sun also creates heat! Just like the fire in the picture heats the egg, the sun heats Earth. What if we want to KEEP something cool on a hot, sunny day? Can we protect it from the sun's heat?\"\n\n2. **Design challenge (simplified for kindergarten):**\n   - Show students three different materials: dark paper, light paper, and aluminum foil.\n   - Ask: \"Which one do you think will keep something cooler when the sun shines on it?\"\n   - Have students make a prediction and draw their guess on a simple sheet.\n\n3. **Simple investigation (teacher-led, students observe):**\n   - Place a thermometer or ice cube under each material in a sunny spot (or under a heat lamp, teacher-supervised).\n   - After 5–10 minutes, check which material's area stayed coolest.\n   - Ask: \"Which material blocked the heat the best? Was it the dark paper, light paper, or shiny foil?\"\n\n4. **Application activity:**\n   - Provide each student with a small paper cup or box.\n   - Challenge: \"Decorate and design a 'sun hat' or 'shade box' using materials we tested. Which material will you choose to keep things cool?\"\n   - Students color, paste, and create simple structures.\n\n5. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Guide design thinking: \"Why did you choose that material? What did we learn about it?\"\n   - Facilitate safe observation of the sun-exposed materials.\n   - Celebrate student designs without judgment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that the sun provides heat (like the fire does).\n- Students apply learning to a new problem: blocking or reducing heat.\n- Students design a simple structure and explain their choice based on exploration.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of heat, temperature, and how heat changes materials.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n   - During Explore, observe which students accurately describe changes (\"melted,\" \"got warm,\" \"changed\").\n   - During Explain, note whether students use vocabulary words correctly in their own sentences.\n   - During Elaborate, assess whether students can make logical predictions about which materials resist heat.\n\n2. **Exit ticket (simple, visual for kindergarten):**\n   - Show students three pictures:\n     - Picture 1: A raw egg (clear white, yellow yolk)\n     - Picture 2: A cooked egg (solid white, firm yolk)\n     - Picture 3: An ice cube\n   \n   Ask (one question at a time):\n   - \"Which picture shows what happened when heat changed the egg?\" (Point to Picture 2.)\n   - \"What made the egg change?\" (Fire/heat.)\n   - \"Show me with your hands: Did the egg get bigger or smaller?\" (Gesture to show it stayed about the same size but changed texture.)\n   - \"What do you think would happen if we put ice near a hot fire?\" (It would melt.)\n\n3. **Success criteria for student understanding:**\n   - ✓ Student can identify heat as a cause of change.\n   - ✓ Student observes and describes at least one way heat changed a material (melting, cooking, warming).\n   - ✓ Student makes a reasonable prediction about how heat will affect an untested material.\n   - ✓ Student connects the cooking egg in the photograph to heat energy from fire.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that heat is energy that causes observable changes.\n- Students explain that fire and the sun both create heat.\n- Students can predict and describe what happens when materials experience heat or cold.\n- Students apply concepts to real-world scenarios (cooking, sun protection).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and repetition:** Use only the core term \"heat\" and simple action words (\"warm,\" \"melt,\" \"change\"). Repeat these words frequently and in multiple contexts throughout the lesson.\n\n2. **Hands-on materials first:** Allow extra time in the Explore phase for students to manipulate materials repeatedly. Ask simpler questions: \"Is it warm or cold?\" rather than open-ended prompts.\n\n3. **Peer partnerships:** Pair students with stronger communicators during Explore so they hear scientific language modeled and feel supported making observations.\n\n4. **Visual supports:** Provide picture cards showing \"before\" and \"after\" states of objects (ice→water, butter solid→butter melted) for reference during discussions.\n\n---\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Prediction and explanation:** Ask advanced students to explain *why* they think heat caused changes: \"What do you think heat does to the tiny pieces inside butter to make it melt?\" Introduce the idea that heat makes particles move faster (age-appropriately simple).\n\n2. **Multi-step investigation:** Challenge students to test which material cools down fastest (dark paper, light paper, foil) and record results with tally marks or simple graphs before revealing the answer.\n\n3. **Real-world problem-solving:** Ask: \"If you wanted to keep ice cream cold outside on a sunny day, what materials would you use? Why? Test your design!\" Students can create insulated containers and test them.\n\n4. **Extension vocabulary:** Introduce \"insulate\" or \"conductor\" (in simple terms): \"Some materials let heat pass through. Some materials stop heat. Which did we find?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cooking at Home & Sharing:** Send home a simple note asking families to let their kindergartener observe a safe cooking activity (scrambling eggs, melting butter, boiling water—with supervision). Students draw or dictate what changed and share with the class the next day.\n\n2. **Sun Heat Investigation:** On a sunny day, take students outside to touch different surfaces (concrete, grass, metal playground equipment—where safe and appropriate). Discuss which feel warmest and why. Make predictions: \"Will the concrete stay hot longer than the grass? Let's find out!\"\n\n3. **Ice Melting Race:** Provide students with ice cubes and different materials (blankets, foil, paper towels, bare surface). Predict which will melt fastest and slowest. Document with drawings showing the ice at the start, middle, and end of the activity. Discuss why certain materials helped or prevented melting.\n\n4. **Story & Picture Book:** Read a simple book like *The Snowy Day* or *Heat* (by Matt Tavares) and connect the sun's heat to changes students observed. Have students create their own picture book: \"How Heat Changes Things\" with pages showing fire, sun, and ice.\n\n5. **Sensory Sorting Activity:** Gather classroom objects and sort them into \"gets very hot easily\" (dark objects, metal), \"stays cooler\" (light-colored, foam), and \"doesn't change much\" (plastic, ceramic). Discuss properties that affect how materials respond to heat.\n\n---",
