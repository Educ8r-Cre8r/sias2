ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about forces and motion by analyzing the dramatic contrast in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on board/projector (or printed copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording questions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Ask students to look carefully at the two vehicles without talking for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** (pausing after each for think-pair-share time):\n   - *\"What do you notice about the size of the locomotive compared to the size of the red car?\"* (Students will observe the locomotive is much, much larger.)\n   - *\"If these two vehicles were racing, which one do you think could move faster or easier? Why?\"* (Listen for ideas about size, weight, power, and force.)\n   - *\"If you wanted to push the red car, would it be easy or hard? What about the locomotive?\"* (Activate their thinking about force and effort.)\n   - *\"What do you think would happen if the locomotive tried to push the red car?\"* (Introduce the idea of unbalanced forces in a familiar context.)\n\n3. **Record student predictions** on chart paper with the heading: *\"What happens when different-sized things get pushed?\"* Save this for comparison during the Explain phase.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** *\"Today, we're going to become force investigators! We'll test how pushing and pulling affect different objects, just like that locomotive and car.\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Let's design an experiment to test what really happens when we apply different amounts of force to objects of different sizes.\"*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate firsthand how the amount of force affects object motion and discover that heavier/larger objects respond differently to forces.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small toy cars (or blocks) of different sizes/weights (at least 2 different types per group)\n- Ramps or smooth table surfaces (or foam board ramps if ramps unavailable)\n- Meter sticks or measuring tape\n- Small objects to act as \"pushes\" (toy blocks, books, or hand-push setups)\n- Data recording sheets (template provided below)\n- Pencils/markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Setup (Teacher-directed, 3 minutes):**\n\n1. Divide the class into groups of 3-4 students.\n2. Give each group two different toy cars/objects (one \"small/light\" and one \"large/heavy\").\n3. Explain: *\"Your job is to investigate: Does the size or weight of an object change how it moves when you push it with the same amount of force?\"*\n\n**Student Investigation (15-20 minutes):**\n\n**Step 1:** Students place the small car at a starting line on a table or ramp.\n\n**Step 2:** One student gives the small car a **gentle push** (use consistent language: \"gentle,\" \"medium,\" \"hard\").\n\n**Step 3:** Measure how far the car moves. Record the distance on the data sheet.\n\n**Step 4:** Repeat Step 3 two more times, recording the distances.\n\n**Step 5:** Repeat Steps 1-4 with the **same gentle push** but using the large/heavy car.\n\n**Step 6:** Compare distances: Did both cars move the same distance? Which one moved farther?\n\n**Step 7:** Repeat the entire investigation, but this time use a **medium push** or **hard push**.\n\n**Step 8:** Record observations: *\"How did the force change the motion? Did the heavier object respond the same way as the lighter object?\"*\n\n**Data Recording Sheet Template:**\n\n| **Object** | **Gentle Push Distance** | **Medium Push Distance** | **Hard Push Distance** |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Small/Light Car | _____ cm | _____ cm | _____ cm |\n| Large/Heavy Car | _____ cm | _____ cm | _____ cm |\n\n**Observation Questions:**\n- Which car moved farther with a gentle push?\n- Which car moved farther with a hard push?\n- What do you notice about the pattern?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- **Circulate among groups** and ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n  - *\"What did you observe when you pushed the small car gently? What about the big car?\"*\n  - *\"Do you see a pattern in your data?\"*\n  - *\"If I pushed even harder, what do you predict would happen?\"*\n- **Ensure consistency:** Help students apply similar amounts of force each time (use verbal cues like \"count to 3, then push\").\n- **Encourage recording:** Remind students to write/draw their data carefully so they can explain it later.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students discover that **lighter objects typically move farther** with the same gentle push.\n- Students find that **with more force, both objects move farther**, but the pattern may differ.\n- Students collect numerical data showing relationships between force and motion.\n- Students begin to notice that the **heavier/larger object requires more force** to move the same distance as the lighter one.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts by connecting student discoveries to the photograph and real-world examples.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Completed data sheets from Explore phase\n- Chart paper with student predictions (from Engage)\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Vocabulary poster or chart (can be created live)\n- Whiteboard/markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their data and observations.\n   - Record similar findings on chart paper.\n   - Ask: *\"Did all groups notice the same pattern, or were there differences?\"*\n   - Connect to the photograph: *\"Look at the locomotive and car again. Based on what we learned, why would the big, heavy locomotive need a bigger push (or pull) than the car?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Write each term on chart paper or vocabulary cards.\n   - Use student-friendly definitions and connect to their investigation:\n\n   | **Vocabulary** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Real-World Example from the Photo** |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Force** | A push or pull that makes something move or changes how it moves. | The locomotive's engine pushing/pulling creates force. |\n   | **Balanced Forces** | Pushes or pulls that are equal, so an object doesn't move or stays moving the same way. | If two equal-strength teams pull opposite ends of a rope, the rope doesn't move. |\n   | **Unbalanced Forces** | Pushes or pulls that are not equal, so an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction. | The locomotive's huge pushing force is much stronger than the car's resistance, so the car would move. |\n   | **Motion** | The way something moves—how fast, in what direction, and how far. | The cars in your investigation moved different distances depending on the force. |\n   | **Mass** (simplified for 3rd grade) | How heavy something is or how much \"stuff\" it has. | The locomotive has more mass than the car, so it needs more force to move. |\n\n3. **Make Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again.\n   - Ask: *\"Look at this locomotive and car. The locomotive is much more massive (heavier) than the car. What would happen if the locomotive tried to push the car? Why?\"*\n   - Students should respond: *\"The locomotive has more force, so it could push the car. The forces would be unbalanced—the locomotive's push is stronger.\"*\n   - Reinforce: *\"When forces are unbalanced, objects move! We saw that in our investigation today.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: *\"If I push a light ball and a heavy ball with the same medium push, which one should move farther?\"* (Light ball.)\n   - Ask: *\"What happens when we apply MORE force to an object?\"* (It moves faster or farther.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or changes how it moves.\n- **Balanced Forces:** Equal pushes or pulls that keep an object still or moving at the same speed.\n- **Unbalanced Forces:** Unequal pushes or pulls that cause an object to start moving, speed up, slow down, or change direction.\n- **Motion:** The way something moves—including how fast, in what direction, and how far.\n- **Mass:** How heavy something is; how much material it contains.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that **force affects motion**.\n- Students can explain that **unbalanced forces cause objects to move**.\n- Students recognize that **different objects respond differently to the same force** depending on their mass.\n- Students can use evidence from their data to support these ideas.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of forces and motion to new scenarios and make predictions about real-world situations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Two or three different scenarios described on index cards or handouts (or presented verbally)\n- Chart paper for prediction display\n- Optional: toy cars/ramps for demonstration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario 1 — The Locomotive Returns:**\n- Display the photograph again and ask: *\"The locomotive is parked at a rail yard. A small worker is standing in front of it. If the locomotive starts moving forward very slowly, what force is acting on it? Is that force balanced or unbalanced? What do you predict would happen to anything in its path?\"*\n- Students discuss and draw their predictions.\n- Reinforce: *\"The locomotive's engine creates a huge pushing force. Any smaller object in the way experiences an unbalanced force, so it would move!\"*\n\n**Scenario 2 — Predicting Motion Patterns:**\n- Present: *\"Two toy cars are sitting on a table. We push Car A with a medium push, and it moves 30 centimeters. We push Car B (which is heavier) with the same medium push. What do you predict will happen? Will it move 30 cm, more than 30 cm, or less than 30 cm?\"*\n- Students make predictions based on patterns they observed in Explore.\n- Optional: Perform a quick demonstration to confirm.\n\n**Scenario 3 — Design Challenge (if time allows):**\n- *\"You are engineers. Your job is to move a heavy box from one corner of the room to another. But you can only give it ONE push. How could you make your one push as strong as possible to move the box farther?\"*\n- Students brainstorm: Run up to it? Push from a lower angle? Get multiple people to push together? (This introduces the idea that more force or combined forces create stronger effects.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate discussion without revealing answers; let students reason through scenarios.\n- Ask probing questions: *\"What did we learn about heavy objects and force? How does that apply here?\"*\n- Encourage students to use data from their investigations to support predictions.\n- Celebrate accurate predictions and reasoning: *\"You used what you learned to figure this out!\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students apply force and motion concepts to new, real-world-inspired scenarios.\n- Students make evidence-based predictions about motion.\n- Students articulate the relationship between force, mass, and motion using vocabulary introduced in Explain.\n- Students recognize that the **same force affects different objects differently**.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces, motion, and unbalanced forces through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n\n1. **Observation Checklist** (use while circulating during Explore):\n   - ☐ Student applies consistent force to test fairness.\n   - ☐ Student accurately measures and records distances.\n   - ☐ Student articulates observations about which object moved farther.\n   - ☐ Student identifies a pattern in the data.\n\n2. **Questioning Strategy** (during Explain):\n   - *\"Why did the lighter car move farther with a gentle push?\"* (Listen for: lighter, less mass, force.)\n   - *\"What would happen if we pushed the heavy car even harder?\"* (Listen for: it would move farther, more force = more motion.)\n   - *\"In the photograph, if the locomotive pushed the car, what forces are acting on the car?\"* (Listen for: unbalanced forces, locomotive's force is stronger.)\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (5 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket. They can respond verbally (teacher scribes) or in writing/drawings:\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **\"When you pushed the light car gently, did it move the same distance as the heavy car? Explain what happened.\"** \n   - *Success Criteria:* Student indicates that different objects moved different distances and recognizes the role of mass/weight.\n\n2. **\"Look at the picture of the locomotive and car. If the locomotive pushed the car with its engine, what do you think would happen to the car? Why?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student predicts the car would move and explains that the locomotive's force (or power) is stronger/unbalanced.\n\n3. **\"What did you learn today about how force affects the way objects move?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student states that more force causes more motion, or that different objects respond differently to the same force.\n\n**Alternative Summative Option — Quick Draw and Explain:**\n- Students draw a picture of the locomotive pushing the car or their toy car investigation.\n- Students write or dictate one sentence: *\"The force made the object move because _________.\"*\n- Success criteria: Student shows understanding of cause-and-effect relationship between force and motion.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- **Mastery:** Students correctly predict and explain motion based on force and mass. They use vocabulary (force, unbalanced forces, motion) accurately and reference their investigation data.\n- **Developing:** Students understand that force affects motion but may struggle to articulate why different objects respond differently. Teacher can clarify with reference to mass.\n- **Beginning:** Students recognize that pushing makes things move but need more support connecting multiple forces or mass to motion differences.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Investigation:**\n   - Provide only ONE type of push (e.g., just \"medium\") rather than three levels.\n   - Use pre-drawn data tables with picture symbols instead of requiring writing.\n   - Pair struggling students with strong partners to share roles (one records, one measures).\n\n2. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:**\n   - Introduce only two vocabulary terms (force, motion) before the lesson; save others for after data collection.\n   - Use gesture and demonstration repeatedly: mime a push, then show the object moving; repeat to reinforce \"force → motion.\"\n   - Create a picture card set with vocabulary terms and illustrations students can reference.\n\n3. **Direct Questioning:**\n   - Instead of open-ended questions, offer choices: *\"Did the light car move MORE or LESS far than the heavy car?\"* \n   - Encourage students to point to data on their sheet when answering.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Investigation:**\n   - Have students test THREE or MORE different objects (varying greatly in mass) to see if a pattern holds across more data points.\n   - Challenge them to investigate angle: *\"Does a ramp at a steeper angle change how far objects move? Why might that be related to force?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"If we doubled the force (pushed twice as hard), did the object move twice as far? Create a hypothesis and test it.\"*\n\n2. **Real-World Application:**\n   - Have advanced students research and report: *\"Why do trucks need powerful engines while bicycles don't?\"* (Connect to mass and force.)\n   - Challenge them to design a solution: *\"If you needed to move a very heavy object with a small push, what could you do?\" (Introduce levers, ramps, wheels—simple machines that multiply force.)\n\n3. **Data Analysis:**\n   - Have advanced students create bar graphs comparing the three force levels (gentle, medium, hard) for their two objects.\n   - Ask them to write a prediction paragraph: *\"Based on our data, if we used an even HARDER push, how far would each object move? Explain your reasoning.\"*\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Force in My Community\" Photo Hunt:**\n   - Students search for pictures or videos (from teacher-curated sources) showing unbalanced forces in real life: a bulldozer moving rocks, a child pushing a swing, a truck pulling cargo, etc.\n   - Students label the picture with arrows showing the direction of force and predict what will move.\n   - Display as a classroom gallery walk.\n\n2. **Ramp Races — Balanced vs. Unbalanced Forces:**\n   - Set up two ramps side by side. Place a toy car on each.\n   - One ramp is slightly steeper than the other (creating unbalanced gravitational forces).\n   - Students predict which car will reach the bottom first and why.\n   - Extend: Modify the ramps' angles and repeat to show that force direction and strength change outcomes.\n\n3. **Force Design Challenge — Move the Heavy Box:**\n   - Provide a heavy classroom item (or weighted box) and various materials (rope, blocks, ramps, etc.).\n   - Challenge groups to design a system using more than one force to move the object.\n   - Students test their designs and report: *\"How did our design use force? What was balanced or unbalanced?\"*\n   - Connects to simple machines and problem-solving with forces.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\nThis lesson bridges concrete, hands-on discovery with formal scientific language and real-world contexts. The locomotive/car photograph provides an engaging anchor that third graders can visualize even when investigating toy cars. Emphasizing the **dramatic size and mass difference** helps students grasp why unbalanced forces matter. Returning to the photograph multiple times (Engage, Explain, Elaborate) reinforces the connection between abstract force concepts and tangible visual evidence.",
