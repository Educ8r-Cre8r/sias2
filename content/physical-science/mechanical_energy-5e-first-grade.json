ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about machines, pulleys, and the work being done in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large photograph displayed on whiteboard, tablet, or printed poster\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently and ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking. Then ask:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is happening?\" (Encourage students to describe the truck, crane, rope, worker, and the object being lifted.)\n   - \"Why do you think that person is using the rope and this big machine? What would happen if they tried to lift that object by themselves?\" (Guide them to think about size, weight, and effort.)\n   - \"Have you ever used a rope to pull something? Or seen a grown-up use a tool to make work easier?\" (Connect to their lived experience—opening a can, using a hammer, swinging on a swing, etc.)\n   - \"What do you think is helping the worker lift something so heavy?\" (Introduce the idea of machines and tools.)\n\n2. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we tried to lift a heavy bucket of sand using just our hands... and then what if we used a rope and pulley like in this picture. Would it be easier or harder? Let's find out!\"\n\n3. **Record student predictions** on chart paper. Save this for comparison in the Evaluate phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become machine scientists. We're going to build our own pulley system and discover how machines like the one in this picture make lifting easier!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover firsthand how a pulley system reduces effort needed to lift an object.\n\n**Materials (per pair/small group of 3-4):**\n- Plastic cup or small bucket\n- 10-15 sand/pebbles or washers (to make it \"heavy\")\n- 3-4 feet of rope or strong string\n- Wooden dowel, stick, or pencil (to serve as axle)\n- Two chairs or a sturdy table edge\n- Paper clips (for attaching rope)\n- Chart paper or notebook for recording\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up the investigation:** Arrange two chairs facing each other, about 2 feet apart. The wooden dowel will rest horizontally across the tops of the chairs (like a clothesline).\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"First, try to lift the bucket by hand. How does it feel? Is it easy or hard?\" (Record: easy or hard.)\n   - \"Now, tie one end of the rope to the bucket handle.\"\n   - \"Drape the rope over the wooden dowel so it hangs down on both sides—like when you put a rope over a tree branch.\"\n   - \"Hold the other end of the rope and pull down. Try to lift the bucket by pulling down on the rope.\"\n   - \"How does it feel now? Is it easier or harder than lifting by hand?\" (Record observations.)\n   - \"What changed? What is the rope and stick doing to help?\" (Guide them to observe: the rope changes direction; the stick stays in place; pulling down lifts the bucket up.)\n\n3. **Documentation:**\n   - Students draw pictures showing: lifting by hand vs. lifting with the pulley\n   - Students use simple words or teacher scribes to write: \"Lifting by hand was ___. Lifting with the pulley was ___.\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What are you noticing? What's making this easier?\" \n   - Resist telling them the answer—let them discover through manipulation.\n   - Help adjust setups that aren't working mechanically, but don't explain why.\n   - Encourage all students to take turns pulling and observing.\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students will observe that using the pulley requires the same or less effort than lifting by hand.\n   - Students will notice the rope changes direction and that the fixed dowel/stick plays a role.\n   - Students will record or communicate that tools (the pulley) make lifting easier or different.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect the pulley system to the photograph and real machines.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original photograph\n- Chart paper with student predictions and observations from Explore\n- Word cards: \"pulley,\" \"effort,\" \"load,\" \"rope,\" \"simple machine\"\n- Real or toy pulley system if available (optional visual aid)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs/groups to briefly share what they discovered: \"Was the pulley easier or harder? What did you notice about the rope?\"\n   - Record key observations on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary:** (Use student-friendly language and point to examples in both the photograph and their own investigation)\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|----------------------------|\n   | **Pulley** | A wheel with a rope that helps us lift or move things. The rope goes over or around the wheel. |\n   | **Simple Machine** | A tool that makes work easier. A pulley is a simple machine. |\n   | **Effort** | The push or pull you have to use to make something move. (Point to the worker pulling the rope.) |\n   | **Load** | The thing you're trying to lift or move. (In the photo: the worker pulling the rope is lifting a load. In your activity: the bucket with sand is the load.) |\n   | **Rope** | A long, strong material that can be pulled or pushed to move things. |\n\n3. **Make Connections:**\n   - \"Look at this picture again. Do you see a rope? Do you see something round that the rope goes over?\" (Point to the boom and cable on the truck.)\n   - \"The truck has a BIG pulley system called a 'boom' or 'crane.' It works like your rope and stick, but it's much, much stronger because the truck's engine does the work instead of a person.\"\n   - \"Why do you think the worker is still holding a rope even though the truck is doing the lifting?\" (Guide them: the worker controls where the load goes; the rope helps guide it safely.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individuals: \"If you wanted to lift your backpack, would a pulley help? Why?\"\n   - \"What's easier—lifting a bucket with your hands or lifting it with a rope over a stick?\"\n   - Invite students to point to the pulley in the photograph.\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students can name and point to a pulley in both the photograph and their investigation.\n   - Students understand that pulleys and simple machines make work easier.\n   - Students can use the word \"pulley\" or \"simple machine\" in a sentence with teacher support.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of pulleys by redesigning their system or solving a new challenge.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original materials from Explore (rope, sticks, buckets, etc.)\n- Additional challenge items: heavier loads (books, small weighted boxes), different rope lengths, plastic bags to carry the load, a second bucket\n- Photograph of the boom truck displayed\n- Challenge cards with simple problems (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present a Real-World Challenge:**\n   - \"The worker in the picture needs to move something heavier now. It's too heavy for the original pulley. How could we change our pulley system to make it even better at lifting heavy things?\"\n   - Offer challenge options (choose 1-2 appropriate to your group):\n     - *Challenge A (Easier):* \"Can you add MORE sand to your bucket? Does the pulley still help? Does it feel the same or different?\"\n     - *Challenge B (Medium):* \"What if we make the rope longer or shorter? Does that change how hard it is to pull?\"\n     - *Challenge C (Harder):* \"Can you design a system using TWO ropes or TWO pulleys? Does it make lifting easier?\"\n\n2. **Student Activity:**\n   - Students test their new design or challenge.\n   - They predict: \"I think making the load heavier will make it ___ to pull.\"\n   - They observe and record: \"It was ___. My prediction was right / wrong.\"\n   - They discuss with a partner: \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n\n3. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - Show the boom truck photo again. \"This machine uses a VERY powerful pulley system. It can lift things that are as heavy as five elephants! Engineers designed it to solve the problem of moving really heavy things safely. What other things do you see that need to be lifted or moved?\" (Boxes, furniture, construction materials, etc.)\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Facilitate the challenge; ask guiding questions rather than giving answers.\n   - Encourage comparison: \"Your first pulley was ___. Your new one is ___. What changed?\"\n   - Help students make the connection between their small investigation and the large truck in the photo.\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students conduct a modified investigation showing deeper thinking about pulleys.\n   - Students can explain (with support) how changing something about the pulley system affects how hard it is to lift.\n   - Students begin to understand that machines can be made better or stronger for harder jobs.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pulleys, simple machines, and how they solve work problems.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n- **Observation:** Circulate during Explore and Elaborate. Listen for students using vocabulary like \"pulley,\" \"easier,\" \"rope,\" \"lift.\" Note who can describe what they're observing.\n- **Questioning:** Ask: \"Why is the pulley helping you?\" and \"What would happen if the rope broke?\" to gauge understanding.\n- **Drawings and Recordings:** Review student sketches and written observations from Explore phase for evidence they understand the pulley's role.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nAdminister one or more of these (choose based on your students' communication style):\n\n**Option 1 – Oral (for students who are not yet writing):**\nShow the photograph and ask individually:\n1. \"What is the machine in this picture doing?\" (Success: Student identifies lifting/moving something.)\n2. \"Why do you think they need this big machine?\" (Success: Student indicates weight, difficulty, or that humans need help.)\n3. \"How is this like the pulley we made?\" (Success: Student mentions rope, pulling, or making work easier.)\n\n**Option 2 – Drawing + Dictation:**\n- \"Draw a picture of our pulley system.\"\n- \"Tell me one way it helps us.\" (Teacher writes student's words below the drawing.)\n\n**Option 3 – Multiple Choice / Match (with pictures):**\n- Show picture of pulley; ask: \"What does a pulley help us do?\" \n  - A) Make it easier to lift things ✓\n  - B) Make things taste better\n  - C) Make things warm\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify a pulley or simple machine in a photograph.\n- ✓ Student can describe (orally or with support) that pulleys make work easier.\n- ✓ Student can perform an action with the pulley system that demonstrates understanding (pulling the rope to lift the load).\n- ✓ Student attempts to use the word \"pulley,\" \"rope,\" or \"easier\" to describe the experience.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will understand that the pulley system makes lifting easier than lifting by hand alone.\n- Students will identify the rope and the fixed point (stick/dowel) as key parts.\n- Students will make a connection between their investigation and the photograph.\n- Advanced students may hypothesize about why the boom truck needs to be so big and strong.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce the Setup Complexity:** Use a pre-made pulley system (a real pulley attached to a sturdy structure) rather than having students assemble one. This removes the mechanical building step and lets them focus on the lifting concept.\n\n2. **Provide Sentence Frames for Communication:** \n   - \"The pulley helps by _______.\"\n   - \"Lifting by hand was ___. Lifting with the pulley was ___.\"\n   - Provide word cards or picture cards of key terms to reduce language demands.\n\n3. **Pair with a Strong Partner:** During Explore, pair a struggling reader/communicator with a stronger peer. Let them divide roles: one predicts, one records; one pulls, one observes.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Introduce Multiple Pulleys:** Show a photo of a block-and-tackle system (multiple pulleys working together). Ask: \"If one pulley makes lifting easier, what would TWO or THREE pulleys do?\" Let advanced students design or test a multi-pulley system and compare the effort needed.\n\n2. **Research Other Simple Machines:** Introduce the concept of levers, inclined planes, or wheels. Ask: \"Are there OTHER tools that make work easier, like the pulley?\" Have them find examples in the classroom or at home (door handles, scissors, ramps, etc.).\n\n3. **Problem-Solving Extension:** Present a scenario: \"The worker needs to lift the load to a very high place AND lower it gently to the ground. How would they use the rope and pulley to do both safely?\" Encourage them to draw or build a solution.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Pulley Walk or Scavenger Hunt:**\n   - Take students on a walk around the school or classroom to find real pulleys and simple machines: flagpole ropes, window blinds, playground equipment (swings, seesaws), door openers, etc.\n   - For each one found, discuss: \"What is this machine lifting or moving? How does it make work easier?\"\n   - Create a classroom chart of \"Pulleys and Machines We Found.\"\n\n2. **Design a Rescue Mission:**\n   - Use a toy figurine or small animal toy \"stuck\" on a high shelf or piece of furniture.\n   - Challenge students to design a pulley system (using rope, string, small baskets, cups) to \"rescue\" the toy without climbing or reaching beyond their safe reach.\n   - Document the design with drawings and have students explain their solution to the class.\n\n3. **Read-Aloud + Discussion:**\n   - Read a picture book about simple machines or pulleys (e.g., *Simple Machines* by David Adler, or *Trucks* by Gail Gibbons).\n   - After reading, revisit the boom truck photograph and ask: \"How does the truck in our picture use the ideas from the book?\"\n   - Discuss: \"What would happen to construction or moving companies if we didn't have machines like this?\"\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
