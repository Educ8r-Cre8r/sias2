Describe temperature as a physical property that can be measured using a thermometer.\n2. Use a thermometer (or simulated thermometer data) to compare the temperatures of different objects and locations.\n3. Explain how heat causes changes in objects and predict whether those changes can be reversed or are permanent.\n4. Identify examples of heating and cooling in everyday classroom and home situations.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nActivate curiosity about temperature measurement and heat by connecting the photograph to students' everyday experiences.\n\n#### Materials\n- Printed photograph of the infrared thermometer (enlarged or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- 3-4 objects at room temperature (wooden block, plastic toy, metal spoon, book)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Hook with the Photograph:**\nDisplay the photograph and say: *\"Today we're going to be Heat Detectives! Look at this special tool. What do you see? What do you think it does? Why is someone pointing it at a brick wall?\"*\n\nAllow 2-3 student responses. Then say: *\"This is called a thermometer. It's a special tool that tells us how hot or cold something is. Watch—I'm going to use this tool to find out the temperature of different things in our classroom. But first, I want to know what YOU think...\"*\n\n**Discussion Questions (calibrated for Second Grade):**\n\n1. *\"When you touch something, how do you know if it's hot or cold?\"* (Students may say: it feels hot, it feels cold, it's warm, etc.)\n\n2. *\"Can you think of something in this classroom that feels warm? Something that feels cold?\"* (Students might mention: the sunny window, the floor, the water fountain, etc.)\n\n3. *\"What do you think this number on the screen (point to 113.5) means?\"* (Guide students to understand it's a measurement.)\n\n4. *\"Do you think different places in our classroom are different temperatures? Why or why not?\"* (Students may predict yes because sun hits different areas, some areas are shadier, etc.)\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n*\"I wonder... is the temperature the same everywhere in our classroom? Is it the same on sunny spots and shady spots? Is it the same near the heater? That's what we're going to discover together!\"*\n\n#### Transition\n*\"Let's become Heat Detectives and go explore our classroom to find hot and cold spots!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate temperature differences in their classroom environment through hands-on measurement and observation, discovering that temperature varies by location and object.\n\n#### Materials\n- 4-5 classroom thermometers (traditional alcohol or digital thermometers at room temperature) OR printed temperature cards with pre-recorded data from different classroom locations (if real thermometers are limited)\n- Chart paper or student worksheet with labeled spaces: \"Sunny Window Area,\" \"Shady Corner,\" \"Near Heater/Radiator,\" \"Our Desk,\" \"Outside Door Area\"\n- Clipboards (one per pair or small group)\n- Pencils or crayons\n- Optional: Hand-drawn thermometer template for recording\n- Real or toy infrared thermometer (if available) for demonstration\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Student Directions (provide visually with pictures for struggling readers):**\n\n1. *\"You are a Heat Detective. Your job is to find the temperature of different places in our classroom.\"*\n\n2. *\"With your partner, you will go to one special location I've marked with a sticker. Wait 30 seconds for the thermometer to settle.\"*\n\n3. *\"Read the number on the thermometer together. One partner reads it out loud; the other writes it on your chart.\"*\n\n4. *\"Draw a picture of what that spot looks like—is there sunlight? Is it near something warm?\"*\n\n5. *\"Come back to share your discovery!\"*\n\n**How the Activity Connects to the Photograph:**\nExplain: *\"The thermometer in the picture was checking how hot the brick wall was in the sun. We're going to check different temperatures around our classroom, just like a real scientist!\"*\n\n**What Students Should Record or Document:**\n- The temperature number at each location\n- A simple drawing of the location (window, corner, etc.)\n- A description (teacher scribes): \"warm place\" or \"cool place\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Assign pairs to specific locations (rotate so each pair gets one spot).\n- Circulate and listen to student conversations: *\"What number do you see? Is that hotter or colder than where we started?\"*\n- Prompt without answering: *\"Do you notice any patterns? Are the sunny spots different from the shady spots?\"*\n- Help students read thermometers if needed; accept approximate readings for Second Grade.\n- Have students predict *before* measuring: *\"Do you think this spot will be warmer or cooler than the last place?\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students will discover that different locations have different temperatures.\n- Most students will notice that sunny areas tend to be warmer than shady areas.\n- Students will have recorded at least 4-5 temperature measurements with drawings.\n- Students will begin to use words like \"hotter,\" \"colder,\" \"warmer,\" \"cooler\" when comparing locations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to the concept of temperature and heat energy.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart with student temperature data compiled from Explore phase\n- Large thermometer poster or visual showing the scale (cold to hot)\n- Picture cards of hot/cold items (sun, ice cream, fire, snow, etc.)\n- The original photograph of the infrared thermometer\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\nGather students. Ask: *\"What did we discover, Heat Detectives? Where was the warmest spot? Where was the coldest spot? How do you know?\"*\n\nCreate a simple bar graph or chart on paper showing the temperatures: coldest → warmest. Say: *\"Look! We can see which places are hot and which are cool. Scientists use numbers to tell us exactly how hot or cold something is.\"*\n\n**Introduce Key Vocabulary:**\n\nUse the chart, visuals, and student body movements to teach:\n\n1. **Temperature** – *\"Temperature tells us how hot or cold something is. We measure it with a thermometer.\"* (Have students hold up fingers to show \"high temperature\" = stretched high, \"low temperature\" = crouched low.)\n\n2. **Heat** – *\"Heat is the energy that makes things warm. Heat moves from hot places to cold places. Heat comes from the sun, fire, heaters, and our bodies!\"* (Have students warm their hands together by rubbing them—that's heat energy!)\n\n3. **Thermometer** – *\"A thermometer is a tool that measures temperature. It has numbers that tell us how hot or cold something is.\"* (Show the photograph again: \"This special thermometer measured the heat in the brick wall!\")\n\n4. **Warm** – *\"When something has a lot of heat energy, we say it's warm or hot.\"*\n\n5. **Cool** – *\"When something has less heat energy, we say it's cool or cold.\"*\n\n**Connections Back to the Photograph and Explore Activity:**\nSay: *\"The thermometer in this picture (show photograph) is just like the ones we used! It showed the temperature of the brick wall in the sunshine. Our thermometers showed us the temperature of different parts of our classroom. Both tools help scientists and detectives measure heat!\"*\n\n**Check for Understanding Strategy:**\n\nUse \"Fist to Five\" (students hold up fingers 0-5 to show how well they understand):\n- *\"I'm going to say a sentence. If you think it's TRUE, show me a 5. If you think it's FALSE, show me a 0.\"*\n  - *\"A thermometer measures how hot or cold something is.\"* (Should be 5s)\n  - *\"The sunny window and the shady corner have the same temperature.\"* (Should be 0s if students observed differences)\n  - *\"Heat moves from warm places to cold places.\"* (Should be 5s after discussion)\n\n#### Vocabulary\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Temperature** | A number that tells us how hot or cold something is. |\n| **Thermometer** | A tool that measures temperature. |\n| **Heat** | The energy that makes things warm. Heat comes from the sun, fire, and warm things. |\n| **Warm/Hot** | When something has a lot of heat energy. |\n| **Cool/Cold** | When something has less heat energy. |\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students will be able to define temperature and thermometer in their own words.\n- Students will understand that heat is energy that makes things warm.\n- Students will identify sources of heat in their classroom (sun, heater, bodies).\n- Students will use comparative language: \"hotter than,\" \"cooler than,\" \"warmer than.\"\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nApply temperature and heat concepts to new contexts by predicting how heat changes objects and exploring reversible vs. irreversible changes.\n\n#### Materials\n- Ice cubes (several per group)\n- Warm water (not hot) in cups or bowls (pre-warmed; teacher keeps out of reach initially)\n- Room-temperature water in cups\n- Small containers or plastic bags\n- Chart paper labeled \"Reversible\" and \"Not Reversible\"\n- Picture cards of: melting ice cream, melting candle, cooking egg, freezing juice into a popsicle, baking bread, melting butter\n- Optional: informal thermometers or temperature-sensitive strips\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part 1: Predict the Change (5 minutes)**\n\nShow students an ice cube. Say: *\"This ice is very cold. What do you think will happen if we put it in warm water? Will the ice change?\"*\n\nHave students discuss with a partner for 1 minute. Ask for 2-3 predictions. Say: *\"Let's test your ideas!\"*\n\n**Part 2: Observe Heat Causing Change (8 minutes)**\n\nDivide students into small groups (3-4 per group). Give each group:\n- One ice cube in a container\n- Access to room-temperature water\n- (Optional: a warm-water station run by the teacher for safety)\n\nSay: *\"Put your ice cube in room-temperature water. What do you observe? Is it changing? Now, I'm going to add some warm water to your container. Watch carefully. What's happening?\"*\n\nTeacher adds warm water to each group's container. Students observe for 2-3 minutes.\n\nAsk: *\"What happened? Did the ice change? Why? Was heat involved?\"*\n\nGuide students to recognize: *\"The warm water had heat energy. That heat made the ice change into water. The heat moved from the warm water to the cold ice!\"*\n\n**Part 3: Reversible vs. Irreversible Changes (5 minutes)**\n\nIntroduce the idea: *\"Some changes caused by heat can be undone—we call those REVERSIBLE. Some changes cannot be undone—we call those IRREVERSIBLE.\"*\n\nShow picture cards one at a time:\n- **Ice melting** → *\"Can we freeze it again? YES! Reversible!\"*\n- **Egg cooking** → *\"Can we un-cook this egg? NO! Not reversible!\"*\n- **Butter melting** → *\"Can we freeze it again? YES! Reversible!\"*\n- **Bread baking** → *\"Can we unbake bread? NO! Not reversible!\"*\n\nPlace each card on the \"Reversible\" or \"Not Reversible\" chart as you discuss.\n\n#### Teacher Role\n\n- Manage water stations and ensure safety (you add warm water; students observe).\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"What's happening to the ice? Why is it changing? Is heat involved? Can we make ice again if we freeze the water?\"*\n- Facilitate group discussions without giving answers.\n- Reinforce vocabulary: \"Heat made the ice change!\"\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students will observe and describe that heat causes ice to melt.\n- Students will begin to understand that some changes from heating can be reversed (melting → freezing) while others cannot (cooking an egg).\n- Students will use heat vocabulary: \"The warm water gave heat to the ice.\"\n- Students will sort pictures and experiences into reversible and irreversible categories (with support).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of temperature, heat, and changes caused by heating/cooling.\n\n#### Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson)\n\n- **Observation During Explore:** Did students accurately record temperatures and make observations about warm vs. cool spots?\n- **Vocabulary Check During Explain:** Could students explain what a thermometer is and what temperature means?\n- **Questioning During Elaborate:** Did students predict what would happen to ice in warm water? Could they explain that heat caused the change?\n\n#### Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment\n\n**Option 1: Picture Sort (Easiest for all learners)**\n\nShow students four pictures:\n1. Ice cream melting in the sun\n2. Water freezing into ice\n3. A heater warming a room\n4. A frog sitting on a cool log\n\nAsk: *\"Point to a picture that shows heat causing something to change. Now point to a picture that shows something cool.\"*\n\nSuccess: Students correctly identify at least 2-3 pictures.\n\n**Option 2: Sentence Stems with Drawings (Core Assessment)**\n\nGive each student a worksheet with sentence stems and space for drawing:\n\n*\"Temperature tells us _______________________\"*\n\n*\"A thermometer measures _______________________\"*\n\n*\"Heat makes things _______________________\"*\n\n*\"When ice gets warm, it changes into _______________________\"*\n\nStudents draw pictures to match each sentence. Teacher or aide scribes if needed.\n\nSuccess: Students complete 3 of 4 stems correctly with reasonable drawings.\n\n**Option 3: Verbal Interview (For students needing more support)**\n\nAsk individually:\n1. *\"Show me the thermometer. What does it do?\"*\n2. *\"Is this room warm or cool? How do you know?\"*\n3. *\"What happens to ice when it's warm? Why?\"*\n\nSuccess: Student answers at least 2 of 3 questions with the main idea correct.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n**Students will demonstrate understanding by:**\n\n- Explaining that a thermometer measures temperature.\n- Identifying warm and cool places/objects in their environment.\n- Describing how heat causes ice to melt (reversible change).\n- Using comparative language: \"hotter,\" \"cooler,\" \"warmer,\" \"colder.\"\n- Understanding that heat comes from sources like the sun and heaters.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ 80%+ of students score \"proficient\" on exit ticket (3+ correct responses).\n- ✓ Students can define temperature and thermometer in their own words.\n- ✓ Students make accurate observations and predictions during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use primarily \"hot\" and \"cold\" rather than \"temperature.\" Pre-teach \"thermometer\" with repeated exposure and pointing.\n\n2. **Thermometer Reading Support:** Provide thermometers with large, easy-to-read numbers. Use pre-printed temperature cards (e.g., \"77°F\") that students match rather than reading directly. Pair students with stronger readers.\n\n3. **Hands-On Focus:** Emphasize the tactile and visual experiences (watching ice melt, feeling warm water) over the numerical measurements. Accept that some students may not precisely read temperatures in Session 1.\n\n4. **Sentence Frames for Recording:** Instead of open-ended writing, provide frames: *\"This place is _____ (warm/cool). I know because _____.\"* Teacher or aide scribes.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Precise Temperature Comparison:** Have students calculate the *difference* between two temperature readings: *\"The sunny spot is 75°F and the shady corner is 68°F. How much warmer is the sunny spot?\"* (Can use a number line or simple subtraction.)\n\n2. **Hypothesis Prediction:** Ask: *\"If we put an ice cube in the freezer (which is very cold), what do you think will happen? Will it melt? Why or why not?\"* Have students predict what happens when heat is removed.\n\n3. **Heat Transfer Investigation:** Investigate which materials conduct heat quickly: *\"If we put a metal spoon and a wooden spoon in warm water, which one will feel hot first? Why?\"* This bridges to heat transfer concepts.\n\n4. **Reversible vs. Irreversible Sorting:** Extend the challenge by providing a wider range of pictures or scenarios and asking students to *explain* their reasoning: *\"Is this change reversible? How do you know?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### Extension 1: Classroom Heat Hunt (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Activity:** Have students search the classroom for hidden \"heat sources.\" Provide picture cards of the sun, fire, heater, light bulb, and stove. Students match each source to examples in the classroom or their home (e.g., \"The window brings in heat from the sun\"). Create a poster: \"Heat Sources We Found!\"\n\n**Connection:** Reinforces that heat comes from multiple sources and links physical science concepts to real-world observation.\n\n---\n\n### Extension 2: Temperature Recording Over Time (Homework or Follow-Up Lesson)\n\n**Activity:** Give each student a simple chart to record the temperature in their home kitchen at three times: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Is it warmer when the oven or stove is on? Students bring charts back and discuss patterns. Create a class graph of findings.\n\n**Connection:** Extends learning to home environment; introduces data collection and pattern recognition.\n\n---\n\n### Extension 3: Frozen vs. Melted Art (20 minutes + drying time)\n\n**Activity:** Provide colored ice cubes (freeze water with food coloring). Students place ice cubes on white paper and watch as they melt, creating a \"heat art\" painting. Discuss: *\"The heat from the room made the ice melt and the colors spread. Is this change reversible or not reversible?\"*\n\n**Connection:** Makes heat concepts visual and creative; engages kinesthetic learners; reinforces reversible/irreversible change concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure warm water is not too hot (lukewarm is sufficient for demonstrating melting). Supervise water stations closely.\n- **Thermometer Selection:** Traditional classroom thermometers work well. If digital, practice reading with students ahead of time.\n- **Pacing:** Break into two shorter sessions if your class has limited attention span. Session 1 = Engage + Explore. Session 2 = Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate.\n- **Visual Supports:** Use picture cards and gestures (hands up for \"hot,\" low for \"cold\") throughout to support varied learners.\n- **Connection to Photograph:** Return to the infrared thermometer image multiple times. Explain that it's a *special thermometer* that measures heat from far away, but it works the same way as classroom thermometers—it tells us how hot or cold something is.",
