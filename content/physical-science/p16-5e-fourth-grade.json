ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by connecting the photograph to students' everyday experiences with food.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of the fried shrimp dish (one per pair or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Hook:** Show the photograph of the fried shrimp to students. Ask them to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking, just observing.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (ask one at a time, allowing 1-2 minutes for each):**\n   - \"What do you notice about the color of the shrimp? Why do you think they look golden-brown and crispy instead of gray and soft?\"\n   - \"If you've ever watched food cooking, what changes did you see happen? Describe them.\"\n   - \"Where does the energy come from that makes this change happen? What is the source of that energy?\"\n   - \"Do you think we could make this shrimp look like this without heat? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we could see inside the shrimp while it was cooking—what do you think is changing on the inside that makes it look so different on the outside?\"\n\n4. **Record Student Ideas:** Chart student responses on paper so they can revisit these ideas later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be food scientists and test what heat energy does to different foods. We'll make observations just like real scientists do, and you'll discover what changes happen when we add heat energy to food.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (23 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how thermal energy causes observable changes in food materials through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- Small pieces of raw potato (about 1-inch cubes, 3 pieces per group)\n- Raw egg white in a small clear dish (about 2 tablespoons)\n- Uncooked pasta (4-5 pieces, dry)\n- Three small paper plates or clear containers labeled A, B, and C\n- Warm water (about 50°C/120°F) in a bowl—**teacher prepares this**\n- Hot water (about 80°C/175°F) in a second bowl—**teacher prepares this**\n- One cup of room-temperature water (control)\n- Thermometer (one per group, optional but helpful)\n- Observation sheet with picture boxes or lines for recording\n- Plastic cups or small clear containers\n- Spoon for handling food pieces\n- Paper towels\n\n**Safety Note:** Teacher handles all hot water. Students only observe the materials in hot water; they do NOT handle hot water directly. Hot water is poured by teacher into labeled containers before students begin. Use containers that stay cool on the outside (small bowls with handles or mugs).\n\n**Activity: Station-Based Investigation**\n\n**Step 1: Set-Up (2 minutes)**\n- Arrange students in groups of 3-4.\n- Give each group three labeled cups: Room Temp (Control), Warm Water, and Hot Water.\n- Place pre-measured water in each cup. Teacher fills the warm and hot water cups just before students begin.\n- Place one piece of raw potato, one piece of raw pasta, and a small amount of egg white into each cup.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Observations (3 minutes)**\n- Students draw or write descriptions of what the food looks like BEFORE it touches water (color, texture, hardness, transparency, smell if appropriate).\n- Ask: \"What do these foods have in common? How are they different?\"\n\n**Step 3: Place in Water—Teacher Demonstrates First (1 minute)**\n- Teacher demonstrates proper placement of materials into the warm water cup.\n- Students place identical food samples into their warm and hot water cups at the same time. Control sample stays in room-temperature water.\n- Set a timer for 3 minutes.\n\n**Step 4: Observations During Heating (3 minutes)**\n- While waiting, students watch and record what they see happening:\n  - Does the color change? Describe it.\n  - Does the texture feel different when they look at it? (Students observe but do not touch hot materials.)\n  - Is the food getting softer or harder?\n  - Can they see the egg white changing? How?\n- Teacher circulates and asks: \"What energy is making this change happen? Where is that energy coming from?\"\n\n**Step 5: Remove and Cool (5 minutes)**\n- Teacher removes the warm and hot water cups after 3 minutes.\n- Students carefully observe the cooked/heated materials.\n- Teacher places hot water cups in a safe location to cool naturally while students work with warm water results.\n- Students handle only the warm water samples (which cool quickly). Hot water samples are observed but not touched.\n\n**Step 6: Compare and Record (9 minutes)**\n- Students create a data table or draw pictures comparing:\n  - **Room Temperature (Control):** What it looks and feels like now\n  - **Warm Water:** What changed? Color? Texture? Hardness?\n  - **Hot Water:** What changed? More or less change than warm water?\n- Students write or draw: \"The heat energy made the food change by...\"\n- Encourage them to use words like: softer, firmer, color changed, became opaque, became transparent, texture changed, broke apart.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group and ask probing questions: \"What happened in the hot water that didn't happen in the room temperature water?\" \"Why do you think hot water caused more change?\"\n- Guide students to notice that hot water = more energy = more change.\n- Do NOT give explanations yet; let students wonder and observe.\n- Ensure safety—no students touch hot materials.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Observation that heat caused the egg white to become opaque (cloudy) and firm.\n- Raw potato and pasta became softer and more pliable in hot water than in room temperature.\n- Hot water caused MORE change than warm water, showing that more thermal energy = bigger changes.\n- Students should draw or write observations showing they noticed these differences.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the science behind the observations using evidence from the Explore phase.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n- Photograph of fried shrimp (from Engage)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures (heat energy, thermal energy, transfer, change)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Group Share-Out (5 minutes)**\n- Ask 2-3 groups to share one observation about what happened in their hot water cup.\n- Record observations on chart paper.\n- Ask follow-up: \"Why do you think the hot water caused these changes?\"\n\n**Step 2: Introduce Vocabulary (7 minutes)**\n\nPresent these terms with student-friendly definitions. Use visuals and hand motions to reinforce:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Connection to Activity** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Thermal Energy (Heat Energy)** | The energy that makes things hot and causes movement of tiny particles we can't see. | The hot water had MORE thermal energy than the warm water, which is why it caused bigger changes. |\n| **Energy Transfer** | When energy moves from one thing to another. For example, heat energy moves FROM the hot water TO the food. | Heat energy from the water transferred into the potato, egg, and pasta, making them change. |\n| **Change in Properties** | When something looks or feels different—like color, texture, hardness, or transparency. | The egg white CHANGED from clear to white and cloudy because heat energy changed how it looked. |\n| **Speed of Change** | How fast or slow a change happens. More thermal energy = FASTER changes. | The HOT water made changes happen FASTER than the warm water because it had more thermal energy. |\n\n**Step 3: Connect to the Photograph (4 minutes)**\n- Show the fried shrimp photograph again.\n- Say: \"Remember when we looked at this picture? The shrimp started out gray and soft, but after heat energy from the hot oil transferred to it, the shrimp changed to golden-brown and crispy. This is the same kind of change you just observed in your investigation!\"\n- Ask: \"Which had more thermal energy—the room temperature water or the hot water? How do you know?\" (The hot water caused BIGGER and FASTER changes, so it had more thermal energy.)\n\n**Step 4: Check for Understanding (2 minutes)**\n- Ask: \"If I wanted to cook food even faster, what would I need to do?\" (Use even HOTTER water or heat source—more thermal energy = faster change)\n- Ask: \"Can you point to a place in the photograph where you think thermal energy transferred from the oil to the shrimp?\" (Students point to the coating, the color change, etc.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Thermal Energy:** The energy that comes from heat; it makes things hot and causes tiny invisible particles to move faster.\n- **Energy Transfer:** When energy moves from one object to another (example: heat moving from hot water into cold food).\n- **Change in Properties:** When something looks, feels, or acts differently (example: color changes, texture changes, becoming softer or harder).\n- **Speed of Change:** How fast or slow something changes; more thermal energy makes changes happen faster.\n- **Heat Source:** The thing that provides the thermal energy (example: stove, oven, hot oil, hot water).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain that heat energy transferred FROM the water TO the food.\n- Students understand that more thermal energy (hotter water) caused bigger and faster changes.\n- Students can use the word \"transfer\" to describe energy moving from one place to another.\n- Students connect the investigation to real cooking (like the fried shrimp photograph).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (17 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of thermal energy transfer by designing and conducting a new investigation or solving a real-world problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Two identical clear cups\n- Cold water (room temperature) in one cup\n- Hot water (teacher-prepared, ~75°C/170°F) in the second cup\n- Two identical tea bags or drops of food coloring (red or blue recommended)\n- Stopwatch or timer with second hand\n- Chart paper to record predictions and results\n- Pencil for recording times\n\n**Activity: Speed Matters Investigation**\n\n**Scenario:** \"Imagine you need to make tea quickly for a guest, but you only have cold water and hot water. Which water will change the tea faster? Let's test to see how thermal energy affects the SPEED of change!\"\n\n**Step 1: Make Predictions (2 minutes)**\n- Show students both cups of water.\n- Ask: \"Which cup has more thermal energy—the hot water or the cold water?\"\n- Ask: \"If we add a tea bag (or food coloring) to each cup at the same time, which one do you predict will change color FASTER? Why?\"\n- Record predictions on chart paper.\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Test (1 minute)**\n- Place a tea bag (or add 2-3 drops of food coloring) into each cup at the EXACT same time.\n- Emphasize: \"The only difference between these two cups is the thermal energy in the water. Everything else is the same.\"\n\n**Step 3: Observe and Time (8 minutes)**\n- Start the timer immediately.\n- Have students watch and count how long it takes:\n  - For the cold water to change color slightly (start changing)\n  - For the hot water to change color (should be much faster)\n- Call out times every 10 seconds: \"10 seconds... cold water is [slightly/not] changing... hot water is [very/very quickly] changing...\"\n- Stop timing when both cups have changed color noticeably, or after 60 seconds (whichever comes first).\n\n**Step 4: Record Results (3 minutes)**\n- Create a simple chart:\n  - **Cold Water:** Took ___ seconds to change color\n  - **Hot Water:** Took ___ seconds to change color\n- Ask: \"Which changed faster? By how much? Why?\"\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Concept (3 minutes)**\n- Ask: \"How does this help us understand why the shrimp in the photograph cooked so fast in the hot oil instead of in room-temperature water?\"\n- Ask: \"If a chef wants to cook food really quickly, what should they use—cold water or hot water? Why?\"\n- Ask: \"What job or activity in real life uses thermal energy to make changes happen FAST?\" (Toaster, microwave, grilling, steaming vegetables, etc.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the timing accurately.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What is different about these two cups? What is the same? What is causing the difference in speed?\"\n- Help students see that THERMAL ENERGY is the key variable affecting speed.\n- Do not tell students the answer; let them discover it.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that hot water transfers color much FASTER than cold water.\n- Students explicitly connect this to the idea that more thermal energy = faster changes.\n- Students apply their learning to real-world cooking and food preparation.\n- Students articulate a causal relationship: \"More thermal energy made the change happen faster.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of thermal energy transfer and how it causes observable changes in materials.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n- During Explore: Observe student recordings and ask: \"What changed? Why did it change?\"\n- During Explain: Ask students to point to evidence in their observations that matches vocabulary terms.\n- During Elaborate: Listen to student predictions and reasoning about why hot water changes color faster.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nProvide each student with a sheet containing these prompts (students can respond with words, drawings, or both):\n\n1. **Observation Question:**\n   \"Look at this picture of an egg in a pan being cooked. Draw or write what you think is happening to the egg. Use the word 'energy' or 'heat' in your answer.\"\n   *(Show a simple picture of a raw egg next to a cooked egg.)*\n\n2. **Explanation Question:**\n   \"The raw egg looks different from the cooked egg. What caused this change? Where did the energy come from?\"\n   *(Accept answers like: \"Heat/thermal energy from the pan transferred to the egg and made it change.\" or \"Hot energy made the egg white turn white and hard.\")*\n\n3. **Application Question:**\n   \"If you wanted to cook an egg super-fast, would you use warm water or hot water? Explain why using what you learned today.\"\n   *(Accept answers showing understanding that more thermal energy = faster changes.)*\n\n4. **Speed Question:**\n   \"In our tea bag experiment, which water changed color faster—the cold or the hot? Why?\"\n   *(Looking for: \"Hot water changed faster because it had more thermal energy / heat.\")*\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n✓ Student can identify at least 2 observable changes that occurred in their investigation (color, texture, hardness, etc.)  \n✓ Student uses the word \"energy,\" \"heat,\" \"thermal,\" or \"transfer\" in at least one response  \n✓ Student demonstrates understanding that more thermal energy causes faster changes  \n✓ Student can apply the concept to a new scenario (cooking eggs, food prep, etc.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify that thermal energy caused observable changes in food.\n- 75% of students can explain that thermal energy transferred from water to food.\n- 70% of students can predict that hotter heat sources cause faster changes.\n- Students show evidence of making and testing predictions about thermal energy effects.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a graphic organizer with labeled pictures showing \"before\" and \"after\" states of food. Students point to or circle what changed instead of writing descriptions.\n   - *Example:* Picture of raw potato → Picture of cooked potato. Student circles: \"Color changed ✓\" \"Got softer ✓\" \"Got harder ✗\"\n\n2. **Pre-Teach Vocabulary with Visuals:** Before Explain phase, show brief video clip (30 seconds) or animated GIF showing water boiling or food cooking, with labels: \"Hot Water = High Thermal Energy\" and \"Cold Water = Low Thermal Energy.\" Pair with hand motions (fast shaking for hot, slow for cold).\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Exit Ticket:** Provide written sentence starters so students complete rather than generate from scratch:\n   - \"The thermal energy made the egg change because _____.\"\n   - \"Hot water changed the color faster than cold water because _____.\"\n   - \"I know thermal energy transferred because I saw _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Test Multiple Variables:** Invite advanced students to predict and test how different AMOUNTS of food affect cooking time. \n   - Example: \"Will a bigger piece of potato or a smaller piece change faster in hot water? Let's test with a large cube and a small cube.\"\n   - Students predict, test, and explain results using their understanding of thermal energy.\n\n2. **Reverse Engineering:** Show the fried shrimp photograph and ask: \"If we wanted to transform the shrimp BACK to its raw state, would thermal energy help? Why or why not? What would we need to do?\"\n   - This requires students to think critically about whether all changes caused by thermal energy are reversible.\n\n3. **Investigate Other Heat Sources:** Students design a mini-investigation: \"Which heats water faster—a light source, the sun, or a hot plate? Why?\" Requires them to apply understanding of thermal energy to new scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cook Real Food at Home (Take-Home Investigation):**\n   - Send home a simple observation sheet: \"Tonight, watch a meal being cooked. Pick ONE food (egg, pasta, vegetable, chicken). Draw what it looks like BEFORE cooking and AFTER cooking. Write down: What changed? Where did the thermal energy come from? How did it transfer to the food?\"\n   - Students bring back drawings and share in next lesson. This bridges school science to home and reinforces concepts in a familiar context.\n\n2. **Create a \"Heat Energy Changes Food\" Poster:**\n   - Provide poster paper and magazines/printed images of different foods (raw and cooked: chicken, bread, pasta, chocolate chip cookies, etc.).\n   - Students cut and paste before/after pairs and label what thermal energy changes they see.\n   - Write one sentence per food: \"When thermal energy transferred to the _____, the _____ changed by becoming _____.\"\n   - Display in hallway as visual reference for other grades.\n\n3. **Explore Non-Food Thermal Changes (Extension into Subsequent Lessons):**\n   - Challenge students to find things in the classroom or home that have changed because of thermal energy:\n     - Chocolate melting\n     - Ice cream melting\n     - Candle wax melting\n     - Metal expanding when it gets hot\n   - Create a class \"Thermal Energy Changes\" chart and compare food vs. non-food transformations. This prepares students for broader understanding of thermal energy affecting many materials, not just food.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Preparation Notes\n\n- **Prepare water temperatures ahead of time:** Use a thermometer to check. Warm water: ~50°C (122°F). Hot water: ~75–80°C (170–175°F). **Never use boiling water with students; it is unsafe.**\n- **Safety is paramount:** You (the teacher) handle all hot water. Students observe materials in hot water but do not touch or pour.\n- **Prep food samples ahead:** Cut potatoes into equal-sized cubes so comparison is fair. Count out pasta pieces.\n- **Have paper towels and cleanup supplies ready:** Food materials will create minor spills.\n- **Consider student allergies:** If students have food allergies, use non-food materials for the investigation (e.g., clay, gelatin, wax, instead of potato/egg).\n\nThis lesson makes NGSS physical science concepts concrete and observable for fourth graders while maintaining the joy of food and culinary science!",
