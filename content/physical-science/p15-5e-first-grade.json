ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about light and seeing by using the bubble photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy of the photograph (enlarged, if possible)\n- Document camera or projector to display the image large enough for all to see\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: a real bubble solution and bubble wand for demonstration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Do NOT explain what it is yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What's inside the bubble?\"\n   - \"How can we see the things inside the bubble so clearly?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the bubble looks so shiny and bright?\"\n   - \"What would happen if we turned off the lights? Could we still see inside the bubble?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate a brief class discussion** (3-4 minutes). Write student responses on chart paper. Encourage wild ideas—don't correct yet.\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"I think we can see inside the bubble because ___________. Let's investigate together!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be light detectives and find out why light helps us see things. Let's explore with bubbles!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover that light is necessary for seeing objects clearly through hands-on investigation.\n\n**Materials (per pair/small group):**\n- Bubble solution (1 cup)\n- Bubble wand (plastic or pipe cleaner)\n- Small objects to put in/near bubbles: sequins, beads, glitter, small pom-poms, or foam pieces\n- Shallow tray or cup to catch bubbles\n- Flashlight (or smartphone light) for each pair\n- Paper towels\n- Dark cloth or blanket (optional, for blocking light)\n- Observer recording sheet (simple picture chart with \"bright light\" and \"no light\" columns)\n\n**Activity - Student Directions:**\n\n**Station 1: Making Bubbles (10 minutes)**\n\n1. \"Pour some bubble solution into your tray.\"\n2. \"Place a small object (like a bead or sequin) on the bubble wand or near the opening.\"\n3. \"Gently blow to make a bubble with your object inside or touching it.\"\n4. \"Look at your bubble in bright light. Draw what you see on your observer sheet in the 'bright light' box.\"\n5. \"Write or draw one thing you notice: Can you see the object? Is it easy to see?\"\n\n**Station 2: Testing Light (10 minutes)**\n\n1. \"Make another bubble with a new object.\"\n2. \"Shine your flashlight directly at the bubble from different angles.\"\n3. \"Move the flashlight away. What happens to what you see?\"\n4. \"Now, cover the bubble with a dark cloth for 3 seconds. Lift it quickly. Can you see as well without the light?\"\n5. \"Draw what you see in the 'no light/less light' box on your sheet.\"\n\n**Connection to photograph:** \"The bubble in our picture was bright and clear because light was shining on it. Just like your bubbles!\"\n\n**What students should record/document:**\n- Simple drawings comparing what they see in bright light versus when light is blocked\n- One-word observations: \"shiny,\" \"clear,\" \"dark,\" \"hard to see,\" etc.\n- Teacher can record student verbal observations on a class chart\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate between stations, listening to student language.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What's different when the light moves?\" \"Can you see the object better with the light on or off?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answer—guide them to notice.\n- Manage materials and provide paper towels for cleanup.\n- Take photos of student bubbles for later discussion.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students should notice that bubbles are easier to see when light shines on them.\n- Students should observe that when light is blocked or dim, it's harder to see the object in the bubble.\n- Students should make simple drawings or symbols showing the difference.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect observations to the scientific concept that light is necessary for vision.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words written and illustrated\n- Printed photograph from lesson\n- Student observer sheets from Explore phase\n- Simple picture cards showing light, shadow, transparent\n- Optional: a real bubble to demonstrate\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Call on 3-4 pairs to show their drawings and say ONE thing they noticed.\n   - Write their words on the chart paper.\n   - Emphasize: \"You all saw that light helps you see!\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (7-8 minutes):**\n   \n   Display a chart with these terms illustrated:\n   \n   - **Light** — Energy that helps our eyes see things. Without light, everything is dark and hard to see.\n   - **See/Observe** — To use our eyes to look at something carefully.\n   - **Bright** — When there is a lot of light. Things are easy to see.\n   - **Dark** — When there is no light or very little light. Things are hard to see.\n   - **Transparent** — A material you can see through because light passes through it (like the bubble in our picture).\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the bubble photo.\n   - \"This bubble is bright and we can see everything inside. Why? Because light is shining on it! Light bounces off the bubble and the objects, and it goes into our eyes.\"\n   - \"The bubble is transparent—light passes right through it.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If this bubble was in a dark room with no light, what would happen?\"\n   - Ask: \"Can you see the things inside the bubble because the bubble is shiny, or because light is hitting it?\"\n   - Listen for students to connect their observations to light.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Chart (visual display):**\n\n| Word | Picture | Meaning |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| **Light** | ☀️ | Energy that helps us see |\n| **See** | 👀 | Use our eyes to look |\n| **Bright** | ⭐ | A lot of light |\n| **Dark** | 🌙 | No light or little light |\n| **Transparent** | 🫧 | See-through |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students should understand that light is necessary to see objects clearly.\n- Students should use vocabulary words (bright, dark, see, light) in sentences about their observations.\n- Students should be able to point to the bubble photo and explain: \"We see it because light is shining on it.\"\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of light and vision to new scenarios and materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Various objects made of different materials: aluminum foil, plastic wrap, tissue paper, cardboard, water bottles, clear cups, colored plastic sheets, fabric scraps\n- Flashlights (one per pair)\n- Clipboards and paper\n- Optional: small battery-operated tea lights (safe, flameless candles)\n\n**Activity - Light Explorer Challenge:**\n\n**Setup:** Arrange materials around the room in small stations or on a table. Students work in pairs.\n\n**Student task:**\n\n1. \"You are a Light Explorer! Pick a material from our collection.\"\n2. \"Hold it up to your flashlight. Shine the light through it or on it.\"\n3. \"What happens? Can you see the light? Can you see through the material?\"\n4. \"Record your material name and draw: **light can pass through** (write or draw ✓) or **light cannot pass through** (write or draw ✗).\"\n5. \"Move to the next material and test again.\"\n\n**Real-world connection (teacher-led discussion, 2-3 minutes):**\n- \"Where do we see transparent materials in real life?\"\n- Guide answers: windows, eyeglasses, water bottles, plastic bags, car windshields.\n- \"These are made so light can pass through and we can see!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate station rotations.\n- Ask: \"What do you notice about this material and light? Is it easy to see through?\"\n- Encourage students to predict before testing: \"Do you think light will pass through the fabric?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students should classify materials as \"light can pass through\" or \"light cannot pass through.\"\n- Students should recognize that not all materials are transparent.\n- Students should make connections to real-world transparent objects they use every day.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light and vision through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n\n- **Observation checklist** (as students explore):\n  - ☐ Student uses the flashlight to test how light interacts with objects.\n  - ☐ Student makes predictions about what will happen.\n  - ☐ Student uses vocabulary: light, bright, dark, transparent, see.\n  - ☐ Student connects observations to the bubble photograph.\n\n- **Questioning during activities:**\n  - \"Why is it easier to see the bubble when the light is on?\"\n  - \"Can you see through this material? How do you know?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (end of Day 2, 3-5 minutes):**\n\nGive each student a simple exit ticket with these prompts:\n\n**Option 1 (Drawing-based for non-writers):**\n- Draw a picture showing: **Why can we see the bubble in the photograph?**\n- Answer frame (teacher reads aloud): \"We can see the bubble because __________.\"\n- Student draws: light, eyes, brightness, or other evidence.\n\n**Option 2 (Sentence stem for writers):**\n- \"We can see the bubble because ___________________________.\"\n- \"Light helps us see because ______________________________.\"\n- \"This material is transparent because ______________________.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Picture sorting):**\n- Show 4 pictures: a sunny day, a dark room, a window, a brick wall.\n- Ask: \"Which pictures show materials that light can pass through? Point to them.\"\n- Ask: \"Which pictures show when we CAN see easily? Which show when it's HARD to see?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding when they:\n\n1. ✓ Identify that light is necessary to see objects.\n2. ✓ Use evidence from their bubble exploration (\"I saw the object better when the light was on\").\n3. ✓ Correctly describe materials as transparent or not.\n4. ✓ Connect their learning to the photograph: \"The bubble is bright and clear because light is shining on it.\"\n5. ✓ Use vocabulary words (light, bright, dark, see, transparent) correctly in context.\n\n**How to determine if students met objectives:**\n\n- Review exit tickets for evidence that students understand light = vision.\n- Listen to student language during elaboration activities.\n- Check observer sheets for clear drawings/notes showing the difference between bright and dark conditions.\n- Observe student success with the material testing (can they predict and test accurately?).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Pair with a buddy:** Assign struggling students a patient peer partner to share materials and take turns being the \"light holder\" and \"observer.\"\n\n2. **Simplified recording:** Instead of written descriptions, students can use simple symbols (☀ for bright, 🌙 for dark, ✓ for \"see,\" ✗ for \"can't see\") on their observer sheets.\n\n3. **Repeat the core explore task:** Before elaborating with new materials, let students make and test 2-3 bubbles with bright light and 2-3 with blocked light until the pattern is clear. Use consistent questioning: \"Can you see it? Is it bright or dark?\"\n\n4. **Vocabulary support:** Provide a picture card key (light, bright, dark, transparent) that students can point to instead of saying words. Label these visibly in the classroom before the lesson.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Predict and explain:** Ask: \"Why do you think light has to bounce off something for us to see it?\" or \"What would happen if the bubble was colored dark black instead of clear?\" Have them draw and explain their predictions.\n\n2. **Light path investigation:** Challenge students to trace the path of light from the flashlight through the bubble to their eye using string or yarn. Discuss: \"Does light travel in a straight line or bouncing all around?\"\n\n3. **Design a game:** Ask: \"Can you design a game where someone hides an object and uses light to give clues?\" Students can sketch or build a simple light-based hide-and-seek game.\n\n4. **Research real examples:** Provide pictures of lighthouses, flashlights, street lights, and ask: \"Why do we use light in these places?\" Help them connect light to safety and communication.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Shadow Puppet Show (follow-up activity, 20-30 minutes):**\n   - Darken one corner of the classroom.\n   - Set up a flashlight or bright lamp and a white sheet as a screen.\n   - Have students place objects (toys, hands, shapes) between the light and sheet.\n   - Observe and discuss: \"We see the shadow because light can't pass through, but we can see the shape!\"\n   - Connection: This reinforces that light and darkness affect what we see.\n\n2. **Night and Day Observation Journal (homework over 1 week):**\n   - Send home a simple one-page chart: \"Morning (Bright Light) vs. Evening (Dark/Less Light).\"\n   - Ask families: \"Look at the same object in bright sunlight and in a dark room. What's different?\"\n   - Students draw or write observations and bring back to share.\n   - Connection: Students experience light differences in their own homes.\n\n3. **Create a Transparent/Opaque Sorting Display (classroom, 15 minutes):**\n   - Set up a table with two columns: \"Light passes through\" and \"Light does NOT pass through.\"\n   - Over the week, have students bring in safe classroom items to test and sort.\n   - Use flashlights to test each item and place it in the correct column.\n   - Connection: Ongoing vocabulary reinforcement and classification practice.\n\n4. **Luminous Creatures Art (follow-up creative activity, 20 minutes):**\n   - Provide tissue paper, cellophane, and clear plastic cups.\n   - Challenge: \"Design a creature that is transparent (like our bubble) so light can pass through it.\"\n   - Students create and decorate, then hold up to light to see the effect.\n   - Connection: Creative application of transparency concept.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure bubble solution does not come into contact with eyes. Have students wash hands after the activity.\n- **Preparation:** Test bubble solution beforehand to ensure it produces good bubbles. Make fresh solution if it's old.\n- **Adaptations for virtual learning:** Students can use items at home (water bottles, tissue paper, fabric) and test with a lamp or flashlight, then share photos/videos of their observations.\n- **Differentiation tip:** Some students may need the light/dark comparison repeated multiple times. This is developmentally normal for First Grade; repetition builds understanding.\n- **Connection to next lesson:** This lesson builds foundation for understanding shadows (1-PS4-3) and light sources (1-PS4-2).\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is designed to be concrete, observable, and directly tied to what students can see in the bubble photograph. By manipulating light themselves, First Graders move from observation to understanding that light is essential for vision—a critical foundation for physical science.**",
