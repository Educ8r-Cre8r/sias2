Describe how gravity pulls objects downward and explain why the backhoe must exert an upward force to lift heavy loads.\n2. Identify and measure different forces acting on an object and explain how balanced and unbalanced forces affect motion.\n3. Design a simple lever system that demonstrates how machines multiply human force to lift objects.\n4. Support an argument using evidence from observations that machines help us do work by changing the direction or magnitude of forces.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about forces and machines using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the backhoe\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\nDisplay the photograph prominently where all students can see it clearly. Ask students to look silently for 30 seconds and notice details. Then guide discussion with these questions:\n\n1. **\"What do you notice the machine is doing in this picture? What object is it holding, and what do you think it weighs?\"** (Students should observe the bucket full of soil and rocks and make predictions about the load.)\n\n2. **\"If you tried to pick up all that dirt and rocks with your bare hands, what would happen? Why would it be so hard?\"** (Guide them to recognize that Earth is pulling down on the objects—gravity makes them heavy and difficult to lift.)\n\n3. **\"How do you think the backhoe is able to lift something so heavy when a person could not? What is different about the machine?\"** (Students may mention the long arm, the metal parts, or the size; help them see these are tools that help multiply force.)\n\n4. **\"If the bucket is being held up by the machine's arm, what forces are pushing and pulling on that bucket right now?\"** (Introduce the idea that multiple forces act at the same time.)\n\n**Prediction Prompt:** \"I'm going to show you how we can build our own simple machine to lift heavy objects. Make a prediction: Do you think we could lift a book using just a stick and a pencil? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become engineers and test how simple machines use forces to help us lift things that would otherwise be too heavy.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate force multiplication and gravity through hands-on lever construction.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- One ruler (12-inch) or wooden stick (approximately 12 inches)\n- One pencil or wooden dowel (approximately 0.5-inch diameter)\n- 5-10 small weights (washers, fishing weights, or rocks in a small bag)\n- One stack of books (at least 3-4 books, approximately 5-8 pounds total)\n- Ruler or measuring tape (cm and inches)\n- Index cards for labeling\n- Data collection sheet (provided by teacher)\n- Optional: scale or balance to measure actual weights\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Build Your Lever:** Place the pencil (fulcrum) under the ruler at the 6-inch mark. Place the stack of books on one end of the ruler (the shorter arm). Record the distance from the fulcrum to where the books sit.\n\n2. **Find the Effort Distance:** Identify where on the other arm (the longer end) you will push down. Measure and record this distance from the fulcrum in centimeters.\n\n3. **Test Your Lever—Trial 1:** Try to lift the books by pushing down on the long arm of the ruler. Record: Were you able to lift the books? How hard did you have to push? (Use descriptors: very easy, easy, hard, very hard, impossible.)\n\n4. **Move the Fulcrum:** Now move the pencil to a different position under the ruler—try placing it at the 4-inch mark, giving you a longer lever arm. Repeat the distance measurements.\n\n5. **Test Your Lever—Trial 2:** Try to lift the same stack of books with this new lever position. Record your observations and compare.\n\n6. **Adjust Again:** Move the fulcrum to the 8-inch mark (even shorter effort arm). Predict if this will be easier or harder than the previous trials. Test and record.\n\n7. **Data Recording:** Complete your data sheet with:\n   - Fulcrum position\n   - Distance from fulcrum to books (load arm)\n   - Distance from fulcrum to where you pushed (effort arm)\n   - Whether you could lift the books (yes/no)\n   - How much effort required (scale of 1-5)\n   - Observation about how gravity affects the books\n\n**Connection to the Photograph:** As students work, ask: \"Just like the backhoe's long arm helps it lift heavy dirt, how is the longer arm of your lever helping you lift the books?\"\n\n**What Students Should Record or Document:**\n- Completed data table with measurements and observations from all three trials\n- A simple labeled diagram showing the lever, fulcrum, load, and effort\n- Written observation comparing which lever position was easiest and why\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Why do you think changing where the pencil sits changes how hard it is to lift the books?\" and \"What force is pulling down on these books right now?\"\n- Resist giving answers; instead, encourage students to test and discover patterns\n- Help students with measurement techniques but allow them to conduct the tests independently\n- Prompt students to think about gravitational force: \"Gravity is always pulling down on the books. How does your lever help you work against gravity?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that moving the fulcrum farther from the load makes lifting easier\n- Students recognize that the longer the effort arm, the less force they must apply\n- Students observe and record that gravity continuously pulls downward on objects\n- Students make predictions based on their observations and test them\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to scientific concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary definitions\n- Diagram showing forces on the backhoe (prepared by teacher)\n- Student exploration data sheets\n- Optional: video clip (30-60 seconds) showing how a backhoe's hydraulics work\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\nInvite 2-3 groups to briefly share their data and discoveries:\n- \"Which fulcrum position made lifting easiest?\"\n- \"What changed between your trials?\"\n- \"How did moving the fulcrum affect the effort you had to use?\"\n\nGuide the class to notice the pattern: longer effort arm = less effort needed.\n\n**Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\nWrite each term on chart paper with a student-friendly definition and draw simple diagrams:\n\n1. **Force:** A push or pull on an object. Forces have direction (up, down, left, right) and strength (how hard or soft). *Example from photo:* The machine pushes up on the bucket with great force; gravity pulls down on the soil with force.\n\n2. **Gravity:** The force that pulls all objects down toward Earth. It is always working, even when we can't see it. *Example:* The books in your lever experiment pulled down because of gravity. The soil in the backhoe's bucket is heavy because gravity pulls on it.\n\n3. **Simple Machine:** A tool with few or no moving parts that makes work easier by multiplying force or changing the direction of a force. *Example:* A lever is a simple machine. The backhoe's arm is made of several levers and hydraulic systems working together.\n\n4. **Lever:** A rigid bar that rotates around a fixed point called a fulcrum to lift or move objects. *Example:* Your ruler was a lever; the backhoe's arm is a lever system.\n\n5. **Work:** When a force moves an object over a distance. Lifting the books is work; moving the dirt is work. *Example:* The backhoe does work when its bucket lifts soil and moves it to a truck.\n\n**Connections Back to Exploration and Photograph (5 minutes):**\n\nDisplay the backhoe photograph again. Point to the machine's long arm and say: \"Look at the backhoe's arm. Like your ruler lever, it has a fulcrum—here, at the connection point to the machine's body. The bucket hangs on one end, holding heavy soil and rocks. The operator sits on the other end, controlling the hydraulic system. This is exactly like your experiment, but much bigger and powered by the machine's engine instead of your muscles. Gravity pulls down on the soil just like it pulled down on your books. The machine's arm overcomes gravity by pulling up with even greater force.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding Strategy:**\nAsk targeted questions:\n- \"Why was it easier to lift the books when the pencil was closer to the books?\" (Longer effort arm means less force needed.)\n- \"What force is always pulling down on objects?\" (Gravity.)\n- \"How is the backhoe similar to the lever we made?\" (Both use a fulcrum and a long arm to multiply force.)\n- \"If you had to lift the stack of books without a lever, what would be harder—moving them up or down? Why?\" (Up; because gravity pulls down, so you work against gravity.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Force** | A push or pull that can move an object or change how it moves. |\n| **Gravity** | The invisible force that pulls all things down toward Earth. |\n| **Simple Machine** | A tool that makes work easier by changing the size or direction of a force. |\n| **Lever** | A bar that rotates around a fixed point (fulcrum) to help lift or move heavy things. |\n| **Work** | Moving an object by using a force across a distance. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that gravity continuously pulls objects downward\n- Students can explain why a lever with a longer effort arm requires less force\n- Students recognize that the backhoe and their ruler lever work on the same principle\n- Students use new vocabulary accurately in context\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by designing and testing a new lever system to solve a real-world problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Rulers or wooden sticks\n- Pencils or wooden dowels (fulcrums)\n- Small bags of sand, rocks, or weights (pre-weighed, labeled as 1 kg, 2 kg, etc.)\n- Classroom objects of varying weights (textbooks, supply boxes, bags of sand)\n- Measuring tapes\n- Design planning sheet (provided by teacher)\n- Optional: spring scale to measure force in newtons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge Scenario:** \"Imagine you are designing a construction site tool. Your team must lift a heavy object (choose: a 2 kg bag of sand, a stack of books, or a science textbook) using only a lever system. Your job is to:\n1. Design a lever that can lift your chosen object.\n2. Predict where you will place the fulcrum to make lifting as easy as possible.\n3. Build and test your lever.\n4. Measure and record how much effort (force) you need to lift the object.\"\n\n**Detailed Steps:**\n\n1. **Plan Your Design (4 minutes):** On the design sheet, students draw their lever system showing:\n   - Where the fulcrum will be placed\n   - Where the load (object) will rest\n   - Where they will apply effort (push down)\n   - Their prediction: Will the fulcrum be closer to the load or to the effort point? Why?\n\n2. **Build and Test (8 minutes):** \n   - Construct the lever system\n   - Test whether it successfully lifts the object\n   - If it doesn't work, adjust the fulcrum position and try again\n   - Record their success and any adjustments made\n\n3. **Measure Effort (4 minutes):** \n   - If available, use a spring scale to measure how much force (newtons) is required to lift the object\n   - Alternatively, students estimate effort level (very easy, easy, moderate, hard, very hard)\n   - Record measurements and observations\n\n4. **Compare and Discuss (2 minutes):**\n   - Invite groups to share their designs and results\n   - Ask: \"Did your prediction match what actually happened?\"\n   - Highlight: \"Notice that all successful levers had the fulcrum closer to the load. This is the design principle that makes machines like the backhoe so powerful.\"\n\n**Connection to Real World:**\n\"Construction workers, farmers, and engineers use levers and machines every day to help them do heavy work. Backhoes, cranes, forklifts, and seesaws are all levers or use lever principles. By understanding how forces work and how machines multiply force, we can solve real problems.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the design process; do not provide answers\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why do you think that will work?\" and \"What would happen if you moved the fulcrum even closer to the load?\"\n- Help students understand why designs fail and encourage iteration\n- Relate their designs back to the backhoe: \"Your lever works the same way the backhoe's arm works, just smaller.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design and build a functional lever system\n- Students demonstrate understanding of force multiplication through their design choices\n- Students make and test predictions about lever placement\n- Students recognize the principle's application to real machines\n- Students experience the engineering design cycle (plan, build, test, adjust)\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces, gravity, levers, and work.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observation of student behavior during Explore phase: Can they follow steps? Do their measurements make sense? Do their explanations reference gravity or force?\n- Listen to student discussions in Elaborate phase: Do they use vocabulary correctly? Are their design decisions based on understanding of force multiplication?\n- Review data collection sheets: Are measurements recorded accurately? Do observations show understanding?\n\n**Exit Ticket Assessment (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nStudents respond to the following prompts (written or verbal, depending on grade level):\n\n1. **\"Draw and label a simple lever system. Show where the fulcrum is, where the load is, and where the effort is applied.\"**\n\n2. **\"Explain why it is easier to lift a heavy book if the fulcrum is close to the book instead of close to where you push down. Use the word 'force' in your answer.\"**\n\n3. **\"Gravity is pulling down on the backhoe's bucket of dirt. Explain what force the backhoe must use to lift the bucket up against gravity. What happens if the upward force is stronger than the downward gravitational force?\"**\n\n4. **\"How is the backhoe's arm like the lever you built with a ruler? How is it different?\"**\n\n**Summative Assessment (Optional, for deeper evaluation):**\n\nPresent a scenario: \"A worker needs to lift a heavy crate onto a truck. He has three options: (A) A lever with the fulcrum very close to the crate, (B) A lever with the fulcrum in the middle, or (C) A lever with the fulcrum very far from the crate. Which lever should he use, and why? Draw or explain your answer using what you learned about forces.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Students accurately identify gravity as a downward force that acts on all objects.\n\n✓ Students recognize that machines use levers to multiply force and make work easier.\n\n✓ Students understand the relationship between fulcrum placement and effort required.\n\n✓ Students use vocabulary (force, gravity, lever, simple machine, work) correctly and in context.\n\n✓ Students can support their explanations with evidence from their explorations and observations.\n\n✓ Students apply their understanding to new contexts (the design challenge, the backhoe comparison).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nMost students will demonstrate understanding by:\n- Correctly answering 3-4 of the exit ticket questions with accurate science vocabulary\n- Drawing accurate diagrams of lever systems with labeled parts\n- Explaining the relationship between fulcrum position and ease of lifting\n- Making connections between their investigations and the photograph\n\nStudents exceeding expectations will:\n- Explain force multiplication using numerical ratios (e.g., \"The effort arm is twice as long, so I need half the force\")\n- Predict how changes in load weight would affect the effort required\n- Explain why gravity is important to understanding how levers work\n- Design novel lever systems for specific, complex problems\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Data Collection:** Provide a pre-made data table with partially completed examples and only one column to fill in per trial. Use pictures and words together rather than relying solely on text.\n\n2. **Guided Lever Building:** Pre-position the fulcrum for the first trial, and have students focus on observing and comparing effort across trials rather than setting up the system from scratch. Provide a checklist showing the steps in order.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Support:** Create a word wall with pictures and simple definitions. Allow students to refer to it during activities. Use consistent, repetitive language: \"Gravity pulls down. The lever pushes up. We work against gravity.\"\n\n4. **Partner with Advanced Peer:** Pair a struggling learner with a student who can model the thinking process and explain concepts in peer language. Assign the struggling student a specific data-recording role so they remain engaged and have clear responsibility.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Quantitative Analysis:** Have students use a spring scale to measure force in newtons (or equivalent) across multiple trials. Ask them to calculate the mechanical advantage of their lever using the formula: Mechanical Advantage = Effort Arm Length ÷ Load Arm Length. Have them graph effort force vs. fulcrum position to show the relationship mathematically.\n\n2. **Complex Machines Investigation:** Challenge students to identify and sketch all the simple machines visible in the backhoe (multiple levers, hydraulic systems, wheels, etc.). Have them research how a hydraulic system multiplies force beyond just lever mechanics.\n\n3. **Real-World Design Problem:** Present a scenario: \"A community garden wants to build a device to help elderly gardeners lift heavy soil bags without strain. Design a lever system that would work, considering safety, accessibility, and ease of use. Include labeled diagrams, measurements, and an explanation of how your design uses forces to make work easier.\"\n\n4. **Extended Research:** Have students investigate other simple machines (pulleys, ramps, wheels and axles) and create a poster or presentation comparing how each multiplies force or changes the direction of force. Include photographs of real-world examples.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Backhoe Engineering Challenge:** Provide students with images or videos of different construction machines (cranes, excavators, bulldozers). Have them identify the lever systems and explain how each machine is designed to work against gravity and perform specific tasks. Students can sketch the machines and label the forces acting on different parts.\n\n2. **Human Lever Exploration:** Take students outside or to the gym to demonstrate how their own bodies are lever systems. Show how a seesaw works (fulcrum in the middle, effort and load at the ends). Let them experiment with balancing different weights on a plank and fulcrum, discovering the principle that a lighter person farther from the fulcrum can balance a heavier person closer to the fulcrum. This connects force, distance, and work in a kinesthetic, memorable way.\n\n3. **Simple Machine Scavenger Hunt:** Have students explore the school and home environments to find examples of simple machines (door handles as levers, stairs as inclined planes, scissors as two levers, pencil sharpeners, etc.). For each machine found, students photograph it and write or draw an explanation of how it uses forces to make work easier. Create a class display or digital portfolio.\n\n4. **Build a Catapult:** Challenge students to design and build a working catapult using rulers, rubber bands, and a small wooden base. Have them test how far their catapult can launch a small object, adjust the design, and test again. This reinforces lever mechanics while introducing energy transfer and the engineering design process.\n\n5. **Force and Motion Simulation:** Use online simulations or apps (such as PhET simulations) that allow students to adjust lever arm lengths virtually, add loads, and see real-time changes in effort required. Students can predict, test, and analyze data, reinforcing their understanding through interactive digital exploration.\n\n6. **Guest Speaker or Video:** Invite a construction worker, engineer, or equipment operator to share how machines help them perform their work and overcome gravity and friction. Alternatively, show a short documentary clip about heavy equipment used in construction, mining, or agriculture, pausing to discuss the forces at work.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
