Explain that engines convert one type of energy (chemical energy in fuel) into another type of energy (motion) using evidence from the photograph and exploration.\n2. Identify and describe the connection between how much energy an object has and how fast it moves.\n3. Design and test a simple device that converts energy from one form to another.\n4. Use vocabulary terms (energy, convert, fuel, motion, chemical energy, mechanical energy) appropriately when describing how car engines work.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how car engines work and activate prior knowledge about energy and motion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of car engine (projected or printed large)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or large monitor. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about all the different parts inside this car engine? What do you think they do?\"\n   - \"Where do you think the energy comes from that makes a car move? What kind of energy could that be?\"\n   - \"When a car goes really fast, do you think it has more energy or less energy than a car going slowly? Why?\"\n   - \"If you could follow the energy from a drop of gasoline all the way to the car zooming down the street, what would happen to it?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Have students turn to a partner and complete this sentence: *\"I wonder how the car engine takes fuel and turns it into...\"* Invite 3-4 volunteers to share aloud. Record their ideas on chart paper without judgment.\n\n4. **Preview:** Say: \"Today, we're going to act like engineers and discover how engines change one kind of energy into another kind of energy—just like a real car engine does.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's build our own simple energy-changing machine to see this happen firsthand.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate energy conversion through hands-on experimentation with a rubber-band-powered car model.\n\n**Materials (per pair of students):**\n- Small toy car or DIY car made from a matchbox and wheels\n- Rubber band (thick, medium-strength)\n- Meter stick or ruler\n- Masking tape\n- Marker\n- Small notebook for recording\n\n**Setup (Prepare Before Class):**\n- If using DIY cars: Provide each pair with a matchbox, 4 paper fasteners with wheels attached (or spools), and assist with assembly if needed.\n- Mark a starting line on the floor with tape. Mark distance markers at 50 cm, 100 cm, 150 cm, and 200 cm using tape.\n\n**Activity: \"Stretch It, Release It, Measure It\"**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:** \"You have a rubber band and a toy car. The rubber band will store energy when you stretch it. When you let it go, that stored energy will push the car forward. Your job is to test how stretching the rubber band different amounts changes how far and fast the car goes.\"\n\n2. **Student Directions (Post these visibly):**\n   - **Step 1:** Place your car at the starting line.\n   - **Step 2:** Stretch the rubber band a little bit (about 5 cm) and wrap it around the car's body or hook. Use masking tape to hold it in place if needed.\n   - **Step 3:** Release the rubber band and watch the car go! Measure how far it traveled from the starting line. Record the distance in your notebook.\n   - **Step 4:** Reset the car. Now stretch the rubber band more (about 10 cm). Release it and measure the distance again.\n   - **Step 5:** Repeat with an even bigger stretch (about 15 cm).\n   - **Step 6:** Look at your measurements. What pattern do you see?\n\n3. **Student Recording Sheet (Simple Table):**\n   ```\n   How Much I Stretched the Rubber Band | How Far the Car Went\n   A little (5 cm)                        | ___ cm\n   More (10 cm)                           | ___ cm\n   Even more (15 cm)                      | ___ cm\n   ```\n\n4. **What Students Should Observe:** As the rubber band stretches more, it stores more energy. When released, the car travels farther and faster. This demonstrates the relationship between energy and motion.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"What's different about your stretches? What happened to the car each time? Can you describe what gave the car its energy?\"*\n- **Do not** explain the answer directly—let students notice the pattern.\n- Help with measurement accuracy but let students do the stretching and releasing.\n- Encourage pairs to check each other's measurements for accuracy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will produce a completed table showing that greater stretch = greater distance traveled.\n- Students will make observations like: \"When I stretched it more, the car went farther,\" or \"The car goes faster when the rubber band is stretched a lot.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect the exploration to the car engine photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of car engine (displayed again)\n- Vocabulary anchor chart or poster board\n- Markers\n- Optional: Simple diagram showing energy conversion steps\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask pairs to share their distance measurements and what patterns they noticed.\n   - Ask: \"Everyone's car went farther when the rubber band was stretched more, right? Why do you think that happened?\"\n   - Listen for student language and affirm observations.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Create an anchor chart and display clearly:\n\n   | Term | Fourth-Grade Friendly Definition |\n   |------|----------------------------------|\n   | **Energy** | The ability to make something move or change. Energy makes things happen. |\n   | **Convert (or Conversion)** | To change energy from one type into another type. |\n   | **Chemical Energy** | Energy stored in fuel (like gasoline) that comes from the chemicals inside it. |\n   | **Mechanical Energy** | Energy that makes things move or keeps them moving. It's the energy of motion. |\n   | **Fuel** | A material (like gasoline) that stores chemical energy and can be burned to release that energy. |\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Engine Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the engine photo again.\n   - Say: \"The rubber band in your car works kind of like an engine, but in a simpler way. Here's how:\"\n   - Point to the engine: \"Gasoline is **fuel**—it's full of **chemical energy** stored inside it. When it burns in the engine, that chemical energy is **converted** into **mechanical energy**—the kind of energy that moves all these metal parts. Those moving parts push the car forward, just like the rubber band pushed your toy car.\"\n   - Show with your hands or a simple diagram how: **Stored Energy → Motion**\n   - Ask: \"In your rubber band car, what was stored energy? What was the motion?\" (Stretched rubber band = stored energy; car moving = motion/mechanical energy)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"If I stretch the rubber band a lot, do I have more energy or less energy stored in it? What will happen when I release it?\"\n   - Provide sentence frames: *\"When the rubber band is stretched a lot, there is _____ energy. So the car will _____.\"*\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Leave this posted for the rest of the lesson and beyond.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use the terms \"energy,\" \"chemical energy,\" \"mechanical energy,\" and \"convert\" in simple sentences.\n- Students can explain the basic idea: fuel has energy → engine converts it → car moves.\n- Students can compare their rubber band car to a real car engine in basic terms.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply energy conversion concepts to a new real-world scenario and design their own energy-conversion device.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3):**\n- Balloon\n- String or tape\n- Straw\n- Plastic cup or bottle\n- Small cardboard box or shoebox\n- Various fastening materials (tape, rubber bands, paper clips)\n- Ruler\n- Optional: wheels from broken toys, LEGOs for structure\n\n**Activity: \"Design a Balloon-Powered Pusher\"**\n\n1. **Introduce the Challenge:** \"You just learned how a rubber band converts stored energy into motion. Now, you're going to be engineers and design a different device that converts energy. This time, you'll use a balloon! When you blow air into a balloon, the air pressure stores energy. Your job is to design a simple device that the balloon's energy can move or push something across a table.\"\n\n2. **Design Requirements (Post These):**\n   - Your device must use a balloon as the energy source.\n   - Your device must move an object (like a small cup, cardboard box, or toy car).\n   - You have 10 minutes to build and test.\n   - Your device should move at least 30 cm (about 1 foot).\n\n3. **Student Directions:**\n   - **Step 1:** Plan your design with your partner. Sketch it or talk about it: Where will the balloon go? How will it push the object?\n   - **Step 2:** Gather your materials.\n   - **Step 3:** Build your device using tape and other materials.\n   - **Step 4:** Test it! Blow up the balloon and release the energy. Does it work? Did the object move?\n   - **Step 5:** Measure how far your object moved.\n   - **Step 6:** Try to improve your design to make it go farther or work better.\n\n4. **Possible Student Solutions (Examples to Help Teacher Anticipate):**\n   - Balloon taped to the back of a box, held down with rubber bands; when inflated and released, air pushes the box forward.\n   - Balloon inside a tube or straw pointed at a cup; air shoots through and knocks the cup.\n   - Balloon attached to a balloon-powered car kit (if available).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask: \"What kind of energy is your balloon storing? What happens when you let the air out?\" (Guide them to recognize air pressure/potential energy → kinetic energy)\n- Help with taping and construction, but let students design the device.\n- Encourage refinement: \"Can you make it go farther? What would you change?\"\n- Celebrate creativity and effort, not just success.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each pair produces a functional balloon-powered device that moves an object.\n- Students can explain: \"The balloon has energy inside it. When I let the air out, that energy pushes [the object].\"\n- Students can measure and compare distances: \"My first try went 50 cm. I changed _____, and now it goes 80 cm.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of energy conversion and the relationship between energy and motion.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student predictions during Engage and compare to their actual findings in Explore.\n- Listen to partner discussions during Explore for language about energy and motion.\n- Check vocabulary anchor chart usage during Explain.\n- Note student questions and design choices during Elaborate as evidence of conceptual understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes at end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple one-page exit ticket:\n\n---\n\n**EXIT TICKET: Energy in Motion**\n\n**Name:** ________________   **Date:** ________________\n\n**Part 1: Draw and Label**\nDraw a simple picture of an engine (like the one in the photo) OR your balloon-powered device. Label where the energy starts and where the motion happens.\n\n**Part 2: Answer These Questions (Circle or write)**\n\n1. When I stretch a rubber band more, the car goes:\n   - **Farther** / **Not as Far**\n\n2. A car engine converts (changes) **__________ energy** into **__________ energy.**\n   (Options: chemical, mechanical, heat, sound)\n\n3. **True or False:** A car that is going very fast has more energy than a car going slowly.\n   - **True** / **False**\n\n4. In your own words, what is energy?\n   ___________________________________________________________\n\n**Part 3: Real-World Question**\nIf a bicycle rider pedals really hard, will the bike go faster or slower than if they pedal gently? Why?\n___________________________________________________________\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies stretching more → farther movement (demonstrates 4-PS3-1)\n- ✓ Student correctly names chemical energy → mechanical energy conversion (demonstrates 4-PS3-4)\n- ✓ Student understands more energy = faster/farther motion (demonstrates 4-PS3-1)\n- ✓ Student can explain energy in simple, grade-appropriate terms\n- ✓ Student applies concept to a new scenario (bicycle question)\n\n**Scoring:**\n- **Meets Standard:** 4-5 correct responses with clear reasoning\n- **Developing:** 3 correct responses OR correct answers with unclear explanations\n- **Needs Support:** Fewer than 3 correct responses; teacher should reteach key concepts one-on-one\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that stored energy is converted into motion.\n- Students show the relationship: more energy input → greater motion output.\n- Students apply this understanding to new contexts (bicycles, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Cards:** Provide visual cards with pictures for \"energy,\" \"fuel,\" \"motion,\" and \"convert.\" Allow students to use these during all phases.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames for Explanations:** \n   - \"When the rubber band is stretched _____, the car goes _____.\"\n   - \"The engine converts _____ energy into _____ energy.\"\n   - Provide word banks: (more/less), (farther/not as far), (chemical/mechanical)\n\n3. **Paired Exploration:** Pair struggling students with stronger readers/observers during Explore so they can focus on hands-on activity while a partner records data. Switch roles halfway through.\n\n4. **Exit Ticket Modification:** Allow students to choose one question to answer in detail rather than all four. Accept drawings with minimal labels instead of requiring written sentences.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Energy Source Comparison:** Challenge advanced students to explore other energy sources during Elaborate. \"What if you used a spring, a falling weight, or a spinning motion instead of a balloon? Which converts energy most effectively?\" Have them test and compare efficiency.\n\n2. **Prediction and Hypothesis:** Ask advanced students to predict the exact distance their balloon car will travel *before* building, based on the size of the balloon and the weight of the object. Compare prediction to actual results and explain the difference.\n\n3. **Real-World Application Essay:** Have students write or draw about where else energy conversion happens: phones (electrical to light/sound), toasters (electrical to heat), muscles and food (chemical energy in food converted to motion). Explain in 3-4 sentences which example they find most interesting and why.\n\n4. **Iterative Design Challenge:** Challenge advanced students to redesign their balloon car three times with specific improvements each iteration (e.g., reduce friction, increase air pressure, improve weight distribution). Chart the distance results and identify which design change had the most effect.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Roller Coaster Energy Challenge:** Students design a marble track using cardboard tubes, ramps, and tape. They predict how high they need to start the marble to make it reach a specific endpoint. They test, measure, and refine. *Connection:* Gravitational potential energy (stored in height) converts to kinetic energy (motion). This bridges to 4-PS3-1 with a more complex system.\n\n2. **Energy Hunt Walk:** Take students on a \"walk around school\" to identify places where energy is being converted. Examples: light switch (electrical to light), fan (electrical to motion), playground slide (gravitational potential to motion), microwave (electrical to heat). Students photograph or sketch examples and label the energy conversion. Debrief: \"What types of energy conversions happen around us every day?\"\n\n3. **Toy Engine Disassembly (with Permission):** If available, bring in a broken toy car or wind-up toy. With strict supervision and safety goggles, allow students to carefully examine the inside. Identify the energy source (battery, wind-up spring, etc.) and predict what parts convert that energy into motion. Reassemble together. *Caution:* Only do with non-hazardous toys; always prioritize safety and supervise closely.\n\n4. **Speed and Energy Graphs:** For further practice with 4-PS3-1, have students create bar graphs comparing the distance their rubber band car traveled at each stretch level. This reinforces the relationship: more energy = greater distance/speed.\n\n5. **Family Connection - At-Home Energy Hunt:** Send home a one-page sheet asking families to identify 3 examples of energy conversion at home (toaster, hair dryer, microwave, car, lamp, etc.). Students bring back their list, and the class creates a master chart. This extends learning beyond the classroom and engages families in science.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Photograph Revisiting:** Return to the engine photograph at least twice during the lesson (Engage and Explain). This anchors abstract concepts to a real-world example.\n- **Vocabulary Anchor Chart Longevity:** Keep the vocabulary chart posted in the classroom for the next 2-3 weeks. Reference it in other lessons to reinforce terminology.\n- **Safety Reminders:** When using rubber bands, emphasize not to snap them at others. When using balloons, watch for latex allergies. When building, supervise hot glue/sharp edges carefully.\n- **Material Prep:** Gather and test all materials the day before to ensure rubber bands aren't too stiff or cars don't have broken wheels.\n- **Engagement Boost:** If students are particularly engaged, extend Elaborate by 10 minutes to allow for more design iterations and friendly competitions (e.g., \"whose balloon car goes farthest?\").\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly parallels the car engine in the photograph—taking stored energy (fuel/stretched rubber band) and converting it into motion—while remaining fully concrete and hands-on for Fourth Grade learners. The 5E structure ensures curiosity is sparked, concepts are discovered, vocabulary is introduced formally, and understanding is applied and assessed.",
