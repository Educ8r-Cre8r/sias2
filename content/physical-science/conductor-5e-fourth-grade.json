ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about how light is made.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected photograph (or printed color copies for small groups)\n- Whiteboard/chart paper\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or show a printed color version. Ask students to simply observe for 15-20 seconds in silence before anyone speaks.\n\n2. **Facilitate initial observations** with these specific discussion questions:\n   - \"What do you see glowing in this picture? What made it glow?\"\n   - \"Do you see anything touching the light bulb? What could that be for?\"\n   - \"Where do you think the electricity comes from to make this bulb light up?\"\n   - \"Have you ever wondered why a light bulb gets hot? Where does that heat come from?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge** by asking:\n   - \"How is a light bulb different from the sun? How is it the same?\"\n   - \"What do you use electricity for at home besides lights?\"\n\n4. **Create a class \"Wonder Board\"** on chart paper where students post one thing they wonder about how light bulbs work. Save this to revisit at lesson's end.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become electrical engineers and build our own circuits to make light! First, let's explore how electricity actually travels.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how electricity travels through a complete circuit to light a bulb.\n\n**Materials (per student pair):**\n- 1 AA or AAA battery (or battery holder)\n- 1 small LED bulb or 2V incandescent bulb (LEDs are safer and use less power)\n- 2 pieces of copper wire (stripped ends, approximately 6 inches each)\n- Tape (electrical or masking tape)\n- 1 sheet of paper or small clipboard for recording\n- **Safety note:** Ensure bulbs are cool before handling; LEDs stay cool\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (written on board or printed):**\n1. Look at your materials. You have a battery, a bulb, and two wires. Your job is to figure out how to make the bulb light up **without the teacher telling you how**.\n2. Predict: Draw a picture of how you think the wires, battery, and bulb should connect to make light. Label each part.\n3. Try connecting the materials in different ways. Test each idea by touching the wires to both the battery and the bulb.\n4. When the bulb lights up, **STOP and freeze your position.** Don't move anything yet.\n5. Gently tape your working circuit so it stays together.\n6. Draw a picture of your successful circuit. Label where the electricity enters and where the light comes out.\n7. Test it again. Does it still work?\n8. **Challenge:** Try breaking the circuit by unplugging one wire. What happens? Why do you think that is?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and observe student strategies without offering solutions. Use open-ended prompts: \"What happened when you connected that wire?\" or \"What do you notice about where the wires touch?\"\n- If students struggle after 8-10 minutes, provide a **hint card** showing a simple circuit diagram (not the answer, just a visual reference of connection points).\n- Resist the urge to demonstrate; let students discover through trial and error.\n- Encourage students to explain their thinking aloud: \"Tell me what you did and why.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will successfully build at least one working circuit.\n- Students will recognize that all three components (battery, bulb, wire) must be connected for light to appear.\n- Students will discover that breaking the connection turns off the light (understanding \"complete circuit\").\n- Students will produce labeled drawings showing their circuit with annotations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect hands-on discovery to scientific concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Completed circuits from Explore phase\n- Chart paper with vocabulary written large\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student drawings from Explore\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 student pairs to briefly show their working circuits to the class.\n   - Highlight key observations: \"What do all the successful circuits have in common?\"\n   - Record student observations on chart paper: *\"The wires touch the battery and the bulb,\"* *\"Nothing is broken,\"* *\"There's a complete circle/path.\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Present each term with a Fourth Grade-friendly definition while pointing to the circuits and the photograph:\n\n   - **Circuit:** A complete path that electricity can travel around. Think of it like a race track—the electricity needs to go all the way around and come back to where it started.\n   - **Conductor:** A material that lets electricity flow through it easily. Copper wire is a conductor. (Show the wires.)\n   - **Complete Circuit:** When all the parts are connected with no breaks, so electricity can travel all the way around.\n   - **Broken Circuit:** When one wire is unplugged or disconnected, stopping electricity from flowing.\n   - **Energy Transfer:** When electricity (electrical energy) travels through the wire and changes into light energy and heat energy in the bulb.\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Display the original photograph again.\n   - Point out the battery, the wires, and the bulb in the photo.\n   - Explain: \"Just like in your circuits, electricity from the battery travels through the wires to the bulb. Inside the bulb, a special wire filament gets so hot it glows with light. The electricity turned into light energy!\"\n   - Reference the light we see: \"That glow is proof that energy moved from one place to another.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students to show a \"thumbs up, thumbs sideways, or thumbs down\" to indicate confidence.\n   - Quick true/false questions:\n     - \"A complete circuit has no broken connections.\" (True)\n     - \"You need a wire to be a conductor.\" (False—many materials can conduct.)\n     - \"The bulb makes light from electrical energy.\" (True)\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart (displayed):**\n\n| Term | Definition | Example |\n|------|------------|---------|\n| **Circuit** | A closed path for electricity to travel | Battery → wire → bulb → wire → back to battery |\n| **Conductor** | Material that lets electricity flow through | Copper wire, metal |\n| **Complete Circuit** | All parts connected with no breaks | Working circuits from our activity |\n| **Broken Circuit** | A break in the path stops electricity | Unplugging a wire |\n| **Energy Transfer** | Electricity changes into light and heat | Bulb glowing |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the three main parts of a simple circuit.\n- Students understand that a complete, unbroken path is necessary for electricity to flow.\n- Students recognize that electrical energy becomes light and heat energy.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply circuit concepts to a new context and deepen understanding.\n\n**Materials (per student pair):**\n- Original circuit setup (or new batteries, wires, and bulbs)\n- 5-6 test materials: paper, aluminum foil, plastic, rubber eraser, wooden popsicle stick, brass fastener\n- Chart paper titled \"Conductors vs. Insulators\"\n- Markers\n\n**Activity: \"What Conducts Electricity?\"**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge (2 minutes):**\n   - Explain: \"We know copper wire conducts electricity. But what about other materials? Today, you'll test whether different materials are conductors or insulators.\"\n   - Show each test material briefly.\n   - Define: **Insulator—a material that does NOT let electricity flow through it easily.**\n\n2. **Student Investigation (10 minutes):**\n   - **Directions:** Rebuild your working circuit, but leave a small gap in one of the wires (about 1 inch space).\n   - **Prediction:** For each test material, predict: \"Will this conduct electricity and make the light turn on?\"\n   - **Test:** Carefully touch each material across the gap where the wires don't touch.\n   - **Observation:** Record whether the bulb lights up (conducts) or stays dark (insulates).\n   - **Data Table (provided or drawn):**\n\n     | Material | Prediction (Conducts or Insulates?) | Result | Was I Correct? |\n     |----------|-----|--------|--------|\n     | Aluminum foil | | | |\n     | Paper | | | |\n     | Plastic | | | |\n     | Rubber | | | |\n     | Wood | | | |\n     | Brass fastener | | | |\n\n3. **Group Discussion & Recording (5 minutes):**\n   - Gather results and create a class chart titled \"Conductors vs. Insulators.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think some materials let electricity through and others don't?\"\n   - Real-world connection: \"The coating around a wire is plastic (an insulator). Why would that be important?\" (Protects us from getting shocked; keeps electricity from touching other things.)\n\n4. **Real-World Application (3 minutes):**\n   - Discuss: \"Look around the classroom. Point out a conductor or insulator you see.\"\n   - Mention: Electrical outlets have plastic covers (insulators) to keep us safe. Copper wires inside walls are conductors.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Observe predictions and guide students to explain *why* they made those predictions.\n- If a student is rough with materials, gently redirect: \"Handle carefully—we're scientists!\"\n- Facilitate discussion without revealing answers until after testing.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a data table showing which materials conduct electricity.\n- Students can explain the difference between conductors and insulators.\n- Students begin to understand practical applications of conductors/insulators in real devices.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students understand energy transfer through circuits and can apply concepts to new situations.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observe** student circuit-building: Do they recognize when a circuit is complete vs. broken?\n- **Listen** to explanations: Can they articulate why the bulb lit up?\n- **Review** labeled circuit drawings from Explore phase: Are connections accurate?\n- **Check** vocabulary anchor chart responses: Do definitions show understanding or confusion?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\n**Provide each student with a printed or digital exit ticket:**\n\n**Question 1:** Draw a simple circuit with a battery, bulb, and wires. Label each part.\n\n**Question 2:** Fill in the blank:\n- \"Electricity travels from the battery through the ________ to the ________. It makes the bulb glow because electrical energy changes into ________ energy.\"\n  - *Answer key: wire, bulb, light (or heat)*\n\n**Question 3 (Choose one to answer):**\n- A: \"What happens if one wire falls off the battery? Why?\"\n  - *Expected: The circuit is broken, so electricity stops flowing and the bulb turns off.*\n  \n- B: \"Is aluminum foil a conductor or insulator? How do you know?\"\n  - *Expected: Conductor, because it lit the bulb when we tested it.*\n\n**Question 4 (Critical thinking):**\n- \"Why do you think the plastic cover on a wire is important? Use the word 'insulator' in your answer.\"\n  - *Expected: The plastic is an insulator that protects us and keeps electricity where it should go.*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly labels circuit parts (battery, bulb, wire).\n- ✓ Student fills in blanks with scientifically accurate terms.\n- ✓ Student explains the effect of a broken circuit.\n- ✓ Student distinguishes between conductors and insulators with reasoning.\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary correctly in explanation.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- **Learning Objective 1 (observe and describe):** Exit ticket Q1 and Q3A show accurate circuit understanding.\n- **Learning Objective 2 (explain energy transfer):** Exit ticket Q2 and Q4 use correct vocabulary and show causation (electricity → light).\n- **Learning Objective 3 (design and build):** Completed working circuits and Q1 drawing demonstrate design skills.\n- **Learning Objective 4 (predict and test conductors):** Elaborate phase data table and Q3B/Q4 show understanding of material properties.\n\n**Closing (2 minutes):**\n- Revisit the \"Wonder Board\" from Engage phase. Ask: \"Did we answer any of your questions? What new questions do you have?\"\n- Preview: \"Next lesson, we'll explore how circuits can power other devices—like motors and buzzers!\"\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Scaffolded Circuit Diagram:**\n   - Provide a printed diagram showing the correct circuit configuration for Explore phase (connection points clearly marked).\n   - Student traces the path with their finger before building, developing mental model first.\n   - Use **think-aloud strategy:** \"I'm going to connect the wire here because the electricity needs to make a complete loop.\"\n\n2. **Simplified Vocabulary:**\n   - Focus on only 2-3 key terms (circuit, conductor, complete) rather than all five.\n   - Use repeated, consistent phrases: \"Is the path broken or complete?\" and \"Does electricity flow through it?\"\n   - Provide **picture cards** with terms and definitions to reference during activities.\n\n3. **Hands-On Practice with Feedback:**\n   - Partner with a more independent learner during Explore.\n   - Provide **immediate tactile feedback:** Let the student touch a working vs. broken circuit repeatedly to internalize the concept.\n   - Use **success frames:** \"You made it light up! Tell me what you did.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Circuit Complexity:**\n   - Introduce **series circuits** (two bulbs in a row) and **parallel circuits** (bulbs on separate branches).\n   - Ask: \"What happens if you add another bulb to your circuit? Will it be brighter or dimmer? Why?\"\n   - Have students draw and build both configurations, comparing brightness.\n\n2. **Material Investigation Extension:**\n   - Provide additional test materials (graphite, salt water, human skin, wet paper towel).\n   - Challenge: \"Some materials conduct electricity better than others. Can you rank your materials from best conductor to worst conductor based on bulb brightness?\"\n   - Introduction to **resistance:** \"Why does the bulb get less bright with some materials?\"\n\n3. **Design Challenge:**\n   - \"Design a circuit that could turn a light on and off using a switch. What material would you use for the switch? Why?\"\n   - Provide a paper clip and brass fastener for students to create a simple switch.\n   - Students present designs and explain material choices using conductor/insulator vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Circuit Scavenger Hunt (Homework or Next Lesson):**\n   - Send students home with a worksheet asking them to **identify and sketch three things in their home that use circuits** (lamp, TV, tablet, doorbell, etc.).\n   - Challenge: \"Can you find an insulator in the picture? Why is it there?\"\n   - Students share findings in next lesson; creates real-world connection and parent engagement.\n\n2. **Build a Switch (15-20 minute follow-up activity):**\n   - Provide materials: paper fastener, aluminum foil, scissors, cardboard.\n   - **Challenge:** Design a working on/off switch for your circuit using only these materials.\n   - Students test and refine their switch designs, adding engineering practices to the lesson.\n   - Display working switches in a class \"Circuit Gallery.\"\n\n3. **Energy Transfer Investigation with Heat:**\n   - Extend to 4-PS3-2 by exploring heat energy from bulbs.\n   - Students carefully observe an incandescent bulb warming up over 2-3 minutes (do NOT touch).\n   - Discussion: \"We know electrical energy becomes light. What else is it becoming?\"\n   - Record observations: **Bulb is getting warm. Electrical energy is also becoming heat energy.**\n   - Connect to real world: \"Why do you think it's important to let a light bulb cool down before touching it?\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Tips & Troubleshooting\n\n**Problem:** Bulbs won't light up.\n- **Solution:** Check battery voltage (older batteries don't work). Ensure wire ends are stripped and bare metal touches bulb contacts. Some bulbs need specific voltage.\n\n**Problem:** Students break circuits on purpose and claim they \"don't work anymore.\"\n- **Solution:** Reframe: \"Great! You found a broken circuit. Now try to fix it. What are you going to reconnect?\"\n\n**Problem:** Students don't see light with LEDs.\n- **Solution:** LEDs are directional; polarity matters. Have students check: longer leg (+) to positive battery terminal, shorter leg (−) to negative.\n\n**Problem:** Students finish early and are waiting.\n- **Solution:** Redirect to the **Challenge questions** or have them predict what happens if you add a second battery or bulb to the circuit.\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Summary\n\n| Standard | Addressed In |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **4-PS3-2:** Energy transfer through electric currents | Explore phase (building circuits), Explain phase (vocabulary), Elaborate phase (testing conductors) |\n| **4-PS3-4:** Device that converts energy from one form to another | Entire lesson; bulb converts electrical energy to light/heat |\n\n**Connections to Scientific Practices:**\n- Developing and using models (drawing circuits)\n- Planning and conducting investigations (testing materials)\n- Analyzing and interpreting data (conductor/insulator chart)\n- Constructing explanations (exit ticket responses)\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is designed to be hands-on, discovery-based, and immediately engaging for Fourth Grade students while firmly rooted in Fourth Grade NGSS physical science standards.",
