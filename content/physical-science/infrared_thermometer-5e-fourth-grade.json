ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about invisible heat and introduce the infrared thermometer as a \"heat detective\" tool.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (8\" × 10\" or projected on screen) of the infrared thermometer\n- One infrared thermometer (if available—optional but ideal)\n- Classroom objects: a sunny windowsill, a cool metal object, a warm hand\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds, then turn to a neighbor and describe what they see.\n\n2. **Facilitate group discussion** with these guiding questions (write them on the board):\n   - *\"What do you think this orange device is used for?\"*\n   - *\"The thermometer shows 113.5. What could that number mean?\"*\n   - *\"How is this thermometer different from the thermometers you use to take your temperature at home or in the nurse's office?\"*\n   - *\"Do you think it can measure temperature without touching something? Why or why not?\"*\n\n3. **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Ask: *\"What is heat? Where do we feel heat in our classroom?\"* Chart student responses. Highlight ideas about feeling warmth from the sun, a heater, or warm objects.\n\n4. **Introduce the Wonder Question:** Write on chart paper: *\"Can we find heat that we can't see?\"* Tell students they will become \"heat detectives\" to solve this mystery.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to investigate how heat moves and how we can find it using special tools, just like the one in this picture.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students hands-on investigate heat transfer through observation, comparison, and temperature measurement.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One infrared thermometer (class set preferred, or 1–2 shared devices)\n- Dark construction paper and aluminum foil\n- Heat source options: sunny windowsill area, heat lamp (teacher-controlled), or warm water in clear containers\n- Thermometer data recording sheet (template provided below)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Timer or clock with second hand\n- Safety goggles (if using heat lamp)\n\n**Activity — \"Heat Detective Investigation\":**\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud; post on chart paper):**\n\n1. **Set up your heat source** (teacher assigns students to sunny window, heat lamp area, or warm water station). Put on safety goggles if using a heat lamp.\n\n2. **Predict:** Before measuring, predict which surface (dark paper or aluminum foil) will be warmer after 5 minutes in the heat. Write your prediction on the recording sheet.\n\n3. **Measure the starting temperature** of both materials using the infrared thermometer (or regular thermometer). Point the infrared device at each surface from about 6 inches away. Read the number on the screen and record it.\n\n4. **Apply heat** for exactly 5 minutes. Keep both materials in the same location (sunlight or heat lamp area).\n\n5. **Measure again.** After 5 minutes, use the infrared thermometer to measure the temperature of both surfaces again. Record the new numbers.\n\n6. **Calculate the change:** Subtract the starting temperature from the ending temperature for each material. Which one heated up more?\n\n7. **Observe and sketch:** Draw a picture of what happened. Use arrows to show where the heat came from and how it moved to the materials.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups; **do not tell students which material will be warmer**—let them discover it.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice? Is one surface warmer than the other? Why might that be?\"*\n- Help students read the thermometer accurately without giving away results.\n- Ensure proper handling of the heat source; supervise all groups closely.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students record temperature data before and after heating.\n- Most discover that dark materials absorb more heat than reflective materials (foil).\n- Students produce sketches with evidence of heat transfer.\n- Students hypothesize about *why* one material got hotter.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to the science of heat energy transfer.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Completed data sheets from Explore phase\n- Infrared thermometer (for demonstration)\n- Images or objects showing infrared light (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Call on 2–3 student groups to share their data and observations. Record temperature changes on a class chart. Ask: *\"What pattern do you see? Did dark materials and shiny materials behave differently?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (write each on chart paper with a simple illustration):\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---------------------------|\n   | **Thermal Energy (Heat)** | The energy that makes things feel warm. Heat is always moving and trying to spread out. |\n   | **Heat Transfer** | When heat energy moves from one place to another—from something hot to something cooler. |\n   | **Infrared Light** | A special kind of light we can't see with our eyes, but it carries heat energy. The thermometer in the picture detects this invisible light! |\n   | **Absorption** | When a material takes in (soaks up) heat energy instead of bouncing it back. Dark materials absorb heat better. |\n   | **Radiation** | Heat energy that travels through the air in invisible waves (like light), without needing to touch anything. |\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - *\"The orange thermometer detects infrared light—heat radiation coming from the brick. It can 'see' the heat without touching it!\"*\n   - *\"That's why it shows 113.5 degrees—the brick was very hot and radiating lots of heat energy.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If I wanted to cool down on a hot day, should I wear dark clothes or light-colored clothes? Why?\"*\n   - Invite students to point to the thermometer screen and explain what number it's showing and what that tells us about the heat.\n   - Use thumbs up/sideways/down: *\"Do you understand how heat can move from the sun to objects without touching them?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary like \"heat transfer,\" \"infrared light,\" and \"absorb\" when discussing their findings.\n- Students explain that dark materials absorbed more heat than reflective ones.\n- Students articulate that the infrared thermometer detects invisible heat energy.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding to a new real-world scenario involving energy conversion and practical design.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Infrared thermometer or regular thermometers\n- Various classroom surfaces: metal desk, wooden table, plastic bin, fabric seat cushion, window glass, tile floor\n- Data recording sheet (new)\n- Optional: color-coded temperature scale chart\n- Optional: \"Solar Cooker Challenge\" materials if extending (see below)\n\n**Activity — \"Temperature Hunt Around the Classroom\":**\n\n1. **Explain the Challenge:** *\"In the Explore phase, we discovered that materials absorb different amounts of heat. Now let's find out which surfaces in our classroom have absorbed the most heat from sunlight coming through the windows today.\"*\n\n2. **Predict and Test:** Students work in pairs to:\n   - Predict which 4 classroom surfaces they think will be warmest (e.g., sunny metal desk, tile floor near window, wood table, etc.)\n   - Use the infrared thermometer to measure the actual temperature of each surface\n   - Record predictions vs. actual measurements on a chart\n   - Compare results: *\"Were you right? Why was that surface warmer or cooler than you thought?\"*\n\n3. **Deepen Understanding:** Ask:\n   - *\"Which material absorbed the most heat from the sunlight?\"*\n   - *\"If we wanted to design a surface to stay cool in the summer, which material should we use? Why?\"*\n   - *\"How is this like what we learned about the dark paper and aluminum foil?\"*\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:** Explain that architects and engineers use this knowledge to design buildings that stay cool in hot climates and warm in cold ones. Some even use special reflective coatings on roofs to bounce heat away!\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate pair work; ask probing questions to deepen thinking.\n- Guide students to make connections between the investigation and real-world applications.\n- Encourage students to explain their reasoning using evidence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students measure classroom temperatures and record data accurately.\n- Students explain differences in temperature based on material properties.\n- Students make evidence-based predictions about which materials absorb heat.\n- Students articulate connections to real-world design (e.g., \"We should use shiny materials on roofs to keep buildings cool\").\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of heat energy transfer and the use of tools to detect invisible energy.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Exit ticket template (printed or digital)\n- Infrared thermometer (for demonstration if needed)\n- Student data sheets from Explore and Elaborate phases\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observations during Explore:** Did students make predictions, collect accurate data, and attempt to explain patterns?\n- **Vocabulary Use:** Are students using terms like \"heat transfer,\" \"infrared,\" and \"absorb\" in discussions?\n- **Questioning:** Do responses to guiding questions show growing understanding of heat movement?\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nPrint or project these 4 questions. Students answer on individual tickets (drawings + words are acceptable for struggling writers):\n\n1. **What did the infrared thermometer measure in our investigation?**\n   - A) How cold things are   \n   - B) How hot things are and how much heat they absorbed   \n   - C) How bright the light is   \n   \n   *(Correct answer: B)*\n\n2. **Why did the dark paper get hotter than the aluminum foil?**\n   - *Expected response: The dark paper absorbed more heat / took in more heat energy from the sun (or heat lamp). The foil bounced the heat away.*\n\n3. **Draw a picture or write: How does heat get from the sun to a brick on the ground?**\n   - *Expected response: Drawing/description showing heat traveling through the air as invisible rays (radiation) and hitting the brick.*\n\n4. **If you were designing a spaceship to go to a very hot planet, would you paint it dark or shiny? Why?**\n   - *Expected response: Shiny, because shiny materials reflect/bounce away heat so the spaceship won't get too hot.*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Students correctly identify that the thermometer measures heat/temperature.\n- ✓ Students explain that dark materials absorb more heat than reflective materials.\n- ✓ Students describe or draw heat transfer from a source to an object.\n- ✓ Students apply learning to a new scenario (spaceship, real-world design).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most Fourth Graders will correctly answer multiple-choice question and provide basic explanations using evidence.\n- Advanced students will articulate detailed connections between material properties and heat absorption.\n- Struggling students may draw pictures showing heat movement and identify that dark materials get hotter (even if explanations are incomplete).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Recording Sheet:** Provide a template with sentence frames and visual cues:\n   - *\"The dark paper started at _____ degrees. It ended at _____ degrees. The change was _____ degrees.\"*\n   - Include pictures of dark vs. shiny materials as visual organizers.\n\n2. **Paired Investigation:** Assign struggling students to work with a stronger partner during Explore phase. Partner reads thermometer aloud; both record data together.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Post large, illustrated vocabulary chart (Heat, Heat Transfer, Infrared, Absorb) permanently in the classroom. Reference it frequently; allow students to point to definitions during discussions rather than recalling from memory.\n\n4. **Teacher-Led Temperature Measurement:** For students who struggle with reading the digital display, pre-measure a few key surfaces and have students match their observations to a provided chart rather than reading the device independently.\n\n---\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners):\n\n1. **Multi-Variable Investigation:** Ask advanced students to test additional materials (black plastic, white plastic, mirror, water-filled container) and create a ranking chart from coolest to hottest. Challenge them to explain *why* each material ranked as it did using scientific reasoning about infrared light and absorption.\n\n2. **Real-World Design Project:** Provide images of roofs in different climates (snow-covered region, desert, tropical island). Ask students to research and explain which materials are used and why, connecting to heat absorption concepts. Have them sketch a design for a \"cool roof\" and justify their choices.\n\n3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Present a scenario: *\"A scientist hypothesizes that white cars stay cooler than black cars on sunny days. How would you test this? What data would you collect?\"* Have students design a mini-investigation plan with variables and controls.\n\n4. **Comparative Data Analysis:** Provide temperature data from multiple student groups (from Explore or Elaborate phases). Ask advanced students to create a bar graph, calculate average temperatures, and write a summary comparing results across groups.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Solar Cooker Challenge\" (Homework or Follow-Up):**\n   - Students design a simple solar cooker using a dark-colored container, plastic wrap, and sunlight.\n   - They predict the temperature inside the cooker at different times of day using infrared thermometer.\n   - They record data over a week and report findings.\n   - *Connection:* Applies learning about dark materials absorbing heat to a real-world technology (solar cooking).\n\n2. **Heat and Energy Transfer: Sound, Light, and Electricity Comparison (Cross-Domain):**\n   - Revisit 4-PS3-2 by exploring *other* ways energy transfers: sound waves (plucked string), light (flashlight in dark room), electric current (battery-powered toy).\n   - Create a class Venn diagram comparing heat transfer to light transfer.\n   - *Connection:* Deepens understanding that energy moves in different forms, not just heat.\n\n3. **\"Design an Outfit for Different Planets\" (Elaboration):**\n   - Students research temperatures on Mars (cold), Venus (extremely hot), and Earth.\n   - They sketch spacesuits using materials they learned about (dark, shiny, reflective) appropriate for each planet.\n   - They write captions explaining their material choices based on heat absorption/reflection.\n   - *Connection:* Real-world engineering application of thermal energy concepts; interdisciplinary with space science.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** If using a heat lamp, ensure it is stable, away from flammable materials, and never pointed at students. Supervise closely. Alternatively, use sunny windowsill areas (free, safe, and authentic).\n- **Infrared Thermometer Availability:** If you don't own one, many schools have them in the building (health office, facilities). Borrow one or two for this lesson. The investigation *can* proceed with regular thermometers, but the infrared device reinforces the concept of detecting invisible heat—central to this lesson's NGSS alignment.\n- **Timing:** The two-session structure allows time for students to process new concepts. Day 1 = Engage + Explore; Day 2 = Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate.\n- **Vocabulary Depth:** Fourth Graders may not fully grasp the physics of infrared radiation, but they *can* understand that some light is invisible and carries heat. Use the phrase \"invisible heat light\" as an accessible metaphor.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly addresses NGSS 4-PS3-2 by providing concrete evidence that heat energy transfers from place to place. It also touches 4-PS4-2 by modeling how light (infrared, though invisible) carries information from objects to our detection device.",
