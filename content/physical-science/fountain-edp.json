Poke a small hole in the bottom of the top cup and fill it with water. Watch the water drip down into the second cup, then the third cup. Can you make the water flow slowly or quickly? What happens when it gets cold?\n\n#### **3-5: Design a Freeze-Resistant Water Feature**\nDesign a small fountain or water circulation system that:\n- Must have **at least 2 levels** where water flows downward\n- Can function in **freezing temperatures** without ice blocking the water pathways\n- Uses materials that **won't crack or break** when exposed to freeze-thaw cycles\n- Must be tested to show water moving through all levels\n\n*Success criteria:* Water flows from top to bottom for at least 3 consecutive cycles without ice buildup blocking flow.\n\n---\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis phase fits because the photo shows a real-world structure (a frozen fountain) where water flow is disrupted by environmental conditions. Students observe the problem (ice blocking water pathways in cold weather) and must define what a working solution needs to do. The visible ice and the fountain's design prompt students to ask: *\"How do we keep water moving when it freezes?\"* rather than jumping to a predetermined solution.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Materials\n\n- Small clear plastic cups or containers (3-4 per team)\n- Aluminum foil or copper tubing (to represent heat-conductive pathways)\n- Warm water and ice (to simulate temperature changes)\n- Hole punch or thumbtack (for making drainage holes)\n- Sand, gravel, or insulating foam scraps (for thermal protection)\n- Measuring cup or spray bottle (to test water flow rate)\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Time\n\n**Single 45-minute session** (K-2) for building and testing water flow; **Two 40-minute sessions** (3-5) to design, build, test with freezing conditions, and redesign based on results.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS 3-5-ETS1-2** (*Generate and compare multiple solutions using design criteria and constraints*) by requiring students to develop a structure that balances water flow, material durability, and environmental resilience—all observable needs from the fountain photo.",
