  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Water in Motion — Observing Energy and Change\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Energy Transfer through Water:** Water moving in the canal demonstrates how energy can be transferred from place to place; the water's motion carries energy that can affect objects in its path (the cone, grass, and surrounding landscape).\n- **Observable Changes and Consequences:** The visible water level, current direction, and impact on the landscape show evidence of how energy manifests as motion and can cause changes to the environment (erosion of grass banks, water flowing against barriers).\n- **Light and Visibility:** The photograph clearly shows how light reflects off water surfaces and objects (the bright blue water, the safety cone's orange color, shadows on pavement), making these features visible and identifiable.\n- **Waves and Water Disturbances:** The ripples and surface movement visible in the canal water represent wave patterns that can move objects and transfer energy across the water's surface.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Energy on the Move: How Water Carries Power**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fourth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 50-minute sessions (or three 30-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** 4-PS3-2 (energy transfer through observation), 4-PS4-1 (wave patterns and movement), 4-PS3-1 (relationship between motion and energy)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Observe and describe evidence of energy transfer occurring in moving water.\n2. Identify and explain how water's motion can move or affect objects in its path.\n3. Describe wave patterns in water and predict how waves cause objects to move.\n4. Design and test a simple barrier or structure to observe how water's energy affects different materials.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by examining the photograph and raising questions about moving water and energy.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected copy of the photograph (states_of_matter.jpg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Give students 1-2 minutes to quietly observe without speaking.\n\n2. **Ask guiding discussion questions:**\n   - \"What is happening in this picture? What do you see the water doing?\"\n   - \"Why do you think there's a warning cone and orange traffic marker near the water?\"\n   - \"How do you think that blue water got to be moving like that? What made it move?\"\n   - \"If you put a toy boat right where that water is flowing, what would happen to it?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations and wonderings** on chart paper using their exact words. Highlight comments about water movement, energy, and cause-and-effect (e.g., \"The water is pushing the grass,\" \"The water is going somewhere,\" \"Something is making the water move\").\n\n4. **Ask a prediction prompt:** \"I wonder... if we could see inside that water right now, what do you think is happening? Is the water moving in one direction, or is it doing something else?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore how water moves and what kind of power—or energy—moving water has. Let's become water scientists and do some experiments!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate wave patterns, water motion, and energy transfer through hands-on water experiments.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 shallow clear plastic tub or large rectangular container per pair (9\" × 13\" or similar)\n- Water (room temperature)\n- Small floating objects: corks, foam pieces, lightweight plastic toys, packing peanuts (variety of materials)\n- Ruler or meter stick\n- Paper towels\n- Spoons or sticks for creating waves\n- Pencils for recording observations\n- Student observation sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Creating Waves (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials.** Pair students and give each pair a tub filled with water (about 2 inches deep) and a ruler.\n\n2. **Give step-by-step directions:**\n   - \"Place your floating object gently in the middle of your water tub.\"\n   - \"Using your spoon or stick, make ONE gentle push through the water toward your object. Observe what happens.\"\n   - \"Now make bigger, faster pushes. What happens to the waves you make? Does your object move more or less?\"\n   - \"Count how many times you have to push before your object reaches the edge of the tub.\"\n   - \"Try pushing from different directions. Does the direction you push change where your object goes?\"\n\n3. **Students record observations** on their sheet: Draw or describe the waves they made and where the object moved.\n\n**Part B: Different Materials, Different Results (10 minutes)**\n\n4. **Add variety:** Give each pair 2-3 different floating objects (cork, foam, plastic toy).\n\n5. **Repeat pushing/wave-making** with each object. Students predict which will move fastest and record whether their prediction was correct.\n\n6. **Pose discovery questions:**\n   - \"Did all objects move the same way? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What does this tell us about how water moves things?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask follow-up questions rather than explaining: \"What did you notice when you pushed faster? What made that object move—was it the water itself or the waves?\"\n- Guide students to observe that waves transfer energy and cause movement without the water pushing the object directly.\n- Encourage students to test predictions multiple times.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that pushing water creates wave patterns.\n- They discover that waves move objects without the object being in direct contact with the push.\n- They predict and test relationships between wave size/speed and object movement.\n- They record observations in words and/or drawings.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Build shared understanding by connecting observations to formal vocabulary and concepts about energy and waves.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photographs or video clip (optional: 30-second video of water waves in action, freely available online)\n- Student vocabulary cards (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Facilitate a group share-out** (5 minutes):\n   - Invite 3-4 pairs to share one observation from their water tub experiments.\n   - Write their discoveries on chart paper, using phrases like \"The wave moved the object\" and \"Bigger pushes made bigger waves.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (8 minutes) with student-friendly definitions and visual examples:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Energy:** The ability to make something move or change. It can be transferred (passed from one thing to another). *Example: When you push water, you give it energy, and that energy makes waves.*\n   - **Wave:** A disturbance that moves through water (or air or other materials) and can carry energy and move objects. *Example: The ripples you made in your tub were waves.*\n   - **Amplitude:** How big or tall a wave is. A bigger wave has more amplitude. *Example: When you pushed hard, you made waves with larger amplitude.*\n   - **Motion:** Movement from one place to another. *Example: Your floating object's motion showed that the wave energy reached it.*\n   - **Transfer:** To move or pass something from one place or thing to another. *Example: The wave transferred energy across the water to move your object.*\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph** (3 minutes):\n   - \"Remember the picture with the blue water and the warning cone? That water is moving with energy, just like the waves in your tubs. The moving water has so much energy that it can wash away grass, push things around, and even knock over cones if they're not heavy enough!\"\n   - Point out visible waves or ripples in the canal water.\n   - Explain: \"The water in that canal is like a giant wave carrying energy from one place to another.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding** (2 minutes):\n   - Ask: \"If I put a toy boat in that canal water, what would happen to it? Why?\"\n   - Have students turn to a partner and explain how energy moved their floating object in their tub.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define and use vocabulary: energy, wave, amplitude, motion, transfer.\n- They can explain that waves carry energy that moves objects.\n- They connect the tub experiment to the real-world photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (16 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply wave and energy concepts to design and test a solution to a real-world problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Water in tubs (same setup as Explore phase)\n- Design materials: index cards, plastic wrap, foam blocks, wooden craft sticks, clay, tape, aluminum foil, small blocks\n- Floating object (small foam piece or cork) per pair\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Pencils and paper for recording designs and results\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the design challenge** (2 minutes):\n   - \"In the photograph, there's a warning cone near the water. The engineers who maintain that canal need to protect important objects from being washed away or damaged by the moving water's energy. Your job is to design a barrier or structure that will slow down or stop a wave from moving a floating object across your tub.\"\n\n2. **Review design steps** (2 minutes):\n   - Ask: \"What will you try? How will you test it? How will you know if it works?\"\n   - Introduce the design process: **Plan → Build → Test → Improve**\n\n3. **Students design and build** (6 minutes):\n   - Each pair sketches their barrier design on paper (what materials will they use? where will they place it?).\n   - They build their structure in or across their water tub.\n   - Teacher approves the design before testing begins.\n\n4. **Students test and refine** (6 minutes):\n   - Create waves (same way as Explore phase) toward the floating object.\n   - Measure how far the object moves with and without their barrier.\n   - Record: Did the barrier work? Why or why not? What would they change?\n   - Allow time to modify and retest their design.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Why do you think that barrier didn't stop the wave?\" and \"What could you add to make it stronger?\"\n- Do not provide solutions; guide students to test and observe.\n- Celebrate persistence and failed attempts as learning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design a structure based on their understanding of how waves transfer energy.\n- They test their design and collect evidence of whether it works.\n- They identify ways to improve their design.\n- They explain their design choice using vocabulary (amplitude, energy, wave).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during Explore and Elaborate):**\n- Observe student ability to predict wave behavior: \"Which wave will move the object farther—a big one or a small one?\"\n- Listen for use of vocabulary in explanations: Do students say \"energy,\" \"wave,\" or \"motion\" when describing what they observe?\n- Check student drawings and records: Do they show evidence of observation and testing?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment - administered at end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a small slip of paper and ask them to answer (in words or drawings):\n\n1. **\"Draw or describe a wave you made in your water tub. Show what moved and why.\"**\n2. **\"How is the moving water in the canal picture like the waves you made? What do they have in common?\"**\n3. **\"True or False: A bigger wave has more energy than a smaller wave. Explain your answer.\"**\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student drawings or descriptions show a wave pattern with a moving object.\n- Students explain that waves carry energy or move things.\n- Students connect their tub experiment to the photograph's moving water.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that larger waves correlate with more energy (bigger amplitude = more energy).\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Can students explain (verbally or in writing) that moving water carries energy?\n- Do they predict how waves will move objects?\n- Can they describe their barrier design in terms of stopping or slowing wave energy?\n- Do exit tickets show transfer of understanding from the tub to real-world scenarios?\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"wave,\" \"energy,\" and \"move\" initially. Introduce \"amplitude\" and \"transfer\" only after students demonstrate confidence with core concepts.\n\n2. **Guided prediction sheet:** Provide a structured worksheet with sentence frames:\n   - \"When I push the water, the wave will _____.\"\n   - \"The object moved because _____.\"\n   - \"A bigger wave has _____ energy than a smaller wave.\"\n\n3. **Pair with a peer:** Place students with a stronger partner during Explore phase. Assign a specific role (observer or experimenter) to maximize engagement and support.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Wave amplitude measurement:** Provide rulers and ask students to measure the height of waves they create and graph the relationship between push strength and wave height.\n\n2. **Multiple barrier designs:** Challenge advanced learners to test three different barrier designs in one session and compare effectiveness. Ask: \"Which design uses the least material but works best?\"\n\n3. **Real-world application:** Ask: \"What structures in our town or city do you think were designed to protect against water energy?\" (Dams, levees, seawalls.) \"How might they work like your barrier?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Canal Water Investigation:** If your school is near a body of water, take students for an outdoor observation walk. Have them identify evidence of water's energy (erosion, moved objects, wave patterns). Sketch and label what they observe.\n\n2. **Energy Transfer in Dominoes:** Connect energy transfer to other contexts. Set up dominoes in a line and explain: \"The first domino's motion transfers energy to the next domino, just like waves transfer energy through water.\" Students design a domino pattern and predict which will fall first.\n\n3. **Sound Waves Investigation:** Extend wave concepts beyond water. Demonstrate sound waves using a tuning fork held over water (water droplets bounce). Have students hypothesize: \"Sound is energy that travels in waves, just like water waves. What objects does sound energy move?\" (Drum heads, eardrums, speakers.)\n\n4. **Design a Flood Protection Plan:** Provide students with a diagram of a town near a river that floods. Ask: \"Design a barrier system using your wave-stopping knowledge. Where would you place it? What would it look like? Draw and label your plan.\"\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
