Observe and describe how light reflects off different materials (shiny, transparent, colorful).\n2. Explain that we can see objects only when light reaches them.\n3. Plan and test how different materials look when light shines on them.\n4. Use observations to compare how light behaves differently with different objects.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the blue balloon with water droplets and confetti\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a large printout. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation—no talking yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing 1-2 minutes for responses):\n   - \"What do you see that is shiny or sparkly in this picture?\" (Students point to water droplets, balloon, confetti.)\n   - \"Why do you think those water drops look so bright and shiny?\" (Guide them to think about light bouncing off the drops.)\n   - \"What colors do you see in the confetti? Do all of the colors look the same brightness?\" (Discuss how some colors seem brighter than others.)\n   - \"What do you think would happen if we turned off the light in this picture? Could we still see the balloon and confetti?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what happens to things when light shines on them. Some things get shiny. Some things stay pretty. Some things hide in shadows. Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper for later reference.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to be scientists and do our own experiment with light and shiny things, just like in this picture!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how different materials interact with light.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- Flashlight or small LED light\n- White paper or dark construction paper\n- 5-6 small objects with different material properties:\n  - Shiny foil ball\n  - White tissue paper\n  - Clear plastic wrap\n  - Colored confetti or sequins\n  - Wooden block (natural, non-shiny)\n  - Cotton ball (fluffy, light-absorbing)\n- Observation recording sheet (see below)\n- Crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Sit in a circle with your group. One person holds the flashlight. Everyone else has your eyes ready to watch.\"\n\n2. \"Pick the first object (for example, the foil ball). Hold it in your hand or place it on the paper.\"\n\n3. \"Turn off the light in the room or dim it. Now, shine the flashlight directly onto your object from different angles—above it, to the side, underneath.\"\n\n4. \"Watch what happens. Does light bounce off it? Does it glow? Does it make a shadow? Does it stay dark?\"\n\n5. \"Take turns with the flashlight so everyone gets to shine and observe.\"\n\n6. \"On your recording sheet, draw what you saw. Did the light bounce? Was it shiny? Was it dark?\"\n\n7. \"Repeat steps 2-6 with each object.\"\n\n**How it connects to the photograph:**\n\"In the picture, the water droplets caught the light and bounced it back to the camera, so they look super shiny. The blue balloon is smooth and shiny too. The confetti pieces catch light and show their colors. Let's see how our objects do the same thing!\"\n\n**What students should record or document:**\n- A simple drawing of each object in the light\n- A check mark or happy face if the object was \"shiny/bright\"\n- A question mark or sad face if the object was \"dark\"\n- Coloring to show the colors they observed\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nCirculate between groups. Use facilitating questions, not answers:\n- \"What do you notice when the light hits that object?\"\n- \"Is that one shinier than the first one? Why do you think so?\"\n- \"Can you move the light to a different spot and watch what changes?\"\n- Do not tell students what to see; let them discover.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents will observe and note that:\n- Some materials reflect light brightly (foil, sequins, plastic).\n- Some materials absorb light and look dull (cotton, wood).\n- Light direction matters—objects look different when light comes from different angles.\n- Transparent materials (plastic wrap) let light through and can look different depending on the angle.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n- The original photograph\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather students in a circle with their observation sheets.\n   - Ask 3-4 students: \"What did you discover? Which object was the shiniest? How did you know?\"\n   - Record responses on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (point to pictures/examples as you speak):\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Light:** Energy that helps us see. It comes from sources like the sun, flashlights, and lamps. It travels super fast.\n   - **Shiny:** When something bounces light back to our eyes so it looks bright or sparkly.\n   - **Dark:** When light doesn't bounce back to our eyes, so it looks dull or hard to see.\n   - **Reflect:** When light bounces off something (like a mirror or water droplet).\n   - **Shadow:** A dark place where light can't reach because something is in the way.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the water droplets. \"These water drops are shiny because they reflect the light, just like your foil balls did.\"\n   - Point to the confetti. \"These colorful pieces catch light and bounce it to the camera, so they look bright and beautiful.\"\n   - Point to the dark background. \"The dark area behind the balloon? That's where there isn't much light, so we can't see as much.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding strategy:**\n   - Show the photograph again. \"Point to something that is shiny and reflects light.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why can we see the confetti in this picture? Is it because the light is off or on?\" (Light is on/shining on it.)\n   - Hold up one shiny object and one dark object. \"Which one reflects light? Which one does not?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents understand that:\n- Light is needed to see things.\n- Some materials are shiny and bounce light; others are dark and don't.\n- When light bounces off (reflects) an object, we can see it better.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by investigating shadows and light placement.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Flashlight\n- White paper\n- 3-4 small objects (from Explore, or new ones like toys, blocks)\n- Dark room or room with lights dimmed\n- Observation sheet: \"Shadow Detective\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**\"Shadow Detective\" Investigation:**\n\n1. \"You are a detective looking for shadows! Let's see what happens when we put things in the way of light.\"\n\n2. \"Choose an object. Place it on white paper. Shine the flashlight on the paper and on the object from the front.\"\n\n3. \"Now, shine the light from *behind* the object. What happens? Do you see a shadow? Where is it?\"\n\n4. \"Move the light closer to the object. What happens to the shadow? Move it farther away. What happens now?\"\n\n5. \"Is the shadow shiny? Is the shadow dark? Can you see through it?\"\n\n6. \"Draw the object and its shadow on your paper. Show where the light was coming from with an arrow.\"\n\n**Real-world connection:**\n\"When the sun is high in the sky, our shadows are small. When the sun is low in the morning or evening, our shadows are long and stretchy. The sun is the light source, just like our flashlight!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What changed about the shadow when you moved the light?\"\n- Allow students to experiment with multiple light positions and angles.\n- Celebrate observations: \"Great noticing! Your shadow got bigger!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents will recognize that:\n- Shadows form when light can't reach an object or surface.\n- Shadow size and direction change based on where the light comes from.\n- Shadows are dark because they are places without light.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light, reflection, and visibility.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment** (during lesson):\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Can they notice differences in how materials interact with light?\n- During Explain phase: Do students use words like \"shiny,\" \"dark,\" and \"light\" correctly when describing objects?\n- During Elaborate phase: Can students predict how a shadow will change when they move the light?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment** (end of lesson):\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet showing three scenarios. Read aloud and have them draw or point to the answer:\n\n1. **Scenario 1:** \"I have a toy ball. I turn off the lights in my classroom. Can I see the ball?\"\n   - Answer choices: Yes / No\n   - Follow-up: \"Why or why not?\"\n\n2. **Scenario 2:** \"I shine a flashlight on a shiny foil ball. What happens to the light?\"\n   - Answer choices: It bounces off (shiny) / It disappears into the ball\n   - Follow-up: \"Draw where the light goes.\"\n\n3. **Scenario 3:** \"I hold my toy in front of a light. What do I see on the wall behind it?\"\n   - Answer choices: A bright shape / A dark shadow shape\n   - Follow-up: \"Label it with the word shadow.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students correctly identify that light is needed to see objects (1-PS4-2).\n- Students observe and describe how different materials respond to light—some shiny, some dark (1-PS4-3).\n- Students can explain that shadows form when light cannot reach a surface.\n- Students use vocabulary (light, shiny, dark, reflect, shadow) accurately in context.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly answer 2 out of 3 exit ticket questions.\n- Students can explain in simple terms: \"We need light to see things\" and \"Some things are shiny because light bounces off them.\"\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n1. **Pair students with stronger observers.** Assign a more confident student to share the flashlight and help describe what they see.\n2. **Use simplified vocabulary.** Instead of \"reflect,\" say \"bounce back.\" Instead of \"light source,\" say \"where the light comes from.\"\n3. **Limit the number of objects.** Have students focus on 2-3 objects during Explore (e.g., foil, cotton, confetti) instead of 6, allowing for deeper observation of fewer items.\n4. **Use a brighter flashlight or LED light** that creates more dramatic effects, making it easier for students to notice differences.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n1. **Experiment with angles and distances.** Ask: \"If I move the light closer, does the shadow get bigger or smaller? Can you predict before testing?\" Have them test multiple angles and record results.\n2. **Compare multiple light sources.** Provide different flashlights, a phone flashlight, and a lamp. Ask: \"Do different lights create different shadows? Why?\"\n3. **Introduce transparency categories.** Have students sort objects into \"lets light through,\" \"bounces light,\" and \"blocks light,\" using vocabulary like transparent, translucent, and opaque.\n4. **Design a light path investigation.** Ask: \"Can you arrange mirrors, plastic, and foil to make light bounce in a special path? Show me with a drawing where the light goes.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Sunshine and Shadows\" Nature Walk:** Take students outside on a sunny day. Have them trace or draw their own shadows at different times (morning, midday, afternoon). Discuss: \"Why is your shadow longer in the morning? Why is it shorter at lunch?\" This connects the lesson to real-world light sources (the sun).\n\n2. **Shadow Puppet Theater:** Provide a white sheet, a flashlight, and simple cardboard shapes (animals, objects). Have students place shapes between the light and the sheet to create shadow puppets. Students create a simple story: \"The shadow cat is dancing!\" This reinforces that shadows form when light is blocked and applies the concept to drama/storytelling.\n\n3. **Shiny vs. Dark Scavenger Hunt:** Send students around the classroom or home to find objects that are shiny (reflect light) and objects that are dark (do not reflect light). Have them sort pictures or real items into two groups and share: \"This aluminum foil is shiny because light bounces off it. This black cloth is dark because it doesn't bounce light back.\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson works best in a room where you can dim the lights (but not completely dark, for safety with First Graders).\n- If outdoor space is limited, the \"flashlight exploration\" works equally well in a classroom corner with a sheet or dark cloth draped to reduce ambient light.\n- The photograph is an excellent reference point throughout—return to it frequently to reinforce how the concepts apply to the real image.\n- Encourage curiosity; First Graders learn best by asking \"what if?\" questions. Model this: \"What if I put the light here instead? Let's try!\"",
