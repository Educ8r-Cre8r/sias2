ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about forces and water using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on projector or printed large (8.5\" × 11\" or larger)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\nDisplay the photograph showing the fire hydrant, traffic cone, and water flowing around them near a canal or stream. Allow students to observe silently for 10-15 seconds.\n\n**Discussion Questions:**\n1. \"What do you notice is happening to the water in this picture? Describe what the water is doing around the orange cone and the blue fire hydrant.\"\n2. \"Why do you think these objects (the cone and hydrant) are placed right next to the water? What job might they have?\"\n3. \"If I pushed on the orange cone with my hand, what would happen? But the water is also pushing on it. How is the water's push different from a hand push?\"\n4. \"What do you predict would happen if we removed the cone and hydrant? How would the water move differently?\"\n\nRecord student observations and predictions on chart paper without correcting misconceptions.\n\n**Prediction Prompt:**\n\"Today, we're going to investigate how forces—like pushing water—can move around obstacles. We'll act like engineers who design things to protect communities from flooding. Let's explore how different barriers change the way water moves!\"\n\n**Transition:**\n\"Now let's get our hands wet and test how moving water behaves when it hits different barriers, just like in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on investigation of forces and motion using water.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large shallow bins or trays (one per group of 3-4 students)\n- Water (pre-filled bins or water table access)\n- Barrier materials: small plastic cups, cardboard rectangles, craft sticks, sponges, small plastic blocks\n- Spray bottles or small watering cans to apply force/create moving water\n- Towels for cleanup\n- Notebook or data sheet for observations\n- Rulers or measuring tape (optional, for measuring water displacement)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Setup:** Divide students into groups of 3-4. Each group gets a bin with 2-3 inches of water.\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Each group will place ONE barrier in the middle of your water bin. Your barrier should be standing upright, like the cone in the picture.\"\n\n2. \"Now, use your spray bottle to spray water toward the barrier from one direction. Spray with the same amount of force each time. Watch what happens to the water around the barrier.\"\n\n3. \"Record what you see: Does the water go around the barrier? Does it splash? Where does the water go? Draw or write your observations.\"\n\n4. \"Now, try spraying from a different direction. Does the water move the same way? Record your observations again.\"\n\n5. \"Switch barriers with another group and repeat steps 1-4. Notice if different barriers cause different patterns.\"\n\n6. \"Try this: Place TWO barriers next to each other (like the cone and hydrant). Spray water between them. What pattern does the water make now?\"\n\n**How This Connects to the Photograph:**\n\"In the picture, the water from the canal is pushing (exerting a force) on the cone and hydrant. We're doing the same thing in our bins—applying a force and watching what happens.\"\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Drawing of barrier placement and water movement\n- Direction water moved\n- Whether water splashed, flowed around, or stayed in one spot\n- Observations comparing different barriers\n- Notes on patterns they noticed\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nCirculate among groups asking guiding questions without giving answers:\n- \"What direction did you push the water? What happened?\"\n- \"If you push from the other side, do you think the water will move the same way or differently?\"\n- \"Which barrier did the water move around most easily? Why do you think that is?\"\n- \"Can you predict what will happen if we use a taller barrier?\"\n\nEncourage students to test predictions and repeat experiments. Prompt them to notice patterns: \"Do you see the water always moving the same way when you spray from the same direction?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Recognizable drawings showing water paths around barriers\n- Observations noting direction of water movement\n- Recognition that barriers change the path of moving water\n- Patterns emerging (e.g., water moves around all sides of a round object; water flows in a line behind a rectangular barrier)\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Samples of barriers used in Explore phase\n- Optional: short video clip (2-3 minutes) of water flow around objects\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\nGather students in a circle or on the floor. Ask volunteers from each group to briefly show their barriers and describe their findings.\n- \"Show us which barrier the water moved around most easily.\"\n- \"What patterns did you notice when you pushed the water in the same direction each time?\"\n- \"Did anyone test what happens with two barriers together?\"\n\nListen for observations about direction, patterns, and barrier effectiveness. Affirm correct thinking and gently address misconceptions using evidence from their investigations.\n\n**Key Vocabulary Introduction:**\nPresent each term on chart paper with a simple definition and a visual example:\n\n1. **Force:** A push or a pull that makes something move or change direction. *Example:* \"The water pushing on the cone is a force.\"\n\n2. **Motion:** The way something moves from one place to another. *Example:* \"The water's motion was around the cone in a circle.\"\n\n3. **Balanced Forces:** Pushes or pulls that are equal and opposite, so an object doesn't move. *Example:* \"If two people push a box from opposite sides with equal strength, the box doesn't move because the forces are balanced.\"\n\n4. **Unbalanced Forces:** Pushes or pulls that are not equal, so an object moves in the direction of the stronger force. *Example:* \"The water's force pushing on the cone was stronger than any push back, so the water moved around it.\"\n\n5. **Barrier:** Something that blocks or slows down movement. *Example:* \"The cone and hydrant are barriers that the water has to move around.\"\n\n**Connections Back to the Photograph:**\n\"Look at this picture again. The water from the canal is pushing on the cone and hydrant with unbalanced forces. The cone and hydrant cannot push back as hard, so the water moves around them. The engineers who put these barriers there designed them to direct the water so it doesn't flood the sidewalk and grass. Just like in your investigations, they used barriers to change the motion of the water!\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\nAsk students:\n- \"Point to the barrier in this picture. What is the water doing to it?\"\n- \"If the water is pushing on the cone, is the cone pushing back on the water? (Yes, but not as hard, so it's unbalanced.)\"\n- \"Can you predict: if we used a much bigger, heavier barrier, what might happen to the water?\" (It would be harder to move; the water would pool up; the barrier might resist the force better.)\n- \"Turn and talk to a neighbor: What's the difference between balanced and unbalanced forces? Give an example from our investigation.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly use terms \"force,\" \"motion,\" and \"barrier\" in sentences.\n- Students identify unbalanced forces in the photograph and their investigation.\n- Students explain (in simple terms) that the water moved around the barriers because the water's push was stronger.\n- Students make connections between their bin experiment and real-world flood control.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to design a solution to a real-world flood control problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bins of water (same as Explore phase)\n- Variety of building materials: plastic cups, popsicle sticks, foam pieces, cardboard, tape, clay, small blocks, sponges\n- Design challenge worksheet (see below) or verbal directions\n- Rulers/measuring tape\n- Towels and cleanup supplies\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Design Challenge Introduction:**\n\"A local community has a small stream near their homes. When it rains a lot, the water flows really fast and sometimes goes where it shouldn't. The city engineers need your help! Your job is to design a barrier (or system of barriers) that will slow down the water or redirect it in a specific direction. Your goal is to protect that imaginary community.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Directions:**\n\n1. \"Look at your water bin. Imagine one side of the bin is a neighborhood and the other side is wild land where water can safely flow.\"\n\n2. \"Your challenge: Design a barrier or barriers that will redirect the water AWAY from the neighborhood side and toward the wild land side.\"\n\n3. \"You have 10 minutes to build your design using the materials provided. Think about what you learned: What shapes work best? Do you need one barrier or more than one? How tall should it be?\"\n\n4. \"Once you've built your barrier, test it by spraying water toward the neighborhood side. Does your design work? Does the water go where you planned?\"\n\n5. \"If it doesn't work, redesign it! You can change the shape, add more barriers, or make it taller. Test again.\"\n\n6. \"Be ready to explain: What forces were you trying to control? How does your design change the motion of the water?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Observe without intervening initially; allow students to test and fail.\n- Ask guiding questions:\n  - \"What do you want the water to do? Show me with your hands how you want it to move.\"\n  - \"Is the water moving the way you planned? Why or why not?\"\n  - \"What would happen if you made your barrier taller/wider/at an angle?\"\n  - \"Look back at the photo. The cone is pointed at the top. Did you try a pointed shape?\"\n- Encourage iteration: \"Engineers test, fail, and redesign. Let's try again!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design and build a functional barrier system.\n- Students test their design and make observations about results.\n- Students make at least one revision based on results.\n- Students articulate (verbally or in writing) how their design controls the force and motion of water.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces, motion, and barrier design.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observation checklist during Explore phase: Do students correctly apply water force? Do they record observations? Do they identify patterns?\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain phase: Can they use vocabulary? Do they connect to the photograph?\n- Observe Design Challenge: Can students articulate a problem and attempt a solution? Do they test and revise?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (digital or paper) with the following questions. Students can respond with drawings, words, or a combination.\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Observation Question:** \"Look at this picture of water flowing. Draw or describe where the water will go if we place a barrier here.\" (Show a simple diagram with a stream and an empty spot for a barrier.)\n\n2. **Vocabulary Question:** \"Fill in the blank: A __________ is a push or a pull. When the water pushes the cone, that's a __________.\"\n   - Options: force, motion, barrier\n\n3. **Pattern/Prediction Question:** \"You sprayed water at a barrier from the same direction three times. What did you notice? Did the water move the same way each time, or did it move differently?\" (This assesses whether students recognized patterns.)\n\n4. **Design Thinking Question:** \"If you wanted to slow down water flowing toward your house, would you use a tall barrier or a wide barrier, or both? Why?\" (This assesses application of knowledge.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ **Emerging:** Student identifies barriers and recognizes that water moves around objects.\n- ✓ **Developing:** Student uses some vocabulary (force, motion, barrier) and describes how barriers change water direction; attempts a design.\n- ✓ **Proficient:** Student correctly uses force/motion vocabulary; explains that unbalanced forces cause water to move; designs and tests a barrier system; predicts outcomes based on observations.\n- ✓ **Advanced:** Student articulates cause-and-effect relationships between force strength/direction and motion; designs multiple barriers; explains why certain designs are more effective.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents demonstrate understanding by:\n- Correctly answering 3 of 4 exit ticket questions.\n- Using at least two vocabulary terms (force, motion, barrier, unbalanced) correctly.\n- Identifying a pattern (water moves predictably in the same direction when force is applied consistently).\n- Designing a barrier that successfully redirects water away from a designated area.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support for Struggling Learners:**\n\n1. **Guided Barrier Exploration:** Before independent work, model the investigation for students. Physically demonstrate spraying water and ask them to predict and observe with you. This pre-teaching builds confidence.\n\n2. **Barrier Template:** Provide pre-made barriers (cups, blocks) for Explore phase so students focus on testing force and motion rather than building. They can place and arrange existing objects.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Explanations:** Provide frames like:\n   - \"The water moved __________ because __________.\"\n   - \"The barrier changed the water's motion by __________.\"\n   - \"I predicted the water would __________, and it actually __________.\"\n\n4. **Smaller Group Design Challenge:** In Elaborate, pair struggling students with stronger peers for the design challenge, or provide a simplified challenge: \"Make the water go around, not through, the barrier.\"\n\n**Challenge for Advanced Learners:**\n\n1. **Multi-Barrier System Design:** Ask: \"Design a system using 3-4 barriers to create a specific water path (e.g., zigzag, spiral, direct to one corner). Can you make the water follow a map you draw first?\"\n\n2. **Force Measurement:** Provide measuring cups and ask advanced students to quantify: \"If you use one spray bottle push, the water splashes 2 inches. If you use two pushes, it splashes 4 inches. What pattern do you see? Can you predict how far 3 pushes will go?\"\n\n3. **Real-World Application Extension:** \"Research how your town/city handles stormwater. What barriers or systems do engineers use? Could you design an improvement?\"\n\n4. **Slope and Angle Investigation:** Provide tilted water bins and ask: \"Does the angle of the barrier matter? Test barriers at different angles and compare.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Flood Barrier Art and Engineering Project:** Students research real flood barriers (levees, flood walls, dikes) used in their region or around the world. They create a poster or 3D model showing how the barrier works and explaining the forces involved. Connect to social studies by discussing communities that experience flooding.\n\n2. **Classroom Stream Table:** Set up a larger, sloped water table or trough (if available) with sand and soil. Students engineer erosion-control barriers (rocks, sticks, sponges) to prevent soil loss when water flows. This extends the lesson to real-world geology and ecosystem protection while reinforcing force and motion concepts.\n\n3. **Predictive Motion Graphing:** Students test barriers of increasing heights and measure how far water splashes (distance = motion). Create a graph showing barrier height vs. splash distance. Introduce the concept that they can predict motion outcomes based on measured data (3-PS2-2).\n\n4. **Water Diversion Relay Race:** Students design small barriers on a sloped surface with water flowing from above. They predict whether water will reach a \"town\" at the bottom. This gamified version reinforces design thinking and cause-and-effect reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\nThis lesson directly leverages the photograph's real-world context (flood control infrastructure) to make abstract concepts of force and motion tangible for third graders. The progression from observation to hands-on testing to design application ensures deep engagement with both NGSS standards. The use of water—a fluid that clearly demonstrates unbalanced forces—provides powerful, memorable evidence of motion patterns. Students leave with both scientific understanding and an appreciation for how engineers solve community problems using physics principles.",
