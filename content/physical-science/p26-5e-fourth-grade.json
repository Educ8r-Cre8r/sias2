ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about large objects and movement using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the dockship photograph (or printed copies, one per student)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Access to a globe or map showing major shipping ports\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or distribute printed copies. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Launch with this statement:** \"This giant ship is called a dockship. It carries cargo across oceans and weighs as much as 50 elephants! Today, we're going to figure out: *What does it take to move something this heavy?*\"\n\n3. **Facilitate a whole-group discussion** using these four scaffolded questions:\n   - \"What do you notice about the size of this ship? How would you describe it to someone who's never seen it?\"\n   - \"What do you think makes this ship move through the water? Where does that 'push' come from?\"\n   - \"Do you think it's easier or harder to push this ship than to push a toy boat? Why?\"\n   - \"If we wanted to make this ship go faster, what would we need to do?\"\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Think-Pair-Share: If you could give this ship *more power* from its engines, what would happen to how fast it moves? Talk to a partner about your idea, then we'll share.\"\n\n5. **Record predictions** on chart paper without correcting them. Return to these at the end of the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Now let's build our own boats and do an experiment to test your ideas about force, motion, and energy.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the relationship between force, resistance, and motion through a hands-on model boat activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small plastic containers or foam trays (one per pair/small group) for boat hulls\n- Plastic drinking straws\n- String (about 2 feet per group)\n- Tape\n- Washers or small weights (10–15 per group)\n- Shallow bins or troughs filled with water (or a large plastic water table if available)\n- Metric rulers\n- Timer or stopwatch\n- Data recording sheets (see template below)\n- Optional: small sails made from paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and display visually):**\n\n1. **Build your boat model:**\n   - Use a small plastic container as your boat hull.\n   - Tape a straw to the top of the container (this will be where you attach your force).\n   - Tie a string (about 2 feet long) to the straw. This string is your \"engine rope.\"\n\n2. **Set up your water test:**\n   - Fill a shallow bin or trough with water (about 4–6 inches deep).\n   - Place your boat in the water.\n   - Mark a starting line with tape on the side of the bin.\n\n3. **Test 1—Light load (small force):**\n   - Have one partner hold the boat at the starting line while another pulls the string with *light force* (easy, gentle pull).\n   - Measure and record how far the boat travels in 5 seconds.\n   - Write the distance on your data sheet.\n\n4. **Test 2—Medium load:**\n   - Tape 5–7 washers (weights) inside the boat to make it heavier.\n   - Repeat the pull with the *same light force* as before.\n   - Measure and record the distance.\n   - What changed? Does the heavier boat move the same distance?\n\n5. **Test 3—More force with heavy load:**\n   - Keep the washers in the boat (it's still heavy).\n   - Now pull the string with *stronger force* (pull harder and faster).\n   - Measure and record the distance traveled in 5 seconds.\n   - Compare this to Test 2.\n\n6. **Optional challenge:** Add a paper sail and test again. Does the sail help push the boat faster? Record what you observe.\n\n**Data Recording Sheet Template:**\n\n| Test | Weight (light/heavy) | Force Applied (light/strong) | Distance Traveled (cm) | Speed Observation | Notes |\n|------|----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| 1    | Light                | Light                        |                        |                   |       |\n| 2    | Heavy                | Light                        |                        |                   |       |\n| 3    | Heavy                | Strong                       |                        |                   |       |\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to ensure boats are built correctly but don't suggest how to pull or predict outcomes.\n- If a group finishes early, ask probing questions: \"What do you notice about the tests? Which test moved farthest? Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Refrain from confirming or correcting predictions; let data speak.\n- Ensure water stays in bins and provide towels for spills.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that a **heavier boat moves less distance** when pulled with the same light force (Test 1 vs. Test 2).\n- Students discover that **stronger force moves the boat farther**, even when it's heavy (Test 2 vs. Test 3).\n- Students begin to understand the relationship: *More force = more motion* and *Resistance (weight/drag) reduces motion*.\n- All groups complete a data table with at least three trials.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration findings to the dockship photograph and scientific principles.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary words written large\n- Photograph of dockship (displayed again)\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Whiteboard or interactive display\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2–3 groups to share their results: \"What did you discover when you added weights to your boat?\"\n   - Ask: \"What happened when you pulled harder on the string?\"\n   - Highlight similarities in results across groups.\n\n2. **Introduce and Define Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   Display each term on chart paper with a visual or gesture. Use student-friendly language and reference their investigation:\n\n   - **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or changes how it moves. *In your experiment, pulling the string was a force. The ship's engines create a force to push it through water.*\n   \n   - **Motion:** When something changes position and moves from one place to another. *Your boat moved through the water—that was motion!*\n   \n   - **Resistance (or Drag):** A force that works against motion and tries to slow things down. *Water pushes back against your boat, and the weight inside makes it harder to move. Those are types of resistance.*\n   \n   - **Energy:** The ability to make things happen or make things move. *Your muscles gave energy to pull the string. The ship's engines use energy from fuel to move the ship.*\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the dockship image again.\n   - \"This giant ship is **very heavy**—that's lots of resistance! Its engines have to use a lot of **energy** to create enough **force** to move it through the water. The heavier the ship, the more energy it needs.\"\n   - \"When a ship goes faster, its engines work harder. Why? Because it has to push against even more water resistance at higher speeds!\"\n   - \"Just like in your experiment: more force = faster motion. The ship's engines create more force, and the ship speeds up.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - **Quick Poll:** \"Show me with your hands: If a ship is twice as heavy, does it need the same amount of engine power, more power, or less power? Why?\"\n   - Listen for language like \"more force,\" \"more energy,\" or \"resistance.\"\n   - Ask: \"If you could pull our boat with two people instead of one, what would happen?\"\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Card (display or provide to students):**\n\n| Word | What It Means | Example |\n|------|---------------|---------|\n| **Force** | A push or pull | Pulling the string; the ship's engines pushing water |\n| **Motion** | Movement from one place to another | The boat moving across the water |\n| **Resistance** | A force that opposes motion and slows things down | Water pushing against the boat; weight inside the boat |\n| **Energy** | The ability to make things move or change | Muscles pulling the string; fuel in the ship's engines |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use at least two vocabulary terms correctly when describing their findings.\n- Students can explain why a heavier object needs more force to move.\n- Students understand that the dockship needs powerful engines because it is so heavy and must overcome water resistance.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply force and energy concepts to a new engineering challenge and deepen understanding of real-world applications.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original boat models from Explore phase (or new ones)\n- Additional weights/washers\n- Various materials: paper sails, aluminum foil, cardboard fins, small fans (battery-operated, optional)\n- Water bins (same as Explore)\n- Measuring tapes\n- Challenge cards (printed or displayed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge Scenario:**\n\"Imagine you are a ship engineer. A cargo company wants you to design a way to move their *heavy* ship faster without using *too much fuel* (which costs money). You need to find a **smart solution** that uses force efficiently.\"\n\n**Student Options (Choose one or two):**\n\n**Option A—Add a Power Source (intermediate):**\n- Keep your heavy boat (with washers).\n- Test different \"engines\": pulling with one finger, pulling with three fingers, using a small battery-operated fan to \"blow\" the boat.\n- Measure: Which uses the *least effort* but still moves the boat far? Record your observations.\n- **Real-world connection:** Ships use different types of engines. Which is most efficient?\n\n**Option B—Redesign the Hull (challenge):**\n- Your boat is too slow! Redesign the shape of the hull using your materials (aluminum foil, cardboard, etc.) to reduce water resistance.\n- Keep the same weight and force, but change the boat shape.\n- Test your new design. Does it move farther or faster?\n- **Real-world connection:** Modern ships have special hull shapes to reduce drag and save fuel!\n\n**Option C—Predict and Test (support):**\n- Use your original boat data table.\n- Predict: \"If I add *10 washers* instead of 5, how far will the boat move when I pull with the same force?\"\n- Test and compare your prediction to actual results.\n- Record: Was your prediction correct? What surprised you?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Assign options based on student readiness (Option C for support, A for on-level, B for advanced).\n- Ask clarifying questions: \"Why do you think that hull shape works better?\" \"What force are you using now?\"\n- Encourage testing and refinement: \"Let's try it again. Did you get the same result?\"\n- Provide encouragement for risk-taking and \"failed\" designs: \"That didn't work, but what did you learn?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design and test a modification to their boat model.\n- Students collect and record new data comparing their design to the original.\n- Students articulate how their changes relate to force, energy, or resistance.\n- Students recognize real-world applications (ship design, fuel efficiency, engineering trade-offs).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of force, motion, energy, and resistance through formative and summative assessment.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist** (teacher notes during Explore and Elaborate):\n  - ✓ Student accurately collects data in their table\n  - ✓ Student uses force and motion vocabulary in explanations\n  - ✓ Student makes predictions based on prior observations\n  - ✓ Student tests modifications and compares results\n\n**Exit Ticket (summative—administer at end of lesson, 5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a card or paper. They may draw, write, or dictate answers:\n\n1. **Picture Prompt:** Show a simple drawing of a boat in water with an arrow showing \"pull.\"\n   - **Question:** \"Why does a heavier boat need a *stronger pull* to move the same distance as a light boat?\"\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student mentions resistance, weight, or force (in their own words).\n\n2. **Real-World Application:**\n   - **Question:** \"The dockship in our photo is VERY heavy. Why do you think its engines are so powerful?\"\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student connects engine power to the ship's weight or water resistance.\n\n3. **Prediction:**\n   - **Question:** \"If we made our boat *twice as heavy*, what would happen to how far it moves when we pull with the same force?\"\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student predicts it won't move as far and gives a reason (e.g., \"more resistance,\" \"harder to push\").\n\n**Summative Assessment Option (alternative/extension):**\n\n**Design Brief (individual or pair):**\n- Provide this scenario: *\"Your job is to help a shipping company move cargo faster without using extra fuel. Draw or describe ONE change you would make to a ship's design and explain why it would help. Use words like force, energy, and resistance.\"*\n- Rubric:\n  - **Emerging:** Student identifies a change but doesn't explain why.\n  - **Proficient:** Student identifies a change and uses 1–2 vocabulary terms to explain (e.g., \"Make the bottom smoother to reduce resistance\").\n  - **Advanced:** Student identifies a change with detailed explanation using 3+ vocabulary terms and references to the investigation (e.g., \"Reduce the boat's weight like we did in our experiment—less weight means less resistance, so the same engine power moves it faster\").\n\n**Success Criteria for Learning Objectives:**\n- **Objective 1 (Explain force & energy relationship):** Student correctly states that heavier objects need more force to move the same distance; uses at least one vocabulary term.\n- **Objective 2 (Predict changes in speed):** Student predicts that greater force increases speed; prediction is based on data from their investigation.\n- **Objective 3 (Design and test):** Student builds a boat, conducts 3+ trials, records data, and tests a modification.\n- **Objective 4 (Communicate):** Student uses force, motion, energy, or resistance in at least 2 contexts (spoken or written).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly explain why a heavier object needs more force.\n- 75% of students make an accurate prediction about speed changes based on force.\n- 100% of students complete at least one boat test and record data.\n- 85% of students use at least one vocabulary term correctly in their exit ticket.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Data Table:**\n   - Provide a 2-column table: \"How Far Did It Go?\" and \"Observation\" instead of the full 5-column table. Students draw or mark with tape how far the boat traveled rather than measuring.\n\n2. **Verbal Scaffolding:**\n   - Pair student with a strong peer or aide during Explore. Ask guiding questions like: \"Is the boat moving farther or closer? Is it going faster or slower?\" instead of open-ended prompts.\n\n3. **Reduced Options in Elaborate:**\n   - Assign only **Option C (Predict and Test)** to provide a more structured, familiar task. Reduce the number of trials from three to two.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Engineering Design Challenge:**\n   - Provide the Elaborate \"Option B—Redesign the Hull\" with added constraints: \"Make the boat faster *and* lighter without sacrificing cargo space.\" Require a written design explanation.\n\n2. **Quantitative Analysis:**\n   - Ask advanced students to calculate the boat's speed (distance ÷ time) for each trial and create a simple line graph showing how force affects speed. Introduce the concept of efficiency: \"Which test used the least energy to move the boat the farthest?\"\n\n3. **Real-World Research Extension:**\n   - Have students research and present on how actual ships reduce resistance (hull coatings, hydrodynamic design, propeller types). Create a poster connecting their findings to the classroom investigation.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Compare Different Boat Hulls (20–30 minutes):**\n   - Provide 3–4 pre-built boat models with different hull shapes (wide, narrow, pointed, flat-bottomed). Test each with the same weight and force. Graph results. Discuss why ship engineers care about hull design. *Connects to real-world naval architecture.*\n\n2. **Energy Conversion Challenge (30 minutes):**\n   - Build a simple pulley system or water wheel that demonstrates energy conversion: human muscle energy → mechanical energy → boat motion. Test with heavier and lighter loads. *Addresses 4-PS3-4: energy conversion.*\n\n3. **Design a Mini-Port (45 minutes, homework or project-based learning):**\n   - Students design a harbor or dock system for toy boats. They must plan how to move different-sized \"ships\" (varying weights) in and out of the port. Present designs explaining how much \"engine power\" each ship needs based on its weight. *Applies concepts to engineering and planning.*\n\n4. **Resistance Race (20 minutes):**\n   - Add a competitive element: Two boats, same force applied, but one has a sail and one has a streamlined shape. Which reaches the finish line first? Repeat 3 times. Discuss whether the results are always the same and why. *Introduces variability and need for repeated trials.*\n\n5. **Video Analysis: Real Ships in Action (15 minutes):**\n   - Show a short video (2–3 minutes) of a large cargo ship moving through water or port. Students annotate: Where is the force coming from? What resistance do they see? How fast is it moving? Discuss how the classroom investigation helps us understand real ships. *Bridges to real-world application and media literacy.*\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Classroom Management\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure water stays contained in bins. Have towels and a mop available. Supervise water activities closely.\n- **Material Prep:** Pre-build 1–2 sample boats before the lesson so you can demonstrate the assembly quickly.\n- **Pacing:** If students struggle with boat-building, provide pre-made hulls (plastic containers already taped) and let them focus on testing.\n- **Motivation:** Emphasize that they are doing what real ship engineers do—testing and improving designs.\n- **Technology:** Consider photographing student boats and data for a class digital gallery or presentation.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly addresses the photograph by using a real-world example (the massive dockship) to motivate inquiry into the fundamental physical science principles that explain how such objects move. Students transition from wonder to investigation to application, building confidence in scientific thinking while maintaining grade-level appropriateness.**",
