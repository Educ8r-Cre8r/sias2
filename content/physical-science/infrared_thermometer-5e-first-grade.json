Identify that thermometers are tools used to measure whether something is hot or cold.\n2. Explain that different places or materials can have different temperatures.\n3. Conduct simple observations using a thermometer to compare warm and cool locations in the classroom.\n4. Describe what they discovered about temperature in different places using pictures and simple words.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about measuring heat and introduce the thermometer as a heat-hunting tool.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed or projected photograph of the infrared thermometer on the brick/concrete\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: warm water in a cup, ice pack (for sensory reference only—not for measurement yet)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or document camera. Ask students to gather on the carpet.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions** (use hand signals for responses—thumbs up/down or show of hands):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is the yellow thing?\" (Students should notice the handheld device and the number on the screen.)\n   - \"The number says 119.5. What do you think that number means?\" (Accept all responses: \"It's hot! It's a score! It's a measurement!\")\n   - \"Why would someone point this tool at a brick wall? What are they trying to find out?\"\n   - \"Have you ever felt something really hot (like the sidewalk in summer) or really cold (like ice)? How did you know it was hot or cold?\"\n\n3. **Launch the wonder prompt:**\n   - \"This tool is called a **thermometer**. It hunts for heat! Today, we're going to be heat hunters too. We'll find out which places in our classroom are warm and which are cool. Who wants to be a heat hunter?\"\n\n**Transition:**\n\"Let's explore our classroom and use a thermometer to find out where the warm and cool places are hiding!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students conduct hands-on temperature investigations and gather observational data.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 2–3 digital thermometers (regular, inexpensive ones—not infrared, as they are fragile) OR 2–3 analog thermometers\n- Observation sheet (template provided below with pictures/words for recording)\n- Clipboards\n- Pencils and crayons\n- 4–6 pre-identified classroom locations marked with tape or signs (e.g., near the sunny window, in the shaded corner, by the door, under a lamp, on the shelf, near the heater/AC vent)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Review tool safety:** Show students the thermometer. Explain: \"This tool measures heat. We read the number that it shows us. We don't shake it or drop it. We hold it gently.\"\n\n2. **Divide the class into 2–3 small groups** (4–5 students per group). Assign each group a thermometer and a starting location.\n\n3. **Provide step-by-step directions** (use visual aids or act these out):\n   - \"Gently place the thermometer in your location for 30 seconds. Count slowly or listen to the timer.\"\n   - \"Look at the number the thermometer shows.\"\n   - \"Draw or write the number on your observation sheet. Tell your partner if it's hot, warm, or cool.\"\n   - \"Move to the next location and repeat.\"\n\n4. **Rotate groups** through 3–4 locations over 15 minutes. Teacher or aide facilitates each rotation and prompts observation:\n   - \"What number do you see?\"\n   - \"Is this place warmer or cooler than where you just were?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this place is warmer/cooler?\" (Accept inferences: \"The sun is shining here!\" \"It's in the shade.\" \"The heater is on.\")\n\n5. **Record findings:** Students draw or circle pictures on the observation sheet (sun symbol for warm, snowflake for cool) and write or copy numbers.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between groups. Ask guiding questions rather than providing answers.\n- Model how to read the thermometer for the first group (point to the number and say it aloud).\n- Prompt discussion: \"Which place felt warmer? How do you know?\"\n- Help students handle thermometers gently; supervise closely.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students record at least 3 temperature readings on their observation sheet.\n- Students make simple comparisons: \"This place is warmer/cooler than that place.\"\n- Students verbally explain one reason why a place is warm or cool (e.g., \"The window lets sunshine in\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and connect student discoveries to the concept of heat and measurement.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Recorded temperature data from Explore phase (teacher compiles on chart paper)\n- Large thermometer visual or classroom anchor chart\n- Picture cards or magazine cutouts showing hot/warm/cool objects (sun, ice cream, blanket, snowman, etc.)\n- Word cards: THERMOMETER, TEMPERATURE, HOT, COLD, WARM, COOL\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on the carpet.** Display the chart with their findings from the Explore phase.\n\n2. **Facilitate group share-out:**\n   - \"What did we find? Which place was the warmest?\" (Point to the location with the highest number on the chart.)\n   - \"Which place was the coolest?\" (Point to the lowest number.)\n   - \"How did the thermometer help us know?\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary** with First Grade-friendly definitions and pictures:\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Visual** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|-----------|\n   | **Thermometer** | A tool that tells us if something is hot, warm, or cold. It shows us a number. | Show the tool; point to the number display. |\n   | **Temperature** | How hot or cold something is. We use a thermometer to measure it. | Point to the thermometer reading; show a sun (hot) and ice (cold). |\n   | **Heat** | The energy that makes things feel warm or hot. Heat moves from hot places to cold places. | Show the warm window location vs. the cool corner. |\n   | **Hot/Warm/Cold** | Words that describe temperature. Hot = very warm. Cold = very cool. | Use picture cards: hot = summer sun; warm = lukewarm water; cold = ice. |\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Show the original infrared thermometer photo.\n   - \"This special thermometer hunts for heat using invisible light. It works like magic to find warm places without even touching them! The number 119.5 means the brick wall in the sunshine was very, very hot!\"\n   - \"We used a regular thermometer, and it also showed us numbers. Both tools help us measure temperature.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your hand: Is a thermometer used to measure temperature?\" (Thumbs up/down.)\n   - \"If the thermometer shows 85, is that hot or cold?\" (Wait for responses; affirm understanding.)\n   - \"Turn to your neighbor and tell them: Where in our classroom is the warmest place?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Thermometer:** A tool that measures how hot or cold something is and shows us a number.\n- **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is.\n- **Heat:** The warm energy that makes things feel hot. Heat travels from warm things to cool things.\n- **Hot:** Very warm; a high temperature.\n- **Cold:** Not warm; a low temperature.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that a thermometer is a tool for measuring temperature.\n- Students can identify hot vs. cold using the classroom examples they discovered.\n- Students recognize that the number on a thermometer tells us if something is hot or cold.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply temperature measurement concepts to a new, hands-on scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 3 containers of water at different temperatures (warm, room temperature, cool—use thermometers to verify beforehand):\n  - **Warm water:** ~110°F (not hot enough to hurt; test on your wrist first)\n  - **Room temperature water:** ~70°F\n  - **Cool water:** ~50°F (add a few ice cubes 5 minutes before; remove before activity)\n- 3 plastic cups labeled with pictures: sun (warm), leaf (room temp), snowflake (cool)\n- Thermometer for each container\n- Observation recording sheet with three water droplet drawings\n- Washcloths or towels for hand drying\n- **Safety reminder card** posted visibly\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up three water stations** in a tray or at a table with towels underneath to catch spills.\n\n2. **Safety briefing:** \"We're going to explore water at different temperatures. The warm water is comfortable—like a nice bath. We will NOT touch water that is too hot. Everyone stays safe.\"\n\n3. **Guide students through the exploration:**\n   - \"Use your thermometer to check the temperature of each cup. What number do you see in the warm water? The cool water?\"\n   - \"Dip your finger into the warm water. How does it feel? Is it warmer than room temperature? Dip into cool water. How does it feel different?\"\n   - \"Draw or write the temperature numbers on your sheet. Draw a happy face if the water feels nice and comfortable.\"\n\n4. **Debrief:**\n   - \"Which water was warmest? Which was coolest? How do you know?\"\n   - \"Could we use a thermometer to check the temperature of your bath water at home? Yes! Thermometers help us stay safe and comfortable.\"\n\n5. **Real-world connection:**\n   - \"Grown-ups use thermometers to check if your food is cooked safely. They use thermometers to check if you have a fever when you're sick. Thermometers help us stay healthy!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Supervise water handling closely. Test water temperature on your own wrist before students participate.\n- Prompt observations: \"Is this warmer or cooler than the last cup?\"\n- Guide students to use the thermometer to verify their sensory predictions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully measure and record three different temperatures.\n- Students describe differences in temperature using sensory language and numbers.\n- Students articulate one real-world use of a thermometer (e.g., checking bath temperature, checking if food is safe).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of thermometers, temperature, and heat measurement.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n- Observe student interactions with thermometers during Explore and Elaborate phases. Look for:\n  - Can students read a temperature number (even if not perfectly)?\n  - Do they use comparison language (\"warmer,\" \"cooler,\" \"hotter,\" \"colder\")?\n  - Can they explain why a location is warm or cool?\n- Use questioning prompts to gauge understanding:\n  - \"What does the thermometer show us?\" (Expected: \"If something is hot or cold\" / \"A number that tells us the temperature\")\n  - \"Which place was warmer—the sunny window or the shade?\" (Expected: Correct location identification based on exploration)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (Individual or Small Group):**\n\nAdminister one of the following:\n\n**Option A: Visual Exit Ticket (Best for First Grade)**\nShow three pictures and ask students to point or circle:\n1. \"Which picture shows something HOT?\" (sun, fire, hot chocolate) → Student circles correct image.\n2. \"Which tool measures temperature?\" (thermometer, ruler, cup) → Student circles thermometer.\n3. \"Show me with your finger where on the thermometer the number is.\" → Student points to the display.\n\n**Option B: Verbal Exit Ticket (Teacher-Conducted)**\nAsk each student 1–2 questions:\n- \"What is a thermometer?\" (Expected: \"A tool that tells us if something is hot or cold\" or similar)\n- \"Tell me about a warm place we found in our classroom.\" (Expected: Student names a location and explains why, e.g., \"The window was warm because the sun shined there.\")\n\n**Option C: Drawing Exit Ticket**\nStudents draw and label:\n- A warm place (with a thermometer showing a high number)\n- A cool place (with a thermometer showing a low number)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify a thermometer as a tool for measuring temperature.\n- ✓ Student can read or recognize temperature numbers on a thermometer (not necessarily read the exact number, but recognize it displays data).\n- ✓ Student can describe or show comparison between warm and cool locations using language learned in the lesson.\n- ✓ Student can explain one reason why a location is warm or cool (e.g., \"sunshine,\" \"shade,\" \"away from heat\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify what a thermometer is and what it measures.\n- 75% of students can compare two temperatures using the words \"warmer\" or \"cooler.\"\n- 70% of students can explain one reason why a place or object is warm or cool.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pair with a strong reader/observer:** During Explore, pair students who need support with a peer who can help read thermometer numbers and interpret observations. Rotate teacher attention to this pair for guided questioning.\n\n2. **Simplified observation sheet:** Use a sheet with only pictures (sun = warm, snowflake = cool) and one large space for drawing or copying a number. Reduce the number of locations to explore from 4 to 2.\n\n3. **Hands-on sensory reference:** Before using a thermometer, let students feel warm and cool materials (warm washcloth, cool spoon, ice pack in a baggie). Connect thermometer readings to these tactile experiences: \"Remember how the warm washcloth felt? This thermometer number shows us it's warm.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Predict and verify:** Ask students to predict which location will be warmest before measuring, then use the thermometer to check their prediction. Ask: \"Why did you think that place would be warm? Were you right? Why or why not?\"\n\n2. **Compare and order:** Provide four locations to measure and ask students to arrange them from coolest to warmest (ordering activity). Record all numbers and put them in order from smallest to largest.\n\n3. **Investigate heat transfer:** Provide a warm cup of water with a thermometer. Ask: \"What do you think will happen to the temperature if we wait 10 minutes? Will it stay the same, get warmer, or get cooler?\" Check the temperature after 5 and 10 minutes. Discuss: \"Heat moves from warm things to cool air. That's why the water got cooler.\" This introduces heat transfer at an intuitive level.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom thermometer hunt scavenger hunt:** Create a list of locations around the school (hallway, office, gym, outside, cafeteria) with pictures. Send students with an adult and a thermometer to measure and record temperatures in each location. Bring data back and create a class bar graph of warmest to coolest spots. Discuss: \"Why do you think the gym is warmer than the hallway?\" (Real-world problem-solving with data.)\n\n2. **\"Heat Detective\" role-play stations:** Set up four classroom stations with pictures of scenarios (a sunny playground, a freezer, a swimming pool, a campfire). Students go to each station with a thermometer prop and predict the temperature, then use an actual thermometer at a prepared \"representative\" container to check. Record and compare predictions to reality. This reinforces prediction, measurement, and comparison skills.\n\n3. **Create a \"temperature book\":** Over a week, students draw and label different temperatures they encounter (e.g., breakfast cereal with milk, their lunchbox, the playground in sun vs. shade, their classroom at different times). Make a class book where each page shows a picture with a thermometer reading and simple label: \"Warm,\" \"Cold,\" or \"Cool.\" This extends measurement into daily life and builds vocabulary retention.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson focuses on heat/temperature as energy and measurement using tools, aligning with the First Grade emphasis on observing and using tools to investigate the physical world.\n- The infrared thermometer in the photograph serves as an engaging hook, though students use standard thermometers for safety and classroom accessibility. The connection is made: both are tools that measure heat.\n- Emphasize comparison (\"warmer than,\" \"cooler than\") and observation language rather than requiring students to read exact temperatures.\n- If you lack multiple thermometers, demonstrate with one and have students contribute observations from the Explore phase in a large-group setting.",
