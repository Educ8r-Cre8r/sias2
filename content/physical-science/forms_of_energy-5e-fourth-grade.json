Comparing the locomotive to the red car shows how the same energy source (diesel engine) powers vehicles of vastly different sizes and speeds.\n- **Speed and Kinetic Energy:** The visual contrast between the stationary locomotive and the smaller, faster car illustrates the relationship between an object's speed and the energy it possesses. Faster-moving objects have more kinetic energy.\n- **Mechanical Energy Conversion:** Both vehicles convert chemical energy (fuel) into mechanical energy (motion), demonstrating energy transformation from one form to another in real-world machines.\n- **Force and Motion in Different Systems:** The locomotive and car represent different scales of force and motion—the locomotive uses immense force to move slowly, while the car uses less total force but achieves higher speeds, introducing the concept of efficiency and power.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Comparing Energy: The Giant Locomotive and the Speedy Car**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fourth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 50-minute sessions (or 90-100 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 4-PS3-1: Use evidence to construct an explanation relating the speed of an object to the energy of that object.\n  - 4-PS3-2: Make observations to provide evidence that energy can be transferred from place to place by sound, light, heat, and electric currents.\n  - 4-PS3-4: Apply scientific ideas to design, test, and refine a device that converts energy from one form to another.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Observe and compare two vehicles of different sizes and speeds to identify how energy affects motion.\n2. Explain the relationship between speed, mass, and kinetic energy using evidence from the photograph and hands-on investigations.\n3. Describe how fuel (chemical energy) is converted into motion (mechanical energy) in different vehicles.\n4. Design and test a simple device that converts stored energy into motion and compare how quickly objects move based on the energy applied.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the locomotive and red car.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on screen or projector\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Video clip (30 seconds) of a train moving or a sports car accelerating\n\n**Activity:**\n\nDisplay the photograph prominently. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds, then facilitate discussion:\n\n1. **Opening Question:** \"What do you notice about the size and shape of these two vehicles? Which one looks stronger? Which one looks faster?\"\n\n2. **Curiosity-Building Questions:**\n   - \"Both of these vehicles have engines that run on fuel. Why do you think they look so different?\"\n   - \"If they both start at the same time and travel down a track, which one do you think would reach the end first?\"\n   - \"Where does the energy come from that makes these vehicles move?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we could take the engine from the big yellow train and put it in the red car. How would that change things?\"\n\nCreate a \"Wonder Wall\" on chart paper where students write or draw their predictions about which vehicle has more energy and why.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to investigate how the energy in vehicles changes the way they move. Let's explore what makes things speed up and slow down!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the relationship between energy input and speed through hands-on activities.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4-5 toy cars or matchbox cars (different sizes)\n- Meter sticks or measuring tapes\n- Ramps made from textbooks and wooden boards (3-4 different heights)\n- Stopwatches or a smartphone timer app\n- Tape and markers for labeling\n- Observation sheets (provided below)\n- Sandpaper, smooth wood, or linoleum for different track surfaces\n- Tennis balls or plastic balls (same size, different weights—optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Speed Investigation with Ramps (15 minutes)**\n\nOrganize students into small groups of 3-4. Each group receives one toy car and one ramp.\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. Set up your ramp at the lowest height (about 6 inches high). Mark a starting line at the top of the ramp and a finish line on the floor 3 feet away.\n\n2. Release your car from the starting line and watch it roll. Measure how far it travels from the bottom of the ramp to where it stops. Record this distance.\n\n3. Raise the height of your ramp slightly (add another textbook). Release the car from the same starting line. Measure and record the new distance.\n\n4. Repeat step 3, increasing the ramp height two more times. Record each distance.\n\n5. **On your observation sheet, draw the ramp at each height and write down the distance the car traveled each time.**\n\n6. **Answer this question: How did changing the height of the ramp change how far your car traveled?**\n\n**Part B: Surface Texture Investigation (5-10 minutes, if time allows)**\n\nStudents test the same car on different surfaces (sandpaper, smooth wood, etc.) to observe how surface affects speed and stopping distance.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions without providing answers:\n  - \"What changed when you made the ramp higher?\"\n  - \"Where did the car's energy come from in this activity?\"\n  - \"Why do you think the car traveled farther this time?\"\n- Ensure students are measuring carefully and recording data accurately.\n- Encourage peer discussion: \"What did your group notice that's different from the other groups?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students discover that higher ramps provide more energy to the car, causing it to travel faster and farther.\n- Students recognize that the car's speed is related to how much energy it has.\n- Students begin to understand that friction (surface texture) affects how far an object travels.\n- Observation sheets show clear data patterns and simple explanations.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect concepts to the photograph and exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- Photograph of locomotive and car (displayed again)\n- Simple energy conversion diagram (teacher-prepared)\n- Whiteboard and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n\nInvite 2-3 groups to share their findings:\n- \"What did you discover about the ramp height and distance traveled?\"\n- \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n\nRecord observations on chart paper. Highlight patterns: \"We all noticed that higher ramps made the cars go faster and farther!\"\n\n**Direct Instruction (10 minutes):**\n\nIntroduce key vocabulary using the photograph and their exploration results:\n\n**Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n1. **Kinetic Energy:** The energy an object has because it is moving. Fast-moving cars and trains have lots of kinetic energy. The red car in our picture has kinetic energy as it moves. When you rolled your car down the ramp, it had kinetic energy.\n\n2. **Potential Energy:** Stored energy that an object has because of its position or state. When your toy car was at the top of the ramp before you released it, it had potential energy. The higher the ramp, the more potential energy the car had.\n\n3. **Energy Conversion (or Energy Transfer):** When energy changes from one form to another. In the photograph, the diesel locomotive converts chemical energy from fuel into mechanical energy (motion). Your car converted the potential energy from the high ramp into kinetic energy as it rolled down.\n\n4. **Speed:** How fast something is moving. The car in the picture looks like it can move at high speeds. Your car moved at different speeds depending on the ramp height.\n\n5. **Friction:** A force that slows objects down when they rub against a surface. Friction is why your car eventually stopped rolling.\n\n**Connection to Photograph (3-4 minutes):**\n\nDisplay the photograph again. Point out:\n- \"The big yellow locomotive has a powerful diesel engine. That engine burns fuel—chemical energy—and converts it into motion. The locomotive moves more slowly than the red car, but it carries much more weight.\"\n- \"The red car is smaller and lighter. Its engine also burns fuel and converts it to motion, but the car can go faster because it weighs less.\"\n- \"Both vehicles are examples of energy conversion. Fuel energy becomes movement energy.\"\n- \"In our exploration, we created a similar situation: the higher ramp gave the car more potential energy, which became kinetic energy, making it move faster and travel farther.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n\nAsk students to turn and talk with a partner: \"If the locomotive and the red car both had the same speed limit, which one would use more fuel to go that speed? Why?\" Listen to responses to gauge understanding.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can define kinetic energy and potential energy in their own words.\n- Students understand that energy converts from one form to another.\n- Students connect the photograph to their Explore activity.\n- Students recognize that speed is related to energy.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing and testing a device that converts energy into motion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Rubber bands (various sizes and strengths)\n- Paper cups or small boxes\n- Toy cars or blocks\n- Meter sticks\n- Tape\n- Aluminum foil (optional, for \"scoops\" or designs)\n- Observation sheet for predictions and results\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge: Build a Rubber Band Car Launcher**\n\nExplain: \"Engineers design devices that convert stored energy into motion. Your challenge is to use a rubber band to create a launcher that propels a toy car as far as possible.\"\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Plan:** Draw a sketch of your launcher. Show how the rubber band will store energy (potential energy) and release it to move the car (kinetic energy).\n\n2. **Build:** Using a paper cup or small box as the launcher base, attach a rubber band so it can be stretched and released to push a toy car forward.\n\n3. **Test:** Release your launcher and measure how far the car travels. Record the distance.\n\n4. **Refine:** Make one change to your launcher (e.g., use a stronger rubber band, change the angle, adjust the release mechanism) and test again. Compare the distances.\n\n5. **Reflect:** Draw a diagram showing how your launcher converted potential energy (the stretched rubber band) into kinetic energy (the moving car).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate without solving the problem for students. Ask questions:\n  - \"How will you capture and release the rubber band's energy?\"\n  - \"What do you predict will happen if you use a stronger rubber band?\"\n  - \"How can you measure whether your design worked?\"\n- Encourage students to troubleshoot if their launcher doesn't work on the first try.\n- Create a \"gallery walk\" opportunity for students to compare their designs and results.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students design a functional device that demonstrates energy conversion.\n- Students test, observe, and collect data comparing different versions of their design.\n- Students create visual representations (diagrams or drawings) showing potential and kinetic energy.\n- Students articulate how their device relates to the photograph (similar energy conversion) and their earlier Explore activity (similar principle of stored energy becoming motion).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of energy, speed, and energy conversion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n- Observation of student discussions during Engage phase and group share-outs.\n- Monitoring Explore activity data collection and student reasoning.\n- Questioning during Explain phase about connections to the photograph.\n- Observing Elaborate activity for evidence of understanding energy conversion.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide students with a simple sheet with these prompts. Students can draw, write, or use a combination:\n\n1. **\"Look at this picture of a ball at the top of a hill and the same ball rolling down the hill.\"** (Teacher draws or provides simple diagram.)\n   - \"Explain: Does the ball have more energy at the top of the hill or at the bottom? Why?\"\n\n2. **\"The locomotive in our photograph is very heavy but moves slowly. The red car is light but can move very fast. Both are using fuel for energy. Why can the red car move faster?\"**\n\n3. **\"In one sentence, tell me what 'energy conversion' means. Give one example from today's lesson.\"**\n\n4. **\"If you built a rubber band launcher today, did it work? Explain what happened to the rubber band's energy when you released it.\"**\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies that the ball has more kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill (or equivalent reasoning).\n- ✓ Student explains that the lighter car has the same energy source but less mass, allowing it to move faster.\n- ✓ Student provides a correct or near-correct definition of energy conversion with a relevant example.\n- ✓ Student describes the rubber band launcher (or similar device) demonstrating conversion of potential to kinetic energy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students demonstrate understanding that speed and energy are related.\n- Students show evidence of understanding energy conversion through their explanations and diagrams.\n- Students apply concepts from the Explore activity to new scenarios (exit ticket questions).\n- Exit tickets reveal gaps in understanding for follow-up small-group instruction if needed.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Provide sentence frames during Explain and Evaluate phases:** \"The ball has more energy at the _____ because _____.\" or \"Energy conversion means that _____ changes into _____.\"\n\n2. **Simplify the Explore activity by fixing ramp height:** Instead of testing multiple heights, students test one ramp and focus on measuring distance and recording data accurately. Pair with a strong reader.\n\n3. **Use visual aids and demonstrations:** Show the energy conversion with a slow-motion video of a ramp release or provide labeled diagrams showing potential and kinetic energy side-by-side.\n\n4. **Pair students strategically:** Group a struggling student with a peer who can explain observations, and assign the struggling student a specific role (e.g., timer, measurer, recorder) to build confidence.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extend the Explore activity:** Have students test variables systematically (e.g., different car masses, multiple surface types, multiple ramp angles). Ask them to predict outcomes before testing and explain why their predictions were correct or incorrect.\n\n2. **Introduce efficiency calculations:** For students ready for mathematical reasoning, introduce the concept of \"distance per unit height\" to compare which ramp height was most efficient at moving the car.\n\n3. **Design Challenge with Real-World Application:** \"Engineers design car safety features to absorb energy during collisions. Redesign your launcher to include a 'crumple zone' (using clay or foam) that absorbs the car's energy. Does the car travel farther or shorter with your safety design? Why might this be important?\"\n\n4. **Connect to broader concepts:** Ask advanced students to research and present on real-world energy conversions in vehicles (e.g., electric cars converting electrical energy, hybrid cars using two energy sources) or to compare the efficiency of the locomotive versus the sports car.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Build a More Complex Energy System:** Students design a multi-stage energy converter (e.g., a marble rolling down a ramp that then hits a lever, which launches a toy car, which breaks a balloon filled with confetti). They map the energy conversions at each stage: potential → kinetic → potential → kinetic, etc. This extends 4-PS3-4 (designing devices that convert energy).\n\n2. **Speed and Energy Investigation Project:** Students research and collect real-world data comparing the speeds and fuel consumption of different vehicles (cars, trains, bicycles, airplanes). They create a poster or digital presentation explaining why lighter vehicles tend to go faster on the same amount of fuel. This connects 4-PS3-1 (relating speed to energy) and introduces real-world problem-solving.\n\n3. **Create an Energy Conversion Comic Strip:** Students draw a 4-6 panel comic strip showing the journey of energy in the photograph or their exploration (fuel → chemical energy → mechanical energy → motion → friction → heat). Include labels and speech bubbles explaining each step. This reinforces 4-PS3-2 (evidence that energy transfers) and appeals to visual learners.\n\n---",
