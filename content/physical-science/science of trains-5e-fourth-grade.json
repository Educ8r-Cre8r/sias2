The photograph shows a stationary train, but students can infer that trains use energy from fuel to overcome friction and move heavy loads at different speeds.\n- **Force and Friction:** The wheels on railroad tracks, the red and black signals, and the contact between train cars demonstrate how forces act on objects and how friction between wheels and rails allows trains to move safely and stop effectively.\n- **Light and Communication:** The red signal light visible in the photograph demonstrates how light is used to transfer information—the red light communicates a specific message to train operators about whether it is safe to proceed.\n- **Sound and Vibration:** While not visible in the photograph, trains produce sound and vibration. Students can infer from the robust construction of the train that it generates significant sound and vibrational energy during operation.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\nSignals, Speed, and Energy: What Makes Trains Move?\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fourth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** 4-PS3-1, 4-PS3-2, 4-PS4-2\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Explain that trains need energy to move and that faster speeds require more energy.\n2. Describe how light signals (like the red signal in the photograph) transfer information to train operators.\n3. Construct a simple model demonstrating how energy moves an object across a distance.\n4. Predict what will happen to a moving train when forces like friction or braking are applied.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the train at the railroad crossing.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the train photograph (large and clear)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Whiteboard or smartboard\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image of the train at the railroad crossing on a large screen. Allow students to observe silently for 15-20 seconds before asking questions.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about this train? What is it doing, and where might it be going?\"\n   - \"Do you see any lights or signals? What do you think that red light means, and why would it be important?\"\n   - \"If you were going to move this huge train from one place to another, what would you need? Where would the energy come from?\"\n   - \"Have you ever felt a train or a vehicle move really fast? What does that feel like in your body, and what do you think needs to happen to make something that big go that fast?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Write on chart paper: \"I wonder how trains know when to stop and go...\" and \"I wonder how much energy it takes to move a train that heavy...\" Invite students to share their own wonders about the train.\n\n4. **Prior Knowledge Activation:** Ask students, \"What do you already know about how things move? What makes something speed up or slow down?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate how trains move, what makes them stop, and how signals like the red light help keep everyone safe. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate energy, motion, and signals through hands-on activities.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small toy trains or cars (1 per pair of students)\n- Masking tape and markers\n- Rulers or measuring tapes\n- Index cards (for signals)\n- Flashlights or desk lamps (2-3 for class use)\n- Ramps or textured surfaces (books, cardboard, sandpaper, aluminum foil)\n- Rolling balls or toy cars for testing\n- Data recording sheets (pre-made)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Speed and Energy Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Setup:** Divide students into pairs. Provide each pair with a toy train/car, a ramp made from stacked books, and a ruler.\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Place your toy train at the top of the ramp. Let it roll down without pushing it. Measure how far it travels after it leaves the ramp on the floor. Record this distance.\"\n   - \"Now, make the ramp higher (add more books). Release the train from the new height. Does it travel farther or closer? Measure and record.\"\n   - \"What do you notice? When the train started from higher up, did it have more or less energy? How do you know?\"\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:** \"In the real photograph, the train uses fuel to create energy that makes it move. The higher the ramp, the more potential energy the toy train had—similar to how more fuel gives the real train more energy to go faster and farther.\"\n\n4. **Documentation:** Students sketch their ramp on a data sheet and record distances. They write or draw: \"When the ramp was higher, the train went _____ because _____.\"\n\n**Part 2: Light Signals Investigation (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Setup:** Dim the classroom lights. Show students the red signal light from the photograph again. Explain that signals use light to send messages.\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"You are going to create a signal system. Use an index card to write 'STOP' in red marker and 'GO' in green marker.\"\n   - \"One partner will hold the card. The other partner stands across the room. Your partner shows the STOP signal—what should you do? What about the GO signal?\"\n   - \"Now, use a flashlight. Flash it on and off. Does this light message work the same way as the colored card?\"\n\n3. **Documentation:** Students record: \"Light signals work because ___. The red light in the train picture probably means _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate to each pair, asking guiding questions: \"What happened when you made the ramp taller? Did you predict this?\" and \"How did you know what the light signal meant?\"\n- Do NOT give answers; instead, ask students to describe what they observed.\n- Prompt reflection: \"What does this tell us about how energy works?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that higher ramps = greater distances traveled (more potential energy → more kinetic energy).\n- Students recognize that light is used to communicate information across distances.\n- Students record data and observations with sketches and words.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts, connecting to the Explore activities and photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words pre-written\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 pairs to share their findings from the ramp investigation: \"What happened? Why do you think the train went farther?\"\n   - Ask: \"Who tested the light signals? What did you discover about how light carries a message?\"\n   - Celebrate observations: \"You were acting like scientists—testing ideas and recording what you found!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n\n   Present each term with a student-friendly definition, using visuals and the photograph:\n\n   - **Energy:** The ability or power to make something move or change. \"When the toy train rolled down the ramp, it had energy that made it move. Real trains use energy from fuel to move.\"\n   - **Speed:** How fast something is moving. \"The higher the ramp, the more speed your train had when it left the ramp. A fast-moving train has a lot of energy.\"\n   - **Force:** A push or pull that can change how something moves or stops it. \"Brakes on a train use force to slow it down and stop it—like friction between the wheels and the rails.\"\n   - **Light Signal:** A message sent using light, often in the form of colors or flashes. \"The red light in the photograph is a signal telling train operators to STOP. Light travels in straight lines and bounces off objects so we can see them.\"\n   - **Friction:** A force that slows things down when they rub against each other. \"Without friction between the train wheels and the rails, the train couldn't grip the track or stop safely.\"\n\n3. **Connections Back to Photograph (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the train: \"This is a real train. It weighs thousands of pounds. What kind of energy does it need to move something that heavy?\"\n   - Point to the red signal: \"This signal uses light to send information. What message do you think that red light is sending? Why is that important?\"\n   - Point to the tracks: \"The friction between the wheels and the rails helps the train move and stop. Without it, the train would slide!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I asked you to explain why the toy train went farther down a higher ramp, what would you say?\" (Listen for: \"It had more energy\" or \"Gravity pulled it faster.\")\n   - Ask: \"How is the light signal like our flashlight activity?\" (Listen for: \"It sends a message\" or \"We can see the light from far away.\")\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Energy** | The power to make something move or change; what makes things work |\n| **Speed** | How fast something is moving from one place to another |\n| **Force** | A push or pull that changes how something moves, stops, or changes direction |\n| **Light Signal** | A message sent using light (like colored lights or flashes) that we can see from far away |\n| **Friction** | A force that slows things down when two things rub against each other |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define energy, speed, and force in their own words.\n- Students understand that light signals carry information.\n- Students can explain why the toy train traveled farther on a taller ramp using the word \"energy.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing their own signal system and predicting energy changes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards, markers, colored pencils\n- Flashlights or construction paper (for making colored light filters)\n- Toy trains/cars\n- Ramps, textured surfaces (sandpaper, foil, tape)\n- Rulers\n- Design worksheet (pre-made)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Design a Signal System (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Challenge:** \"Imagine you are a train operator. You need to design a signal system using light to tell other trains whether it's safe to go, slow down, or stop. What colors will you use? How will the lights help keep trains safe?\"\n\n2. **Design Steps:**\n   - Students work in pairs to sketch or construct a signal using colored index cards, flashlights with colored filters, or drawings.\n   - Each student labels what each light/color means and explains why that signal is important for train safety.\n   - Optional: Students can use a flashlight and create a \"message code\" (e.g., 1 flash = GO, 2 flashes = SLOW, 3 flashes = STOP).\n\n3. **Application to Real World:** \"Real trains use these kinds of signals every day. Engineers read these signals to know when to speed up, slow down, or stop. This keeps everyone on the train and around the tracks safe.\"\n\n**Part 2: Predict and Test Energy Changes (5-7 minutes)**\n\n1. **Challenge:** \"On a real train, when the brakes are applied, what happens? The train slows down. Let's predict: if we add friction to our ramp (like sandpaper or tape), will the toy train go farther or stop sooner?\"\n\n2. **Prediction:** Students write or draw their prediction: \"If I add friction, the train will _____ because _____.\"\n\n3. **Quick Test:** Add a textured surface (sandpaper or tape) to the track. Release the toy train from the same height as before. Measure the distance. \"What changed? Why?\"\n\n4. **Connection:** \"Just like your toy train, real train brakes create friction to stop the train. More friction = less distance traveled because the force slows down the train's energy.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide design templates if students need structure.\n- Ask: \"Why did you choose those colors for your signals?\" and \"What happens to the train's speed when friction increases?\"\n- Encourage students to explain their thinking aloud.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design a functional signal system and explain how light transfers information.\n- Students predict how friction affects motion and test their prediction.\n- Students use vocabulary (energy, speed, force, friction, signal) correctly in explanations.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of energy, motion, signals, and the connection to the train photograph.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** During Explore and Elaborate, note whether students:\n  - Measure and record data accurately\n  - Use vocabulary correctly (energy, speed, force)\n  - Make reasonable predictions about cause and effect\n  - Explain their thinking using evidence from their investigations\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket to complete individually. Offer the choice to respond with words, drawings, or both:\n\n1. **Question 1 (Energy & Speed):** \"In the photograph, the train is very heavy and large. Based on what you learned today, why does a heavy train like this need a lot of energy to move fast? What happens to the energy if the train goes faster?\"\n\n2. **Question 2 (Light Signals):** \"Look at the red light in the photograph. What message is that light sending? How is this signal like the flashlight activity we did today?\"\n\n3. **Question 3 (Friction & Braking):** \"If a train is moving very fast and needs to stop, what force would help it slow down? What did you learn about this today?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student correctly explains that:\n- Faster speeds require more energy (4-PS3-1)\n- Light signals transfer information from place to place (4-PS4-2)\n- Friction is a force that slows moving objects (4-PS3-1)\n- Uses 2-3 vocabulary terms correctly\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student demonstrates partial understanding, explaining 2 of the 3 concepts with some vocabulary\n\n✓ **Emerging:** Student shows initial understanding but needs more practice with vocabulary and concepts\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should demonstrate:\n- Ability to explain why a ramp height affected the toy train's distance (energy concept)\n- Understanding that light signals communicate information\n- Recognition that friction slows moving objects\n- Use of academic vocabulary in context\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Data Sheet:** Provide a pre-labeled data sheet with sentence frames:\n   - \"When the ramp was tall, the train went _____.\"\n   - \"The red light means _____ because _____.\"\n   - This reduces the cognitive load of recording while still engaging students in the investigation.\n\n2. **Pair with a Stronger Partner:** During Explore, assign emerging learners to work with more proficient peers who can model data collection and provide verbal explanations. The teacher circulates to ask guiding questions to both students.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Word Bank:** Provide students with a visual word bank (with pictures) showing energy, speed, force, friction, and signal. Students can point to or write words from the bank during exit tickets rather than generating vocabulary independently.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Complex Predictions:** Ask advanced students: \"What if the toy train started from an even higher ramp and rolled over both smooth and rough surfaces? Predict the distance traveled on each surface. Why might they be different?\" Students design and conduct this multi-variable investigation, recording and graphing results.\n\n2. **Real-World Application:** Provide news articles or videos about train accidents caused by brake failure or poor visibility. Ask: \"How could better understanding of friction and light signals have prevented this? Design a solution.\" Students create a proposal with drawings and explanations.\n\n3. **Energy Transfer Deep Dive:** Ask: \"We learned that fuel gives trains energy. Can you trace where that energy comes from? Where does the train's fuel come from? Where did that energy originate?\" Students research and create a diagram showing energy transfer from the sun through fossil fuels to train motion (connecting to 4-PS3-1 and 4-PS3-2).\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Signal Code Design Challenge:** Students create their own multi-light signal system (like a traffic light) and teach a classmate or family member the code. They test the effectiveness by seeing if others can follow the signals correctly from across a room or down a hallway. (Connection to 4-PS4-3: transfer of information through patterns)\n\n2. **Build a Marble Run with Energy Levels:** Using cardboard tubes, tape, and ramps, students construct a marble run at different heights and test which configuration allows the marble to travel the farthest or fastest. They record predictions and results, deepening understanding of potential and kinetic energy. (Connection to 4-PS3-1)\n\n3. **Research and Present: How Trains Stop Safely:** Provide students with picture books or age-appropriate videos about train braking systems, modern rail signaling, and safety features. Students create a poster or short presentation explaining \"How Friction and Light Signals Keep Trains Safe,\" combining illustrations, vocabulary, and explanations. (Synthesis of 4-PS3-1, 4-PS3-2, and 4-PS4-2)\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
