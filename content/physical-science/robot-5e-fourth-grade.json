Observe and describe how energy from batteries powers both movement and light in devices.\n2. Identify how light reflects off different colored and textured surfaces to make objects visible.\n3. Investigate how friction and surface type affect how easily objects roll and move.\n4. Design and test a simple rolling device that uses at least two forms of energy transfer.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (printed color copy, 8x10\" or larger, OR projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Real toy robot or rolling toy (optional, to pass around)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display & Hook:** Show the photograph on the board or projected. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Guided Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about this robot? What colors do you see, and why do you think those colors were chosen?\"\n   - \"How do you think this robot moves? What would need to power it?\"\n   - \"Look at that glowing eye—what's making it glow? Where would that energy come from?\"\n   - \"This robot is sitting on concrete, grass, and dirt. Do you think it would move the same way on all these surfaces? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \n   - \"I wonder... if we could build a simple rolling robot in our classroom, what would we need to make it move AND light up?\"\n   - Record student wonderings on chart paper for reference during Explore.\n\n4. **Think-Pair-Share:** Students turn to a partner and share one idea about what makes the robot's eye light up. Ask 3-4 volunteers to share with the class.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become engineers. We'll investigate how energy makes things move and shine, just like this robot. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 battery-powered toy car or rolling robot (or DIY alternative: cardboard tube + painted cup + paper clip wheels)\n- 1 flashlight or LED light toy\n- 4-5 objects to test rolling: toy car, marble, wooden block, foam ball, plastic bottle\n- Meter stick or measuring tape\n- Different surface samples: carpet, tile, cardboard, sandpaper\n- Clipboard and pencil\n- Safety goggles\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Rolling Robot Challenge (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set Up:** Each group receives a rolling toy and different surface types. Set up a simple 3-meter test track using tape on the floor with sections of different surfaces.\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Push your rolling toy from the START line with the same amount of force each time.\"\n   - \"Measure how far it travels on each surface using the meter stick.\"\n   - \"Record your results on the chart: Which surface made it go farthest? Which surface stopped it fastest?\"\n   - \"What do you notice? Why do you think some surfaces affected the motion differently?\"\n\n3. **Recording:** Students complete a simple data table:\n   - Surface Type | Distance Traveled | Observations\n   - Create a bar graph to show results (or sort index cards by distance if graphing is not yet mastered).\n\n4. **Teacher Facilitation:** Circulate and ask:\n   - \"What's making the toy stop? Is it the toy or the surface?\"\n   - \"Try pushing it harder/softer. Does that change how far it goes?\"\n   - DON'T explain friction yet—let students discover the pattern.\n\n**Part B: Light Exploration (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set Up:** Provide a flashlight and various colored objects (blue paper, white paper, red paper, black paper, shiny aluminum foil, matte black cloth).\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Shine the flashlight on each colored object in a dark corner of the room.\"\n   - \"Which colors reflect the most light back to your eyes? Which are hardest to see?\"\n   - \"Draw or write: Why do you think the robot's eye is bright blue and glowing?\"\n\n3. **Recording:** Sketch observations showing which colors \"shine\" brightest.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that smooth surfaces allow objects to roll farther than rough surfaces.\n- Students observe that bright colors (especially blue and white) reflect more light than dark colors.\n- Students begin to connect the robot's blue color to visibility and the glowing element to energy transfer.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph (revisited)\n- Simple diagram showing battery → light + motion (can be drawn on board)\n- Friction demonstration item (toy car on carpet vs. tile)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to report their rolling results: \"Which surface let your toy travel farthest?\"\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their light observations: \"Which colored object was easiest to see?\"\n   - Create a class chart: \"What Affects How Things Move?\" and \"What Affects How We See Things?\"\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Mini-Lesson (10 minutes):**\n   - Hold up the photograph. Point to the robot's eye and body.\n   - Explain using simple language: **\"Inside this robot, there's a battery. The battery gives energy. That energy does TWO jobs: it makes the wheels spin to move the robot, and it makes the eye light up. The battery changes electrical energy into two different types—motion energy and light energy.\"**\n   - Use the friction demo: Roll a toy car on carpet, then tile. \"The smooth tile has less FRICTION. Friction is like the surface is trying to slow the toy down. Rough carpet has MORE friction because it 'grabs' the wheels.\"\n   - Revisit the light observations: \"The robot is BLUE and GLOWING. The glowing eye is bright because the light comes directly from inside. But the blue color? Blue reflects light really well, so when light from outside hits it, the light bounces back to our eyes. That's why we can see it clearly!\"\n\n3. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Show a picture of a red ball and a black ball in sunlight. \"Which one reflects more light to your eyes? Why?\"\n   - \"What would happen if we put a rough sandpaper surface under your rolling toy? Would it go faster or slower? Why?\"\n   - Have students turn and talk, then share out answers.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Energy** | The ability to make things move or change. It can come from batteries, the sun, or motion. |\n| **Friction** | A force that slows things down when they rub against surfaces. Rough surfaces create more friction than smooth ones. |\n| **Reflect/Reflection** | When light bounces off a surface and goes back toward our eyes, letting us see objects. |\n| **Electrical Energy** | Energy that comes from batteries or electricity and can power lights and motors. |\n| **Motion** | Movement from one place to another. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain that batteries provide energy for motion and light.\n- Students understand that friction affects how far objects roll.\n- Students recognize that light reflection helps us see colored objects.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding of energy transfer and material properties.\n\n**Materials (per group):**\n- Cardboard tube or paper cup\n- Aluminum foil, colored paper (blue, white, black, red)\n- Flashlight\n- 1 battery-powered LED light or glow stick\n- Tape\n- Simple rolling mechanism (wheels from a broken toy, or rolling it like a marble inside)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Design Challenge: \"Build a Better Robot Eye\"**\n\n1. **Scenario:** \"The robot's eye is great, but we need to make it even MORE visible in a dark room. Can you design a better version using what you learned about light and reflection?\"\n\n2. **Student Task:**\n   - \"Wrap your LED light or glow stick with different colored materials (foil, colored paper, white paper).\"\n   - \"Test which covering makes it brightest.\"\n   - \"Predict: Will smooth or crinkly aluminum foil reflect more light?\"\n   - \"Redesign your 'robot eye' using the material that works best.\"\n\n3. **Real-World Connection:** \"Why do firefighters and construction workers wear bright yellow or orange vests with reflective strips? Because those colors and materials reflect light really well, so people can see them even at night!\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Facilitate testing in a darkened area of the classroom.\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think that material works better? What does it do to the light?\"\n   - Encourage students to make predictions BEFORE testing.\n   - Push thinking: \"If you wanted to make it visible from really far away, what would you change?\"\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students apply understanding that light colors and reflective materials make objects more visible.\n   - Students recognize that smooth, shiny surfaces (like foil) reflect light better than dull surfaces.\n   - Students make predictions based on evidence and test them systematically.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of energy transfer, friction, and light reflection.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation checklist during Explore phase:\n  - ☐ Student records data from rolling tests accurately\n  - ☐ Student makes observations about light reflection\n  - ☐ Student participates in discussions with scientific reasoning\n- Exit ticket (see below)\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative, 5-10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket asking (use pictures and words):\n\n1. **Energy Question:** \"Draw or describe: What TWO things does the battery in a robot do?\" \n   - (Expected answer: Makes it move AND makes the light shine)\n\n2. **Friction Question:** \"Which surface would make a rolling toy go FARTHEST: sandpaper, carpet, or smooth tile? Explain why in one sentence.\"\n   - (Expected answer: Smooth tile, because it has less friction/doesn't slow it down as much)\n\n3. **Light Question:** \"Why can we see the robot's blue eye easily, even from far away?\"\n   - (Expected answer: Blue reflects light / the light bounces off the blue color into our eyes, or the light is bright inside)\n\n4. **Challenge Question (for all):** \"If you built a toy robot, would you paint it black or white? Why?\"\n   - (Expected answer: White, because white reflects more light and is easier to see)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Student correctly identifies that energy does two jobs (motion + light)  \n✓ Student shows understanding that friction affects how far objects roll  \n✓ Student explains that light reflects off objects to make them visible  \n✓ Student applies this knowledge to design or predict scenarios  \n\n**How to Determine Success:**\n- Review exit tickets for conceptual understanding.\n- If 75%+ of students show understanding of at least 2 of 3 main concepts, move forward.\n- If students struggle with friction or reflection, use one of the extension activities for targeted review.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Cards:** Provide picture + word cards (Energy, Friction, Light Reflection) that students can reference during discussions and activities. Pre-teach vocabulary in small groups before whole-class lessons.\n\n2. **Guided Data Recording:** Pre-make tables with surface names and pictures already filled in; students only fill in the distance traveled. Provide a word bank for descriptive sentences (\"smooth,\" \"bumpy,\" \"fast,\" \"slow\").\n\n3. **Partner Pairing:** Pair with a more independent student during Explore activities. Assign specific roles: one measures, one records; then switch.\n\n4. **Reduced Complexity in Elaborate:** Instead of designing a new robot eye, students choose from 2-3 pre-made options (foil, white paper, blue paper) and test which is brightest—more guided, less open-ended.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extended Friction Investigation:** Ask students to test rolling on liquids (water in a shallow pan) or predict how different wheel types would change friction. Have them create a friction ranking chart from least to most friction.\n\n2. **Energy Conversion Deep Dive:** Introduce the concept that motors in robots convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. Have students design a two-surface track (smooth and rough) and calculate the ratio of distances traveled (e.g., 8 meters on tile ÷ 2 meters on carpet = 4:1 ratio).\n\n3. **Light Science Extension:** Have advanced students explore how ANGLE of light affects reflection (angled vs. perpendicular light hitting colored paper). They could create a diagram showing angles of incidence and reflection.\n\n4. **Real-World Application:** Ask them to research WHY different vehicles use different colors (emergency vehicles = red/white, construction = yellow/orange) and write a 1-paragraph explanation connecting to light reflection and safety.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Design Your Own Robot\" Project (homework or indoor recess activity):**\n   - Provide students with craft supplies (paper cups, paper towel tubes, paint, markers, wheels cut from foam or construction paper).\n   - Challenge: Build a rolling robot that includes both a light source (battery-powered LED) and is painted a color that reflects light well.\n   - Display robots and discuss which designs are most visible and why.\n   - **Connects to:** 4-PS3-4 (designing a device that transfers energy)\n\n2. **Friction Science Station (follow-up lesson or centers):**\n   - Set up a station with various rolling objects and surfaces.\n   - Students roll each object down a ramp on different surfaces and measure the distance traveled.\n   - Create a \"Friction Museum\" display showing which combinations travel farthest/shortest.\n   - Challenge question: \"Can you design a surface that creates MORE friction than sandpaper?\"\n   - **Connects to:** 4-PS3-1 (relating speed to energy)\n\n3. **\"Mirror, Mirror\" Light Reflection Exploration (science center activity):**\n   - Provide mirrors, flashlights, and various colored objects.\n   - Students predict and test: \"If I shine a light on a blue object in front of a mirror, is it brighter than without a mirror? Why?\"\n   - Create a \"Shine Bright Challenge\": arrange mirrors and colored paper to make a dark object as visible as possible.\n   - **Connects to:** 4-PS4-2 (light reflection allows objects to be seen)\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wear safety goggles during the rolling car tests (to protect eyes if objects roll toward them). LED lights and flashlights should be used properly (no shining directly in eyes).\n- **Timing Flexibility:** If your students need more hands-on time, split into 3 sessions: Day 1 (Engage + Explore), Day 2 (Explain + Elaborate), Day 3 (Evaluate + Extensions).\n- **Photography Opportunity:** Document student investigations with a camera or tablet. Use photos in the Explain phase to show examples of their discoveries (\"Look what Group 3 found about friction!\").\n- **Real Robot (Optional):** If you can access a programmable robot (like Bee-Bot or a simple robot kit), students can observe how programming tells it to move and light up—making energy transfer concrete and observable.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson grounds abstract concepts in observable, hands-on investigation using the robot photograph as a springboard for deeper understanding of energy, motion, and light—core Fourth Grade physical science ideas.",
