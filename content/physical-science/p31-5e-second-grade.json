Identify and describe what causes the flag to move (wind as a force).\n2. Observe and compare how different materials respond to wind or air movement.\n3. Explain how the properties of the flag's material make it good for its job.\n4. Predict and test how changes to materials will affect their movement in wind.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph (p31.jpg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a printed large poster where all students can see clearly.\n\n2. **Direct student attention** to the flag: \"Look at this beautiful flag. It's moving! What do you notice about it?\"\n\n3. **Ask 3-4 specific discussion questions** (pause for think-pair-share before collecting answers):\n   - *\"What is making the flag move? What do you think is pushing it?\"*\n   - *\"Why does the flag wave and flutter instead of staying straight?\"*\n   - *\"If you touch a flag on a windy day, what would happen to your hand?\"*\n   - *\"What do you think would happen if we used a flag made of paper instead of cloth?\"*\n\n4. **Capture predictions** on chart paper. Write student ideas without judgment. Underline words like \"wind,\" \"push,\" \"blow,\" and \"move.\"\n\n5. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we made our own flags out of different materials and tested them with wind. Should we try?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore what happens when we use different materials and make them move like the flag in the picture!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Strips of material (5-6 inches × 12 inches): tissue paper, construction paper, plastic grocery bag material, cloth/cotton fabric, aluminum foil, newspaper\n- Craft sticks or unsharpened pencils (one per student)\n- Tape (masking or painter's tape)\n- Electric fan (set on low speed) *or* access to a hallway/outdoor space where students can run to create wind\n- Observation recording sheet (see Teacher Role section for format)\n- Optional: smartphone to take photos of materials before and after testing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"You are going to test different materials to see what happens when wind pushes them. First, pick one material. Hold it gently in your hand and look at it carefully. What do you notice? Is it stretchy? Is it stiff? Is it thick or thin?\"\n\n2. \"Tape your material to the top of your stick with just a little tape. Make sure the material can move freely.\"\n\n3. \"Now hold your stick in front of the fan (or your teacher will turn on the fan). Watch what happens! Does your material flutter? Does it blow straight back? Does it move a little or a lot?\"\n\n4. \"Draw and write what you see on your recording sheet. Use words or pictures to show: Did it move a lot, a little, or not at all? Did it flutter like the flag, or stay stiff?\"\n\n5. \"Trade materials with a friend and test another one. Try at least 3 different materials.\"\n\n**Connections to the Photograph:**\n- \"The flag in the picture is made of cloth, and it's moving because wind is pushing it. Your materials will help us figure out which ones move best when wind pushes them—just like the flag!\"\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Simple drawings or checkmarks showing how each material moved (✓✓✓ = lots of movement; ✓✓ = some movement; ✓ = little movement)\n- A few words describing what they saw (e.g., \"tissue paper flutters,\" \"foil stays stiff\")\n- Which material moved the most like the flag\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask follow-up questions without giving answers: *\"What do you notice about that material? Is it thick or thin? Does it remind you of the flag?\"*\n- Use a fan at a consistent speed to keep testing conditions fair.\n- Help students tape securely so material doesn't fall off.\n- Ask: *\"Why do you think that material moved more than this one?\"* to encourage thinking about properties.\n- Scaffold by suggesting students compare one stiff material to one flexible material.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that **thin, lightweight, flexible materials move more easily** in wind.\n- Students will observe that stiff materials (foil, construction paper) move differently than stretchy materials (plastic, tissue).\n- Students will make the connection: *\"The flag moves because it's made of cloth, and cloth can flutter.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The printed photograph (p31.jpg)\n- Picture cards or drawings of the materials tested\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 students to share: *\"Which material moved the most? Which stayed still? Why do you think that happened?\"*\n   - Record responses on chart paper, grouping similar materials: \"Materials That Moved A Lot\" vs. \"Materials That Didn't Move Much\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Refer back to the photograph and student observations as you teach each term.\n   - Use repetition and student-friendly language.\n\n3. **Make Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the flag in the photograph: *\"The flag is made of cloth. Cloth is flexible—it can bend and move. When the wind pushes it, it flutters just like your tissue paper did. That's why cloth makes a good flag!\"*\n   - Show picture cards or student sketches of materials: *\"The foil didn't move much because it's stiff and heavy. The tissue paper moved a lot because it's thin and flexible.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If I wanted to make a flag that would wave and flutter beautifully in the wind, what material should I use? Why?\"*\n   - Listen for students to mention: flexible, light, thin, stretchy, cloth.\n   - If students struggle, point back to the photo: *\"Look at this flag. What's it made of? Yes, cloth! And what did our cloth do when the wind pushed it?\"*\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Force** | A push or pull that makes something move or stop. Wind is a force that pushes the flag. |\n| **Material** | What something is made of. The flag is made of cloth; the pole is made of metal. |\n| **Flexible** | Something that can bend and move without breaking. Cloth is flexible. |\n| **Stiff** | Something that doesn't bend easily. Metal and foil are stiff. |\n| **Property** | A special quality of something. Cloth is flexible and light—those are properties. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the word \"force\" or \"push\" to explain why the flag moves.\n- Students will identify that the flag's material (cloth) is flexible and light, which helps it move in the wind.\n- Students will understand that different materials have different properties that affect how they move.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-cut material samples (cloth, plastic, tissue paper)\n- Craft sticks, tape\n- Electric fan or access to outdoor space\n- *Optional:* aluminum foil, string, construction materials\n- Challenge task cards (printed or written on chart paper)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Apply to New Context — \"Design a Better Flag\" Challenge:**\n\n1. **Present the scenario:** *\"Imagine you work for a company that makes flags. A customer asks: 'What material would make the BEST flag for a very windy day?' You need to use what you learned to answer.\"*\n\n2. **Offer a choice of challenge tasks:**\n   - **Tier 1 (Support):** *\"Test two materials you didn't try before. Decide which one would make a better flag and why. Tell a partner.\"*\n   - **Tier 2 (On Level):** *\"Design a flag using two different materials taped together. Test it. Why did you choose those materials? Does your flag work better than a single material?\"*\n   - **Tier 3 (Challenge):** *\"Some flags need to move gently and some need to move a lot. Design two different flags—one for a gentle breeze and one for a strong wind. What materials did you use? Why?\"*\n\n3. **Students build and test** their new designs using the fan.\n\n4. **Students record or sketch** their design and explain their choice.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Allow students to choose their challenge level, or assign based on prior performance.\n- Ask probing questions: *\"Why did you pick that material? What property does it have? How is that helpful?\"*\n- Encourage students to predict first: *\"What do you think will happen? Why?\"*\n- Facilitate peer teaching: *\"Show your friend your flag. Can they guess what it's made of and why?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will articulate that **material properties determine how an object responds to forces.**\n- Students will demonstrate understanding by intentionally selecting materials based on their properties.\n- Students will use vocabulary: flexible, light, material, property, force.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore and Elaborate:\n  - ☐ Student predicts which materials will move\n  - ☐ Student accurately observes and records how materials respond to wind\n  - ☐ Student uses vocabulary: force, material, flexible, property\n  - ☐ Student explains connections between material properties and movement\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes, end of second session):**\n\nProvide each student with a slip of paper with two or three of these prompts (keep it short for second grade):\n\n1. **Picture Prompt:** Show a simple drawing of a flag in the wind. Ask: *\"Why is the flag moving? Draw or write your answer.\"*\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student mentions wind, push, or force.\n\n2. **Material Choice:** *\"I want to make a flag that flutters beautifully. Should I use cloth or foil? Why?\"*\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student chooses cloth and gives a reason related to flexibility or lightness (e.g., \"Cloth bends,\" \"Foil is too stiff\").\n\n3. **Open Explanation:** *\"Tell me one thing you learned about how wind makes things move.\"*\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student connects material properties to movement (e.g., \"Light things move more,\" \"Cloth can flutter\").\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Evidence to Look For |\n|-------------------|----------------------|\n| 1. Identify wind as a force | Student says \"wind pushes\" or \"wind makes it move\" on exit ticket or during discussion |\n| 2. Observe how materials respond | Student recorded observations during Explore and tested at least 2 materials |\n| 3. Explain why flag material is good | Student correctly identifies that cloth is flexible or light in exit ticket or explanation |\n| 4. Predict and test | Student made a prediction during Elaborate and tested a new design |\n\n**Scoring Guide for Exit Ticket:**\n- **3 (Proficient):** Student correctly identifies wind/force as cause of motion AND explains that flexible/light materials move more.\n- **2 (Developing):** Student identifies wind OR explains that some materials move more, but not both clearly.\n- **1 (Beginning):** Student shows limited understanding; may mention wind but doesn't connect to material properties.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary** during a small-group lesson before the main Explore activity. Use only 2-3 key terms (force, material, flexible). Pair with visual aids (photos of stretchy vs. stiff items).\n\n2. **Simplify the investigation** by providing only 3 material options and pre-taping them to sticks so students focus on observation, not assembly. Use a clear chart: \"Moved a Lot / Moved a Little / Didn't Move.\"\n\n3. **Use a comparison sentence frame** for recording: \"The _______ moved more than the _______ because it is _______.\" Provide word banks: light, thin, stretchy, bendy.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Quantify movement:** Challenge students to count how many times their flag flutters in 10 seconds for each material, or measure how far back the material bends. Graph and compare results.\n\n2. **Predict and test multiple variables:** Ask: *\"What if we made the flag bigger? What if we used two pieces of cloth stuck together? What if we change the fan speed?\" Encourage predictions and systematic testing.*\n\n3. **Real-world application:** Have advanced students research flags from different countries or climates (U.S. flag, Olympic flag, etc.). What materials are they made from? Why might those materials be chosen? Could they design a flag for a specific environment (desert, underwater, rainforest)?\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Windmaker\" Design Challenge:** Students design and build a simple wind-maker from paper/straws to test their flags indoors. They must predict how much wind is needed to make different materials move. Connect to future lessons on energy and motion.\n\n2. **Real Flag Hunt:** Take students on a walk around the school (playground, entrance, classroom doors) to find all the flags, banners, or flowing objects. Observe: What are they made of? What do you see them moving in the wind? Have students photograph or sketch them and compare materials.\n\n3. **Storytelling Extension:** Read a picture book about wind (e.g., *Come On, Rain!* by Karen Hesse or *Wind* by Marion Dane Bauer). Discuss how the story shows wind as a force. Have students draw or write about a time they felt wind push them and what moved as a result.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher\n\n- **Safety:** If using an electric fan, ensure it has a protective cage and is placed securely. Remind students not to touch the fan blades. Supervise fan use at all times.\n- **Inclusive Design:** The photograph of a city flag is culturally neutral and geographically specific, making it relevant to urban and suburban settings. If your school or community has significant geographical differences, consider discussing flags in various contexts (rural areas, different climates).\n- **Optional Video Hook:** If projecting the photograph isn't impactful enough, consider a 30-second silent video clip of a flag in strong wind before showing the still image. This amplifies the \"force in action.\"\n- **Material Sustainability:** Save material scraps from other classroom activities (fabric remnants, scrap paper) to use for testing. This reduces waste and costs.",
