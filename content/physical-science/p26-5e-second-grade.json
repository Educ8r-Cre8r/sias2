  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Floating Cargo Ships\n\n## Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Buoyancy and floating:** Large metal ships float on water despite being very heavy, demonstrating that the shape and design of objects affect whether they sink or float.\n- **Properties of materials:** The ship's metal hull is designed to be waterproof and resistant to water, showing how material properties determine suitability for a purpose.\n- **Force and load:** The ship's structure supports massive cargo weight and distributes it across the water, showing how materials can be designed to hold heavy loads.\n- **Displacement:** The ship pushes water aside to stay afloat, an observable physical principle appropriate for Second Grade understanding of how objects interact with water.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**Why Don't Heavy Ships Sink? Building Floating Boats**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or one 90-minute block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-PS1-2: Analyze data obtained from testing different materials to determine which materials have the properties that are best suited for an intended purpose.\n  - 2-PS1-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to describe and classify different kinds of materials by their observable properties.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Investigate and test different materials to determine which ones float and which ones sink.\n2. Explain that the shape and type of material used affects whether an object floats or sinks.\n3. Design and build a boat using materials that allows it to float while holding cargo (weight).\n4. Use observations to identify material properties that make things good or poor choices for building ships.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about how a heavy metal ship can float on water.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large photograph of the cargo ship (printed or projected)\n- Basin or tub of water (visible to students)\n- One metal spoon\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Ask students to observe quietly for 15 seconds.\n\n2. **Pose the \"Wonder Question\":** \"This is a real ship made mostly of heavy metal. It carries thousands of boxes of cargo across the ocean. How do you think it stays on top of the water instead of sinking to the bottom?\"\n\n3. **Ask these discussion questions one at a time, allowing 30 seconds for pair-share before whole-group responses:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is the ship made of?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a heavy object sink in water? What happened?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this giant metal ship doesn't sink?\"\n   - \"What would happen if we put a metal spoon in water?\" (Demonstrate dropping the spoon into your water basin and show that it sinks.)\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"If a tiny metal spoon sinks, how could a ship made of metal possibly float? Talk to your partner: What ideas do you have?\" Record student ideas on chart paper without judgment.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become ship designers and test different materials to figure out the secret of floating boats!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate which materials sink and float, and how shape affects floating.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 large tub or container filled with water\n- Aluminum foil (cut into 4-inch squares)\n- Plastic foam or foam peanuts\n- Wood blocks (small, 1-2 inches)\n- Modeling clay (small lump, walnut-sized)\n- Metal washers or pennies (8-10 per group)\n- Plastic containers with lids (small, like butter containers)\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Recording sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity: \"Sink or Float Testing Station\"**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Start by testing one material at a time. Before you put it in the water, predict: Do you think it will sink or float? Put a check mark in the 'Prediction' column on your sheet.\"\n\n2. \"Gently place the material in the water. Watch what happens. Does it sink to the bottom or float on top?\"\n\n3. \"Mark 'S' for sink or 'F' for float in the 'Result' column.\"\n\n4. \"Remove the material, dry it with a paper towel, and test the next material.\"\n\n5. **Second round — Shape matters:** \"Now, take your aluminum foil square. Crumple it into a tight ball and predict if it will float or sink. Test it. What happened? It should sink! Now, unfold it and gently shape it into a boat (cup shape). Put it in the water. Does it float now? How is that possible?\"\n\n6. **Challenge round:** \"Your aluminum foil boat is floating! Now, carefully place one washer in the boat. Does it still float? Add another washer. How many washers can your aluminum boat hold before it sinks?\"\n\n**Recording Sheet (simple, visual for Second Grade):**\n\n| Material | Prediction (Y/N) | Result (S/F) | Float Strong or Weak? |\n|----------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| Foam     | ☐                | ☐ S ☐ F     | ◐◐◐◐◐                |\n| Wood     | ☐                | ☐ S ☐ F     | ◐◐◐◐◐                |\n| Clay     | ☐                | ☐ S ☐ F     | ◐◐◐◐◐                |\n| Plastic  | ☐                | ☐ S ☐ F     | ◐◐◐◐◐                |\n| Aluminum (ball) | ☐         | ☐ S ☐ F     | ◐◐◐◐◐                |\n| Aluminum (boat) | ☐         | ☐ S ☐ F     | ◐◐◐◐◐                |\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between stations. Ask guiding questions: *\"What did you predict? What actually happened? Why do you think the foam floats but the clay sinks?\"*\n- When students notice the aluminum foil boat floats but the ball sinks, pause and ask: *\"What changed? The material is the same, but the shape is different. What does that tell us?\"*\n- Encourage students to test the washers in their boats without leading them to the \"right\" answer.\n- Document observations with photos or student quotes on chart paper for the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that some materials float (foam, plastic, aluminum when shaped) and some sink (clay, metal ball).\n- Students recognize that shape affects floating (aluminum ball sinks; aluminum boat floats).\n- Students observe that floating boats can hold cargo (washers) up to a limit.\n- Recording sheets show predictions vs. results (some will be surprised).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect exploration to the cargo ship.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with student predictions from Engage phase\n- Student recording sheets from Explore\n- Photograph of cargo ship (displayed again)\n- Index cards with vocabulary words (one per student or pair)\n- Drawing of a simple cross-section of a ship (pre-drawn on chart paper)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Let's look at what we discovered. Turn to your neighbor and tell them one thing that surprised you during testing.\"\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share aloud: *\"What surprised you? Why did that material sink or float?\"*\n   - Add surprising findings to the Engage chart: \"We thought metal sinks, but when we shaped aluminum into a boat, it floated!\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with student-friendly explanations (8 minutes):**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Float:** When something sits on top of water and doesn't sink to the bottom.\n   - **Sink:** When something goes down to the bottom of water.\n   - **Material:** What something is made of (like metal, plastic, wood, foam).\n   - **Shape:** The form or outline of something (like a ball, a boat, or a flat piece).\n   - **Cargo:** Heavy things that ships carry across the water (like boxes, containers, or goods).\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Display the cargo ship again.\n   - \"This ship is made of metal—the same material as our sinking metal ball. But look at its shape! It's hollow and spreads out like a giant boat. That's why it floats, even though it's super heavy.\"\n   - Point to the cargo containers on the ship. \"These are filled with things (cargo) from all over the world. The ship is strong enough to hold all this weight and still float.\"\n   - Draw or show a simple diagram: Ship hull (hollow boat shape) pushing water aside to stay on top.\n\n4. **Check for understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: *\"If we change the aluminum foil from a ball to a boat shape, does the material change?\" (No.) \"What changes?\" (The shape.) \"Does the shape change how it floats?\" (Yes!)*\n   - Ask: *\"Why does the real cargo ship float even though it's made of metal?\" (Because of its shape—it's like a giant boat.)*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that both material properties AND shape matter for floating.\n- Students connect their aluminum foil experiment directly to the cargo ship.\n- Students can use vocabulary: float, sink, material, shape, and cargo.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding by designing a ship to carry cargo.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- Plastic container (like a small yogurt tub or margarine cup, approximately 4\" x 3\" x 2\")\n- Aluminum foil or paper\n- Modeling clay\n- Small plastic beads or wrapped candies (to represent cargo—count them beforehand)\n- Tub of water (same as Explore phase)\n- Ruler or measuring stick\n- Recording sheet: \"Cargo Challenge\"\n\n**Activity: \"Design Your Cargo Ship\"**\n\n1. **Challenge presentation (2 minutes):** \"You are a ship designer. Your job is to build a ship using a plastic container that will float AND carry as much cargo (beads) as possible without sinking. You have aluminum foil and clay to help you design it. Which will you use? Why?\"\n\n2. **Design phase (8 minutes):**\n   - Students sketch their design on paper first. *\"Will you use the container as-is? Will you make it more boat-shaped? Will you add clay to the sides?\"*\n   - Students build their ship with materials provided.\n   - Emphasize: *\"Remember: the shape matters, and the materials matter. Think about what you learned from the aluminum foil experiment.\"*\n\n3. **Testing phase (8 minutes):**\n   - Students place their ship in water. Does it float?\n   - If it floats, they carefully add beads (cargo) one at a time, counting aloud.\n   - They stop when the ship sinks.\n   - Record: *\"Our ship held __ pieces of cargo before sinking.\"*\n\n4. **Reflection (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Why do you think your ship held this amount of cargo? If you could rebuild it, what would you change to hold even more?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: *\"What does your design remind you of? Why did you shape it that way? How is it like the cargo ship in the photograph?\"*\n- Praise efforts and material choices: *\"I see you used the clay to make the sides higher. That's smart—it's like the ship's walls!\"*\n- Challenge students: *\"What if you made the boat wider? Would it hold more cargo?\"* (Don't answer; let them test.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply understanding of shape and material to solve a real problem (carrying cargo).\n- Students test, observe, and adjust (scientific thinking).\n- Students can articulate why their design works or doesn't work.\n- Most ships should float with some cargo; varying amounts demonstrate understanding of design trade-offs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student mastery of learning objectives through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Use a checklist—Did students test materials systematically? Did they record predictions and results? Did they notice the shape change in aluminum foil?\n- **Discussion during Explain:** Listen for students using vocabulary correctly. Can they explain why shape matters?\n- **Questioning during Elaborate:** Ask each pair: *\"Why did you choose that material? How is your ship like the real cargo ship?\"* Listen for connections to the photograph and prior activities.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (10 minutes)**\n\nProvide students with a simple one-page exit ticket with these prompts (read aloud; students draw or write with support):\n\n**Exit Ticket: \"What We Learned About Ships\"**\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Draw something that floats and something that sinks. Label them.\n\n2. **Answer with words or pictures:** Why doesn't the cargo ship sink even though it's made of metal?\n   - ☐ Because metal doesn't sink\n   - ☐ Because of its shape—it's like a big boat\n   - ☐ Because it's very big\n   - ☐ Other: _______________\n\n3. **Short answer (or dictate to teacher):** \"If we squished aluminum foil into a ball, would it float or sink?\" Answer: _____ Why? _____________________\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies at least one floating and one sinking object.\n- ✓ Student recognizes that the cargo ship floats because of its shape (not just because metal floats).\n- ✓ Student can explain that shape affects floating (aluminum ball sinks; aluminum boat floats).\n- ✓ Student uses at least two vocabulary terms correctly: float, sink, material, shape, or cargo.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most Second Graders will meet criteria 1, 2, and 3.\n- Advanced students will articulate the shape-function relationship with sophisticated language.\n- Struggling students may need visual supports or sentence starters: *\"The ship floats because _____. The shape is _____.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified material testing:** Provide only 3 materials (foam, clay, wood) in the Explore phase. Reduce cognitive load by testing fewer variables.\n\n2. **Sentence starters for explanations:** Provide sentence frames on index cards:\n   - *\"This material _____ because _____.\"*\n   - *\"The shape is important because _____.\"*\n   - *\"The ship floats because _____.\"*\n\n3. **Partner pairing:** Pair struggling students with stronger peers during Explore and Elaborate. Assign clear roles: one predicts, one tests, one records.\n\n4. **Visual supports during Explain:** Use simple drawings or realia (actual objects) to demonstrate sink vs. float, not just words. Show a real metal spoon sinking and the aluminum foil boat floating side-by-side.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended cargo test:** Challenge advanced students to predict not just how many beads their ship holds, but to explain *why* using material properties and buoyancy language: *\"My wider boat holds more because it spreads the weight over a bigger area.\"*\n\n2. **Design modification task:** After initial testing, ask: *\"If you rebuilt your ship with a different material (plastic vs. aluminum), would it float better? Test it and explain your findings.\"*\n\n3. **Real-world connection research:** Have advanced students draw and label the real cargo ship's features during Explain—point out the hull shape, the wide design, and cargo containers. Ask: *\"Why do you think real ships are built this way? What would happen if they had a narrower shape?\"*\n\n4. **Multi-variable investigation:** Challenge students to test two versions of the same shape: one narrow, one wide. Same cargo. Which holds more? Record data and write a conclusion: *\"Wider shapes hold more cargo because _____.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Build-a-Boat Challenge (follow-up lesson or homework):** Students design a boat using only one type of material (e.g., foam, plastic, clay, or wood) that must float and hold at least 5 washers. They test at home (with parental supervision in a tub or bathtub) and report results. Gallery walk of designs in the classroom.\n\n2. **Cargo Ship Story Writing:** Students write a simple story (3-5 sentences, with illustrations) about a cargo ship that travels across the ocean. Prompt: *\"Where did your ship travel? What cargo did it carry? How did it stay afloat?\"* This integrates ELA and science understanding.\n\n3. **Sink-or-Float Mystery Bag:** Place mystery objects in a bag (sponge, eraser, metal washer, plastic button, grape, marble). Students predict sink or float before testing. Create a classroom graph: \"What We Floated.\" This reinforces the Explore phase and builds vocabulary through repetition.\n\n4. **Engineering Design Challenge — Unsinkable Boat:** Provide each student a plastic cup and a limited amount of aluminum foil. Challenge: *\"Design a boat that holds the most cargo (washers) before sinking. You may only use the cup, the foil, and tape.\"* This mirrors the real engineering challenges faced by ship designers.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Prior knowledge:** Students at this age may have played with bath toys or seen boats. Ask about these experiences during Engage to activate prior knowledge.\n- **Water management:** Set up testing stations on tables covered with plastic tablecloths or newspaper. Have towels ready for spills. Assign a \"water monitor\" student to refill containers as needed.\n- **Safety:** Supervise water activities closely. Remind students not to splash or drink from the test containers.\n- **Pacing:** If students are highly engaged in Explore, extend that phase by 5-10 minutes. The Explain phase can be shortened if students already understand the concepts.\n- **Vocabulary reinforcement:** Write vocabulary words and definitions on a word wall chart with pictures. Reference it daily for the rest of the week.\n- **Real-world anchor:** Throughout the week, reference the cargo ship photograph during transitions: *\"Just like the floating ship we studied, foam floats because...\"*\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly addresses NGSS 2-PS1-2 by having students test materials and determine which are best suited for floating and cargo-carrying purposes. It also supports 2-PS1-1 by requiring students to observe and describe material properties.**",
