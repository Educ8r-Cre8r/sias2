The locomotive's massive size and power demonstrate large-scale energy conversion, while the smaller car shows a different scale of the same process.\n\n- **Force and Motion:** Both vehicles demonstrate how forces (generated by engines burning fuel) create motion. The locomotive's wheels on the track and the car's wheels on the road show how forces are applied to overcome friction and move objects.\n\n- **Matter and Its Properties:** The photograph shows two different materials and structures—the locomotive's heavy metal frame and the car's lighter design—which have different properties that affect how they move and what forces are required to move them.\n\n- **Gravitational Force and Weight:** Both vehicles are subject to Earth's gravitational pull. The locomotive's enormous weight and the car's lighter mass demonstrate how gravity affects different objects differently, influencing the energy needed to move them.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Energy in Motion: How Vehicles Convert Fuel to Power**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-PS3-1: Use models to describe that energy in animals' food (used for body repair, growth, motion, and to maintain body warmth) was once energy from the sun.\n  - 5-PS2-1: Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down.\n  - 5-PS1-3: Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Explain how stored chemical energy in fuel is converted into motion and heat energy.\n2. Describe how gravitational force affects objects of different masses and the energy needed to move them.\n3. Compare the properties of materials and structures that allow vehicles of different sizes to move.\n4. Support an argument using evidence that the sun's energy is ultimately the source of the energy that moves vehicles on Earth.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about energy and motion using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed on screen or printed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without any explanation. Show it for 30 seconds in silence, allowing students to look carefully.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about the size of these two vehicles? How are they different?\"\n   - \"Both of these vehicles can move. Where do you think the energy comes from to make them go?\"\n   - \"If you had to push both of these vehicles, which one would be easier to move? Why?\"\n   - \"What do you think this locomotive and this car have in common, even though they look so different?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"The text on the locomotive says 'Ultra Low Emissions Diesel Genset Switcher.' What do you think that means? Where does diesel fuel come from originally?\" Write student predictions on chart paper.\n\n4. **Activate prior knowledge:** Ask students, \"Have you ever felt heat from the sun? Have you ever thought about where the energy that makes cars and trains move actually comes from?\" \n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate where vehicles get their energy and how they use it to move. We'll explore how the sun's energy plays a hidden role in powering these machines.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how energy is stored, transferred, and used through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Toy cars or small model vehicles (at least one per group of 3-4 students)\n- Wind-up toy cars OR cars powered by rubber bands (alternative: battery-powered toy cars)\n- Spring scales or small weight scales\n- Meter sticks or measuring tapes\n- Ramps (made from foam board or cardboard)\n- Tape and masking tape\n- Data recording sheets (provided)\n- Markers and pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Observing Energy Storage and Transfer (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Organize students into groups of 3-4.** Assign each group a toy car (wind-up, rubber band-powered, or battery-powered).\n\n2. **Provide clear student directions:**\n   - \"Wind up your car (or pull back the rubber band / turn on the battery) and observe what happens when you release it.\"\n   - \"Make the car go as far as possible. Measure the distance it travels in centimeters using your meter stick.\"\n   - \"Do this three times and record all three distances on your data sheet.\"\n   - \"Now, try storing MORE energy (wind it tighter, pull the rubber band back farther, or use a longer battery push). Does the car travel farther? Record your new distances.\"\n\n3. **Connection to photograph:** \"Just like your toy car stores energy when you wind it up, the locomotive and the real car store chemical energy in their fuel. When the fuel burns, that stored energy becomes motion—just like your wound-up car.\"\n\n4. **What students record:**\n   - Starting energy level (wind tightness, rubber band distance, or battery duration)\n   - Distance traveled (three trials)\n   - Changes in distance when more energy was added\n\n**Part B: Exploring Force, Mass, and Gravity (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the heavier object:** \"The locomotive in the photo is MUCH heavier than the red car. How do you think that affects how much energy is needed to move it?\"\n\n2. **Provide directions:**\n   - \"Use the spring scale to measure the weight (force of gravity) on your toy car. Record this number.\"\n   - \"Now, add weight to your car using stacked weights or books. Measure the new weight.\"\n   - \"Wind up your car the SAME amount of energy as before. Does it go as far? Record what happens.\"\n\n3. **What students record:**\n   - Original weight of car\n   - New weight after adding mass\n   - Distance traveled with the same amount of energy applied\n   - Observation: Did the heavier car go as far?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to each group and ask guiding questions: \"What do you think happened? Why did adding mass change how far the car traveled?\"\n- **Do not** explain the answer; let students observe and wonder.\n- Ensure accurate measurements and recordings.\n- Help students stay on task and manage materials.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will discover that more stored energy makes objects move farther.\n- Students will observe that heavier objects require more energy to move the same distance.\n- Students will recognize that energy is transferred from the car (or their wind-up action) to motion.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Diagram showing energy transformation (teacher-created or from textbook)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask each group to share one key observation: \"What did you find out about energy and motion?\"\n   - Write findings on chart paper using student language first, then rephrase using scientific vocabulary.\n\n2. **Teacher-led mini-lesson (8 minutes):**\n   - \"Energy is the ability to make things move or change. In your exploration, you stored energy when you wound up your car. That energy was released and turned into motion.\"\n   - Reference the photograph: \"The locomotive burns diesel fuel. The fuel is made from oil that came from ancient plants and animals. Those ancient organisms got their energy from the sun millions of years ago. Today, when we burn diesel, we're using the sun's energy!\"\n   - \"The red car works the same way. Its gasoline comes from oil, which also came from the sun's energy, stored in plants and animals long ago.\"\n   - **Introduce the concept of gravitational force:** \"The Earth pulls down on all objects with a force we call gravity. Your car weighs more when you add mass to it. That's because gravity is pulling down harder. A heavier object needs more energy to move it the same distance as a lighter object.\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary instruction (3 minutes):** Write each term on the board and have students repeat after you.\n\n4. **Connection back to data (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at your measurements. When you added more wind-up energy, did your car go farther? Why?\"\n   - \"When you added weight to your car, it didn't go as far with the same energy. That's because gravity was pulling down on it more, and more energy was needed to overcome that pull.\"\n   - \"The huge locomotive needs TONS of diesel fuel to move because it's so heavy. Gravity pulls it down with enormous force. The small red car needs less fuel because it's lighter and gravity doesn't pull on it as hard.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding strategy:**\n   - Ask students: \"Where did the energy come from that made your toy car move?\" (From you winding it up.)\n   - \"And where did YOUR energy come from?\" (From food we eat.)\n   - \"And where did the sun's energy get stored in that food?\" (Plants absorbed it from the sun; we ate plants or animals that ate plants.)\n   - \"So, the sun is the original source of energy for almost everything that moves!\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Energy:** The ability to make something move, change, or do work. Example: \"The diesel fuel has energy stored in it that helps the locomotive move.\"\n- **Chemical Energy:** Energy stored in fuel (like diesel, gasoline, or food) that can be released through burning or digestion. Example: \"Diesel fuel contains chemical energy.\"\n- **Kinetic Energy:** The energy of motion—energy that something has because it's moving. Example: \"Once your toy car starts moving, it has kinetic energy.\"\n- **Gravitational Force:** The pulling force that Earth exerts on all objects, pulling them downward. Example: \"Gravitational force is why the heavy locomotive is so hard to move.\"\n- **Mass:** The amount of matter in an object. A heavier object has more mass. Example: \"The locomotive has much more mass than the red car.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can explain that fuel contains stored chemical energy.\n- Students understand that gravitational force affects all objects and that heavier objects require more energy to move.\n- Students recognize that the sun's energy is the original source of energy for vehicles.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing an experiment and connecting to real-world scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Toy cars from Explore phase\n- Ramps of varying heights (3 different heights: shallow, medium, steep)\n- Meter sticks or measuring tapes\n- Weight sets or stacked textbooks\n- Data recording sheets\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge: Design an Experiment About Potential Energy and Gravitational Force**\n\n1. **Present the real-world connection:**\n   - \"The locomotive in the photo travels on tracks that go up and down hills. When a train goes up a hill, it has to fight against gravity—it needs lots of energy. When it comes down a hill, gravity actually helps it move. How do you think that works?\"\n\n2. **Design investigation (teacher guides; students design and conduct):**\n   - \"You're going to design an experiment to see how height and gravity affect a rolling object's motion.\"\n   - **Student task:** \"Using your ramp, predict: Will a car roll farther if it starts from a higher position on the ramp or a lower position? Why?\"\n   - Students record their prediction with reasoning.\n\n3. **Conduct the experiment:**\n   - Place toy car at three different heights on the ramp.\n   - Release the car and measure how far it travels from the bottom of the ramp.\n   - Record distances for each height.\n   - Repeat 2-3 times per height to ensure reliability.\n\n4. **Deepen understanding:**\n   - \"The higher you place your car, the more the Earth's gravity can pull it down. That gravitational pull gives the car more energy to roll farther. This is called potential energy—energy that comes from being in a position where gravity can pull on it.\"\n   - \"A train at the top of a mountain has lots of potential energy. When it rolls down, that becomes kinetic energy—the energy of motion.\"\n\n5. **Real-world application discussion:**\n   - \"Engineers who design trains think about hills and gravity all the time. They have to make sure the locomotive has enough fuel energy to climb hills, and they have to control the brakes when going down hills so the train doesn't go too fast.\"\n   - \"Where else do you see gravity helping or fighting against motion?\" (Roller coasters, sledding, skateboarding, elevators, etc.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Guide students in making predictions BEFORE they experiment.\n- Ask: \"What will happen? Why do you think that?\"\n- Help students organize data neatly.\n- Encourage students to discuss their findings with a partner.\n- Facilitate connection: \"How is this like the locomotive on the photo?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students discover that higher starting positions result in greater distances traveled due to gravitational potential energy.\n- Students apply the concept that gravitational force creates energy available for motion.\n- Students connect this understanding to real vehicles and landscapes.\n- Students articulate that the sun's energy, fuel's chemical energy, and gravitational potential energy all work together in transportation systems.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of energy transformation, gravitational force, and the sun as the ultimate energy source.\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n\n- Observation during Explore phase: Did students accurately measure and record data? Did they make connections between energy input and motion output?\n- Questioning during Explain phase: Can students explain where fuel energy comes from and how gravity affects motion?\n- Participation during Elaborate phase: Did students make reasonable predictions? Can they interpret their data?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) — Administer at the end of Day 2:**\n\n**Prompt (read aloud; students write or draw responses):**\n\n\"Look at this picture again. The locomotive and the red car both use fuel to move. Answer these questions:\"\n\n1. **\"Where did the energy in their fuel originally come from? (Hint: Think about what we learned about the sun.)\"**\n   - *Expected answer:* The energy in fuel came from the sun, stored in ancient plants and animals millions of years ago.\n\n2. **\"Why does the big, heavy locomotive need MORE fuel than the small red car to travel the same distance?\"**\n   - *Expected answer:* The locomotive is heavier, so Earth's gravitational force pulls down on it harder. It needs more energy to move against that gravitational pull.\n\n3. **\"Draw or explain: How is a toy car rolling down a ramp like the locomotive on a real train track?\"**\n   - *Expected answer:* Both use gravitational force to create motion. As they go down, gravity pulls them and gives them energy to move.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- **Proficient:** Student accurately identifies the sun as the original energy source, correctly explains the relationship between mass/gravity and energy needed for motion, and makes a reasonable comparison involving gravitational force.\n\n- **Developing:** Student identifies the sun as an energy source but may not fully explain how; explains that heavier objects need more energy but may lack clarity on the role of gravity; makes a comparison but with incomplete reasoning.\n\n- **Beginning:** Student has limited understanding of energy sources or the role of gravity; struggle to connect concepts; comparisons may lack scientific reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- All students should be able to explain that stored chemical energy in fuel comes originally from the sun.\n- Most students should be able to describe how gravitational force affects the energy needed to move objects of different masses.\n- Students should demonstrate understanding that energy is transferred and transformed in vehicles.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visual supports:** Provide a \"vocabulary card\" with pictures and simple definitions for energy, gravity, and motion. Allow students to refer to these during discussions and writing tasks.\n\n2. **Sentence frames for explanations:** Provide sentence starters: \n   - \"The fuel has _________ energy stored in it.\"\n   - \"Gravity pulls the _________ car down harder than the _________ car.\"\n   - \"The sun's energy is in fuel because _________.\"\n\n3. **Hands-on measurement support:** Pair struggling students with a peer or provide teacher-led small group practice measuring and recording distances before the full Explore activity. Use larger, easier-to-read measuring tools (meter sticks with larger increments).\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Efficiency investigation:** \"Compare two different types of toy cars or vehicles. Which one uses energy more efficiently? Design an experiment to test which car goes farthest on the same amount of energy. How could this help engineers build better real cars?\"\n\n2. **Energy calculations and graphing:** \"Collect data on the relationship between the energy you add (wind-up tightness on a scale of 1-5) and distance traveled. Create a line graph. What pattern do you see? Can you predict how far the car would go if you added even MORE energy?\"\n\n3. **Research and presentation:** \"Research how real locomotives or electric cars get their energy. How is it different from what we learned about the diesel locomotive? How is it similar? Create a presentation to teach the class.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Solar Energy Chain\" Poster Project:** Students create a visual chain showing energy transformation from sun → ancient plants/animals → fossil fuels → chemical energy in fuel → kinetic energy of motion. Display in hallway. This reinforces 5-PS3-1 (sun as energy source).\n\n2. **\"Gravity and Mass Investigation\":** Students conduct a modified version of the Explore activity at home using toy cars and items of different weights. They record data and compare results with classmates, discovering universal principles about mass, gravity, and energy. (This extends 5-PS2-1.)\n\n3. **\"Design a More Efficient Vehicle\":** Challenge students to design or build a simple vehicle (using cardboard, dowels, and wheels) that travels farthest using minimal energy input (a single rubber band release or ramp height). Students test, modify, and retest their designs, explaining how they applied what they learned about energy and gravitational force.",
