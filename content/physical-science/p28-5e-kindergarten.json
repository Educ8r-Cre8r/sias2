Observe and describe how pushing and pulling forces make objects move.\n2. Predict how different strengths of pushes and pulls will affect how far or fast an object moves.\n3. Compare and explain the movement of objects when pushed or pulled with different amounts of force.\n4. Identify real-world examples of pushes and pulls, such as the train in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about forces using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color photograph of the light rail train (or displayed on screen/smartboard)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: toy train for additional visual reference\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Show students the image of the light rail train and allow 30 seconds of silent observation. Say, \"Look carefully at this big machine. What do you notice?\"\n\n2. **Facilitate Discussion with Guided Questions:**\n   - \"What is this?\" (Help them identify it as a train.)\n   - \"How do you think this heavy train gets moving down the tracks? Does it move by itself, or does something make it move?\"\n   - \"What do we call it when we make something move? Is it a push or a pull?\" (Introduce the terms gently.)\n   - \"Do you think this train moves fast or slow? What might make it go faster or slower?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \n   - Say, \"I wonder... if I could push this train with a tiny little push, or a REALLY BIG push, would it move the same way both times?\" \n   - Have students turn to a partner and share their ideas: \"Do you think the size of the push matters?\"\n\n4. **Record Predictions:** On chart paper, write or draw student predictions: \"We think pushing makes things move because...\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to test pushes and pulls ourselves with some things we can move in our classroom. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how different strengths and directions of pushes and pulls affect motion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small toy cars or blocks (1 per pair, or 1 per small group)\n- Smooth floor or long table/ramp\n- Tape for marking start and end lines\n- Rulers or measuring tape\n- Pictures/cards showing \"soft push,\" \"hard push,\" \"pull\" (with simple illustrations)\n- Recording sheets (simple pictures with spaces to draw or place stickers)\n\n**Activity – Station-Based Investigation:**\n\n**Station 1: Soft Push vs. Hard Push**\n\nStudent Directions:\n1. Place your toy car at the tape line (start line).\n2. Give the car a *soft* push with one finger. Watch where it stops.\n3. Mark or remember where it stopped.\n4. Reset the car at the start line.\n5. Now give the car a *hard* push with your whole hand. Watch where it stops.\n6. Compare: Did the soft push or hard push make the car go farther?\n7. Draw or color a picture on your recording sheet showing which push was stronger.\n\n**Station 2: Push vs. Pull**\n\nStudent Directions:\n1. Your teacher will attach a string to the toy car.\n2. First, push the car across the floor from behind it.\n3. Then, pull the car using the string.\n4. Did the push and pull make the car move the same way, or different?\n5. On your recording sheet, draw an arrow showing the push direction and an arrow showing the pull direction.\n\n**Station 3: Direction of the Push**\n\nStudent Directions:\n1. Place the car at the starting tape.\n2. Push the car forward (away from you).\n3. Reset and push the car to the side (sideways).\n4. Does a push always make things move in the same direction? Why or why not?\n5. Draw the path the car took with each push on your sheet.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between stations asking open-ended questions: \"What happened when you pushed softly?\" \"Did it go as far?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Avoid confirming right/wrong; instead ask, \"What did you notice?\"\n- Help students record by drawing simple pictures or placing dot stickers to mark distances.\n- Encourage students to try their investigation more than once.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that harder pushes make objects move farther or faster.\n- Students observe that pulls and pushes move objects in different directions.\n- Students realize that the direction of the force affects the direction of motion.\n- Recording sheets show simple evidence of their observations (drawings, marks, or stickers).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration findings to the train photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple illustrations\n- The train photograph (displayed again)\n- Real objects to demonstrate: toy car, ball, blocks, string\n- Visual anchor chart showing push vs. pull with arrows\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask volunteers to share what they discovered at each station.\n   - Record their observations on a new chart: \"What We Learned About Pushes and Pulls\"\n   - Affirm findings: \"You discovered that a hard push makes things move farther!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8–10 minutes):**\n   \n   Display each term with a simple illustration or demonstration:\n\n   - **Push:** A force that moves something *away* from you. (Demonstrate by pushing a toy car away.)\n   - **Pull:** A force that moves something *toward* you. (Demonstrate by pulling a toy car with string.)\n   - **Force:** The strength or power that makes something move or stop.\n   - **Speed:** How fast or slow something moves. (Fast = far in a short time; slow = not far.)\n   - **Direction:** Which way something moves (forward, backward, sideways, up, down).\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Show the train photo again.\n   - \"This train is pushed by a powerful engine. The engine pushes the train down the tracks. The push is so strong that the whole train moves! Look at those overhead wires—they give power to the engine so it can push the train.\"\n   - Ask: \"Do you think the train's push is soft or hard? How do you know?\"\n   - \"The train always moves in the same direction—forward on the tracks. That's because the push always goes the same way.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Show the toy car and ask: \"If I push this car gently, what will happen?\" (Students respond.)\n   - \"If I pull it with the string, which way will it move?\" (Students show direction with arms.)\n   - \"Is this a push or a pull?\" (Students answer for each action you demonstrate.)\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Anchor Chart:**\nCreate a visual anchor chart to remain displayed:\n```\nPUSHES & PULLS\n🖐️ PUSH: Makes things move AWAY\n🧤 PULL: Makes things move TOWARD\n⚡ FORCE: The strength to move something\n🏃 SPEED: How fast or slow\n⬆️ DIRECTION: Which way it goes\n```\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and label pushes and pulls in classroom contexts.\n- Students understand that force, speed, and direction are connected to movement.\n- Students can explain the train's motion using \"push\" and \"force\" language.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to new scenarios and deepen understanding of pushes and pulls.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Toy vehicles (cars, blocks, balls)\n- Various launching devices (ramps, catapults made from craft sticks and rubber bands—pre-made by teacher)\n- Targets (paper circles, cones)\n- Challenge cards with picture instructions\n- Recording/observation clipboard\n\n**Activity – Push & Pull Challenges:**\n\n**Challenge 1: Make It Stop**\n- Students push or pull a toy car and try to make it stop at a specific line using a second push or pull.\n- Question: \"Can you use a push to stop it, or do you need a pull?\"\n- Students discover: You need to push or pull *against* the direction of motion to stop something.\n\n**Challenge 2: Change the Direction**\n- A toy car starts moving in one direction.\n- Students must push or pull it to make it change direction (turn sideways).\n- Question: \"Does pushing on the side change where it goes?\"\n- Students discover: The direction of the force determines the direction of motion.\n\n**Challenge 3: Make It Go Really Far (Ramp Challenge)**\n- Students release (soft push) a toy car down a ramp.\n- Then they give the car a hard push at the bottom of the ramp.\n- Question: \"Which made the car go farther—just rolling down, or pushing at the bottom?\"\n- Students discover: Forces can add together to make things move faster or farther.\n\n**Challenge 4: Design a Delivery Route**\n- Using small cars and blocks to represent buildings, students create a simple \"track\" and push the car around it.\n- Question: \"Can you push the car around corners without it stopping? What happens?\"\n- Students discover: Sustained force keeps things moving; direction changes require turning the force.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Pose challenges as open-ended exploration, not a script.\n- Ask: \"How can we make that work?\" rather than demonstrating.\n- Encourage students to try multiple times and adjust their approach.\n- Celebrate attempts and persistence: \"You're thinking like a scientist!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can apply push-and-pull concepts to new scenarios.\n- Students begin to understand that multiple or opposing forces create different outcomes.\n- Students show evidence of deeper reasoning: \"We need a stronger push because...\" or \"It stopped because we pulled it backward.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pushes, pulls, and how they affect motion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist** (use during Explore and Elaborate):\n  - ☐ Student identifies a push or pull when shown\n  - ☐ Student predicts how a push or pull will move an object\n  - ☐ Student observes and describes movement accurately\n  - ☐ Student compares soft and hard pushes/pulls\n  \n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes):**\n\nChoose one format based on your class:\n\n**Option A: Show & Tell (Best for most K students)**\n- Give each student a toy car.\n- Ask three yes/no questions; students show their answer by doing it:\n  1. \"Can you push the car? Show me a push.\" (Students push the car.)\n  2. \"Can you pull the car? Show me a pull.\" (Students pull using string or by hand.)\n  3. \"If I push the car softly, will it go the same distance as a hard push?\" (Students vote with thumbs up/down, then you demonstrate to confirm.)\n\n**Option B: Drawing Prompt (For students who can draw/record)**\n- Show the train photograph one more time.\n- Prompt: \"Draw the train and show me which way the push makes it go. Use an arrow.\"\n- Students draw the train and arrow pointing forward.\n- Questions to ask as they work: \"Which way does the push make it move?\" / \"Is this a push or a pull?\"\n\n**Option C: Interview / Verbal (For individual assessment)**\n- Ask each student 1–2 questions one-on-one:\n  - \"When the train moves down the tracks, is that a push or a pull?\"\n  - \"If someone pushed you on the swing, would you move forward or backward?\"\n  - \"Show me what a soft push looks like. Now show me a hard push. Which one makes things move farther?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n\n✅ **Students demonstrate understanding if they:**\n- Correctly identify at least 2 examples of pushes and pulls in the classroom\n- Predict that a harder push will make an object move farther or faster\n- Observe and describe how a push or pull changes an object's motion\n- Use the words \"push,\" \"pull,\" or \"force\" accurately in at least one sentence\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify and demonstrate a push or a pull\n- 75% of students can predict that stronger forces create more motion\n- 85% of students can connect the train's movement to a \"push\" force\n- All students have engaged with at least one challenge activity and shown evidence of thinking about forces\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Station Rotation:**\n   - Reduce to 2 stations instead of 3; combine soft/hard push and push/pull into one station.\n   - Pair student with a buddy or aide.\n   - Use only one type of toy (e.g., just cars, no balls that roll unpredictably).\n\n2. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:**\n   - Use **gesture** heavily (push hand away, pull hand toward) alongside words.\n   - Provide a personal vocabulary card with push/pull pictures they can reference at stations.\n   - Practice 1–2 vocabulary words in isolation before group lesson.\n\n3. **Concrete, Shorter Investigations:**\n   - Reduce the number of \"trials\" (e.g., push the car once softly, once hard, then compare—not multiple times).\n   - Use a measuring strategy they understand: \"Did it go to the wall or not?\" (binary choice) rather than exact measurements.\n   - Pre-record observations for them on the sheet; they focus on doing the push/pull.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Multi-Variable Prediction:**\n   - \"If you use a hard push AND a ramp, will it go farther than just a hard push? Test your idea.\"\n   - Students hypothesize the combined effect of forces and test it.\n\n2. **Represent Force Graphically:**\n   - Instead of simple drawings, challenge students to use tally marks or stickers to show how many finger-widths the car traveled with each force.\n   - Introduce the concept: \"Can you show how far is 'soft' and how far is 'hard' using marks?\"\n\n3. **Extend to Real-World Problem-Solving:**\n   - \"The train is stuck on the tracks. How could we push or pull it to get it moving again?\" (Discuss multiple solutions.)\n   - \"Design a game where you push a car to hit a target. What kind of push do you need—soft, medium, or hard?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Push and Pull Hunt\" (Classroom Walk)**\n   - Take students on a short walk around the classroom (or school hallway, with permission).\n   - Ask them to point out pushes and pulls they see: a door being pushed, a ball being thrown (pulled through the air), a child pulling a wagon, etc.\n   - Create a class list or picture chart: \"Pushes and Pulls We Found.\"\n   - Connects to real-world observation and reinforces vocabulary.\n\n2. **Ramp Races (Elaborate Play Activity)**\n   - Build simple ramps using blocks and boards.\n   - Have students release cars from different heights on the ramp.\n   - Ask: \"Does a car go faster from a high ramp or a low ramp? Why?\"\n   - Students discover that the height of the ramp affects the force (gravity) pulling the car down, causing faster motion.\n   - Record which ramp height made the car go fastest.\n\n3. **\"Machines That Push and Pull\" Picture Book**\n   - Read a picture book like *Push and Pull* by Shelley Rotner or *Machines* by Clive Oppenheimer.\n   - After reading, ask students to identify all the pushes and pulls they saw in the book.\n   - Create a class \"Push and Pull Machines\" poster with pictures from the book, magazine cutouts, or student drawings.\n   - Include the train from the original photograph at the top: \"Our train uses a push to move!\"\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Safety Reminder:** Emphasize that pushes and pulls in investigations are gentle and controlled—never pushing a person or pulling hard on materials.\n- **Pacing:** If students are highly engaged with one phase, it's acceptable to extend slightly and shorten another phase. This lesson is designed with flexibility.\n- **Inclusivity:** Ensure all students can physically push or pull (adapt for students with motor challenges by allowing them to direct a partner's movements or use modified tools).\n- **Connection to Photo:** Refer back to the train photograph at least 3 times throughout the lesson to maintain the concrete visual anchor and reinforce that real machines depend on pushes and pulls.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson plan uses the authentic image of a light rail train to ground Kindergarten students' understanding of one of the most fundamental physical science concepts: forces. By moving from observation (Engage) through hands-on experimentation (Explore), explicit naming of concepts (Explain), and real-world application (Elaborate), students develop both conceptual understanding and the language to describe how pushes and pulls make things move.",
