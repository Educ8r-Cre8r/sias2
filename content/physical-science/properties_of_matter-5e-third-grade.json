Observe and describe the properties of different liquids (how they flow, their color, thickness, and how they fill containers).\n2. Predict how a liquid will behave when poured into different containers and explain why it takes that shape.\n3. Compare the properties of at least three different liquids and identify similarities and differences.\n4. Explain that liquids are a state of matter that flows and takes the shape of its container.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by examining the photograph of the engine reservoir and its liquid contents.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Printed or projected image of the photograph\n  - Large clear container (such as a transparent plastic pitcher or fish tank)\n  - Water\n\n- **Activity:**\n  Display the photograph on the board or project it for all students to see. Point to the yellow fluid visible in the engine reservoir.\n\n  **Discussion Questions (pose these one at a time, allowing 1-2 minutes of pair-share and whole-group discussion for each):**\n  1. \"What do you see in this picture? Describe what's inside that white container with the black cap.\"\n  2. \"This yellow liquid is special engine oil that helps a car run smoothly. Why do you think the liquid fills the bottom of the container? What would happen if we tipped this container sideways?\"\n  3. \"Have you seen liquids in containers at home? Can you think of examples?\" (Accept responses: juice in a cup, milk in a jug, water in a bottle, etc.)\n  4. \"If we poured this engine oil into a different shaped container—like a tall, thin tube instead of this wide container—what do you think would happen to it?\"\n\n  **Prediction Prompt:**\n  \"Today, we're going to become liquid scientists! We're going to test different liquids and see how they behave. Make a prediction: Do you think all liquids move and flow the same way, or are some liquids different?\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Let's find out by exploring liquids ourselves. In our Explore station, you'll test different liquids and watch how they behave.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate the properties of different liquids through hands-on exploration with containers and materials.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - 3-4 different liquids in small, labeled containers (water, corn syrup, vegetable oil, honey—choose 3-4 based on availability)\n  - Clear plastic cups or small transparent containers (at least 3-4 per student pair, 12-16 total)\n  - White paper or white paper towels (to place under cups for better visibility)\n  - Spoons or droppers (1 per liquid type)\n  - Paper towels for cleanup\n  - Observation recording sheets (printed template with drawings of empty containers and space for notes)\n  - Optional: small ramps made from cardboard or wooden rulers (for observing flow rate)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  Divide the class into pairs or small groups of 3. Assign each pair/group a \"Liquid Station\" and provide them with 2-3 different liquids to test. Rotate groups every 8-10 minutes so students can observe all liquids.\n\n  **Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n  1. **Predict:** Before you touch anything, look at the liquids. Which one do you think will pour the fastest? Which will pour the slowest? Write your prediction on your observation sheet by drawing an arrow (fast or slow).\n\n  2. **Pour and Observe:** Using a spoon or dropper, carefully pour a small amount of the first liquid into an empty cup. Watch closely. Write or draw what you see:\n     - Does it fill the cup quickly or slowly?\n     - What color is it?\n     - Does it look thick or thin?\n     - Can you see through it?\n\n  3. **Tilt and Test:** Very gently tilt the cup to one side. What happens to the liquid? Does it move to the lower side? Does it try to spill out? Draw what you observe.\n\n  4. **Compare Containers:** Pour the same liquid into a different-shaped container (e.g., if the first was a wide cup, use a tall, thin cup). Does the liquid behave differently in a new shape? What stayed the same? What changed? Record your observations.\n\n  5. **Feel the Difference (Optional):** Carefully touch the outside of the cups containing different liquids (do not touch the liquids directly). Some liquids feel \"thicker\" to pour. Which one seems thickest? Which seems thinnest?\n\n  6. **Rotate:** When the teacher signals (after ~8 minutes), move to the next Liquid Station and repeat steps 1-5 with different liquids.\n\n- **How This Connects to the Photograph:**\n  The engine oil in the photograph behaves like the liquids you're testing. It fills the container from the bottom up and would flow if the container tipped over—just like your test liquids.\n\n- **What Students Should Record or Document:**\n  - Drawings or sketches of each liquid in its container\n  - Quick notes using sentence stems: \"This liquid is _______.\" \"When I tilted the cup, the liquid _______.\"\n  - Predictions vs. actual observations\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  Circulate among groups without providing answers. Ask guiding questions:\n  - \"What do you notice about how fast/slow that poured?\"\n  - \"What happened when you tilted the cup?\"\n  - \"Is this liquid the same as the first one you tested? How is it different?\"\n  - Ensure liquids are contained and spills are cleaned up immediately for safety.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  Students will observe and document that:\n  - Different liquids have different colors and thicknesses.\n  - Liquids flow and take the shape of their container.\n  - Some liquids pour faster than others.\n  - All liquids respond similarly when tilted (they move to the lower side).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to scientific concepts about liquids and their properties.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Anchor chart (large poster paper, pre-drawn with sections for vocabulary and properties)\n  - Markers (multiple colors)\n  - Completed observation sheets from Explore phase\n  - One clear container filled with water (for demonstration)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  Gather students in a circle or at carpet area where all can see the anchor chart and a demonstration container.\n\n  **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):**\n  Ask 3-4 student pairs/groups to share one observation from their Explore station:\n  - \"What liquid did you test?\"\n  - \"What did you notice about how it moved?\"\n  - \"Was it different from the first liquid you tested? How?\"\n\n  Record their responses on the anchor chart using drawings and simple words.\n\n  **Key Vocabulary Introduction (with demonstrations, 8-10 minutes):**\n\n  As you introduce each term, demonstrate with water in a clear container or reference observations from the Explore phase.\n\n  1. **Liquid:** A state of matter that flows, takes the shape of its container, and can be poured. \"All the liquids you tested today—water, oil, syrup—are liquids because they flow and fill up the bottom of the cup.\"\n\n  2. **Container:** A cup, bottle, or object that holds something inside. \"Your observation sheets showed how the same liquid looked different in different containers, but it was still liquid.\"\n\n  3. **Flow:** The movement of a liquid from one place to another. \"When you tilted the cup, the liquid flowed toward the lower side.\"\n\n  4. **Properties:** Characteristics or features that describe something. \"Color, how thick or thin it is, and how fast it pours are all properties of liquids.\"\n\n  5. **Volume:** The amount of space a liquid takes up. \"See the 'MAX' label on that engine oil container? That shows how much liquid can fit—that's the volume.\"\n\n  **Connections Back to the Photograph (2-3 minutes):**\n  Display the original photograph again. Point to the yellow liquid in the reservoir.\n  - \"This engine oil is a liquid, just like the ones you tested. It fills the container from the bottom. If the container tipped over, the liquid would flow out. The 'MAX' label tells the car's owner how much oil should be in there.\"\n\n  **Check for Understanding Strategy:**\n  Use hand signals: \"Show me with your thumb—up if you can explain what a liquid is, sideways if you're not sure, down if you need help.\"\n\n  Ask individual students: \"Can you describe one property of the water you tested?\" Listen for responses that mention color, thickness, or how it flowed.\n\n- **Vocabulary List:**\n\n  | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n  |------|---------------------------|\n  | **Liquid** | A state of matter that flows and takes the shape of its container |\n  | **Container** | An object that holds something inside, like a cup, bottle, or tank |\n  | **Flow** | The way a liquid moves from one place to another |\n  | **Properties** | The characteristics or features that describe something (like color or thickness) |\n  | **Volume** | The amount of space that a liquid takes up inside a container |\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  Students will:\n  - Understand that liquids are a state of matter with specific characteristics.\n  - Use vocabulary to describe what they observed (e.g., \"The honey didn't flow as fast as the water because it has different properties\").\n  - Connect their observations to the photograph and recognize engine oil as a liquid with the same properties as the liquids they tested.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding of liquid properties to a new, real-world scenario and deepen their thinking.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Design Challenge worksheet (printed, with illustrations of different containers)\n  - Assorted small containers of different shapes and sizes (cups, bottles, bowls, narrow tubes if available—or drawn options on worksheet)\n  - Access to test liquids from Explore phase (water, oil, syrup, honey)\n  - Rulers or measuring tools (optional, for measuring liquid levels)\n  - Colored pencils or markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n  Present students with a **Design Challenge:**\n\n  \"A restaurant needs to move its cooking oil from one big container to many small bottles for customers to take home. The oil needs to:\n  - Flow quickly so they don't waste time\n  - Not spill on the counter\n  - Fit exactly into the small bottles without overflowing\n\n  Your job: Choose the BEST container to pour the oil FROM. Should they use a container with a wide opening (like a big bowl) or a narrow opening (like a bottle)? Why? Test your thinking if you can, and then draw your answer.\"\n\n  **Teacher Facilitation:**\n  - Introduce the challenge with enthusiasm: \"You're helping a real restaurant solve a problem!\"\n  - Allow students to test their predictions with actual liquids if they wish (oil or water as a substitute).\n  - Ask probing questions: \"What do you predict will happen if they pour from a bowl? From a bottle with a narrow opening? Why?\"\n  - Accept predictions and guide students to see that a narrow opening gives better control, even if it flows slightly slower.\n\n  **Student Task:**\n  - Individually or in pairs, students choose a container type and draw it on the Design Challenge worksheet.\n  - Write or dictate why that container would work best using sentence stem: \"I think _______ is the best container to pour from because _______.\"\n  - Optional: Measure and record how much liquid fills the small bottles to connect to the concept of volume.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students apply properties of liquids (flow, shape-taking) to solve a practical problem.\n  - Students explain reasoning based on observations: \"A narrow opening slows down the flow, so the oil won't spill.\"\n  - Students recognize that understanding liquid properties is useful in real life.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of liquid properties and their ability to observe, describe, and explain how liquids behave.\n\n- **Formative Assessment (Ongoing Throughout Lesson):**\n  - **During Explore:** Observe student pairs as they test liquids. Note whether they can describe properties (color, thickness, flow rate) and whether they test systematically.\n  - **During Explain:** Listen to student responses during vocabulary check and share-out. Do they use vocabulary correctly? Can they connect observations to definitions?\n  - **During Elaborate:** Review Design Challenge explanations. Do students reference properties of liquids in their reasoning?\n\n- **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (10 minutes):**\n  Distribute an **Exit Ticket** (can be a printed sheet or verbal response recorded by teacher). Students respond to 2-3 of the following:\n\n  1. **Draw and Label:** \"Draw a liquid in a container. Label two properties of the liquid.\" (Success: Student draws a recognizable liquid/container and labels at least one property like color, thickness, or how it flows.)\n\n  2. **Multiple Choice:** \"Which is true about liquids?\n     - A) Liquids always stay the same shape\n     - B) Liquids take the shape of their container ✓\n     - C) Liquids don't flow\n     - D) All liquids are the same color\"\n     (Success: Student selects B.)\n\n  3. **Short Response:** \"Why does the engine oil in the picture fill the bottom of the container and not float in the middle?\" (Success: Student explains that liquids flow downward and settle at the bottom, even if phrasing is simple: \"Because it's a liquid and liquids fall to the bottom.\")\n\n  4. **Comparison:** \"Compare water and honey. How are they the same? How are they different?\" (Success: Student identifies at least one similarity [both are liquids] and one difference [honey flows slower/is thicker].)\n\n- **Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n  - ✓ Student can describe at least two properties of a liquid.\n  - ✓ Student understands that liquids take the shape of their container.\n  - ✓ Student can observe and compare how different liquids flow.\n  - ✓ Student uses vocabulary (liquid, flow, properties, container) in context.\n  - ✓ Student can apply knowledge to a real-world scenario (Design Challenge).\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students will demonstrate understanding that liquids are a state of matter with observable, testable properties.\n  - Students will be able to predict and explain liquid behavior based on observations.\n  - Students will recognize liquids in everyday contexts (engine oil, cooking oil, juice) and understand why their properties matter.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a pre-made graphic organizer with pictures of containers and simple word choices to check off (\"This liquid is: □ Thick □ Thin. It flows: □ Fast □ Slow.\") instead of requiring students to write independently.\n\n2. **Peer Pairing:** Pair students with strong communicators during the Explore phase so they can observe together. The stronger student can help record observations while both test liquids together.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart with Pictures:** Create a visual anchor chart before the lesson with drawings (not just words) for each vocabulary term. Point to and reference it repeatedly. Use the same visuals on the Exit Ticket.\n\n4. **Teacher-Led Mini-Explain:** Before Explore, do a brief whole-group demonstration pouring water into different containers and tilting one so students understand the task and expectations.\n\n#### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Predict and Test in New Scenarios:** Ask advanced students, \"If we froze one of these liquids into ice (a solid), how would it behave differently in a tilted container? Can you predict and draw what would happen?\" This introduces the concept of states of matter and how properties change.\n\n2. **Design a Liquid Sorting Activity:** Challenge students to sort the test liquids from \"fastest flow\" to \"slowest flow\" and create a visual ranking chart with labels. Ask them to predict where a new liquid (introduced late in Explore) would fit on the ranking.\n\n3. **Volume Measurement:** Provide rulers and graduated containers (or simple measurement cups). Ask advanced students to measure the depth of each liquid when poured into the same cup and compare volumes. Record data on a simple bar graph.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Sink or Float Liquid Test:** \"Not all liquids mix! Test what happens when you carefully pour oil into water, or honey into water. Do they mix or separate? Why might this matter to a restaurant or factory?\" (Connects to properties and real-world applications; can be done as homework with parent help.)\n\n2. **Liquid Timeline Activity:** Create a chart showing how different liquids are used in machines or at home (engine oil in cars, syrup in food, soap in cleaning, ketchup in cooking). Have students draw and label one liquid and explain why its properties make it useful for that job.\n\n3. **Make a Liquid Density Tower:** Layer different test liquids in a clear cup or bottle in order of thickness (heaviest on bottom). Observe which liquids sink to the bottom and which float on top. This builds understanding of why the denser liquid (syrup or honey) sinks and lighter liquids (oil, water) may separate. (Advanced extension for students ready to explore density concepts.)\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson intentionally builds on students' observations of the engine oil reservoir to make liquids concrete and relevant. The photograph serves as a real-world anchor throughout all five phases.\n- Third graders are beginning to understand properties and can observe carefully, but they need multiple exposures to vocabulary and hands-on practice. The Explore phase is the heart of the lesson; give plenty of time for investigation.\n- Safety: Ensure students do not taste or directly touch the test liquids (especially oil and syrup). Supervise cleanup carefully, and have paper towels readily available for quick spill management.\n- The Design Challenge in Elaborate is intentionally open-ended to allow creativity while reinforcing concepts. Some students may want to test their ideas; encourage this.",
