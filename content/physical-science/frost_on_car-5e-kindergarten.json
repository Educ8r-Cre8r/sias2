  "content": "# Frost and Sunlight: A Kindergarten Investigation\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n- **Heat and temperature:** Sunlight warms surfaces, and cold temperatures can cause water to freeze into frost crystals, which eventually melt when warmed by the sun\n- **The effect of sunlight on Earth's surface:** The photograph shows frost (frozen water) being melted by the rising sun, demonstrating how solar energy changes the state of water on surfaces\n- **Observation and prediction:** Students can observe the frost crystals and predict what will happen to them as the sun gets higher and warmer in the sky\n- **Properties of materials:** Frost has unique visible properties—crystalline, sparkly, cold to the touch—that change as temperature changes\n\n### Lesson Title\nMelting Frost: How Sunlight Changes Ice Crystals\n\n### Lesson Overview\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 30-minute sessions (can be split over two consecutive days if morning observation of frost is possible)\n- **NGSS Standards:** K-PS3-1 (Make observations to determine the effect of sunlight on Earth's surface); K-PS3-2 (Use tools and materials to design and build a structure that will reduce the warming effect of sunlight on an area)\n\n### Learning Objectives\nStudents will be able to:\n- **Observe and describe what frost looks like** using words such as \"sparkly,\" \"icy,\" \"cold,\" and \"white crystals\"\n- **Predict what will happen to frost** when it is warmed by sunlight\n- **Investigate how sunlight changes frost** by conducting a simple hands-on activity\n- **Design a simple structure** that keeps frost or ice from melting quickly by blocking sunlight\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-12 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about frost and activate prior knowledge about sunlight and warmth.\n- **Materials:** \n  - Photograph of frost on car (displayed on screen or printed large)\n  - One small ice cube or piece of crushed ice (for sensory exploration, optional)\n  - Blanket or small cloth\n\n- **Activity:** \n  1. Display the frost photograph large enough for all students to see clearly. Ask students to gather around and look closely.\n  2. Ask these specific discussion questions:\n     - \"What do you see in this picture? What does it look like?\" (Students should describe sparkly, white, icy crystals)\n     - \"Have you ever touched something very cold? What did it feel like?\" (Elicit descriptions like \"cold,\" \"wet,\" \"icy\")\n     - \"What is the big bright thing in the sky in this picture?\" (Guide them to identify the sun)\n     - \"What do you think will happen to these icy crystals when the sun gets warmer and warmer?\"\n  3. If available, pass around one ice cube in a sealed bag or a piece of crushed ice so students can safely feel how cold it is. Ask, \"Is this cold or warm?\"\n  4. Say: \"Today we're going to become scientists and discover what the sun does to frost and ice!\"\n- **Transition:** \"Let's do an experiment to see what sunlight can do to ice crystals, just like the frost in our picture.\"\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (18-20 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students conduct a hands-on investigation to observe the effect of sunlight (or a heat source) on ice and frost-like materials.\n- **Materials:** \n  - Small clear cups or containers (one per pair/small group)\n  - Ice cubes or crushed ice (prepared in advance)\n  - Water\n  - Paper towels\n  - Two pieces of white cloth or paper (one to shade ice, one to expose it)\n  - Warm (not hot) water in a pitcher\n  - Thermometer (optional, for older K students or teacher demonstration)\n  - Timer or classroom clock\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Setup:** Divide students into 2-3 small groups. Give each group a cup with 2-3 ice cubes and cold water.\n  2. **Part 1—Observation:** Ask students to observe the ice for 2-3 minutes. Prompt them: \"What do you see? Is the ice moving? Does it look like the frost in the picture?\"\n  3. **Part 2—Testing sunlight's effect:** Divide each group's ice cup into two sections:\n     - **Section A (Sunny side):** Place the cup or a small dish of ice in direct sunlight (real window) or under a desk lamp positioned close (teacher monitors for safety—no direct heat lamp on students).\n     - **Section B (Shaded side):** Place an identical cup of ice under a cloth or paper cover to block light/warmth.\n  4. **Part 3—Prediction:** Ask students to predict: \"Which ice do you think will melt faster—the one in the sunny spot or the one covered up?\" Record their predictions with simple drawings or tallies.\n  5. **Part 4—Observation over time:** Check both cups every 5 minutes for 15-20 minutes. Students observe and record:\n     - Does the sunny-side ice look different?\n     - Does the shaded ice look different?\n     - Which one is melting faster?\n     - Are there water droplets or puddles forming?\n  6. **Documentation:** Provide simple picture cards (sun, frost, water drops, empty) so students can place them in order to show what happened to the ice over time, or they can draw before-and-after pictures.\n\n- **Teacher Role:** \n  - Circulate among groups, asking open-ended questions: \"What do you notice? What's changing? Why do you think that happened?\"\n  - Do not tell students the answer; allow them to observe and discover.\n  - Help students notice small changes; point to water droplets or puddles forming without explaining why.\n  - Manage the heat lamp safely; ensure no student gets too close.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  - Students will observe that ice in the sunny spot melts faster than ice in the shade.\n  - Students will see water droplets or small pools forming under the sunny ice.\n  - Students will make a simple record (drawing, picture sequence, or tally) of their observation.\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (12-15 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and help students connect their discovery to the photograph and the concept of heat energy from sunlight.\n- **Materials:**\n  - Photograph of frost again (displayed)\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Picture cards with simple vocabulary (sun, heat, ice, frost, melt)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Group Share-out:** Invite 2-3 groups to share what they observed. Ask: \"What happened to your ice? Which melted faster?\"\n  2. **Connection to Frost:** Point back to the frost photograph. Say: \"The frost on this car is ice crystals, just like the ice we used in our experiment. When the sun comes up in the morning and gets warmer, it does the same thing to the frost that it did to our ice. The sunlight warms the frost, and it melts into water!\"\n  3. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (use picture cards and simple definitions):\n     - **Frost:** Tiny ice crystals that form on cold surfaces when it's very cold outside (like on the car in our picture)\n     - **Sunlight:** Energy from the sun that warms things up\n     - **Heat:** Warmth from the sun or other sources\n     - **Melt:** When ice turns into water because it gets warm\n     - **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is\n  4. **Check for Understanding:** Ask: \"What does sunlight do to ice? Yes! It warms it up and makes it melt. Can you show me with your hands how frost crystals melt into water?\" (Students mime melting.)\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Frost:** Tiny, sparkly ice crystals that form on very cold surfaces\n  - **Sunlight:** Light and warmth energy from the sun\n  - **Heat:** Warmth that comes from the sun or makes things warmer\n  - **Melt:** When something cold like ice turns into water\n  - **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  - Students understand that sunlight warms surfaces and makes ice/frost melt.\n  - Students can use the word \"melt\" in context.\n  - Students recognize the connection between their experiment and the frost in the photograph.\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-18 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a simple structure to keep ice or frost from melting quickly (blocking or reducing sunlight).\n- **Materials:**\n  - Ice cubes or crushed ice in cups (fresh, prepared just before this phase)\n  - Various materials students can use to build a shade structure:\n    - White paper\n    - Aluminum foil\n    - Cloth scraps or napkins\n    - Small paper cups or containers\n    - Tape or paper clips\n    - Popsicle sticks or straws (optional)\n  - Markers for labeling\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Problem Introduction:** \"Scientists, we have a problem! Someone left frost on their car, and the sun is coming up. The frost is melting fast! Can you build a little shade or cover that will keep the frost from melting so quickly?\"\n  2. **Challenge:** Give each pair a new cup of ice and a pile of materials. Say: \"Use these materials to build a structure that will protect the ice from sunlight. You want to keep it cold and icy as long as possible!\"\n  3. **Design and Test:** \n     - Students work together to design a simple cover or shade using the materials.\n     - They place their ice cups with their structures in sunlight (next to the window or under the lamp) for 10-15 minutes.\n     - They observe: \"Is my ice still frozen? Has it melted? How much water is there?\"\n  4. **Compare Results:** Ask: \"Whose ice stayed the coldest? Why? What material worked best?\" Elicit responses: \"White reflects light,\" \"Thick cloth blocks heat,\" \"Foil kept it cold.\"\n  5. **Real-World Connection:** \"In the winter, when it's very cold, some people cover their car windshields to keep frost and ice from forming. Your designs are like those covers!\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Encourage experimentation; let students try different materials without judgment.\n  - Ask: \"Why do you think that material is working?\" to promote thinking about properties.\n  - Celebrate all attempts and designs, not just the \"most effective\" ones.\n  - Help students recognize that materials that block or reflect light/heat are more effective.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students design a working (or partially working) shade structure.\n  - Students observe differences between protected and unprotected ice.\n  - Students begin to understand that blocking sunlight helps keep things cold.\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n- **Objective:** Assess whether students understand how sunlight affects ice/frost and can make simple observations and predictions.\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n     - During Explore: Observe whether students notice the difference between shaded and sunny ice. Check their predictions and documentation.\n     - During Explain: Listen to student responses to questions about what sunlight does. Do they use words like \"warm,\" \"melt,\" \"sunlight\"?\n     - During Elaborate: Observe whether students can design a cover and explain why it might work.\n\n  2. **Exit Ticket Activity** (5-8 minutes):\n     - Show students the frost photograph again.\n     - Ask three simple questions (verbally or with picture choices for non-readers):\n       1. \"What do you see in this picture?\" (Accept: ice, frost, sparkly crystals, cold)\n       2. \"What will happen when the sun gets warm?\" (Accept: it will melt, turn to water, disappear)\n       3. \"If you wanted to keep the frost from melting, what would you do?\" (Accept: cover it, put something on top, shade it, block the sun)\n     - Record students' responses with quick notes or pictures.\n\n  3. **Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n     - ✓ Student can observe and describe frost or ice using sensory words\n     - ✓ Student predicts that sunlight will warm and melt ice/frost\n     - ✓ Student demonstrates understanding through the Explore activity (noticing the difference between shaded and sunny ice)\n     - ✓ Student attempts to design a shade structure in Elaborate phase\n     - ✓ Student answers at least 2 of 3 exit-ticket questions correctly\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  - Most kindergarteners will be able to observe and describe frost, predict that sunlight melts it, and show understanding through hands-on exploration.\n  - Students may use a mix of scientific and everyday language (e.g., \"the sun made the ice go away\").\n  - Students will demonstrate basic understanding of cause and effect: sunlight causes warming, which causes melting.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n1. **Simplified Language and Visual Supports:** \n   - Use real-world pictures alongside vocabulary words (picture of frost, picture of sun, picture of water).\n   - Repeat key vocabulary in simple sentences: \"The sun is hot. Hot makes ice melt. Melt means turn to water.\"\n   - Allow students to respond to questions with pointing, single words, or gestures rather than full sentences.\n\n2. **Hands-On Sensory Exploration:**\n   - Let students handle ice in sealed bags repeatedly to reinforce the concept of \"cold.\"\n   - Provide extra time for observation; don't rush through the timing of ice melting.\n   - Pair struggling learners with a stronger peer during Explore and Elaborate activities.\n\n3. **Simplified Data Recording:**\n   - Instead of multiple observations over time, have students draw or place picture cards (ice → water drop → puddle) in just 2-3 time points.\n   - Provide pre-drawn templates for \"before and after\" rather than asking students to create a record from scratch.\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n1. **Extended Observation and Prediction:**\n   - Ask advanced students to predict *how long* it will take for ice to melt in sun vs. shade. Have them estimate in minutes and check a clock.\n   - Introduce the thermometer: \"Let's measure how warm the sunny spot is and how warm the shady spot is. Which is warmer?\"\n   - Prompt: \"Why do you think one spot is warmer than the other?\"\n\n2. **Application to New Scenarios:**\n   - Ask: \"If you were leaving a popsicle outside on a sunny day, where would you put it so it doesn't melt so fast?\"\n   - Extend Elaborate: Have students predict which of their shade materials will work best *before* testing, and discuss why.\n   - Ask students to design a shade structure with specific requirements (e.g., \"It must let you see the ice inside, but still keep it cold\").\n\n3. **Vocabulary Expansion:**\n   - Introduce terms like \"reflect\" and \"absorb\" informally: \"Light colors bounce light away (reflect). Dark colors soak up light (absorb). Which keeps ice colder?\"\n   - Have advanced students teach a peer or explain their design to the class using more complete sentences.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frost Hunt Outdoors (if weather permits):**\n   - On a cold morning, take students outside to look for frost on grass, leaves, or cars.\n   - Ask them to observe and describe the frost they find: Is it sparkly? Is it in sunny spots or shady spots? \n   - Predict: \"What will happen to this frost as the sun gets higher?\" Return to the same spot later and observe whether it has melted.\n   - This makes the lesson \"real\" and memorable.\n\n2. **Ice Melting Race:**\n   - Set up an indoor relay game where pairs race to see whose ice (with different protective materials) melts the slowest.\n   - This reinforces the concept while adding a playful, competitive element.\n   - Discuss why some materials \"won\" and others didn't.\n\n3. **Sunlight and Shadows Exploration:**\n   - Extend to exploring how shadows block sunlight.\n   - On a sunny day, have students use their bodies or objects to create shadows on paper or grass.\n   - Ask: \"What's warmer—the sunny spot or the shadow? Why?\" (This connects K-PS3-1 directly.)\n   - Tie back to the frost: \"Frost in the shade stays frozen longer because shadows block the warm sunlight, just like in our game!\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- If you cannot access real frost (warm climate), you can fully substitute with ice cubes in the Explore phase—the physics is identical, and students still learn that sunlight warms surfaces and causes melting.\n- For maximum engagement, try to show the frost photograph in the morning when students may have just arrived and frost is still visible outside. Point to the windows: \"Look! That's what we're investigating today!\"\n- Keep the lesson energetic and observation-focused; kindergarteners learn best through play and discovery, not lectures.",
