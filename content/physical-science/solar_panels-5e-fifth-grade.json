Explain that solar panels convert light energy from the sun into electrical energy that can be used to power buildings and devices.\n2. Identify and describe properties of materials that make them useful for capturing or blocking sunlight.\n3. Use a model or diagram to trace the path of energy from the sun through a solar panel to electrical use.\n4. Support an argument that energy from food comes from the sun, understanding the connection between solar energy, plant growth, and food chains.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how solar panels work and activate prior knowledge about energy and sunlight.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the rooftop with solar panels (displayed on projector, smartboard, or printed copies)\n- Optional: a small handheld solar panel or solar-powered device (e.g., solar calculator, solar light)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently and ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking. Have them turn to a partner and describe what they see in detail.\n\n2. **Facilitate a whole-group observation discussion** using these prompts:\n   - \"What do you notice on top of this building? What do these blue rectangular objects look like?\"\n   - \"Why do you think someone would put these panels on a roof? What might they be doing up there?\"\n   - \"The sun is shining in this photo. How do you think sunlight could be useful?\"\n   - \"In your home or school, where does the electricity come from? Could it come from the sun?\"\n\n3. **Show a small solar-powered device** (if available) and activate it in sunlight. Ask: \"How is this device working without being plugged into a wall? Where is its power coming from?\"\n\n4. **Launch the wonder prompt:** \"Today, we're going to discover how those blue panels on the roof capture energy from the sun and turn it into electricity that powers lights, computers, and refrigerators!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an investigation where you'll observe materials and test which ones respond to sunlight, just like solar panels do.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how different materials interact with light and heat from sunlight, building understanding of material properties related to energy capture.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 5-6 different material samples: black paper, white paper, aluminum foil, clear plastic sheet, dark cloth, reflective material (mirror or reflective tape)\n- Thermometers (at least 3-4)\n- Sunny windowsill or area with direct sunlight (OR a heat lamp as alternative)\n- Recording sheets (printed or digital)\n- Stopwatch or clock\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into small groups** (3-4 students per group).\n\n2. **Explain the investigation:** \"We're going to test different materials to see how they respond to sunlight. Solar panels are made of special materials that capture light energy. Let's discover which materials get hottest when exposed to sunlight and why.\"\n\n3. **Distribute to each group:**\n   - One material sample\n   - One thermometer\n   - A recording sheet with columns for: Material Name, Temperature at Start (°C), Temperature After 5 Minutes (°C), Temperature After 10 Minutes (°C), Observations\n\n4. **Step-by-step student directions:**\n   - Place your thermometer on top of your material sample.\n   - Record the starting temperature.\n   - Place the material in direct sunlight (or under the heat lamp).\n   - Record the temperature every 5 minutes for 10 minutes.\n   - Observe: Does the material feel warm? Does it seem to absorb or reflect the light?\n   - Draw or describe what you notice about how the light interacts with your material.\n\n5. **Rotation option (if limited sunlight access):** Have groups rotate through stations, each testing one material for 10 minutes, then recording data and moving to the next station.\n\n6. **Connection to the photograph:** Point out: \"Just like we're testing how materials respond to heat and light, solar panels are made of special materials that capture sunlight and convert it. Your thermometer shows temperature change—solar panels change light into electricity!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What's happening to the temperature? Which material is heating up the most? Why do you think that material is absorbing more energy?\"\n- Avoid explaining the results; let students observe and wonder.\n- Ensure thermometers are placed correctly on the materials.\n- Manage time so all groups complete measurements within the 20-25 minute window.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will observe that dark materials (black paper, dark cloth) heat up more than light materials (white paper, aluminum foil).\n- Students will record temperature data showing the change over time.\n- Students will describe observations about which materials seem to absorb sunlight versus reflect it.\n- Students will begin inferring connections between material properties and energy absorption.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain how solar panels use material properties to capture light energy and convert it to electrical energy.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Colored markers\n- Diagram of a solar panel (simple cross-section showing light hitting the surface and electricity being produced; can be hand-drawn or printed)\n- The original photograph of solar panels\n- Optional: short animated video (2-3 minutes) on how solar panels work (many free options on YouTube; search \"how do solar panels work for kids\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask representatives from each group to report their findings:\n   - \"Which material got the hottest?\"\n   - \"Which material stayed the coolest?\"\n   - \"What does this tell us about how materials respond to sunlight?\"\n\n2. **Create a class data summary** on the board showing all materials ranked by temperature change. Ask: \"Why do you think dark, absorbing materials got hotter than shiny, reflective materials?\"\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** (write each on chart paper with a student-friendly definition):\n\n   - **Solar Panel:** A flat device made of special materials that captures light energy from the sun and converts it into electrical energy.\n   - **Light Energy:** Energy that travels from the sun in the form of light waves. We can see light energy and feel warmth from it.\n   - **Electrical Energy:** Energy that flows through wires and powers devices like lights, refrigerators, and computers.\n   - **Energy Conversion (or Energy Transformation):** When energy changes from one form into another (for example, light energy becoming electrical energy).\n   - **Semiconductor:** A special material in solar panels that has just the right properties to capture sunlight and create electricity. (Note: Silicon is the most common semiconductor used in solar panels.)\n\n4. **Explain solar panel function** using the diagram:\n   - \"Solar panels are made of materials—especially a material called silicon—that have special properties. When sunlight hits the silicon in a solar panel, the light energy is absorbed. The silicon converts that light energy into electrical energy.\"\n   - Point to the photograph: \"See these blue panels on the roof? Each panel is made of many small units, and when sunlight hits them, they're constantly converting light into electricity. That electricity travels down into the building to power lights and appliances.\"\n   - \"The sun's energy is so powerful that it can travel 93 million miles through space and still power a whole city full of buildings!\"\n\n5. **Connect to food and living things:**\n   - \"We learned that solar panels capture energy from the sun. But did you know that living things also get energy from the sun? Plants capture sunlight and use it to grow. When we eat plants—or when we eat animals that ate plants—we're eating food that got its energy from the sun. So the sun powers both technology (like solar panels) and life!\"\n\n6. **Check for understanding strategy:** \n   - Ask individual students: \"Can you point to a solar panel in the photo and explain what's happening there in your own words?\"\n   - Use a quick thumbs up/middle/down: \"Do you understand how light energy becomes electrical energy in a solar panel?\"\n   - Exit slip preview: \"Tonight, I'm going to ask you to explain one way solar panels are useful.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Solar Panel** | A flat device made of special materials that captures sunlight and turns it into electricity. |\n| **Light Energy** | Energy that comes from the sun in the form of light. We can see it and feel warmth from it. |\n| **Electrical Energy** | Energy that flows through wires and powers things like lights, fans, and computers. |\n| **Energy Conversion** | When energy changes from one type into another, like when sunlight becomes electricity. |\n| **Semiconductor** | A special material (like silicon) that captures sunlight and helps create electricity. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can define and use the five key vocabulary terms correctly.\n- Students can explain the basic process: sunlight → solar panel → electricity.\n- Students can identify that solar panels work because of the special properties of the materials they're made from.\n- Students can connect solar energy to how plants and animals get energy from the sun.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by solving a real-world energy problem using solar energy concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Solar Design Challenge\" worksheet or card (printed or projected)\n- Colored pencils, markers\n- Rulers\n- Index cards or poster paper\n- Optional: images of different solar panel installations (on buildings, in fields, on vehicles, etc.)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Challenge:** Present this real-world problem:\n\n*\"Your town is building a new community center. The architects want to install solar panels to power the building. They need to decide: Where should they put the solar panels? On the roof? On the ground in a field? On the south side of the building? On the west side? Help them make the best choice!\"*\n\n**Student Task:**\n\n1. **Working in pairs or small groups,** students must:\n   - Choose the BEST location for solar panels on or around the community center building.\n   - Explain WHY that location is best, using what they learned about sunlight, material properties, and energy capture.\n   - Draw a diagram showing their recommended solar panel placement.\n\n2. **Guiding questions to frame their thinking:**\n   - \"Remember our thermometer experiment—which materials absorbed the most sunlight?\"\n   - \"The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Which side of a building gets the most sunlight throughout the day?\"\n   - \"What time of year is the sun highest in the sky? What does that tell us about where panels should be angled?\"\n   - \"What if something blocks the sunlight—like trees or other buildings? How would that change your choice?\"\n\n3. **Students should include on their diagram:**\n   - The building outline\n   - Where they placed the panels (roof, ground, specific wall)\n   - At least 2 reasons why their location is best\n   - Arrows or labels showing how sunlight hits the panels\n\n4. **Optional extension:** Show images of real solar installations (rooftop arrays, solar farms, solar vehicles) and ask: \"Why did they choose to put solar panels there? What can you observe from these photos?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"Why did you choose that location?\" \"How does your answer connect to the thermometer experiment?\" \"What do you know about how the sun moves?\"\n- Guide groups that are stuck by asking: \"Which direction does the most sunlight come from in our location?\" or \"What did we learn about dark vs. light materials?\"\n- Ensure students are justifying their choices with scientific reasoning, not just guessing.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students identify the roof or south-facing wall as optimal (depending on latitude).\n- Students explain that southern exposure receives the most consistent sunlight throughout the day.\n- Students apply knowledge of material properties and energy absorption to justify their design.\n- Students create a labeled diagram showing their solar panel placement.\n- Students articulate the connection between their observations and their design decisions.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of solar energy conversion and the ability to apply concepts to new situations.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observation notes during Explore phase: Are students recording accurate data? Are they noticing patterns?\n- Questions during Explain phase: Can students use vocabulary correctly? Can they trace energy conversion?\n- Observations during Elaborate phase: Are students justifying their design choices with scientific reasoning?\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket containing 2-3 questions:\n\n**Option A (Multiple Choice + Short Answer):**\n\n1. **What does a solar panel do?**\n   - A) It makes the sun brighter\n   - B) It converts light energy from the sun into electrical energy\n   - C) It stores heat for winter\n   - D) It cools buildings down\n   - *(Correct answer: B)*\n\n2. **In our experiment, which material got the hottest when placed in sunlight? Why do you think that happened?** (Students write 2-3 sentences)\n\n3. **How is the energy from the sun in a solar panel similar to the energy from the sun in the food we eat?** (Students write 2-3 sentences connecting solar panels to food chains)\n\n**Option B (Diagram with Labels):**\n\nProvide a simple unlabeled diagram of a solar panel (cross-section) and ask students to:\n- Label the sunlight entering the panel\n- Label where the light energy is converted to electrical energy\n- Draw an arrow showing where the electricity goes\n- Write one sentence explaining the process\n\n**Option C (Explanation Prompt):**\n\n\"Imagine you're talking to someone who has never seen a solar panel. Explain to them what a solar panel does and why the sun is important for making it work. Use at least two vocabulary words from our lesson.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Student correctly explains that solar panels convert light energy to electrical energy.\n\n✓ Student accurately identifies or describes material properties that make solar panels effective.\n\n✓ Student connects solar energy to the sun as a power source.\n\n✓ Student applies their understanding to a new scenario (such as the design challenge or explaining to someone unfamiliar with solar technology).\n\n✓ Student uses at least 2-3 vocabulary terms correctly (solar panel, light energy, electrical energy, energy conversion, semiconductor).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most students (80%+) can identify the basic function of a solar panel.\n- Most students can explain why dark, light-absorbing materials are more effective than reflective materials.\n- Most students can connect solar energy to both technology and living things.\n- Advanced students can explain why location and angle matter for solar panel efficiency.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards:** Provide small reference cards with pictures and simple definitions of the five key vocabulary terms. Students can keep these visible during activities and exit ticket completion.\n\n2. **Guided data recording in Explore:** Pre-draw the table on the worksheet with time intervals already filled in. Students only need to write in the temperature readings and one observation. Pair with a buddy who records while the struggling student takes measurements.\n\n3. **Scaffolded exit ticket:** Provide multiple-choice answers for the exit ticket instead of open-ended questions. For the diagram prompt, provide a partially labeled diagram and ask them to complete it. Reduce the number of sentences required in written explanations (e.g., 1-2 sentences instead of 3).\n\n4. **Visual anchor chart:** Create and display a large poster showing the energy conversion process with pictures: Sun → Light → Solar Panel → Electricity → Light Bulb. Point to this chart when answering questions.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate efficiency:** Ask advanced students to calculate the percentage increase in temperature for each material group during the Explore phase. \"Which material was most efficient at absorbing energy? Create a bar graph ranking all the materials by efficiency.\"\n\n2. **Research real-world applications:** Have advanced students research and present on one additional use of solar energy (solar water heaters, solar vehicles, solar cooking, etc.). They should explain why solar panels are a good choice for that application and what challenges solar technology faces.\n\n3. **Design optimization challenge:** In the Elaborate phase, ask advanced students to consider not just location but also angle and orientation. \"The sun's angle changes with the seasons. How should solar panels be angled in our location to capture the most energy year-round?\" They can research the concept of a solar tracker.\n\n4. **Energy calculation:** Provide data on how much electricity a typical residential solar panel produces (e.g., 300 watts in direct sunlight). Ask: \"If a home uses 10,000 kilowatt-hours per year, how many solar panels would it need?\" (This is advanced math, so provide scaffolding.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Build a Solar Oven:** Students design and construct a simple solar oven using a pizza box, plastic wrap, aluminum foil, and black paper. They use it to cook s'mores or heat water, experiencing energy conversion firsthand. This reinforces that solar energy produces heat as well as electricity. (Time: 2 sessions, 60-90 minutes)\n\n2. **Track the Sun's Path:** Over the course of a week, students measure and record the length and direction of shadows cast by a stick or pole at the same time each day. They create a diagram showing the sun's path and discuss how this affects solar panel placement. Connects to 5-ESS1-2 (shadow patterns). (Time: ongoing observation + 30-minute analysis session)\n\n3. **Interview a Local Solar Installer or Engineer:** Arrange a virtual or in-person visit from someone in the solar industry. Students prepare questions about how solar panels are designed, installed, maintained, and how efficient they are. This connects abstract learning to real careers and community. (Time: 30-45 minutes)\n\n4. **Create an Energy Flow Diagram:** Students make a large poster or digital diagram showing how energy from the sun flows through a solar panel, into a home, powers appliances, and is used for heat, light, and motion. Then they extend the diagram to show how the sun's energy also flows through plants and animals (food chains), connecting 5-PS3-1 to biology. (Time: 45-60 minutes)\n\n5. **Compare Energy Sources:** Students research and create a comparison chart or Venn diagram showing solar energy vs. fossil fuel energy (coal, natural gas, oil). They discuss which is better for the environment and which is more practical in different climates. (Time: 45-60 minutes, can be homework)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety Reminder:** If using a heat lamp instead of direct sunlight, ensure students do not touch the lamp or place hands too close. Heat lamps get very hot.\n- **Sunny day dependence:** Ideally conduct the Explore phase on a sunny day. If not possible, use a heat lamp placed 6-8 inches above materials, or conduct on a window sill with indirect sunlight (results will be less dramatic but still visible).\n- **Real-world connection:** Many schools now have solar panels. If your school does, take students outside to observe them and discuss their purpose. If not, invite a local expert or show drone/aerial footage of solar installations.\n- **Prerequisite knowledge:** Students should have basic familiarity with energy, heat, and light from prior K-4 instruction. This lesson assumes they understand that sunlight provides warmth.\n- **NGSS alignment note:** This lesson strongly addresses 5-PS3-1 (energy from the sun) and 5-PS1-3 (material properties). It touches on 5-PS2-1 (gravitational force) only indirectly and is not the primary focus.",
