They formed when water dripped and froze repeatedly during cold weather.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image shows the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of **ice formation and phase changes**. Icicles form when liquid water from melting snow or ice drips from a surface and freezes before hitting the ground. This happens because the air temperature is below 32°F (0°C), causing the water molecules to slow down and arrange themselves into a solid crystal structure. The repeated cycle of dripping and freezing creates the characteristic pointed shape as each new drop adds another layer of ice.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **States of Matter and Phase Changes**: Water exists in three states (solid, liquid, gas) and can change between them when energy is added or removed through heating or cooling.\n\n2. **Freezing Point**: Water freezes at 32°F (0°C) when thermal energy is removed, causing water molecules to move slower and form organized crystal structures.\n\n3. **Heat Transfer**: Heat moves from warmer objects to cooler objects, which explains why liquid water loses heat to the cold air and freezes into solid ice.\n\n4. **Particle Behavior**: In solids like ice, particles are tightly packed and vibrate in place, while in liquids like water, particles move more freely and can flow.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use hands-on demonstrations with ice cubes melting and refreezing to help students visualize molecular movement during phase changes. This concrete experience helps bridge abstract concepts.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways to represent particle movement through drawings, physical movements, and digital simulations to support different learning styles and abilities.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In**: At the molecular level, water molecules (H₂O) slow down and form hexagonal crystal structures when they freeze. The molecules arrange in an organized pattern that makes ice less dense than liquid water.\n\n2. **Zoom Out**: This connects to Earth's water cycle, where water constantly changes states as it moves between oceans, atmosphere, and land. Icicles represent one small part of this massive global system of water movement and energy transfer.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: \"Ice is colder than water.\" **Reality**: Ice and water can be the same temperature (32°F) during the freezing process; the difference is in the arrangement of molecules, not temperature.\n\n2. **Misconception**: \"Icicles form because it's snowing.\" **Reality**: Icicles form from liquid water that drips and freezes, often during sunny winter days when snow melts but air temperature stays below freezing.\n\n3. **Misconception**: \"All water freezes the same way.\" **Reality**: Pure water freezes differently than water with dissolved substances (like salt), which lowers the freezing point.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation**: 5-PS1-3 - Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: \n  - [[NGSS:DCI:5-PS1.A]] - Matter of any type can be subdivided into particles that are too small to see\n  - [[NGSS:DCI:2-PS1.A]] - Different kinds of matter exist and many of them can be either solid or liquid\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: \n  - [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns can be used as evidence to support an explanation\n  - [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]] - Matter is transported into, out of, and within systems\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What conditions are necessary for icicles to form, and why don't they form in summer? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n2. How would the shape of icicles change if the temperature was much colder or warmer? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n3. What evidence can you observe in the photo that shows water changed from liquid to solid? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n4. Why do you think some icicles in the photo are thicker than others? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Freezing Point:** The temperature at which a liquid changes into a solid.\n* **Phase Change:** When matter changes from one state (solid, liquid, gas) to another state.\n* **Crystal Structure:** The organized, repeating pattern that particles form in a solid.\n* **Thermal Energy:** The energy that comes from heat and causes particles to move.\n* **Molecule:** The smallest unit of a substance that still has all the properties of that substance.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *The Magic School Bus: Wet All Over* by Joanna Cole\n- *Water Is Water* by Miranda Paul\n- *Ice Is Nice!* by Robin Nelson\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- \"States of Matter for Kids\" - Simple explanation of solids, liquids, and gases with animations (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkwGOGBOaWs)\n- \"How Do Icicles Form?\" by SciShow Kids - Kid-friendly explanation of icicle formation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBjLW5_dGAM)",
