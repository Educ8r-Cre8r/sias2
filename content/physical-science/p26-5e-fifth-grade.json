Explain why a heavy steel ship can float on water using the concept of balanced forces.\n2. Describe how the shape and design of an object affect whether it sinks or floats.\n3. Identify properties of materials (such as density and water displacement) that influence buoyancy.\n4. Support a claim about floating and sinking using evidence from hands-on investigations.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by puzzling over why a massive steel ship doesn't sink.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, clear image of the photograph (printed 8.5\" × 11\" or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Marker\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph prominently.** Show it without context for 10-15 seconds and ask students to observe silently.\n\n2. **Pose the Hook Question:**\n   > \"What do you notice about this ship? Is it made of a light material or a heavy material?\"\n\n3. **Ask Curiosity-Sparking Questions:**\n   - \"This ship is made mostly of steel. Steel is very heavy, right? So why doesn't it sink to the bottom of the ocean?\"\n   - \"If I gave you a steel ball the size of a marble, would it float or sink?\"\n   - \"What's different about the marble and this giant ship?\"\n   - \"What do you think the ship's hull (the bottom part touching the water) looks like? Is it flat? Does it have a special shape?\"\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:**\n   > \"Turn to a partner and make a prediction: If we could take this ship apart and squish all the steel into a solid ball, what would happen to that ball in the water? Why do you think so?\"\n\n5. **Record student ideas** on chart paper without judgment. This becomes the class hypothesis to test.\n\n**Transition:** \n\"Today, we're going to become ship designers and discover the secret that keeps these giants floating.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the relationship between object shape, density, and buoyancy through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- One 100g ball of modeling clay (or plasticine)\n- One large container (9\" × 13\" rectangular plastic tub or similar, at least 4\" deep)\n- Water to fill container (approximately 3-4 liters per group)\n- Paper towels\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring displacement)\n- Small objects to test: pebbles, foam pieces, wooden blocks, metal washers\n- Observation recording sheet (provided below)\n- Aprons or old shirts to protect clothing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Sink Test (5 minutes)**\n- Distribute one ball of clay to each group.\n- Ask: \"Predict: Will this clay sink or float? Why?\"\n- Have students place the clay ball into the water-filled container and observe.\n- **Record:** \"What happened to the clay ball? Did it sink or float?\"\n\n**Step 2: Ship Design Challenge (15 minutes)**\n- Say: \"The clay sank because it was shaped like a solid ball. Now you're ship designers. Can you reshape this same clay so it FLOATS? You can't take any clay away—you only get to change the shape.\"\n- **Students reshape the clay** into a flat platform, bowl, or boat-like shape and place it gently on the water.\n- **Observe and Record:**\n  - \"Did your clay float this time? What shape did you make?\"\n  - \"How much of the shape is touching the water?\"\n  - \"What do you think is holding it up?\"\n\n**Step 3: Exploration & Testing (optional, time permitting)**\n- Provide additional small objects (pebbles, foam, metal washers, wood blocks) and ask: \"Which of these objects float? Which sink? What do you notice about the materials that float versus sink?\"\n- Students test and sort objects into two groups.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions rather than giving answers: *\"What changed when you reshaped the clay?\" \"Is gravity still pulling down on it?\" \"What's pushing up against the clay?\"*\n- Do NOT tell students about displacement or density yet—let them observe and wonder.\n- Prompt students to think about what holds objects up in water: *\"The water is pushing up. Is that force strong enough?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that the same material (clay) can float or sink depending on its shape.\n- Students observe that spreading weight over a larger area allows floating.\n- Students recognize that shape and design matter.\n- Recording sheets show clear before-and-after observations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts, connecting exploration to the photograph and real-world application.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary definitions (pre-written)\n- The photograph of the ship (displayed again)\n- Student recording sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: Simple diagram showing forces (arrows pointing down for gravity, arrows pointing up for water pressure)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Group Share-Out (5 minutes)**\n- Ask 2-3 groups to share: \"How did you make your clay float? What did you change?\"\n- Listen for and reinforce student language about shape, spreading out, and pushing up.\n\n**Step 2: Introduce Key Vocabulary (5 minutes)**\n- Write each term on chart paper and post visibly for remainder of lesson:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Gravity** | A pulling force that pulls everything down toward Earth. The heavier something is, the stronger the downward pull. |\n| **Buoyancy** | An upward pushing force from water (or other liquids) that pushes up against objects placed in it. |\n| **Density** | How tightly packed the material is. Heavy, tightly packed materials sink; materials that are lighter or spread out can float. |\n| **Water Displacement** | When an object sits in water, it pushes the water out of the way. The water pushes back up, helping to hold the object up. |\n| **Hull** | The bottom part of a ship that touches the water. Its shape is special to help the ship float and move. |\n\n**Step 3: Connect to the Photograph (5 minutes)**\n- Display the ship photograph again.\n- Ask: \"The ship is made of steel, which is heavy. Why doesn't it sink? Use the words 'gravity,' 'buoyancy,' and 'shape' in your answer.\"\n- Guide discussion: *\"Gravity pulls the ship down. The water pushes up (buoyancy) with a force just as strong. Because the ship's hull is designed with a special shape—wide and flat—it spreads its weight over a big area. The water can hold it up.\"*\n- Compare to the clay: *\"Just like the clay ball sank but the clay boat floated, this steel ship floats because of its shape.\"*\n\n**Step 4: Check for Understanding (5 minutes)**\n- Ask students to turn to a partner and explain in their own words: \"Why is buoyancy important for a ship?\"\n- Use a quick thumbs check: \"Thumbs up if you can explain why a heavy ship floats. Thumbs sideways if you're still thinking about it. Thumbs down if you need more help.\"\n- Address any misconceptions immediately: \"I heard someone say the water holds the ship up. That's right! The water pushes UP with a force called buoyancy.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use correct vocabulary (gravity, buoyancy, density, hull) in explanations.\n- Students understand that shape and design affect floating/sinking.\n- Students recognize that two opposing forces—gravity pulling down and buoyancy pushing up—must be balanced for something to float.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply the concept of buoyancy and force balance to a new scenario—designing their own cargo ship that can carry weight.\n\n**Materials (per group):**\n- One fresh piece of modeling clay (100g per group)\n- One deep container (same as Explore phase)\n- Water\n- Small objects to use as \"cargo\": washers, pebbles, or plastic counting bears (lightweight objects, ~20-30g total per group)\n- Recording sheet: \"My Ship Design\"\n- Ruler (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge Prompt:**\n> \"Your group is a ship design company. A client needs a cargo ship that can carry heavy goods across the ocean. Design a ship out of clay that:\n> 1. Floats on water\n> 2. Can carry the most cargo (objects) without sinking\n> 3. Has a special hull design that keeps the cargo dry and safe.\"\n\n**Step 1: Design & Build (7-8 minutes)**\n- Students reshape their clay to create a cargo ship with:\n  - A wide, stable base (hull) that displaces water effectively\n  - Walls or sides that keep cargo from falling off\n  - Optional: a deck or platform to hold cargo\n- Ask: *\"Why are you making it this shape? How will the water help hold up your cargo?\"*\n\n**Step 2: Test the Cargo (5-7 minutes)**\n- Students carefully place their ship in water.\n- One at a time, they add cargo objects to their ship while it floats.\n- **Record:** \n  - \"How many pieces of cargo did your ship hold before it sank?\"\n  - \"Why do you think it held that much?\"\n  - \"What part of your design helped it float with cargo?\"\n\n**Step 3: Compare & Discuss (3 minutes)**\n- Compare results across groups: \"Whose ship carried the most cargo? Why was theirs successful?\"\n- Guide reflection: *\"Ships that spread their weight over a larger area and have a deeper hull can carry more. The more water they displace, the stronger the buoyancy force.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Celebrate design choices: \"I notice you made the walls really tall—that helped keep the cargo from tipping off.\"\n- Prompt deeper thinking: *\"If you added even more cargo, what would happen? Why?\"*\n- Connect to the photograph: \"Real cargo ships are designed exactly like this—with a special shape to carry heavy loads without sinking.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply the concept of buoyancy to solve a design problem.\n- Students understand that hull design directly impacts how much weight a ship can carry.\n- Student ships hold measurable amounts of cargo, demonstrating practical application of force balance.\n- Students explain their design choices using vocabulary from the Explain phase.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of buoyancy, gravity, and how forces interact to keep ships floating.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage predictions.\n- Monitor group work during Explore: Are students reshaping the clay and testing predictions?\n- Listen for use of vocabulary during group share-outs in Explain phase.\n- Observe design choices in Elaborate phase: Do students intentionally create wider hulls or deeper designs?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nProvide each student with a printed exit ticket (3-4 questions). Students complete individually and turn in before leaving.\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Vocabulary Application:**\n   > A marble made of steel sinks in water, but a steel ship floats. Use the word \"buoyancy\" in a sentence to explain why.\n   \n   *(Expected answer: Something like, \"Buoyancy pushes up on the ship, holding it up. It doesn't push up on the marble as much because the marble is small.\")*\n\n2. **Conceptual Understanding:**\n   > Look at this diagram [show simple drawing of ship with arrows: one pointing down labeled \"gravity,\" one pointing up labeled \"buoyancy\"]. Are the forces balanced? How do you know?\n   \n   *(Expected answer: \"Yes, because the ship is floating, not sinking.\")*\n\n3. **Application:**\n   > If a ship is carrying too much cargo and sinks deeper into the water, is the buoyancy force getting stronger or weaker? Explain.\n   \n   *(Expected answer: \"Stronger, because more of the ship is in the water, so more water is pushing up.\")*\n\n4. **Claim & Evidence:**\n   > Make a claim: Can you make a heavy object float? Support your claim with evidence from today's activities.\n   \n   *(Expected answer: \"Yes. I reshaped clay into a boat and it floated. The shape matters—spreading the weight helps.\")*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly uses vocabulary (buoyancy, gravity, force, density, hull, displacement).\n- ✓ Student explains that shape and design affect floating/sinking.\n- ✓ Student recognizes that balanced forces keep objects floating.\n- ✓ Student supports claims with evidence from hands-on activities.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show students can apply vocabulary to new scenarios.\n- Students articulate the connection between object shape and buoyancy.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that forces must be balanced for floating.\n- Responses show reasoning based on observations from the lesson.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Sentence Frames for Explanations:**\n   - Provide sentence starters: *\"The ship floats because gravity pulls _____ and buoyancy pushes _____.\" / \"The shape of the hull helps because _____.\"*\n   - Allow students to point to vocabulary posters and use them to construct responses.\n\n2. **Structured Exploration:**\n   - Pair struggling students with stronger peers during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n   - Give explicit step-by-step directions for clay reshaping: *\"First, make it flat like a plate. Now gently curve up the edges.\"*\n   - Use a pre-made clay boat shape as a model they can try to match.\n\n3. **Simplified Exit Ticket:**\n   - Offer a multiple-choice version of exit ticket questions.\n   - Allow verbal response to teacher or peer instead of written.\n   - Focus on questions 1 & 2 only (simpler than 3 & 4).\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deeper Design Problem:**\n   - Challenge: *\"Design a ship that can carry cargo AND push through water quickly. What shape do you need? Why?\"*\n   - Research task: \"Look up pictures of real cargo ships and speedboats. Why do they have different shapes?\"\n\n2. **Quantitative Exploration:**\n   - Have advanced students measure and record the depth of water displacement with and without cargo using a ruler.\n   - Ask them to predict: *\"If I add twice as much cargo, how much deeper will the ship sink?\"*\n   - Compare predictions to actual results and discuss why estimates were accurate or inaccurate.\n\n3. **Real-World Application Research:**\n   - Assign students to research: \"How do engineers decide how much cargo a real ship can safely carry?\" or \"What happens if a ship is overloaded?\"\n   - Have them create a one-page infographic explaining their findings.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Titanic & Ship Safety Investigation (Homework or Follow-Up Lesson):**\n   - Read a simplified account of the Titanic's sinking.\n   - Ask: \"If the Titanic had a different hull design or if it was carrying less cargo, could it have floated? Why or why not?\"\n   - Discuss how modern ships use technology (hull designs, lifeboats, monitoring systems) to stay safe.\n\n2. **Design Challenge: Bridge Over Troubled Water (STEM Integration):**\n   - Challenge students to design a floating bridge made of clay and craft materials that can support the weight of a toy car crossing it.\n   - Apply buoyancy and force concepts to a new context.\n   - Test and iterate designs based on whether they support the car's weight.\n\n3. **Hands-On Density Exploration (Follow-Up Lesson):**\n   - Use the clay boats to introduce density more formally: *\"Clay is denser than water, but when spread out in a boat shape, there's air inside. Air is less dense than water, which helps it float.\"*\n   - Provide foam, wood, and other materials with different densities.\n   - Ask students to predict and test which materials float, then explain based on density.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety Reminders:** Ensure aprons/old clothes are worn. Supervise water use closely. Have towels available for spills. No drinking water used in this experiment.\n- **Preparation:** Pre-fill all containers with water before students begin. Have clay ready in bags for quick distribution.\n- **Timing Flexibility:** If students are deeply engaged in Elaborate, it's okay to extend that phase by 5-10 minutes and shorten Explain slightly.\n- **Real-World Connection:** Show photographs or brief video clips (1-2 minutes) of actual cargo ships being loaded or unloaded to reinforce that this is not just a classroom activity—it's real engineering.\n- **Vocabulary Wall:** Keep vocabulary posters on the wall for the rest of the unit so students can reference these concepts in future lessons about waves, energy, or other forces topics.",
