Light bounces off the frozen water crystals, making them visible and shiny.\n- **States of Matter and Temperature:** Water changes from liquid to solid (ice/frost) when it gets very cold. The frost coating on the car shows water in its frozen solid form.\n- **How Objects Are Seen:** Objects like frost can only be seen when light hits them and bounces into our eyes. In darkness, even frost would not be visible; sunlight illuminates it.\n- **Observable Properties of Materials:** Frost has observable properties—it is white, sparkly, cold, and covers surfaces. Students can describe what they observe using their senses (sight, touch).\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Frosty Sparkles: When Sunlight Finds Ice**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 60–75 minutes (one extended session or two 35–40 minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 1-PS4-2: Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that objects in darkness can be seen only when illuminated.\n  - 1-PS4-3: Plan and conduct investigations to determine the effect of placing objects made with different materials in the path of a beam of light.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Make observations** of how frost and ice become visible when light shines on them.\n2. **Explain** that objects need light to be seen, using the frost photograph as evidence.\n3. **Investigate** how different materials (clear, shiny, dark) change the way light shines through or bounces off them.\n4. **Demonstrate** understanding that light helps us see things by testing objects in a dark space and with light.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by examining the frost photograph and activating curiosity about why frost sparkles in the sun.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of frost on car (projected on screen or printed large)\n- Flashlight or lamp (for later reference; can be held but not used yet)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph.** Project the frosty car image on a screen or show a large printed copy. Ask students to sit where they can see it clearly.\n\n2. **Prompt observation with wonder:** Say: \"Look closely at this picture. What do you see? Tell me what makes this look so pretty and sparkly.\"\n\n3. **Ask these guiding questions:**\n   - \"What is that white, sparkly stuff on the car? Have you seen it before?\" (Allow students to share experiences with frost or ice.)\n   - \"Why does the frost look so shiny and bright? What makes it sparkle?\"\n   - \"Do you think the frost would look the same at night when it's dark? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What is making the frost visible in this picture?\" (Guide them to notice the sun in the background.)\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen to this frost if there was no sunlight. Would we still be able to see all those sparkles? Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to do some investigations with light and different materials to understand why we can see things like frost when light shines on them, and why things disappear when it's dark.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate whether objects can be seen in darkness and with light, using hands-on exploration with real materials.\n\n**Materials (per student pair or small group):**\n- Shallow box or container with a lid (or a closed closet/dark corner)\n- Flashlight or small lamp\n- Various objects to test: ice cubes or frozen water in a container, aluminum foil, dark fabric, clear plastic wrap, a shiny spoon\n- Notebook or paper for recording observations\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up the dark space.** Before the lesson or at the start of Explore, prepare a dark area—this could be a large box with a lid, a closet with the lights off, or a space covered with a dark blanket.\n\n2. **Divide students into small groups (2–3 students per group).** Each group will take a turn.\n\n3. **First investigation: Objects in darkness.**\n   - Explain: \"We're going to put some objects in a dark space and see if we can see them.\"\n   - Have one student place the object (e.g., an ice cube or aluminum foil) inside the dark space.\n   - Ask: \"Can you see it? What do you observe?\" (Students should report that they cannot see the object clearly, if at all.)\n   - Record their answer: \"In darkness, we cannot see the object.\"\n\n4. **Second investigation: Adding light.**\n   - Now, have a student shine a flashlight into the dark space directly on the same object.\n   - Ask: \"Can you see it now? What changed? What do you see?\"\n   - Students should observe that the object becomes visible when the light shines on it.\n   - Record their observation: \"When light shines on the object, we can see it!\"\n\n5. **Test different materials.**\n   - Repeat the dark-then-light investigation with 2–3 other materials (e.g., dark fabric, clear plastic, shiny aluminum foil).\n   - Ask: \"Did the light work the same way on all materials? Did some shine more than others?\"\n   - Students record: Which materials looked brightest or most reflective when the light hit them?\n\n6. **Document findings.**\n   - Have students draw or write in their notebooks: \"I saw _____ in the dark. I could not see it. When the light shined on it, I could see it because light helped me see.\"\n   - Encourage them to label what material they tested and whether it was shiny or dark.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate group rotations to ensure all students get a turn in the dark space.\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"What changed?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answers; let them discover through observation.\n- Guide students to use their senses carefully and describe what they see in their own words.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students should discover that objects are not visible (or very hard to see) in complete darkness.\n- Students should observe that when light shines on objects, those objects become visible.\n- Students should notice that some materials (shiny, reflective ones like foil or ice) reflect more light and appear brighter.\n- Students should produce simple drawings or written records of their observations.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to the frost photograph and the concepts of light and visibility.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of frost on car (displayed again)\n- Picture chart or poster with vocabulary words and simple illustrations\n- Flashlight for demonstration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore phase.**\n   - Ask each group: \"What did you discover? Can you see things in the dark? What happens when light shines on them?\"\n   - Celebrate their observations: \"Great scientists! You found out that light helps us see things!\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions.**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Light:** Energy that helps us see. Light comes from the sun, lamps, and flashlights.\n   - **Reflection:** When light bounces off an object and comes into our eyes. Shiny objects reflect light well.\n   - **Visible:** Something we can see because light is bouncing off it into our eyes.\n   - **Dark/Darkness:** When there is no light, so we cannot see things.\n   - **Frost:** Frozen water (ice crystals) that forms on cold surfaces when water freezes.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph.**\n   - Show the frost photograph again.\n   - Say: \"Remember this frosty car? The frost looks so sparkly and bright in this picture. Why? Because the sun is shining on the frost! The light from the sun bounces off (reflects from) all those tiny ice crystals. That reflection helps our eyes see the frost and makes it look shiny.\"\n   - Ask: \"What would happen to this frost if it were nighttime and very dark? Would we see the sparkles?\" (Guide them to conclude that without light, we would not see the frost clearly.)\n\n4. **Check for understanding.**\n   - Ask comprehension questions:\n     - \"Can we see things without light?\" (No)\n     - \"What do we need to see an object?\" (Light)\n     - \"Why does the frost in the picture look so bright?\" (Sunlight is shining on it and reflecting off it.)\n     - \"What would happen if we put frost in a completely dark room?\" (We wouldn't be able to see it.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that light is necessary for vision.\n- Students can explain (in simple words) that objects become visible when light shines on them.\n- Students can apply this concept to the frost photograph: the sun's light makes the frost visible and sparkly.\n- Students understand that reflection is how light bounces off objects.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of light and visibility to a new scenario and create a simple investigation of their own.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Ice cubes or frozen water in small containers\n- Flashlights (1 per pair or group)\n- Dark room or box\n- Optional: colored paper, markers, construction materials\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Ice and Light Investigation**\n\n1. Introduce a new question: \"Now that we know light helps us see things, let's test it with ice—which is a lot like frost! We have ice cubes. Let's put them in a dark space and see if we can see them without a light. Then we'll add the light and see what happens.\"\n\n2. Have students:\n   - Place an ice cube in the dark space.\n   - Try to see it without light (record observations).\n   - Shine a flashlight on the ice cube (record observations).\n   - Compare: \"Which was easier to see—ice in the dark or ice with the light? Why?\"\n\n3. Ask a thinking question: \"Ice is clear and shiny like frost. Did the light reflect off the ice the same way it did off the aluminum foil? What's different?\"\n\n**Option B: Design a \"Find the Object\" Game**\n\n1. Explain: \"You now know that light helps us see things. Let's design a game! Your game will help someone find a hidden object using light.\"\n\n2. Have students:\n   - Hide an object (shiny or dark) in a partially dark corner or box.\n   - Write or draw instructions: \"To find this object, you need ______. You can ______.\"\n   - Guide them to include: \"You need LIGHT! You can use a flashlight or turn on a lamp.\"\n\n3. Have pairs test their game with a friend: \"Does your game work? Can they find the object with light? Can they find it without?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What are you noticing? How is this like what we found with the frost?\"\n- Help students make connections between ice/frost and their new investigations.\n- Encourage them to predict before testing: \"Do you think the ice will look the same in the light as in the dark?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students apply the concept that light is necessary for vision to a new scenario with ice.\n- Students recognize similarities between frost and ice in how light interacts with them.\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding by designing a simple investigation or game based on what they learned.\n- Students can explain their findings to peers.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light and visibility through formative and summative assessment.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n\n- **Observation:** Watch students during the Explore phase. Do they understand that objects are hard to see in darkness and become visible with light? Are they making connections?\n- **Listen to student language:** During group share-outs in Explain, do students use words like \"light,\" \"see,\" and \"dark\" appropriately?\n- **Check drawings/records:** Review the pictures or notes students made during Explore. Can they show the object in dark and in light?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5–10 minutes)**\n\nAdminister this at the end of the lesson. Students can answer orally, draw, or write (teacher scribes for non-writers):\n\n1. **Show a picture** of a dark room with an object (or just describe it): \"Imagine you have a toy car in a completely dark room. You cannot see the car. What do you need to do to see the toy car?\"\n\n   **Expected answer:** \"Turn on a light\" or \"Use a flashlight\" or \"Bring in light.\"\n\n2. **Look at the frost photograph again:** \"Why can we see all the sparkles on this frosted car?\"\n\n   **Expected answer:** \"Because the sun is shining on it\" or \"Light is bouncing off the frost\" or \"The sun makes it bright.\"\n\n3. **Quick check:** \"Can we see things without light? Yes or no?\" (Correct answer: No)\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- ✓ Students recognize that objects need light to be visible.\n- ✓ Students can apply this concept to the frost photograph.\n- ✓ Students understand that without light, we cannot see things.\n- ✓ Students show evidence of this understanding through their drawings, answers, or observations during investigations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students who meet the standard: Demonstrate understanding that light is essential for vision; explain why the frost is visible in the photograph; can predict what would happen to the frost in darkness.\n- Students approaching the standard: May need support with explaining \"why,\" but can identify that light helps us see.\n- Students who need additional support: Benefit from repeated, hands-on experiences with light and dark (see Differentiation section).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce language demand:** Provide sentence frames for students to use:\n   - \"In the dark, I _____ (could/could not) see the object.\"\n   - \"When the light shined, I _____ (could/could not) see it.\"\n   - \"Light helps me _____.\"\n\n2. **Use concrete, repeated demonstrations:** Some students may need more repetitions of the dark-and-light investigation. Allow them to experience it 3–4 times with different materials to solidify understanding. Pair them with a strong peer.\n\n3. **Simplify the exit ticket:** Ask only yes/no or either/or questions:\n   - \"Do we need light to see things? Yes or no?\"\n   - \"Can you see this object in the dark? Yes or no? Now I'll shine a light. Can you see it now?\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Explore light and reflection in depth:** Provide mirrors, reflective materials, and light sources. Ask: \"Can you make the light bounce in different directions? What materials reflect the most light? Can you use reflected light to see an object?\"\n\n2. **Compare translucent, transparent, and opaque materials:** Provide clear plastic, frosted plastic, and dark plastic. Ask: \"How does light travel through each one? Which lets the most light through? Why?\" This extends thinking about how light behaves differently with different materials (connecting to 1-PS4-3).\n\n3. **Design a \"Frost Detector\" device:** Challenge: \"Create a tool or device using light that could help someone see frost on a car in the dark.\" Students might design a flashlight holder, a reflective strip, or a light-up sensor idea.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frost Hunt Investigation (homework or next-day observation):** Send students home with a note for families: \"Look for frost, ice, or dew on surfaces early in the morning. Observe it with sunlight and describe what you see. Draw a picture and share with the class. What makes it visible?\" This connects the lesson to real-world observation and family engagement.\n\n2. **Shadow Play and Light Exploration:** Set up a light source (lamp) and have students use their hands, objects, and translucent materials to create shadows on a wall. Discuss: \"Where does the shadow come from? Why can we see it? What happens when we move the light?\" This extends understanding of how light interacts with objects.\n\n3. **Create a \"Day and Night\" Frost Poster:** Have students create a two-panel drawing: one showing frost in daylight (bright and sparkly, with sunlight) and one showing frost at night (dark, less visible). Label: \"In the day, light makes frost visible\" and \"In the night, there is no light, so we cannot see the frost.\" This reinforces the core concept in a visual, memorable way.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
