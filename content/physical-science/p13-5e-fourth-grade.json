Explain how gravity causes objects to move and how the speed of falling objects relates to energy.\n2. Describe how light reflects off water droplets and other surfaces, allowing us to see them.\n3. Design and conduct a simple investigation to observe how droplets behave on different surfaces.\n4. Use evidence from observations to explain the relationship between light, reflection, and visibility.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity about the photograph and activate prior knowledge about water, light, and motion.\n\n#### Materials\n- Printed copy or digital display of the photograph (p13.jpg)\n- Projector or interactive whiteboard\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording student ideas\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display and Initial Observation:**\n1. Project the photograph on the board without explanation. Ask students to observe silently for 20 seconds.\n2. Ask them to turn to a partner and describe what they see using only words (no hands yet).\n\n**Guided Discussion Questions:**\n1. \"What do you notice hanging from the bottom of the blue balloon? What makes them visible—what helps us see them?\"\n2. \"Why do you think some droplets look bright white or shiny, while others look darker? What could be causing that difference?\"\n3. \"If those droplets were to fall to the dark surface below, what do you predict would happen to them? Would they fall straight down or roll?\"\n4. \"Where do you think the energy to move these droplets comes from?\"\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n\"Today, we're going to become Droplet Detectives. We'll investigate how water droplets move, how light helps us see them, and what forces are at work. You'll collect evidence to solve our mystery!\"\n\n#### Transition\n\"Let's move to our investigation stations where you'll use your own balloons and water to discover what's happening in this photograph.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate light reflection and falling motion through hands-on exploration with water droplets and balloons.\n\n#### Materials\n- 1 blue balloon per pair of students (inflated to about 8–10 inches diameter)\n- Water in spray bottles or pipettes\n- Dark construction paper or black poster board (as background)\n- Flashlights or light sources (phones with flashlight apps work)\n- Droppers or syringes (optional, for more control)\n- Paper towels\n- Investigation worksheets (template provided below)\n- Small cups of water at each station\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud and post visually):**\n\n1. **Observe light and droplets:**\n   - Place your balloon on the dark paper.\n   - Using the spray bottle or dropper, place 5–8 water droplets on the balloon's surface.\n   - Without touching the droplets, observe them. Draw what you see in the \"Before Light\" section of your worksheet.\n   - Now, shine the flashlight on the droplets from different angles. What happens to how they look?\n   - Draw what you see in the \"With Light\" section. Label which droplets are bright, which are dim, and why you think that is.\n\n2. **Observe motion and gravity:**\n   - Spray a small stream of water onto the balloon (about 10 droplets).\n   - Watch and record: Do the droplets stick to the balloon, roll, or fall? Do they all move the same way?\n   - Tilt the balloon gently. What happens to the droplets now?\n   - Record your observations: \"When I tilted the balloon, the droplets ______________________.\"\n\n3. **Investigate surfaces:**\n   - Compare how water droplets behave on the balloon versus on the dark paper beside it.\n   - Spray each surface the same way. What is different? Why might the balloon and paper be different?\n   - Record: \"The droplets behave differently because _____________________.\"\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- **Circulate among stations** without providing answers. Ask guiding questions such as:\n  - \"What changed when you shined the light on the droplet?\"\n  - \"What do you notice about which droplets are easiest to see?\"\n  - \"Why do you think some droplets rolled and others fell?\"\n- **Encourage students to try multiple angles** with the light source.\n- **Prompt deeper observation:** \"Can you see inside the droplet? What does that tell you about light passing through it?\"\n- **Manage time** and ensure all students complete the three observations.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students observe that light reflecting off droplets makes them visible (shiny/bright droplets show strong reflection).\n- Students notice that droplets fall or roll due to gravity and surface properties.\n- Students record observations showing differences between reflective and non-reflective surfaces.\n- Students begin to connect light, visibility, and the behavior of water on different materials.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts based on student observations. Connect exploration findings to the original photograph and real-world contexts.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper or digital display\n- Vocabulary poster (create or print ahead of time)\n- Photograph (p13.jpg) on display\n- Optional: short video clip (1–2 minutes) showing light reflecting off water or raindrops\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n1. Invite 2–3 student pairs to share one observation from their investigation.\n2. Display observations on chart paper under headings:\n   - \"How Light Helps Us See Droplets\"\n   - \"How Gravity Affects Droplets\"\n   - \"Differences Between Surfaces\"\n3. Ask: \"How does what you discovered match what we see in the photograph?\"\n\n**Mini-Lesson: Three Key Ideas (10 minutes):**\n\nPresent the following concepts in simple, connected language:\n\n**Concept 1 – Reflection of Light (4-PS4-2 connection):**\n- \"Light bounces off shiny things. When light bounces off a water droplet, it reaches our eyes, and that's how we see it. The droplets in the photo are bright because light is bouncing to us from them.\"\n- Show the photograph and point out the bright droplets hanging from the balloon.\n- Ask: \"Why aren't the droplets on the dark paper as easy to see?\" (Less light reflects from that background.)\n\n**Concept 2 – Gravity and Energy (4-PS3-1 connection):**\n- \"Gravity is a force that pulls things downward toward Earth. When a droplet falls, gravity gives it energy to move. The faster it falls, the more energy it has.\"\n- Demonstrate by releasing a droplet from your hand and letting it fall to a cup of water.\n- Ask: \"What force made that droplet move? Where did it get the energy to fall?\"\n\n**Concept 3 – Speed and Energy Connection:**\n- \"Objects that move fast have more energy than objects that move slow. The droplets in our photo are falling because of gravity. As they fall faster, they gain more energy.\"\n\n#### Vocabulary\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Reflection** | When light bounces off a shiny surface and travels to our eyes so we can see the object. |\n| **Gravity** | A force that pulls objects downward toward Earth. It's why things fall and don't float away. |\n| **Energy** | The power to make things move or change. Falling droplets have energy because they are moving. |\n| **Light Source** | Something that makes light, like the sun, a flashlight, or a lamp. Light bounces off objects to help us see them. |\n| **Speed** | How fast something is moving. A droplet falling quickly has more speed than one falling slowly. |\n\n#### Check for Understanding\n- Ask: \"Turn to your partner and explain: Why can we see the water droplets in the photo? Use the word 'reflection' in your answer.\"\n- Listen for: \"We can see them because light reflects/bounces off them to our eyes.\"\n- Ask: \"What force is pulling the droplets downward?\" (Gravity)\n- Ask: \"If a droplet falls faster, what happens to its energy?\" (It has more energy.)\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students understand that light reflection allows us to see objects.\n- Students recognize gravity as the force causing droplets to move downward.\n- Students explain that falling objects have energy and that speed is related to the amount of energy.\n- Students use vocabulary correctly in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nApply concepts to a new context and explore real-world connections. Deepen understanding through prediction and comparison.\n\n#### Materials\n- Different surface types: plastic wrap, aluminum foil, sandpaper, paper towel, plastic cup\n- Water spray bottles or droppers\n- Small flashlights\n- Dark background (black paper)\n- \"Prediction Sheet\" (template below)\n- Camera or smartphone to document observations (optional)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Challenge: \"Surface Investigators\"**\n\n**Setup:**\nArrange stations with different materials. Each pair receives a prediction sheet.\n\n**Student Task:**\n1. **Predict:** Before testing, look at each material and predict:\n   - \"Will light reflect brightly off this surface, or will it be dull?\"\n   - \"Will water droplets fall quickly, slowly, or stick to this surface?\"\n   - Write your predictions on the sheet.\n\n2. **Test:** Place 3–4 water droplets on each material. Shine a light on them. Observe and record what actually happens.\n\n3. **Compare:** \"Which surface reflected light the most? Which one made droplets fall the fastest? Why do you think that happened?\"\n\n4. **Connect to Real Life:**\n   - \"Where do you see water droplets in real life? (Rain on windows, puddles, water bottles, leaves after rain)\"\n   - \"Why is it easier to see raindrops on a car window than on a grassy lawn?\" (Light reflects off the smooth, shiny car window. The grass absorbs light and doesn't reflect it as well.)\n   - \"What would happen if you shined a flashlight on raindrops during a rainstorm? Would you see them better?\" (Yes, the light would reflect off the droplets and you'd see them shine.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate station rotations (2–3 minutes per surface).\n- Ask prompts: \"What's different about this surface compared to the balloon?\" \"Can you explain why the light behaves differently?\"\n- Encourage students to make predictions *before* testing, then reflect on whether they were correct.\n- Have students record evidence (drawings or written descriptions).\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students apply concepts of light reflection to new surfaces and contexts.\n- Students recognize patterns: smooth, shiny surfaces reflect light and make droplets visible; rough or porous surfaces do not.\n- Students predict outcomes based on observations and test their predictions.\n- Students make real-world connections between the lesson and everyday phenomena (rain, windows, puddles).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student mastery of learning objectives through formative and summative assessment.\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** As students explore, note whether they:\n  - Correctly identify how light reflects off droplets (use the word \"reflection\" or \"bounces off\").\n  - Recognize gravity as the cause of falling motion.\n  - Explain the connection between speed and energy in simple terms.\n  - Make reasonable predictions and test them.\n  \n- **Partner Discussions:** Listen to partner shares during Explain phase. Do students use vocabulary correctly? Can they justify their observations?\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a printed or digital exit ticket. Read questions aloud; students answer with drawings and/or words.\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **\"Look at this picture of a water droplet on a window. The sun is shining on it. Why can you see the droplet so clearly?\"**\n   - ☐ Because light bounces off it to my eyes (reflection)\n   - ☐ Because gravity makes it fall\n   - ☐ Because it is moving fast\n\n2. **\"A raindrop is falling from a cloud. What force is making it fall downward?\"**\n   - Answer: _________________ (Accept: gravity, Earth's pull, or similar)\n\n3. **\"Two droplets are falling. One is falling very fast. One is falling slowly. Which one has more energy? Why?\"**\n   - Answer: The _________________ droplet has more energy because _________________.\n\n4. **\"Draw or describe: If you wanted to see water droplets on a piece of sandpaper, would it be easier to see them in the dark or in bright light? Why?\"**\n   - Answer with drawing or words: _________________\n\n#### Success Criteria for Student Understanding\n\n**Students Demonstrate Mastery If They:**\n- Correctly explain how light reflection allows us to see objects (4-PS4-2).\n- Identify gravity as the force causing downward motion (4-PS3-1).\n- Connect speed of motion to energy level (faster = more energy).\n- Make predictions about light and surface behavior, then test and explain results.\n- Use vocabulary (reflection, gravity, energy, speed) appropriately in context.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Most Fourth Grade students will correctly answer 3 out of 4 exit ticket questions.\n- Students will provide evidence-based explanations (e.g., \"Light bounces off the droplet\" or \"Gravity pulls it down\").\n- Student drawings will show understanding of reflection (e.g., arrows showing light bouncing).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Sentence Frames for Explanations:**\n   - Provide sentence starters: \"I can see the droplet because light _____.\" \"Gravity makes droplets _____ downward.\" \"The faster droplet has _____ energy than the slower one.\"\n   - Allows students to participate without inventing language from scratch.\n\n2. **Simplified Observation Sheet:**\n   - Reduce the number of observations required in Explore.\n   - Use pictures/icons to label \"bright,\" \"dim,\" \"falling,\" \"rolling\" so students can point or circle instead of writing.\n   - Pair with a stronger reader/writer for peer support.\n\n3. **Direct Light and Droplet Comparison:**\n   - Before Explore, demonstrate one observation yourself (place a droplet on the balloon, shine light on it, point out the brightness change). This gives students a model to replicate.\n   - Reduce the need for independent discovery while still allowing hands-on engagement.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Investigate Angle of Light Reflection:**\n   - \"Experiment: Does the angle at which you shine the light affect how bright the droplet appears? Test light from above, below, and to the side. Record which angle creates the brightest reflection.\"\n   - Introduces the idea that reflection depends on angle (foundational for understanding law of reflection).\n\n2. **Predict and Test: Energy and Falling Distance:**\n   - \"If a droplet falls from higher up, does it have more energy when it hits the surface? Test by dropping droplets from different heights and observing the splash size.\"\n   - Connects falling distance, speed, and kinetic energy.\n\n3. **Real-World Investigation:**\n   - \"Find three examples of water droplets in the school or outdoors (rain on a window, dew on grass, puddles). For each, explain whether light is reflecting off them well or poorly. How could you make each one easier to see?\"\n   - Applies concepts to authentic contexts and requires higher-order thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Raindrop Rainbow Investigation:**\n   - Show students a video or photograph of a rainbow created by sunlight reflecting through raindrops.\n   - Challenge: \"Investigate: Can you make a rainbow using water droplets, a flashlight, and a white paper? What conditions do you need? (Hint: You need light, water droplets, and the right angle.)\"\n   - This extends 4-PS4-2 by exploring how light bends through water droplets.\n\n2. **Speed and Energy Obstacle Course:**\n   - Create a \"droplet race\": Roll different-sized marbles down a ramp from different heights.\n   - Students predict which marble will be fastest and have the most energy. They measure distance traveled after leaving the ramp.\n   - Record data and explain: \"The marble that fell from the highest point was fastest and traveled the farthest. Why? It started with more potential energy from gravity.\"\n   - Deepens 4-PS3-1 understanding.\n\n3. **Design a Water-Catching Device:**\n   - Challenge: \"Using a balloon, cup, mesh strainer, and aluminum foil, design a device that catches and holds the most water droplets without letting them fall through. Test your design. Explain: How does the surface material affect whether droplets stick or fall?\"\n   - Applies concepts to engineering and materials science while reinforcing reflection, gravity, and surface properties.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of 5E Flow\n\n| Phase | Key Focus | Time |\n|-------|-----------|------|\n| **Engage** | Hook curiosity with photograph; activate prior knowledge about light, water, gravity | 10–15 min |\n| **Explore** | Hands-on investigation: observe light reflection on droplets, gravity's effect on motion, surface differences | 20–25 min |\n| **Explain** | Introduce vocabulary (reflection, gravity, energy, speed); connect observations to science concepts | 15–20 min |\n| **Elaborate** | Apply concepts to new surfaces; make predictions; connect to real-world rain, windows, puddles | 15–20 min |\n| **Evaluate** | Assess understanding through observations, discussions, and exit ticket with 4-question assessment | 5–10 min |\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Safety:** Keep water away from electrical outlets and flashlights.
