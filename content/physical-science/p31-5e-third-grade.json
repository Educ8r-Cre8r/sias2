Wind and air resistance are forces affecting the flag's motion.\n- **Balanced and Unbalanced Forces:** The flag moves because wind (an unbalanced force) acts on it, while the clock maintains steady motion through balanced forces working on the pendulum mechanism.\n- **Pattern and Prediction:** Clock hands move in a predictable, repeating pattern that allows us to predict where they will be at future times.\n- **Energy Transfer:** The clock's mechanism converts stored energy into the motion of the hands and the flag waves in the breeze, demonstrating kinetic energy.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Time in Motion: How Forces Make Clocks Tick**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90-120 minutes (two 45-60 minute sessions, or three 30-40 minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 3-PS2-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object.\n  - 3-PS2-2: Make observations and/or measurements of an object's motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify forces that cause objects to move in repeating patterns (such as swinging or spinning).\n2. Predict the location of a moving object based on observing its pattern of motion.\n3. Compare how balanced and unbalanced forces affect the motion of objects (clock hands vs. waving flag).\n4. Plan and conduct a simple investigation to test how forces influence repetitive motion.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph while introducing the concept of patterns and motion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the urban clock and flag\n- Chart paper and markers (or whiteboard)\n- Small clock or demonstration clock with visible hands (optional but helpful)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster where all students can see it clearly. Position students so they can observe both the clock face and the American flag.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause for student responses after each):\n   - \"What do you notice moving in this picture?\" *Guide students to identify both the clock hands and the flag.*\n   - \"The clock hands move in a special way—what do you think makes them move? What force is moving them?\" *Accept ideas; validate curiosity without confirming answers.*\n   - \"Look at the flag. It's moving too. What is making the flag move differently from the clock hands?\"\n   - \"If I cover the clock with my hand right now, can you predict where the clock hands will be in 5 minutes? How do you know?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to give you a special challenge: We're going to investigate how things can move in patterns, just like the clock hands do. You're going to be scientists who watch movements and predict what happens next!\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper under the heading \"What Makes Things Move?\" Refer back to this chart during the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's explore how forces create moving patterns by creating our own moving objects!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how forces create repeating patterns of motion through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials per group (groups of 3-4):**\n- String (12-18 inches long)\n- Metal washers or fishing weights (3-4)\n- Tape\n- Pencil or dowel rod\n- Timer (teacher phone or classroom timer)\n- Paper cup or small container (optional, for added weight)\n- Investigation worksheet (provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and demonstrate each step):**\n\n1. \"Tape one end of your string to a pencil. Your partner will hold the pencil so it sticks out over the edge of a desk or table—like this.\" *Demonstrate by holding a pencil horizontally.*\n\n2. \"Tie the metal washers to the other end of the string so they hang down. This is your pendulum—a weight on a string.\"\n\n3. \"Now, gently pull the washers to one side and let go. Don't push hard—just lift them and release. Watch what happens.\"\n\n4. \"What do you observe? Talk with your group. Does it swing the same way each time? Does it go back and forth? How many times does it swing in 15 seconds? Use your timer.\"\n\n5. \"Record your observations on your worksheet by drawing pictures of where the washers are at the start, middle, and end of the swing.\"\n\n6. \"Now try again, but this time pull the washers higher before releasing. What happens now? Does it swing faster or slower? More times or fewer times? Record this too.\"\n\n7. \"Repeat one more time, but pull the washers even higher. What changes? What stays the same?\"\n\n**Investigation Worksheet Prompts:**\n- Draw the pendulum swinging. Show three positions: starting, middle, and end.\n- How many times did it swing in 15 seconds? (First try: ___ swings, Second try: ___ swings)\n- When you pulled it higher, did it swing faster or slower?\n- Predict: If you let it swing one more time, where do you think it will be? (Draw or write your prediction.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group. Ask open-ended questions: \"What pattern do you see?\" \"Do you think it will swing the same way next time?\"\n- Resist telling students what to notice. Instead, redirect: \"What did you observe? Show me with your hands.\"\n- Ensure students release (don't push) the washers so they discover natural swing patterns.\n- Help groups use the timer but let them count swings themselves.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that pendulums swing back and forth in a repeating pattern.\n- Students discover that releasing from a higher position creates more swings (energy concept introduced informally).\n- Students predict future positions based on observed patterns.\n- Students record data through drawings and simple tallies.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration, connecting observations to forces and patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Demonstration clock (or the photograph displayed again)\n- Pendulum model from Explore (one group's model or teacher-made)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to show their pendulum and describe what they observed.\n   - Ask the class: \"Did all the pendulums move the same way? What was the same about them? What was different?\"\n   - Record observations on chart paper.\n\n2. **Key Vocabulary Instruction (5-8 minutes):**\n   Introduce and define each term using the student observations and the demonstration:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or stop. (Show example: gravity pulling the washers down; hand releasing creates the swing.)\n   - **Pattern:** Something that repeats in the same way over and over. (Point to pendulum swings or clock hands moving.)\n   - **Pendulum:** A weight on a string that swings back and forth. It's a type of motion that repeats.\n   - **Gravity:** A force that pulls things down toward Earth. (Gravity is pulling your pendulum down.)\n   - **Balanced Forces:** When pushes and pulls on an object are equal, so it doesn't change direction or speed. (The pendulum swings at a steady speed because forces are balanced.)\n\n3. **Connections to Photograph (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again.\n   - \"The clock on the building has a mechanism inside with gears and a pendulum, similar to the one you made. The pendulum swings back and forth in a repeating pattern, just like yours did. This pattern helps keep time.\"\n   - \"Look at the flag. The wind is a force pushing it. Is the flag's motion a pattern like the clock? Why or why not?\" *Guide students to see that the flag's motion is not as predictable because wind changes.*\n   - \"The clock hands move in a very predictable pattern. We can predict where they will be, just like you predicted where your pendulum would swing.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Show me with your hands a pendulum motion. What force is making it swing?\"\n   - Ask: \"Can you predict: if a clock hand is pointing at the 3, where will it point in one hour? How do you know?\"\n   - Use thumb signals: Thumbs up (I understand), thumbs sideways (I'm not sure), thumbs down (I need help).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that forces cause motion.\n- Students recognize that repeating patterns allow prediction.\n- Students connect their pendulum model to a real clock.\n- Students can use the vocabulary terms in context.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing and testing a new force scenario.\n\n**Materials per group:**\n- String or yarn (various lengths: 6 inches, 12 inches, 18 inches)\n- Metal washers (same amount per group)\n- Pencil or dowel\n- Timer\n- Chart paper divided into three columns labeled \"Short String,\" \"Medium String,\" \"Long String\"\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge Question:** \"Does the length of string change how fast a pendulum swings? Let's test it!\"\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Make three pendulums using the same weight (washers) but different string lengths: one short, one medium, one long.\"\n\n2. \"Release each pendulum from the same height (same starting position).\"\n\n3. \"Count how many complete swings each one makes in 15 seconds. Record the number on the class chart.\"\n\n4. \"What pattern do you see? Which pendulum swings the most times in 15 seconds? Which swings the least?\"\n\n5. \"Why do you think the string length affects the swinging? Talk with your group.\"\n\n**Application to Real World:**\n- Show students a picture of a grandfather clock or explain: \"Real clocks use pendulums with specific string lengths so they tick at exactly the right speed. Clock makers have to choose the perfect length to keep time correctly.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide groups to release pendulums consistently (from the same height).\n- Ask: \"What do you think will happen before you test?\" (prediction)\n- Ask: \"Did your prediction match what actually happened?\" (metacognition)\n- Encourage groups to explain *why* length might matter (\"What do you think gravity is doing?\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that pendulum length affects swing frequency (though they may not use that term).\n- Students make predictions and test them.\n- Students see that patterns help explain how real objects work (like clocks).\n- Students begin to understand cause-and-effect relationships between force conditions and motion.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forces, patterns, and prediction through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Did students notice and record the pendulum's pattern? Could they identify when the motion repeated?\n- **Verbal checks during Explain:** Listen to student responses when you ask about forces and patterns.\n- **Questions during Elaborate:** Do students make predictions before testing? Can they explain results?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (printed or on a whiteboard). Students may respond with words, drawings, or both.\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n1. \"Draw a pendulum. Show with arrows the forces pushing or pulling it.\" (Expected: Arrows showing gravity, motion, or the push/pull that starts it.)\n2. \"Why does a pendulum move in a pattern? What makes it move the same way again and again?\" (Expected: Mention gravity, the same forces, or \"it swings back and forth.\")\n3. \"If you see a clock hand pointing at the 2, where will it point in 30 minutes? How did you predict this?\" (Expected: At the 3 or 4; mentions the pattern/repeating motion as reasoning.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ **Proficient:** Student identifies forces (gravity, push, pull) and describes how they create repeating patterns. Student makes a reasonable prediction about clock hands or pendulum motion based on observed patterns.\n- ✓ **Developing:** Student identifies that something causes motion and notices it repeats but may have difficulty articulating the force or using vocabulary correctly. Prediction shows some understanding of pattern.\n- ✓ **Beginning:** Student observes motion but does not yet connect it to forces or patterns. Prediction is random or based on guess.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most Third Grade students will demonstrate understanding that repeating motions can be predicted.\n- Most will identify gravity or pushing/pulling as forces that create motion.\n- Some students will use vocabulary terms correctly; others may describe concepts without formal vocabulary.\n- Students should show evidence of investigating and observing patterns during hands-on work.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Investigation Setup:** Provide pre-made pendulums with the string already taped and weight attached. Students only need to release and observe, reducing fine motor and setup demands.\n\n2. **Visual Reference Chart:** Create a chart showing the vocabulary terms with picture icons (arrow for force, circle with arrows for pattern, pendulum drawing for pendulum). Display it prominently and reference it repeatedly during instruction.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Predictions:** Provide frame: \"I think the pendulum will _____ because the _____ is pulling/pushing it.\" This scaffolds both prediction and force reasoning.\n\n4. **One-to-One or Small Group Explanation:** Spend extra time with struggling students during the Explain phase, using the teacher's pendulum demo and asking them to repeat back what they observed.\n\n**Challenge (Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper Investigation:** Ask: \"What other things besides string length might change how a pendulum swings? What about the weight? What about the height you release it from?\" Let them design and test a multi-variable investigation.\n\n2. **Connection to Real Applications:** Provide information about how pendulums are used in different devices (grandfather clocks, metronomes, playground swings). Ask: \"Why would engineers want to use a pendulum instead of a motor to keep time?\"\n\n3. **Graphing and Data Analysis:** Have advanced students create a simple bar graph or line graph showing the number of swings for each string length, and write a conclusion sentence: \"As string length increases, the number of swings ______ because _____.\"\n\n4. **Force Diagram Challenge:** Ask students to draw and label all the forces acting on a pendulum at different points in its swing (gravity, tension in string, motion).\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Design a Water Clock (Classroom or Take-Home):** Provide students with two clear plastic bottles, water, food coloring, and tape. Challenge them to make a simple water-drip timer that takes exactly 1 minute to drain. Discuss: \"Is this a pattern? Can you predict how full it will be after 30 seconds?\" (Connects to pattern and prediction; alternative to pendulum.)\n\n2. **Make a Metronome:** Students create a pendulum that \"taps\" a surface or bell at regular intervals by taping a pencil to the weight. Use it to keep time during a song. Ask: \"How does this help musicians?\" (Real-world application of pendulum patterns.)\n\n3. **Explore Other Repeating Motions:** Provide spinning tops, bouncy balls (drop from the same height repeatedly), or swinging jump ropes. Ask students to investigate: \"Which motions repeat in patterns? Which don't? Why?\" (Expands understanding of forces and motion patterns beyond pendulums.)\n\n4. **Research Project (Optional):** Students research a picture of a real grandfather clock or cuckoo clock. They draw or describe: \"What inside the clock makes it work?\" and \"What would happen if the pendulum broke?\" (Connects mechanics to design thinking.)\n\n---\n\n## Pedagogical Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Why This Lesson Works:** Third graders are natural observers of patterns and can visually track repeating motions. The pendulum is a tangible, predictable model that directly connects to the photograph's clock. The lesson moves from concrete manipulation (making and testing pendulums) to abstract reasoning (predicting and explaining patterns).\n\n- **Common Misconceptions to Address:**\n  - Students may think the pendulum \"gets tired\" and eventually stops. Clarify that friction and air resistance slow it down, but the pattern (the back-and-forth motion itself) stays the same while it swings.\n  - Students may confuse the *frequency* (how many swings) with *speed* (how fast each swing occurs). Stick with observable language: \"more swings\" vs. \"faster swings\" rather than technical terms.\n\n- **Safety Note:** Ensure the pencil/dowel is secure on the desk and weights cannot fall on students' feet. Supervise closely during the Explore phase.\n\n- **Accessibility:** Students with visual impairments can feel the pendulum swing and count beats. Students with hearing differences can observe and draw instead of listening to ticking clocks.\n\n---",
