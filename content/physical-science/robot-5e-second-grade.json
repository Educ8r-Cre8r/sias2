Identify and describe the observable properties of different materials (hard, soft, smooth, rough, shiny, dull).\n2. Recognize that objects are made of smaller pieces put together for a specific purpose.\n3. Classify materials based on their properties and what they are used for.\n4. Explain why certain materials are chosen for different parts of an object.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about objects made of parts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the blue robot (printed large or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student journals or blank paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display a large, clear image of the robot on grass and soil. Let students look silently for 20 seconds before asking any questions.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (ask one at a time, wait for responses):**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about the blue thing.\"\n   - \"What do you think this object is made of? Is it all the same material, or different materials?\"\n   - \"Look closely—can you see different pieces that make up this robot? What are they?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the robot has wheels? Why does it have an eye?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Say, \"I wonder what would happen if we took apart this robot. What pieces would we find inside? Could we use those pieces to make something else?\"\n\n4. **Record Predictions:** Have students draw or dictate one thing they think the robot is made of. Display these on a \"Wonder Wall.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore different materials just like those in this robot, and we'll discover why certain materials work better for certain jobs!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate observable properties of different materials through direct experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Set of 5-6 materials: plastic toy block, rubber ball/eraser, metal spoon, foam piece, smooth stone, soft cloth\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per pair)\n- Property recording sheet (with pictures and words: hard/soft, smooth/rough, shiny/dull, heavy/light)\n- Small containers or trays to hold materials\n- Sensory exploration stations chart (teacher-prepared)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize Exploration Stations:** Set up 3-4 stations around the room, each with 1-2 materials and a simple task card.\n\n2. **Station Instructions (read aloud; have visual pictures on each card):**\n   - **Station 1 (Touch & Feel):** \"Pick up each material. Rub it on your cheek or arm. Is it hard or soft? Smooth or rough? Write or draw what you feel.\"\n   - **Station 2 (Look Carefully):** \"Use the magnifying glass. Look at each material. Do you see bumps or lines? Is it shiny or dull? Draw what you see.\"\n   - **Station 3 (Weight & Movement):** \"Hold each material in your hand. Is it heavy or light? Can you bend it or does it stay stiff?\"\n   - **Station 4 (Sound Test):** \"Gently tap each material with a stick or pencil. Does it make a sound? Is it loud or quiet?\"\n\n3. **Student Directions (simplified):**\n   - Work in your small group at each station for 3-4 minutes.\n   - Touch, look, and listen to each material.\n   - Use the property chart to mark what you notice.\n   - Move to the next station when you hear the signal.\n\n4. **What to Record:**\n   - Students should complete a simple checklist or draw pictures on the property recording sheet for each material.\n   - Encourage children to use comparison words: \"harder than,\" \"smoother than,\" \"more shiny than.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate through stations, asking clarifying questions: \"Why do you think this is hard?\" \"How is this material different from that one?\"\n- Do NOT tell students answers; instead, guide observations: \"What does your hand tell you?\"\n- Prompt deeper thinking: \"That rubber is soft. What do you see when you look closely?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students explore at least 4-5 different materials.\n- They document observable properties using words, pictures, or gestures.\n- They make comparative statements: \"This is harder than that.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to the robot photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with written vocabulary\n- Photograph of the robot (revisit)\n- Pictures or actual samples of materials visible in the robot (plastic, rubber, metal)\n- Student property recording sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover at the stations? Tell us about one material you explored.\"\n   - Highlight diverse responses: \"Maria found the metal spoon is hard and shiny. Jack found the rubber is soft and smooth. Both are right!\"\n   - Record key words on chart paper as students share.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (teacher-led, 5 minutes):**\n   - Display each term on chart paper with a simple picture or example.\n   - Use the materials from Explore to demonstrate each property.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Material:** What something is made of (plastic, metal, rubber, wood, cloth). Point to the robot: \"The robot is made of several materials.\"\n- **Property:** A characteristic you can observe with your senses (hard, soft, smooth, rough, shiny, dull, heavy, light). Demonstrate: \"Hardness is a property we can test by pressing.\"\n- **Observe:** To look, listen, touch, or use your senses to learn about something. \"When we observed the materials at stations, we used our senses.\"\n- **Purpose:** The reason something is made a certain way or the job it does. \"The rubber wheels have the purpose of helping the robot move.\"\n\n3. **Connection to the Robot (5 minutes):**\n   - Revisit the photograph. Point to different parts of the robot.\n   - Ask: \"This wheel is rubber. Why do you think the robot has rubber wheels instead of plastic wheels?\" (Guide: \"Rubber is bouncy and flexible—good for moving.\" \"Plastic is hard—good for the body.\")\n   - Point to the eye: \"This shiny lens helps the robot see. Why is a shiny material better than a dull one?\" (Guide: \"Shiny lets light in so the robot can see better.\")\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Hold up two materials. Ask: \"Which one would be better for a robot's wheel? Why?\"\n   - Have students show thumbs up/sideways/down to indicate confidence understanding properties.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use property vocabulary correctly when describing materials.\n- They explain (simply) why a material's properties matter for its purpose.\n- They connect exploration to the robot example.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply material properties to design and reassemble objects.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-assembled small objects made of multiple materials: simple toy cars, building block structures, or craft-made items (can be made by teacher ahead of time)\n- Paper bags with mixed materials: plastic pieces, rubber bands, small metal washers, foam scraps, cloth pieces\n- Construction materials: tape, string, paper fasteners\n- Design planning sheet (simple, picture-based)\n- Real or picture example of how a robot might be \"rebuilt\" differently\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Disassembly & Observation (7 minutes):**\n   - Give each small group a pre-made simple object (toy car, block structure, etc.).\n   - Instruction: \"Carefully take apart your object. As you remove each piece, notice what material it is made of. What properties does it have? Why do you think it was used for that part?\"\n   - Students record/draw the parts and materials.\n\n2. **Reassembly Challenge (8 minutes):**\n   - Provide a bag with mixed materials.\n   - Challenge: \"Using these materials, rebuild your object in a NEW way OR make a completely NEW object. You can change which parts are plastic or rubber or metal. What properties do you need for it to work?\"\n   - Example: \"If you make wheels out of foam instead of rubber, what might happen? Would it roll the same way?\"\n\n3. **Explain Their Design:**\n   - Students briefly share their new creation and explain one choice they made: \"I used a rubber band for the wheel because rubber is bouncy.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What material did you choose for that part? Why does that property matter?\"\n- Encourage risk-taking: \"Your design is different—that's great! Does it work? What would you change?\"\n- Facilitate peer feedback: \"Do you agree with their choice? Can you think of another material that might work?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students disassemble and reassemble objects successfully.\n- They explain material choices using property vocabulary (hard, soft, bouncy, flexible, etc.).\n- They recognize that the same object can be made in different ways depending on available materials.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of material properties and object composition.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n   - **Station observations:** Note student language and reasoning during Explore.\n   - **Group discussion:** Listen for correct use of property vocabulary during Explain.\n   - **Thumbs check:** Quick visual assessment of confidence during Explain.\n   - **Elaboration observation:** Assess design choices and explanations during Elaborate phase.\n\n2. **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes, end of Session 2):**\n   \n   Present students with two simple scenarios. Assess using verbal or written response (draw, dictate, or write):\n\n   **Scenario 1:** \"The robot needs new wheels. Should they be made of hard plastic or soft rubber? Why?\"\n\n   **Scenario 2:** \"Show me two different materials. Tell me one way they are the SAME and one way they are DIFFERENT.\"\n\n   **Alternative (if preferred):** Display 3-4 materials (plastic cube, rubber eraser, metal nail, cloth). Ask: \"Point to the one that is hard and shiny. Why did you pick that one?\"\n\n3. **Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n   - **Emerging:** Student identifies one property of a material (e.g., \"This is hard\").\n   - **Developing:** Student compares properties and mentions why a material might be used (e.g., \"Rubber wheels are soft and bouncy\").\n   - **Proficient:** Student explains a material choice using property vocabulary and purpose (e.g., \"The metal eye is shiny so light bounces into it and the robot can see\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully identify properties of materials.\n- They make reasonable choices about which materials serve which purposes.\n- They explain their thinking using age-appropriate vocabulary learned during the lesson.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Station Cards:** Use only 2-3 stations instead of 4. Reduce the number of materials at each station to 2-3 instead of 5-6. Use picture-only property charts instead of words.\n\n2. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair struggling students with a strong observer during stations. Assign a \"material buddy\" who points out properties together.\n\n3. **Teacher-Led Mini-Group Explain:** After Explore, pull small groups aside and do a simplified vocabulary introduction with only 2-3 key terms (Material, Hard/Soft, Purpose). Use lots of hands-on demonstration.\n\n4. **Scaffolded Exit Ticket:** Instead of two scenarios, ask one concrete question with picture choices: \"Which would be a better wheel: rubber or plastic? Point to one.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Complex Redesign Task:** Instead of reassembling the same object, challenge advanced students to design a completely new object for a specific purpose: \"Build a robot arm that can pick up soft items. Which materials would you use and why?\" Require them to explain at least two material choices in detail.\n\n2. **Property Ranking:** Provide a list of materials and ask students to rank them by hardness, flexibility, or shininess. Ask them to predict: \"If we used the softest material for a robot's body, what might happen? Why?\"\n\n3. **Real-World Connection Research:** Have advanced learners investigate why a real robot (or vehicle) uses the materials it does. They can interview staff or research online with teacher support, then create a simple poster explaining one design choice.\n\n4. **Create Your Own \"Material Key\":** Ask students to design a chart showing 6-8 materials, their properties, and what jobs they would be best for. Challenge them to think of materials beyond what's shown in class.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Robot Sorting Game:** Create a real-world follow-up where students sort classroom objects (pencil, eraser, metal paperclip, plastic cup, cloth towel, wooden block) by material and properties. They can create a sorting chart or Venn diagram comparing two properties (e.g., \"Hard & Shiny\" vs. \"Soft & Dull\").\n\n2. **Design a Robot Brainstorm:** After the lesson, challenge students to sketch their own robot design. They must label at least three different materials and explain why each material was chosen for that part. Display these designs as a gallery and have peers vote on the \"best material choice.\"\n\n3. **Material Hunt Around School:** Take students on a nature walk or classroom hunt to find examples of different materials. They collect photos or sketches of objects made of plastic, metal, rubber, wood, and cloth. Back in class, they sort findings by material and property, creating a classroom display: \"We Found These Materials!\"\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Preparation:** Pre-assemble simple objects (you can glue together block structures or gather toy cars) for the Disassembly phase. Test all materials ahead of time so you know their properties.\n- **Timing:** If this is your first 5E lesson with this class, the Explore phase may take slightly longer as students learn station routines.\n- **Safety:** Ensure no small pieces are choking hazards. Supervise disassembly if objects are fragile.\n- **Real Robot Connection:** If possible, show a brief (30-second) video of a real robot in action after the Elaborate phase to reinforce why material choices matter in the real world.\n\nThis lesson directly uses the photograph as a motivation and reference point while building strong foundational understanding of material properties aligned to 2-PS1-1 and 2-PS1-3.",
