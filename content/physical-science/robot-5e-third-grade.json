ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by examining the photograph of the robot in its natural environment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the blue robot (projected or printed, one per student or small group)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Short video clip (30 seconds) of a toy robot moving in grass or on concrete\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or distribute printed copies to small groups. Ask students to look carefully at where the robot is positioned and what surrounds it.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** (pause after each to allow 10–15 seconds of think time):\n   - \"What do you notice about this robot? What does it look like?\"\n   - \"The robot is sitting on concrete and near grass. If we pushed this robot, do you think it would roll the same way on both surfaces? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What do you think we would need to do to make this robot move?\"\n   - \"Can you predict: If we pushed the robot on grass versus on the concrete, which surface would it travel farther on?\"\n\n3. **Record predictions** on chart paper labeled \"Our Predictions\" without correcting them. This activates prior thinking about forces, surfaces, and motion.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we pushed this robot with a strong force on different surfaces. Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now you're going to be scientists and test your predictions with your own rolling robot and different surfaces!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how forces affect motion and discover how different surfaces impact movement distance.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3–4 students):**\n- One small rolling robot or wheeled toy car (alternative: can substitute with a ball, but wheeled toys work best for this activity)\n- Meter stick or measuring tape\n- Three different surfaces prepared in advance: smooth concrete/tile, grass/soil, and carpet or rough mat\n- Masking tape and markers for labeling\n- Data recording sheet (provided below)\n- Optional: ramp made from a textbook or board (for extension)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup:** Divide the class into groups of 3–4. Assign each group a \"testing station\" with one prepared surface (concrete, grass, or carpet). Provide the meter stick and masking tape.\n\n2. **Step-by-step student directions:**\n   - \"Place your robot at the starting line (marked with tape).\"\n   - \"Push the robot gently with the same amount of force each time. You can use your finger to push it the same way.\"\n   - \"Watch where it stops. Use the meter stick to measure how far it traveled.\"\n   - \"Record the distance on your data sheet.\"\n   - \"Repeat three times on your assigned surface.\"\n   - \"Calculate the average distance it traveled.\"\n\n3. **Connection to photograph:** \"Just like the robot in the picture is on concrete and near grass, we're testing how it moves on different surfaces!\"\n\n4. **What students record:**\n   - Data table with three trials showing distance traveled\n   - A simple drawing of their surface\n   - A prediction for what would happen on a different surface\n   - One observation about what they noticed (e.g., \"The robot went faster on the smooth surface\")\n\n5. **Teacher role:** Circulate among groups. Ask guiding questions instead of giving answers:\n   - \"What do you notice about how far the robot is traveling each time?\"\n   - \"Why do you think it went different distances?\"\n   - \"Does the surface matter? How can you tell?\"\n   - Ensure consistent pushing force by modeling or gently correcting technique.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that the robot travels different distances on different surfaces.\n- Most will observe that smoother surfaces result in greater distances traveled.\n- Students record measurable data with three trials per surface.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of the robot\n- Drawn or printed images of: balanced forces diagram (object at rest), unbalanced forces diagram (object moving)\n- Optional: Picture cards showing surfaces (smooth, rough, textured)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite each group to share one observation: \"Our robot traveled _____ cm on the _____ surface.\"\n   - Create a class chart comparing all results across surfaces.\n   - Ask: \"Which surface made the robot travel the farthest? The shortest? Why?\"\n\n2. **Teacher-led instruction (8–10 minutes):**\n   - Point back to the photograph: \"When the robot is sitting still, like in this picture, what forces are acting on it?\"\n   - **Introduce key vocabulary** with demonstrations:\n\n   **Vocabulary List:**\n   - **Force:** A push or a pull that makes something move or change direction. (Demonstrate by pushing a toy.)\n   - **Balanced Forces:** Forces that are equal and opposite, so an object stays still. (Show robot at rest: \"Gravity pulls down, the ground pushes up equally.\")\n   - **Unbalanced Forces:** Forces that are not equal, so an object starts moving or changes motion. (Push the robot: \"My push is stronger than the friction, so it moves.\")\n   - **Friction:** A force that slows down or stops moving objects. (Rub hands together: \"Friction makes them warm and slows my hands.\")\n   - **Motion:** Movement from one place to another.\n\n3. **Connections:**\n   - \"When the robot sits still in the picture, forces are balanced. Nothing pushes it.\"\n   - \"When we pushed it, we created an unbalanced force, so it moved.\"\n   - \"On the smooth surface, there was less friction, so it traveled farther!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show the photograph again and ask: \"If we pushed this robot right now, would forces be balanced or unbalanced? Why?\"\n   - Ask 2–3 students to explain in their own words.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that an object at rest has balanced forces.\n- Students understand that a push or pull (force) causes motion (unbalanced forces).\n- Students grasp that friction on different surfaces affects how far something travels.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply force and motion concepts to a new scenario and deepen understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Same robots used in Explore phase\n- Three different prepared surfaces (reuse from Explore or create new ones)\n- Data recording sheet (for predictions)\n- Meter sticks\n- Masking tape\n- Picture cards or descriptions of scenarios (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario-based prediction task:**\n   - Present this scenario: \"The robot in the picture needs to travel across a gym to deliver a message. Which surface should we use so it travels the farthest?\"\n   - Show images or descriptions of three surfaces (smooth gym floor, outdoor concrete, grassy field).\n\n2. **Student application:**\n   - In small groups, students make a written prediction: \"The robot will travel the farthest on _____ because _____.\"\n   - Students explain their reasoning using what they learned about friction and forces.\n   - Optional: Groups can test a different surface than they tested before to verify predictions.\n\n3. **Real-world connection:**\n   - \"Engineers who design robots have to think about where robots will move. If you wanted to send a robot to explore a muddy area or a snowy field, what would you need to know about forces and surfaces?\"\n   - Discuss ideas briefly (e.g., robots need stronger wheels, more powerful motors to overcome friction).\n\n4. **Teacher role:** \n   - Facilitate discussion by asking: \"What force would the robot need to overcome friction on a rough surface?\"\n   - Prompt students to make connections: \"How is this like what you discovered earlier?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding of friction and force to predict outcomes in new situations.\n- Students justify predictions using learned vocabulary (force, friction, balanced/unbalanced).\n- Students recognize that surface choice affects motion and can explain why.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of forces, motion, and friction across all learning objectives.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage discussion (predictions reveal prior knowledge).\n- Monitor Explore investigations: Do students apply consistent force? Do they record data accurately?\n- Listen to explanations during group share-out (Do they reference surfaces and distance?).\n- Assess vocabulary use in Explain phase (Can they use \"force,\" \"friction,\" \"balanced,\" \"unbalanced\"?).\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) — Administer at end of lesson:**\nProvide each student with a sheet or digital form containing:\n\n1. **Short answer (with picture support):**\n   - \"Draw or describe: What happens when you push a robot? What forces are involved?\"\n\n2. **Multiple choice:**\n   - \"A robot is sitting still on concrete. Are the forces on the robot balanced or unbalanced?\"\n     - A) Balanced\n     - B) Unbalanced\n     - C) I'm not sure\n\n3. **Prediction question:**\n   - \"If a robot is pushed on a rough carpet and then on a smooth tile floor with the same force, which surface will it travel farther on? Why?\"\n\n4. **Reflection:**\n   - \"What did you learn about how surfaces affect motion?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Students correctly identify balanced forces (object at rest).\n- ✓ Students correctly identify unbalanced forces (object in motion after a push).\n- ✓ Students predict that smoother surfaces result in greater distance traveled.\n- ✓ Students use vocabulary (force, friction, motion) accurately in explanations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most Third Graders should demonstrate understanding that forces cause motion.\n- Students should recognize that friction (roughness of surface) affects distance traveled.\n- Students should move from describing observations (\"it went farther\") to explaining causes (\"less friction on smooth surfaces\").\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visual supports:**\n   - Pair written vocabulary with picture symbols and physical demonstrations throughout the lesson.\n   - Use hand-over-hand demonstrations for students who struggle with consistent pushing force.\n\n2. **Structured data recording:**\n   - Provide a partially filled data table with labels and units already in place; students only fill in numbers.\n   - Use a simple pictorial recording option instead of written explanations (draw the robot on the surface).\n\n3. **Peer partnerships:**\n   - Pair each struggling learner with a more confident partner during Explore; assign specific roles (one pushes, one measures, one records).\n   - During Explain, allow them to respond non-verbally (thumbs up/down) before expecting spoken explanations.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Multi-variable investigation:**\n   - Challenge students to test how **force strength** affects distance (soft push vs. hard push on same surface) in addition to surface type.\n   - Have them design a simple data table comparing two variables and write a conclusion.\n\n2. **Ramp and incline exploration:**\n   - Provide a ramp at different angles and ask: \"How does the angle of the ramp affect how far the robot travels? Which angle makes it go farthest?\"\n   - Students measure and graph results.\n\n3. **Design challenge:**\n   - Present the question: \"Design a path for the robot using three different surfaces. Order them so the robot travels the farthest total distance using what you know about friction.\"\n   - Students sketch and label their design with explanations.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Build a Race Track:**\n   - Students design and construct a simple track using blocks, cardboard, tape, and various textured surfaces.\n   - They predict which section the robot will move fastest on and test predictions.\n   - Connect to friction: \"Which surfaces slow down the robot the most?\"\n\n2. **Investigate Magnetic Forces (connection to 3-PS2-3):**\n   - If using a robot with magnetic capabilities, introduce: \"This robot has a magnet. Can forces work without touching? Let's test!\"\n   - Students explore what happens when they hold a magnet near the robot without contact.\n   - Extend learning: \"What other invisible forces exist?\" (gravity, static electricity).\n\n3. **Real-world Robot Research:**\n   - Show images of robots used in different environments (Mars rovers, underwater drones, warehouse robots).\n   - Discuss: \"Why do you think Mars rovers have different wheels than warehouse robots? What forces and surfaces do they need to handle?\"\n   - Students write or draw one thing robots need to overcome friction on their special surfaces.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Materials prep:** Prepare surfaces in advance (tape a section of concrete, grass, and carpet in accessible areas or simulate with textured paper).\n- **Robot choice:** Any small wheeled toy works; if the exact robot in the photo is unavailable, any consistent, predictable toy car or robot will demonstrate the concepts equally well.\n- **Timing flexibility:** This lesson can be compressed to 60 minutes (reduce Elaborate) or extended across two days (Session 1: Engage + Explore; Session 2: Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate).\n- **Safety:** Ensure testing areas are clear of obstacles and students push gently to maintain control.\n- **Connection to photograph:** Throughout the lesson, refer back to the robot in the picture to ground abstract concepts in concrete imagery students have already observed.",
