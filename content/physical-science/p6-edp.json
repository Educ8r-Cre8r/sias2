Your job: design a way to arrange and attach them to a piece of wood so they don't fall off or roll around when you move it. You can use string, clay, or tape. What works best?\n\n### 3-5\n**\"Design a Display Frame for Collected Natural Objects\"**\n\nYou have found various natural materials (seed pods, twigs, small stones, dried mushrooms) that you want to display permanently on a wooden board. Your design must:\n- Secure at least 8 objects in place so they remain stable when the board is tilted at 45°\n- Use only 3 types of fastening methods (e.g., string, hot glue, clips, small nails)\n- Keep the board lightweight enough for one person to carry\n- Leave at least 20% of the board surface visible\n\nTest your design by tilting and shaking the board. Which fastening method worked best for which object types?\n\n## EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem** — This real-world photo shows an actual collection challenge: how to organize and stabilize natural objects on a weathered surface. Students can observe the *problem* (objects scattered, at risk of loss or damage) and define what \"staying in place\" means before jumping to solutions.\n\n## Suggested Materials\n- Scrap wood or cardboard base\n- String, twine, or yarn\n- Hot glue gun or wood glue\n- Small nails, tacks, or pushpins\n- Clay or poster putty (reusable adhesive)\n- Collected natural objects: twigs, seed pods, pebbles, dried leaves\n\n## Estimated Time\n**45–60 minutes** (one session for K-2; one or two sessions for 3-5 depending on whether testing and iteration are included)\n\n## Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly addresses **3-5-ETS1-2: Generate and compare multiple solutions to a design problem** by requiring students to evaluate which fastening method works best for different material types and weights.",
