Demonstrate how a push or pull makes a bubble move in different directions.\n2. Observe and describe the colors they see on a bubble's surface.\n3. Predict what will happen when they gently push or pull a bubble.\n4. Compare how bubbles move when pushed with different amounts of force.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed image of the bubble photograph\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or smartboard. Have students sit in a circle where they can all see clearly.\n\n2. **Introduce with wonder:** \"Look at this amazing picture! A person is holding something special. What do you think it is? Turn to a friend and whisper your guess.\"\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (pause for responses after each):\n   - \"What colors do you see on this bubble? Can you name them?\" (Students identify: purple, pink, blue, yellow, green)\n   - \"Do you think this bubble is moving or staying still? How can you tell?\" (Students observe the stretched, wavey shape)\n   - \"If you gently blow on a bubble or wave your hand at it, what do you think would happen?\" (Elicit predictions about movement)\n   - \"Why do you think this bubble has so many beautiful colors? Where else have you seen rainbows?\" (Connect to prior knowledge)\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Today we're going to make our own bubbles and make them move in different ways. I wonder if a soft push will move the bubble the same way a big, strong push will. Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"First, we're going to play with bubbles and discover how to make them move. Then we'll talk about what we learned.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bubble solution (pre-made or purchased)\n- Bubble wands (1 per student or 1 per pair)\n- Shallow cups or small bowls with bubble solution\n- Open outdoor space or gymnasium\n- Colored construction paper (optional, for catching bubbles)\n- Teacher clipboard for observation notes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Get a bubble wand and dip it slowly into the bubble solution. Lift it out gently.\"\n\n2. \"Hold your wand up, but don't blow yet! Just watch what happens to the bubble on your wand.\"\n\n3. \"Now, gently blow on your wand to make a bubble. Watch where it goes.\"\n\n4. \"Try making a bubble and then giving it a very soft push with your hand. What happens?\" (Students observe motion)\n\n5. \"Make another bubble. This time, give it a bigger push. Does it move faster or slower than before?\" (Students compare force and motion)\n\n6. \"Try to make your bubble move in different directions. Can you push it to the left? To the right? Upward?\" (Students explore directional motion)\n\n7. \"Hold up your bubble and look at it carefully. What colors do you see? Try to count how many colors you can spot.\" (Students observe light effects)\n\n8. **Documentation:** As students explore, have them point to the colors on their bubbles. You (or a teaching assistant) can record observations on a simple checklist: \"Saw blue ☐ Saw purple ☐ Saw yellow ☐ Saw pink ☐\"\n\n**How the Activity Connects to the Photograph:**\nJust as the child in the photograph is holding and manipulating a bubble to show its colors and movement, students are doing the same thing, making their own discoveries about how bubbles respond to pushes and pulls.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate around the outdoor space, asking probing questions: \"What happened when you pushed that bubble softly?\" \"Can you make it go that direction again?\"\n- Do NOT tell students what will happen; let them discover through trial and error.\n- Help students who struggle to make bubbles by modeling the correct wand-dipping technique.\n- Ensure safety: remind students to be gentle with bubbles and not to poke or grab roughly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create bubbles and observe that they move when pushed or blown.\n- Students will notice that stronger pushes move bubbles faster or farther.\n- Students will observe rainbow colors on bubble surfaces.\n- Students will begin to understand that bubbles can move in different directions based on where the force is applied.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers (including colors: blue, purple, yellow, pink, green)\n- Bubble solution and wands (for teacher demonstration)\n- The original photograph\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a circle.** Say: \"Let's talk about what we discovered with our bubbles!\"\n\n2. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - \"Who can show us with their hands how they made a bubble move with a soft push?\" (Students demonstrate)\n   - \"Who made a bubble move with a bigger push? Was it different?\" (Elicit that stronger pushes moved bubbles faster)\n   - \"What colors did everyone see on your bubbles?\" (List colors on chart paper as students call them out)\n\n3. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** with Kindergarten-friendly definitions:\n\n   - **Push:** \"A push is when you use your hand or breath to move something away from you. Like this.\" (Demonstrate pushing a bubble)\n   \n   - **Pull:** \"A pull is when you move something toward you. Bubbles float, so we mostly push them, but we can move our hands to pull a bubble in different directions.\"\n   \n   - **Motion:** \"Motion means something is moving. Our bubbles had motion when they flew through the air!\"\n   \n   - **Force:** \"Force is when you push or pull with strength. A soft force moves a bubble gently. A big force moves it faster and farther.\"\n   \n   - **Light:** \"Light is what we see with our eyes. The sunshine made our bubbles show beautiful colors because light bounces off the bubble's skin.\"\n\n4. **Connections Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Hold up the photograph. \"Look! The child in this picture is showing us a bubble with colors. That's what YOU saw on YOUR bubbles! The colors happen because of light bouncing off the bubble.\"\n   - \"The child's hand is near the bubble. What do you think happened next? Did they push it? Did they blow on it?\" (Students hypothesize)\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your hand: What does a push look like?\" (Students mime pushing)\n   - \"If I blow a very soft breath on a bubble, will it go far, or will it go a little bit?\" (Students respond)\n   - \"Why did your bubbles have so many colors?\" (Light and the bubble's material)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|-----|\n| **Push** | When you use your hand or breath to move something away from you |\n| **Motion** | When something is moving and going from one place to another |\n| **Force** | The strength you use when you push or pull something |\n| **Light** | What you see with your eyes; light makes colors appear on bubbles |\n| **Color** | Different looks of light: red, blue, yellow, purple, pink, green |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain that pushes make bubbles move.\n- Students understand that different amounts of force (soft vs. strong) affect how far or fast a bubble moves.\n- Students recognize that light creates the colors on bubbles.\n- Students use words like \"push,\" \"motion,\" and \"color\" in their explanations.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bubble solution and multiple wands\n- Open space (indoors or outdoors)\n- Colored construction paper or white paper\n- Tape\n- Optional: hula hoops or chalk to mark target zones\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge: Bubble Target Motion**\n\n1. **Set up a simple scenario:** Create a \"target zone\" using chalk on pavement or a colored paper on the ground. Explain: \"Today, we're going to try to push our bubbles to land in the target zone. Some of us will use soft pushes, and some will use big, strong pushes. Let's see which one works better!\"\n\n2. **Student Instructions:**\n   - \"Make a bubble and gently blow it toward the target zone with a soft push of your hand.\"\n   - \"What happens? Does it reach the target?\"\n   - \"Now, try a bigger push. Do you have better luck?\"\n   - \"Try pushing your bubble in different directions—can you make it go left, then right, then up?\"\n\n3. **Discussion During Activity:**\n   - \"Which force worked better—soft or strong?\" (Students will likely discover that stronger pushes help bubbles reach targets, though variables like air currents also matter)\n   - \"How many different directions can you make your bubble move?\"\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - \"Bubbles float outside on windy days. The wind pushes them in different directions! When you blow bubbles, YOU are like the wind.\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen bubbles floating across the sky? What was pushing them?\" (Wind, breeze, air movement)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice about your bubble now?\" \"Can you predict where it will go?\"\n- Celebrate effort and observations, not just success: \"I see you're experimenting with different pushes!\"\n- Guide students to compare results without directing them to a single \"right answer.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding of force and motion to a new task (targeting).\n- Students make comparisons between soft and strong pushes.\n- Students connect bubble behavior to real-world phenomena (wind).\n- Students demonstrate increased control and intentionality in their bubble-making.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist** (teacher uses during Explore and Elaborate phases):\n  - ☐ Student created bubbles independently\n  - ☐ Student observed that bubbles move when pushed or blown\n  - ☐ Student identified colors on bubbles\n  - ☐ Student compared soft vs. strong pushes\n  - ☐ Student used vocabulary (push, pull, motion, force, light)\n\n- **Question Prompts During Activity:**\n  - \"Show me how you push your bubble gently. Now show me a big push.\"\n  - \"What colors do you see?\"\n  - \"What made your bubble move?\"\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket/Closing Circle):**\n\nGather students and ask these specific questions (accept verbal responses):\n\n1. **\"I'm going to make a bubble. Show me with your hand: should I push soft or push hard to make it move far?\"** (Correct answer: push hard; assesses understanding of force)\n\n2. **\"Why did your bubble have so many beautiful colors?\"** (Correct answer: light, sunshine, it bounced off the bubble; assesses understanding of light)\n\n3. **\"If I push a bubble to the left, where will it go?\"** (Correct answer: to the left; assesses understanding of directional motion)\n\n4. **\"Can you make a bubble and let me watch? Now push it gently. What happened?\"** (Observational assessment: student demonstrates push/pull and describes or shows motion)\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n| Objective | Level 1 (Emerging) | Level 2 (Developing) | Level 3 (Proficient) |\n|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Demonstrate push/pull and motion | Student needs help making bubbles | Student makes bubbles; motion is unclear | Student creates bubbles and clearly shows motion from push |\n| Observe colors | Student sees bubbles but doesn't mention colors | Student identifies 1-2 colors | Student identifies 3+ colors on bubbles |\n| Compare forces | Student doesn't compare pushes | Student attempts but results are unclear | Student clearly states soft vs. strong pushes cause different motion |\n| Use vocabulary | Uses no target vocabulary | Uses 1-2 terms (push, motion) | Uses 3+ terms (push, motion, force, light, color) |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most Kindergarten students will demonstrate understanding that pushes move objects and that different force strengths affect motion.\n- Students will recognize colors on bubbles and associate them with light.\n- Students will use simple language to describe their observations (\"The bubble went up,\" \"I pushed it,\" \"It has purple\").\n- A few students may make predictions about directional motion and force, indicating deeper understanding.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Hand-Over-Hand Bubble Making:**\n   - For students who struggle to create bubbles, physically guide their hand in the wand-dipping and blowing motion. Provide gentle, non-verbal support first, then fade guidance.\n   - Pair with a buddy who has mastered bubble creation.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Picture Cards:**\n   - Create simple picture cards showing \"push,\" \"motion,\" and \"light\" with illustrations. Point to these during discussions to reinforce vocabulary for students with emerging language skills.\n   - Use rebus sentences: \"Bubble → motion\" (arrow shows movement).\n\n3. **Shorter Exploration Time:**\n   - Allow students who tire easily to observe others making bubbles rather than create many bubbles themselves. Ask observational questions: \"What do you see happening to that bubble?\"\n\n### Challenge (for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Prediction and Testing:**\n   - Ask: \"If you push a bubble from the side, where will it go?\" Have students predict, then test their hypothesis. Encourage them to try multiple pushes from different angles.\n   - Introduce the idea of \"force direction\": \"Your push goes this way [point], so the bubble goes that way!\"\n\n2. **Describe Motion with Details:**\n   - Instead of just \"the bubble moved,\" ask advanced students to describe: \"Did it go fast or slow? Did it curve or go straight? How far did it go?\"\n   - Introduce the idea of distance: \"Can you make a bubble go farther than last time?\"\n\n3. **Connect to Wind and Air Movement:**\n   - Discuss: \"What other invisible forces move things? We can't see wind, but we see bubbles move. What else moves because of wind?\" (Leaves, trees, kites, hair)\n   - Create a simple experiment: \"Does a fan push bubbles faster than our hand?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bubble Painting (Art + Science Integration):**\n   - Add food coloring to bubble solution (safe, washable food coloring only).\n   - Have students blow bubbles onto white paper to create pop-art paintings.\n   - Discuss: \"The bubble popped! Did the color stay on the paper? What happened to the bubble's material?\"\n   - This extends learning about properties of materials and the temporary nature of bubbles.\n\n2. **Outdoor Wind Observation:**\n   - On a windy day, blow bubbles outside and observe how wind pushes them in different directions.\n   - Record observations: \"Did the wind push the bubbles fast or slow? Where did the wind push them?\"\n   - Connect to the photograph: \"Just like the child's hand pushed the bubble, the wind is pushing our bubbles now!\"\n\n3. **Rainbow Colors Hunt:**\n   - After the lesson, take students on a nature walk to find rainbows, prisms, or reflective surfaces.\n   - Discuss: \"We saw colors on the bubble because of light. What other things have rainbow colors? Can you find them?\"\n   - Create a class book: \"Colors We See in Our Classroom\" with pictures of colorful objects, labeled with color words.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Bubble Solution Recipe (if making from scratch):** 1 cup water, 2 tablespoons dish soap, 1 tablespoon corn syrup. Mix gently and let sit 1 hour before use.\n- **Safety Reminders:** Bubble solution can irritate eyes. Keep a damp cloth nearby. Supervise closely during outdoor exploration.\n- **Timing:** This lesson works well as two sessions—Day 1: Engage + Explore, Day 2: Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate. This allows time for drying if bubbles are used for art.\n- **Connection to Photo:** Throughout the lesson, repeatedly return to the photograph. Ask students: \"How is what YOU'RE doing like what the child in the picture is doing?\" This reinforces that they are scientists doing real investigations.",
