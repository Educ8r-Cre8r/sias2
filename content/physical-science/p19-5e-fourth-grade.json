ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity and activate prior thinking about how liquids mix and spread.\n\n#### Materials\n- Projected image or printed photograph of the jar with blue dye diffusing in water (p19.jpg)\n- One clear jar partially filled with water (demonstration jar, prepared just before lesson)\n- Blue food coloring or liquid watercolor\n- Eyedropper or pipette\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display the Photograph:**\n- Show the image on the projector or display it on a document camera. Do not explain it yet.\n- Let students look silently for 10 seconds, then ask them to turn to a neighbor and share what they see.\n\n**Discussion Questions (pose these one at a time, allowing 30-60 seconds of think-pair-share time before discussion):**\n1. \"What colors do you see in this jar? Where is the color, and where is it not?\"\n2. \"Do you see any lines or brushes in the jar? How do you think the blue color got mixed into the water if nobody is stirring it?\"\n3. \"If we waited one more hour, what do you think this jar would look like? Why?\"\n4. \"What questions do you have about what's happening in this jar?\"\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n\"I wonder if we added MORE blue color to the jar right now, would it mix faster or slower than it's mixing right now? Let's find out!\"\n\n#### Transition\n\"Today, we're going to be detectives and discover exactly how and why colors spread through water—and we're going to test whether warm water and cold water make a difference.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents hands-on investigate how temperature affects the rate of diffusion through direct experimentation.\n\n#### Materials\n- Clear cups or jars (two per student pair): one filled with room-temperature water, one pre-filled with warm water (about 110°F / 43°C, warm but safe to touch), and one with cold water (add ice cubes 5 minutes before)\n- Blue or red food coloring (same color for all groups)\n- Eyedroppers or pipettes (one per pair)\n- Stopwatches or timer (phones or class timer projected)\n- Paper towels\n- Observation sheet (template provided below)\n- Pencil or crayon for recording\n\n#### Student Directions (written on board or chart and read aloud)\n\n1. **Gather your materials.** Make sure you have three cups: one with cold water (with ice), one with room-temperature water, and one with warm water. Do NOT touch the warm water with your bare hands for long—use the cup handles.\n\n2. **Predict first.** On your observation sheet, draw or write: \"Which cup do you think the color will spread through FASTEST? Why?\"\n\n3. **Add one drop.** Use your eyedropper to add ONE DROP of blue food coloring to the cold water cup. Watch what happens. Start your timer RIGHT when you drop the color in.\n\n4. **Count and watch.** Count how many seconds it takes for the blue color to completely mix with the water and turn the WHOLE cup a solid color (no more stripes or clouds of blue). Write down the number.\n\n5. **Repeat for room temperature.** Let that cup sit. Quickly rinse your eyedropper with water, then add ONE DROP to the room-temperature cup. Time how long it takes to fully mix. Record the number.\n\n6. **Repeat for warm water.** Rinse your eyedropper again, then add ONE DROP to the warm water cup. Time and record.\n\n7. **Compare.** Look at all three numbers. Which mixed fastest? Which was slowest? Draw or write your discovery on your observation sheet.\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- **Before the lesson:** Prepare water temperatures and test them yourself to ensure safety.\n- **During the activity:** Circulate to each pair and ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n  - \"What do you notice happening in the cold cup right now?\"\n  - \"Is the color spreading at the same speed in both cups, or is one faster?\"\n  - \"Why do you think warm water might be different from cold water?\"\n- **Manage safety:** Remind students not to drink the water and to use cup holders for warm water.\n- **Monitor timing:** Help students start their timers together so results are comparable.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students will observe that blue dye spreads fastest in warm water, moderately in room-temperature water, and slowest in cold water.\n- Students will collect and record numerical data (time in seconds for each temperature).\n- Students will make a visual or written prediction that may or may not match actual results, showing their thinking process.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to the scientific concept of diffusion and energy transfer.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- The original photograph (p19.jpg)\n- Optional: a short video clip (1-2 minutes) showing diffusion in action (YouTube search \"food coloring diffusion time lapse\" for age-appropriate options)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\n- Ask 3-4 student pairs to share their timing results aloud. Write the numbers on a chart so the class can see the pattern.\n- Ask: \"What pattern do you see? Did warm, cold, or room-temperature water mix the fastest?\"\n- Guide students to verbalize: \"Warm water made the color spread faster.\"\n\n**Introduce Key Vocabulary with Definitions:**\n\n1. **Diffusion** - The movement of tiny, tiny pieces (called *particles*) of something—like color or smell—from where there are lots of them to where there are fewer of them. It happens all on its own, without anyone stirring.\n\n2. **Particles** - Super tiny pieces of matter that are so small you can't see them, but they're everywhere in solids, liquids, and gases. In this jar, water particles and color particles are bumping into each other.\n\n3. **Energy** - The ability to make something move or change. Heat is one type of energy. Warm water has MORE heat energy than cold water.\n\n4. **Heat (Thermal Energy)** - Energy that makes things feel hot or warm. Heat makes particles move faster and bump into each other more often.\n\n**Connect Back to the Photograph and Explore Activity:**\n- Show the photograph again: \"In this jar, someone dropped blue color into water, just like you did. The color is spreading all by itself—that's diffusion. The blue stripes and clouds you see are what diffusion looks like while it's happening.\"\n- Point to the photograph: \"In your experiment, the warm water diffusion happened so fast that you might not have seen as many blue stripes—it was done mixing faster! The cold water stayed in blue stripes longer because the particles were moving slower.\"\n- Explain: \"Here's the secret: When water is warmer, its tiny particles are jiggling and moving faster. When color particles meet water particles that are moving fast, they bump around and spread out quicker. Cold water particles move slower, so it takes longer.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\nAsk these questions and have students show with thumbs up/down or turn-and-talk:\n- \"If I added a drop of red color to very, VERY hot water, what would happen to it compared to cold water?\"\n- \"Can you give me an example of diffusion you've seen in real life?\" (Hint examples: tea steeping, cooking smells filling the kitchen, perfume smell spreading across a room)\n\n#### Vocabulary\n- **Diffusion** - Tiny particles of one substance moving through another substance on their own, spreading out evenly over time.\n- **Particles** - Invisible tiny pieces of all matter (solids, liquids, and gases) that are always moving.\n- **Energy** - The ability to make things move or change; heat is one type of energy.\n- **Heat/Thermal Energy** - The energy that makes things warm and makes particles move faster.\n- **Temperature** - How hot or cold something is; measured in degrees.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students can explain that diffusion is when color (or other particles) spread through water on their own.\n- Students can describe that heat makes particles move faster, which makes diffusion happen faster.\n- Students connect their observations from the Explore phase to the new vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply their understanding by designing a solution to slow down or stop diffusion.\n\n#### Materials\n- Clear cups filled with room-temperature water (one per pair)\n- Food coloring (same color)\n- Eyedroppers\n- Variety of barrier materials: coffee filters, paper towels, plastic wrap, cheesecloth, aluminum foil, small mesh strainers, cotton balls\n- Optional: small plastic bags or containers for organizing materials\n- Design sheet (template provided below)\n- Pencils and crayons\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Design Challenge Introduction:**\n\"Now that you know how diffusion works, here's a challenge: Can you design a barrier—something that will SLOW DOWN or STOP the blue color from mixing into the water? You have these materials to choose from. Your job is to pick ONE or TWO materials, create your barrier in the water, add a drop of color, and see if it works. Then you'll improve your design!\"\n\n**Student Steps:**\n\n1. **Choose Your Barrier.** Look at the materials. Pick one or two that you think might slow down the color's spreading. Write or draw your choice on your design sheet.\n\n2. **Build Your Barrier.** Place your chosen material(s) in the cup of water. You can layer them, ball them up, or arrange them however you want—just make sure the material is IN or ON the water.\n\n3. **Test It.** Drop ONE drop of color onto or near your barrier. Watch for 30 seconds.\n\n4. **Record What Happened.** Draw or write: Did the color go through? Did it stop the color? Did it slow it down? Rate your design with a star (★) or smiley face: ☺ (worked great), ○ (worked a little), ☹ (didn't work).\n\n5. **Improve It.** If it didn't work well, try a different material or layer it differently. Repeat steps 3-4.\n\n6. **Share Your Best Design.** Be ready to show the class your best barrier and explain why you think it worked (or didn't work).\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- **Facilitate without solving:** If a student says, \"This didn't work,\" respond with: \"What did you observe? What do you think happened? What would you try next?\"\n- **Ask guiding questions:** \"Why do you think that material might slow down the color?\" \"What's different about that material compared to the first one you tried?\"\n- **Celebrate thinking:** Affirm both successful designs and thoughtful failures: \"That didn't work the way you hoped, but you learned something important!\"\n- **Time management:** Give a 2-minute warning before wrapping up so students can complete final tests.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students will construct a barrier and test its effectiveness.\n- Students will observe that some materials block or slow diffusion better than others.\n- Students will refine their design based on evidence and make a second attempt.\n- Students will explain their reasoning for why a material worked or didn't work, connecting back to particles and diffusion.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of diffusion, the role of temperature, and the ability to apply concepts to a new problem.\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation notes during Explore phase: Can students set up the experiment safely? Do they record data accurately? Are their predictions changing based on observations?\n- Questioning during Explain phase: Listen to student responses when asked about real-life examples of diffusion. Note who connects ideas and who needs clarification.\n- During Elaborate: Watch students' design choices. Do they reference temperature, particles, or energy when explaining their choices?\n\n**Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes, given at the end of the lesson or second session):**\n\nDisplay these three questions on the board. Students write or draw their answers on an index card or half-sheet:\n\n1. **Draw a picture:** Show what happens when you drop blue color into cold water. Label your drawing if you can.\n\n2. **Fill in the blank:** \"When water is _____, the color spreads faster because the tiny particles are moving _____.\"\n\n3. **Explain:** \"If you put a paper towel inside a cup before adding water and color, what would happen to the color? Why?\"\n\n#### Success Criteria\n- **Proficient:** Student can describe diffusion using at least one vocabulary term (diffusion, particles, energy, or heat), explains the connection between temperature and diffusion speed, and applies the concept to the barrier design with reasonable justification.\n- **Developing:** Student describes some observation but may confuse cause and effect; needs support with vocabulary or explaining the role of temperature.\n- **Beginning:** Student observes changes but does not yet connect them to particles, energy, or the role of temperature; needs significant scaffolding and concrete examples.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- **Most students** will understand that color spreads through water (diffusion) and that warm water makes it happen faster because heat makes particles move faster.\n- **Some students** will use correct vocabulary and explain the mechanism clearly.\n- **Some students** will need follow-up conversations to solidify vocabulary and the particle model.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a sheet with images and checkboxes instead of open-ended writing prompts. Example: \"In cold water, the color spread: ☐ very fast ☐ medium speed ☐ very slow.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Support:** Create a word bank with pictures of diffusion, particles, temperature, and energy. Students can point to or place words on their sheets rather than generating language independently.\n\n3. **Buddy System for Explore:** Pair struggling learners with strong observers. Assign roles: one watches and describes, the other records and times. Rotate roles.\n\n4. **Simplified Barrier Challenge:** Provide 2-3 pre-selected materials instead of a large variety. Guide the student to make a prediction: \"Will this material stop the color?\" Then test.\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n1. **Multiple Variables:** Ask advanced students to test THREE variables: (a) temperature, (b) amount of color (one drop vs. three drops), and (c) type of liquid (water vs. salt water vs. oil). They predict which will change the outcome and record comparisons.\n\n2. **Particle Model Drawing:** Ask students to draw a model of particles in cold water vs. warm water using circles to represent particles. Ask: \"How would you show that warm-water particles move faster?\"\n\n3. **Real-World Application:** Challenge students to research or hypothesize why tea steeps faster in hot water than cold water. Write a paragraph or create a comic strip explaining the science.\n\n4. **Refined Barrier Design:** Ask advanced students to layer multiple materials intentionally and test a hypothesis: \"Does layering make the barrier work better?\" Encourage them to write a simple procedure and results summary.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Smell Diffusion Investigation:** Bring in scent samples (vanilla extract, lemon juice, a scented marker). Have students close their eyes and predict how far away they can smell it. Move slowly farther back and record the distance. Discuss: \"Is this diffusion? How is it the same as the color spreading in water? How is it different?\" (Introduces diffusion in gases.)\n\n2. **Temperature and Dissolving:** Give students sugar or salt and cups of water at different temperatures. Ask: \"Does warm water dissolve sugar faster than cold water?\" This extends the concept of energy affecting how particles interact, but with a different substance.\n\n3. **Design a \"Clean-Up\" Device:** Present a scenario: \"A factory accidentally spilled blue dye into a river. Design a system to remove or slow the spread of color.\" Students can sketch or build a prototype using craft materials, connecting to 4-PS3-4 (design a device that converts or manages energy/matter).\n\n4. **Diffusion in Agar (Optional, advanced/take-home):** For motivated families, provide instructions to grow food coloring in gelatin (agar substitute). Students observe diffusion over several days and document with photographs or drawings. This shows diffusion in a solid-like medium.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing is flexible:** If you teach in two sessions, do Engage and Explore in Session 1, then Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate in Session 2.\n- **Water temperature safety:** Test warm water on your own wrist before students use it. Warm, not hot (aim for 110–120°F / 43–49°C). Provide cup holders or tongs if needed.\n- **Consistent food coloring:** Use the same brand/color for all groups so results are comparable.\n- **Advance prep:** Fill cups with water 10 minutes before the Explore phase so ice has time to chill water and warm water stays warm.\n- **Real-world connections to emphasize:** Tea steeping, cooking smells, perfume, air fresheners, food coloring in frosting, ink in markers—students live with diffusion every day!",
