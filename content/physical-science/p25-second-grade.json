You can see the same flowers reflected in the table's smooth surface like a mirror.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe **Anchoring Phenomenon** is **reflection** - the bouncing of light off smooth surfaces. The polished table acts like a mirror because its smooth surface bounces light rays back at the same angle they hit it. This creates a clear image of the flowers that appears to be underneath the table. Reflection happens when light cannot pass through a material and instead bounces back to our eyes.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Light travels in straight lines** - Light rays move from the flowers to the table surface in straight paths\n2. **Smooth surfaces reflect light clearly** - The polished table creates a mirror-like reflection because it has no bumps or scratches\n3. **Rough surfaces scatter light** - Unlike the smooth table, the textured wall behind doesn't show clear reflections\n4. **We see objects when light bounces off them** - The flowers are visible because light reflects off their petals to our eyes\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use a flashlight and various materials (mirror, aluminum foil, sandpaper, fabric) to let students discover which surfaces create the clearest reflections. This hands-on exploration builds understanding before introducing vocabulary.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways to explore reflection: tactile experiences with different textured materials, visual demonstrations with flashlights, and kinesthetic activities where students act as \"light rays\" bouncing off different \"surfaces\" (classmates).</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** At the microscopic level, smooth surfaces have tiny particles arranged in orderly, flat patterns that bounce light rays back evenly. Rough surfaces have particles that stick out in different directions, scattering light rays everywhere.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** Reflection is essential in nature's larger systems - calm lake surfaces reflect mountains and sky, animals use reflection for camouflage, and solar panels position themselves to reflect sunlight efficiently for clean energy.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"The reflection is another set of real flowers under the table.\"\n   **Clarification:** Reflections are images created by bouncing light, not real objects in a different location.\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"Only mirrors can show reflections.\"\n   **Clarification:** Any smooth, shiny surface can create reflections - water, polished metal, glass, or glossy tables.\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"Dark objects don't reflect light.\"\n   **Clarification:** All objects reflect some light (that's how we see them), but lighter and shinier objects reflect more light.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 1-PS4-3 Plan and conduct investigations to determine the effect of placing objects made with different materials in the path of a beam of light.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-PS4.B]] - Objects can be seen if light is available to illuminate them or if they give off their own light\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] - Simple tests can be designed to gather evidence to support or refute student ideas about causes\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What would happen to the reflection if we made the table surface rough with sandpaper? (Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 2)\n\n2. Why can you see the flowers clearly in the table but not in the wall behind them? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. How is the reflection the same as the real flowers? How is it different? (Bloom's: Compare | DOK: 1)\n\n4. What other places in our classroom or school show reflections like this table? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Reflection:** When light bounces off an object back to your eyes\n* **Smooth:** Having a flat surface with no bumps or scratches\n* **Light ray:** A straight line that shows the path light travels\n* **Surface:** The outside or top part of something you can touch\n* **Scatter:** To spread out in many different directions\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- Mirrors by Marion Dane Bauer\n- Light: Shadows, Mirrors, and Rainbows by Natalie M.
