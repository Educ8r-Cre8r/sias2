ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how light is made using electricity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the photograph (or display on interactive board)\n- Flashlight or small lamp for classroom demonstration\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around printed copies. Ask students to gather on the carpet and look closely.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - *\"What do you see in the picture?\"* (Expected: a light bulb, people's hands, a battery)\n   - *\"Why do you think the bulb is glowing? What is making it light up?\"* (Expected answers will vary; accept all ideas)\n   - *\"Have you ever seen a light bulb turn on at home? How does it work?\"* (Activate prior knowledge about batteries, switches, plugs)\n   - *\"What happens if we take the wires away—will the bulb still light up?\"* (Prediction question)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Hold up your classroom flashlight and turn it on and off. Say: *\"This flashlight has a battery inside, just like the one in our picture. I wonder... what do the wires and battery do together to make the light?\"* Encourage students to share their ideas.\n\n4. **Write student predictions** on chart paper so you can revisit them at the end.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to build our own light-up circuit, just like the one in the picture, and discover how electricity makes light!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how circuits work by building a simple light-up device.\n\n**Materials (per pair/small group):**\n- One AA or AAA battery (in a battery holder, if available)\n- One 2–3 inch LED bulb or small incandescent bulb (pre-wired, e.g., from a basic circuit kit) OR bare LED with pre-stripped wires\n- Two short lengths (6–8 inches) of insulated copper wire, stripped at both ends\n- Clear tape or electrical tape\n- One optional clear plastic cup or clear bag (for shadow investigation)\n- One aluminum foil square (5×5 inches)\n- One white paper square (5×5 inches)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Teacher setup:** Before the lesson, create 3–4 \"demo stations\" with materials pre-organized so students can grab and go. Alternatively, work with small groups while others do a partner drawing activity.\n\n2. **Step-by-step student directions** (demonstrate each step on the document camera or with a physical demo):\n   - *\"Touch one wire to the positive end of the battery (the + side). Hold it with your thumb.\"*\n   - *\"Touch the other wire to the negative end of the battery (the – side). Hold it with your finger.\"*\n   - *\"Now touch both wires to the bulb at the same time. What happens?\"*\n   - *\"Draw or write what you see: Does the light come on? Is it bright or dim?\"*\n\n3. **Connection to photograph:** Point back to the image and say: *\"Look—in our picture, the wires are touching the battery and the bulb, just like you're doing! That's called a circuit. The electricity travels from the battery through the wires to the bulb, and that makes light!\"*\n\n4. **Exploration extension** (for students who succeed quickly):\n   - *\"Now cover the bulb with aluminum foil. Can you still see the light? What if you cover it with white paper instead? What's different?\"*\n   - Record observations with pictures or words.\n\n5. **What students should record:**\n   - Simple drawings labeled \"Light on\" or \"Light off\"\n   - One-word descriptions: bright, dim, works, broken\n   - Pictures showing what blocked the light and what didn't\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and observe without immediately fixing broken circuits.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"What's touching the battery? Is both wires connected to the bulb?\"*\n- Resist the urge to tell; instead, ask: *\"What do you think would happen if we moved this wire?\"*\n- Celebrate effort and perseverance with phrases like: *\"I see you're experimenting! Tell me what you tried.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully light up a bulb (or discover why it didn't work through troubleshooting).\n- Students observe that different materials (foil vs. paper) affect whether they can see the light.\n- Students realize that wires must touch both the battery and the bulb for light to happen.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of circuits and light.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple icons\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Student notebooks or paper for drawing/recording\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:**\n   - Invite 3–4 students to show their light-up circuits to the class.\n   - Ask: *\"What did you do to make the light turn on?\"* and *\"What happened when you covered it with foil?\"*\n   - Record their observations on chart paper: *\"The light works when the wires touch the battery and bulb\" / \"Foil blocked some light, but paper let some light through.\"*\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** (write each word on chart paper with a simple picture):\n\n   - **Electricity:** The invisible energy that comes from a battery and makes things work (like lights and toys). *Draw a battery and zigzag lines showing energy flowing out.*\n   \n   - **Circuit:** A complete loop or path that electricity travels through to make something work. *Draw a circle with battery, wires, and bulb labeled.*\n   \n   - **Battery:** A container that stores energy and releases it to make electricity flow. *Draw a cylinder with + and – symbols.*\n   \n   - **Light:** The bright energy we can see. *Draw a bulb with rays around it.*\n   \n   - **Conductor:** A material that lets electricity flow through easily (like metal wires). *Show a wire.*\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the image and say: *\"In this picture, the person is holding a circuit. The battery is right here (point), the wires are here, and the bulb is up here. Electricity flows from the battery through the wires to make the bulb light up!\"*\n   - Ask: *\"Do you see how the wires are touching the battery and the bulb? If one wire wasn't touching, the circuit would be broken, and the light would turn off.\"*\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: *\"What do we need to make a light turn on? Can you name the three parts?\"* (Battery, wires, bulb)\n   - Show the circuit and ask: *\"Is this a complete circuit or a broken circuit? How do you know?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the parts of a simple circuit: battery, wires, bulb.\n- Students understand that light helps us see.\n- Students recognize that a complete circuit is needed for electricity to flow and make light.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply circuit concepts by investigating which materials block light and which let it shine through.\n\n**Materials (per pair):**\n- One working circuit from Explore phase (or a pre-made demo circuit)\n- Variety of test materials (pre-cut 3×3 inch squares):\n  - Clear plastic wrap\n  - Wax paper\n  - Aluminum foil\n  - Black construction paper\n  - Colored tissue paper\n  - Cotton gauze\n  - Frosted plastic sheet\n- One white wall or poster board (as a \"screen\" to project light against)\n- Clipboard and observation recording sheet (with picture boxes for each material)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up a \"light investigation station\":**\n   - Dim the classroom lights or close blinds partway.\n   - Have students take turns holding their circuit so the bulb shines on a white surface.\n   - Place each test material between the bulb and the white surface.\n\n2. **Step-by-step directions for students:**\n   - *\"Hold your lit bulb near the white paper or wall.\"*\n   - *\"Now place one material between the bulb and the paper. Does light shine through? Can you see the bulb's glow on the other side?\"*\n   - *\"Try the next material. Is it the same or different?\"*\n   - *\"Draw or color in your observation sheet: Light came through / Light was blocked.\"*\n\n3. **Real-world connection:**\n   - Say: *\"In the picture, someone is using a bulb with a metal tool. If they put this circuit in a dark room, the light would help them see. But what if they wanted to hide the light? Which of our materials would work best?\"*\n   - Encourage students to think about windows, curtains, and why we use certain materials in our homes.\n\n4. **Teacher facilitation:**\n   - Ask follow-up questions: *\"Why do you think plastic lets light through but foil doesn't?\"*\n   - Prompt comparison: *\"Which material let the most light through? Which blocked it the most?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that translucent and transparent materials allow more light to pass through than opaque ones.\n- Students can sort materials into categories: \"Light comes through\" and \"Light is blocked.\"\n- Students apply their understanding to a new investigation independently.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of circuits, electricity, and light.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore phase:\n  - ☐ Student successfully connects wires to battery and bulb\n  - ☐ Student predicts whether light will come through each material\n  - ☐ Student adjusts their circuit when it doesn't work (troubleshoots)\n  - ☐ Student uses vocabulary: battery, circuit, light, electricity\n\n- **Listen to student explanations** during share-out and ask clarifying questions:\n  - *\"Show me the three parts of your circuit.\"*\n  - *\"Why do you think the light won't turn on?\"*\n  - *\"What did you learn about foil and paper?\"*\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (provide 3 options so students can show understanding in their preferred way):**\n\n**Option 1 – Draw & Label:**\nDraw a simple circuit with a battery, wires, and a bulb. Label each part. (Assessment: All three parts present and correctly labeled.)\n\n**Option 2 – Answer These Questions (show with pictures or words):**\n1. *What do we need to make light with electricity?* (Expected: battery, wires, bulb)\n2. *What happened when you covered the bulb with foil?* (Expected: The light was blocked / I couldn't see it)\n3. *Why is the light important?* (Expected: It helps us see in the dark)\n\n**Option 3 – Circle or Color:**\nShow pictures of 4 different circuits. Circle the ones that would light up. (Expected: Students correctly identify complete vs. broken circuits.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Students can identify the three main parts of a circuit.\n- ✓ Students explain that electricity from the battery makes the light.\n- ✓ Students predict whether materials will let light through or block it.\n- ✓ Students troubleshoot a broken circuit by checking connections.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can name the three parts of a circuit without prompting.\n- Most students can explain in simple terms why light turned on or off.\n- Students demonstrate understanding through drawings and verbal explanations appropriate to First Grade level.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Pre-made circuits:** Provide fully assembled circuits where students only need to touch wires to the battery to see results. Reduce the troubleshooting demand and focus on observation.\n\n2. **Visual supports:** Create a picture card showing the three circuit parts (battery, wire, bulb) that students can reference while building. Use arrows to show the path electricity travels.\n\n3. **Pair with strong peers:** Have struggling students work with patient partners who can model the steps. Use think-aloud language: *\"First, I'm touching this wire to the + side. Now I'm touching the other wire to the bulb...\"*\n\n4. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use just *battery*, *wire*, and *light* during Explore. Introduce *electricity* and *circuit* later, once the concrete experience is solid.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Build a switch:** Provide additional materials (paper clip, brass fastener, cardboard) and guide students to create a simple switch that turns their circuit on and off. Ask: *\"How can we make a lever that breaks and fixes the circuit?\"*\n\n2. **Investigate multiple bulbs:** Provide two bulbs and ask: *\"What happens if we add another bulb to the circuit? Does it stay as bright?\"* Students compare brightness and predict why.\n\n3. **Design a practical use:** Ask: *\"Where could we use a circuit like this? Design a flashlight, a night light for a dark place, or a tool light for a toolbox. Sketch or build your idea.\"*\n\n4. **Reverse engineering:** Show a broken flashlight or toy and ask students to predict what's inside and why it doesn't work. Discuss what parts might be missing or disconnected.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Light Hunt Around the Classroom/School:**\n   - Take students on a walk to identify all the places where lights help people see or work safely (hallway lights, desk lamps, exit signs, streetlights outside).\n   - Draw or list the lights and discuss: *\"Why is light important in that place? What would happen if the light went out?\"*\n   - Connect to real-world electricity and safety.\n\n2. **Shadow Play & Light Investigation:**\n   - Dim the lights and use student circuits (or a flashlight) to cast shadows on a white sheet or wall.\n   - Have students use their hands, objects, and the light to create shadows.\n   - Discuss: *\"Why can we see the shadow? What happens if we move the light closer or farther away?\"*\n   - Record observations: *\"Big shadow / small shadow / light shadow / dark shadow.\"*\n   - Connect to 1-PS4-2 (objects in darkness need light to be seen).\n\n3. **Create a \"Bright Ideas\" Journal:**\n   - Send students home with a simple one-page activity: *\"Draw three places at home where electricity makes light. Ask a family member: Why do we need that light?\"*\n   - Students share responses in class the next day.\n   - Create a class book: *\"Lights in Our Lives\"* with student pages stapled together.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Check all batteries and bulbs before the lesson. Use only low-voltage, age-appropriate circuit kits. Supervise group rotations closely.\n- **Prep:** Assemble 4–5 working demo circuits in advance so students have models to reference if they struggle.\n- **Timing flexibility:** If students are deeply engaged in Explore, extend that phase. If they finish quickly, move straight to Elaborate without rushing Explain.\n- **Vocabulary exposure:** First graders need multiple exposures to new words. Revisit *circuit*, *electricity*, and *conductor* in future lessons about magnets, sound, and pushes/pulls.\n- **Photo reference:** Display the original photograph throughout all five phases so students continuously make connections between the lesson activity and the real-world example.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly scaffolds First Grade understanding of energy, light, and how materials interact with light—building toward more complex circuit investigations in upper grades.",
