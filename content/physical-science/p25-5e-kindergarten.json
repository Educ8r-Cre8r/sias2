Observe and describe how light from a source (lamp, sunlight) makes objects bright and visible.\n2. Identify and point to shadows created when light is blocked by objects.\n3. Compare transparent and opaque materials and describe what light does with each.\n4. Predict and test what happens to shadows when light moves or changes direction.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about light, shadows, and bright objects using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printout or digital display of the photograph (p25.jpg)\n- Pointer stick or laser pointer (optional)\n- Classroom lights (can be dimmed if safe to do so)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen where all students can see clearly. Say: \"Look at this beautiful picture. I want you to look very carefully at what you notice.\"\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions:**\n   - \"What do you see that is bright in this picture? Point to it!\"\n   - \"Where is the light coming from? What makes the flowers so red and bright?\"\n   - \"Do you see any dark areas? What do you think made those dark spots?\" (Guide students to notice shadows under and around the flowers.)\n   - \"If we turned off the lamp above the flowers, what do you think would happen?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder... if I put something in front of the light, what would happen to the flowers? Would they still be bright, or would they become dark? Turn to a friend and whisper your idea.\"\n\n4. **Listen for student responses.** Accept all ideas without judgment. Celebrate curious thinking.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking, friends! Now we're going to do an experiment with light and shadows to discover what really happens. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how light travels, what blocks it, and how shadows form through hands-on discovery.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 desk lamp or bright flashlight per pair/small group (ensure bulbs are cool; use LED if possible)\n- Clear glass vases or clear plastic cups (1 per group)\n- Flowers, branches, or craft materials (silk flowers work well for safety)\n- White paper or white poster board (1 sheet per group)\n- Various small opaque objects (wooden blocks, toy cars, erasers, small dolls)\n- Water for vases (optional; use for real flowers only with caution)\n\n**Activity: Hands-On Light and Shadow Investigation**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Sit in a small group with your teacher or partner. On your table, you see a lamp, a vase with flowers, and some objects.\"\n\n2. \"First, let's turn ON the lamp and look at the flowers. What do you see? Is the vase bright? Can you see the flowers clearly? Draw or point to show what you see.\"\n\n3. \"Now, let's move a small object between the lamp and the flowers. Watch carefully! What happens to the light? Do you see a shadow? Where is it?\"\n\n4. \"Take turns putting different objects in front of the light. Try a wooden block. Try a toy. What shadows do you see on the white paper? Are the shadows big or small? Dark or light?\"\n\n5. \"Now let's try something new. Turn OFF the lamp. What do you see now? Can you see the flowers? Are they bright or dark? Turn the lamp back ON. What changed?\"\n\n6. **Documentation:** Have students draw or place stickers on a worksheet showing:\n   - Where the light came from (draw an arrow)\n   - Where they saw a shadow\n   - What object made the shadow\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What did you notice when you moved the block? Why do you think the shadow got bigger/smaller?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answer; guide them to observe and describe.\n- Ensure students take turns and handle materials safely.\n- Use a checklist to note which students can identify light sources, shadows, and cause-effect relationships.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that objects block light and create shadows.\n- Students discover that shadows change when the object or light source moves.\n- Students notice that the lamp is a source of light energy.\n- Students can point to or draw where shadows appear.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect observations to light energy concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Photograph (p25.jpg) displayed again\n- Markers\n- Picture cards of light sources (sun, lamp, flashlight, fire—use clipart if needed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 groups to share their discoveries: \"What did you find out about the light and shadows?\"\n   - Record student language on chart paper (e.g., \"The block made a dark shadow,\" \"When we moved the light, the shadow moved\").\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   \n   Create a simple anchor chart as you explain each term. Use the photograph to point to examples.\n\n   - **Light:** Energy that helps us see things. Light comes from sources like lamps and the sun. Point to the lamp in the photograph.\n   - **Shadow:** A dark area that forms when light is blocked by an object. Show the shadows under the flowers in the photo.\n   - **Opaque (oh-PAK):** A material that light cannot pass through; it blocks light and makes a shadow. The flowers are opaque!\n   - **Transparent (trans-PAIR-ent):** A material that light CAN pass through. You can see through it. The glass vase is transparent.\n   - **Blocks:** When something gets in the way of light, it blocks the light.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the lamp in the photo: \"This lamp gives off light energy. The light travels and hits the beautiful red flowers.\"\n   - Point to shadows: \"See these dark areas? The flowers are blocking the light, so shadows appear.\"\n   - Point to the vase: \"The glass is clear—light passes right through it. But the flowers inside block some light and make shadows.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can you point to the light source in our photograph?\" (Lamp.)\n   - Ask: \"Can you show me where a shadow is?\" (Under flowers, on table.)\n   - Ask: \"Is the vase opaque or transparent? How do you know?\" (Transparent—we can see through it.)\n\n**Vocabulary Summary:**\n- **Light:** Energy that lets us see; comes from sources like lamps and the sun.\n- **Shadow:** Dark area made when an object blocks light.\n- **Opaque:** Something light cannot pass through; it blocks light.\n- **Transparent:** Something light can pass through; you can see through it.\n- **Blocks:** Gets in the way of light.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name a light source (lamp, sun, flashlight).\n- Students understand that shadows form when light is blocked.\n- Students can identify transparent materials (clear glass) vs. opaque objects (flowers, blocks).\n- Students use words like \"light,\" \"shadow,\" and \"blocks\" in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a shadow puppet activity and predicting light behavior in new contexts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Flashlight or desk lamp (1 per group)\n- White sheet or white butcher paper taped to wall\n- Small opaque objects or hand puppets (stuffed animals, wooden shapes, action figures)\n- Chart paper for predictions\n\n**Activity: Shadow Puppet Theater**\n\n1. **Setup:** Tape a white sheet to the wall or hold it vertically. Position the light source 2-3 feet in front of the sheet. Darken the room slightly (safe, supervised conditions only).\n\n2. **Exploration (8 minutes):**\n   - \"We're going to make shadow puppets! Hold an object or stuffed animal between the light and the white sheet. What do you see on the white sheet?\"\n   - Students take turns creating shadows and experimenting with moving objects closer/farther from the light.\n   - \"What happens to the shadow when your object gets closer to the light? Farther away?\"\n\n3. **Prediction and Application (7 minutes):**\n   - Show students a new scenario: \"If we use TWO lights, what might happen to the shadow? Would it be bigger, smaller, or would we see two shadows?\"\n   - Let students predict, then test with a second light source if available.\n   - Ask: \"Can you think of a time you've seen a shadow outside? Where was the sun? Where was the shadow?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate turn-taking and safe handling of materials.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Why did your shadow get bigger? Can you explain it to a friend?\"\n- Encourage students to predict before testing: \"What do you think will happen if...?\"\n- Celebrate creative shadow designs and scientific thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that shadows change size based on distance from the light source.\n- Students can predict shadow behavior in new scenarios.\n- Students apply concepts to real-world examples (shadows outdoors, shadows in their classroom).\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding through play and experimentation.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light sources, shadows, transparent and opaque materials, and light blocking.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist** during Explore phase:\n  - ☐ Student identifies the light source.\n  - ☐ Student points to or identifies a shadow.\n  - ☐ Student describes what happens when an object blocks light.\n  - ☐ Student tests and observes cause-effect (moving object/light changes shadow).\n\n- **Questioning During Explain Phase:**\n  - Listen to student responses to: \"Where is the light?\" \"What is a shadow?\" \"Can light pass through the vase?\"\n\n- **Observations During Elaborate Phase:**\n  - Can the student make predictions about shadows?\n  - Does the student adjust predictions based on new observations?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (Choose one—age-appropriate for Kindergarten):**\n\n**Option A: Picture-Based Exit Ticket**\nProvide 3 simple drawings:\n1. A lamp shining on a block with a shadow\n2. A vase of flowers in sunlight\n3. Two objects with light coming from different directions\n\nAsk students to:\n- Point to where the light is coming from (use an arrow or pointer).\n- Circle or point to any shadows they see.\n- Tell a partner what they notice.\n\n**Option B: Verbal Assessment**\nOne-on-one or small group; teacher asks:\n- \"Where do you see light in this picture?\" (Student points to lamp/light source.)\n- \"Can you show me a shadow?\" (Student identifies shadow.)\n- \"Is the glass see-through or does it block light?\" (Student answers \"see-through\" or \"transparent.\")\n- \"If we turned off the lamp, what would happen to the flowers?\" (Student predicts: \"They would be dark,\" \"We couldn't see them,\" etc.)\n\n**Option C: Drawing Task**\n\"Draw a picture of the flowers with the bright lamp. Show where the light is, where the flowers are, and where the shadow is. You can use labels or just draw.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Kindergarten:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least one light source (lamp, sun).\n- ✓ Student points to or describes a shadow in the photograph or their own work.\n- ✓ Student understands that objects block light (even if expressed simply: \"The flower is in the way of the light\").\n- ✓ Student can compare transparent and opaque materials in simple language (\"I can see through the cup; I can't see through the flower\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will demonstrate understanding through pointing, drawing, or simple verbal explanations.\n- Students will show evidence of observing light sources and shadows.\n- Students will use new vocabulary (light, shadow, blocks) in context.\n- Student responses will show cause-effect thinking: \"When I moved the block, the shadow moved.\"\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"light,\" \"shadow,\" and \"block\" with struggling learners. Introduce opaque and transparent later or through repeated exposure.\n\n2. **Hands-on scaffolding:** Pair the student with a strong peer or adult. Model each step explicitly: \"Watch me hold the block in front of the light. Now you try. What do you see?\"\n\n3. **Visual supports:** Use picture cards of light sources and shadows. Create a simple \"light and shadow\" picture dictionary for the student to reference.\n\n4. **Reduce variables:** Start with ONE light source and ONE object. Only after mastery, introduce multiple objects or moving the light.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Predict and test multiple variables:** \"What if we use a BIG object and a SMALL object? Which will make a bigger shadow? Why do you think so?\" Students test predictions and explain observations.\n\n2. **Real-world application:** \"Find three shadows in our classroom right now. Are they all the same darkness? Why or why not?\" Encourage students to think about light direction and distance.\n\n3. **Create a shadow story:** Advanced students can create a short narrative using shadow puppets and explain what light sources and positions they used: \"My story happens outside when the sun is high. Where would the shadows be?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Shadow Investigation Over Time:** On a sunny day, have students trace the shadow of the same object (e.g., a stick, a toy, the school flagpole) at three different times of day (morning, noon, late afternoon). Compare and discuss: \"Why did the shadow change? Where was the sun?\" This extends K-PS3-1 by observing the effect of sunlight over time.\n\n2. **Design a Shadow Shield:** Challenge students to design a simple structure that blocks the sun or a lamp to keep a designated area cool or dark. Provide materials like paper, foam, boxes, and tape. Students build, test with a lamp, and describe what they discovered about how materials block light energy. (Connects to K-PS3-2.)\n\n3. **Light Source Scavenger Hunt:** Take students on a classroom or outdoor scavenger hunt to find all the light sources they can (lamp, window sunlight, computer screen, flashlight, candle [safely observed]). Have them point and describe each one. Document with photos or drawings on a classroom poster titled \"Where Does Light Come From?\"\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Safety First:** Ensure all lamps and bulbs are cool before students handle them. Use LED bulbs when possible. Supervise closely during Elaborate phase with dimmed lighting.\n- **Real-World Connection:** Show how shadows appear on sunny days during outdoor time. Point out shadows of trees, students, and playground equipment.\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Kindergarteners learn through repetition. Use \"light,\" \"shadow,\" and \"blocks\" frequently and naturally throughout the day, not just during this lesson.\n- **Photograph Revisiting:** Return to the photograph multiple times across the lesson phases. Each time, students will notice new details and deepen understanding.\n- **Engagement Tip:** Kindergarteners love hands-on, playful learning. The shadow puppet activity is particularly powerful for this age group and can become a favorite classroom center to revisit independently.",
