  "content": "### Visible Elements in Photo\n- Modern multi-story glass-fronted building with metal frame and horizontal mullions (window divisions)\n- Older brick/stone building visible in reflection, showing contrast between architectural styles\n- Repetitive grid pattern of window frames and panes across multiple floors\n- Metal horizontal support beams running the full width of the facade\n- Clear sky visible through transparent glass panels\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n- **From glass facade + metal frame**: The building is designed to allow light into interior spaces while maintaining structural support; engineers had to balance transparency with strength.\n- **From repetitive grid pattern**: Modern buildings use modular, repeated units for efficient construction and cost-effectiveness.\n- **From reflection of older building**: Different building materials (glass vs. brick) serve different purposes—older structures prioritize insulation and durability; modern ones prioritize light and aesthetics.\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2**: Make a tall building that lets lots of light in. Use clear materials (like plastic wrap or cellophane) and straws or sticks to make a frame. Your building should stand up on its own and not fall over when you gently push it. How can you make the frame strong enough to hold the see-through walls?\n\n**3-5**: Design a 30 cm tall building facade using a grid framework (straws, dowels, or craft sticks) and transparent panels (plastic sheets, cellophane, or acetate). Your structure must (1) support a lightweight load (100g weight) placed on a simulated floor, (2) allow light to pass through at least 60% of the surface, and (3) use no more than 12 vertical supports. Test which frame spacing (5cm, 10cm, or 15cm apart) provides the best balance between strength and transparency.\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n**Imagine / Plan** — The photo shows a successful real-world solution (glass-and-steel facade). Students can observe *how* engineers solved the light/strength trade-off, then apply those design principles to their own structure. This phase works best because students have a visible model to analyze before building.\n\n### Suggested Materials\n- Plastic straws, wooden dowels, or craft sticks (for frame)\n- Clear plastic sheeting, cellophane, or transparency film (for panels)\n- Tape (masking or clear packing tape)\n- Small weights or washers (for load testing)\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Optional: sand/weights to simulate load\n\n### Estimated Time\nTwo 30-minute sessions (first session: observe photo, plan design, build frame; second session: attach panels, test load, measure light transmission)\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS 3-5-ETS1-1** (Define a problem, identify constraints and criteria) by having students analyze a real building's trade-offs between structural strength and light transmission, then apply those constraints to their own prototype.",
