White vapor or steam is visible rising from the water, showing the ice is melting and changing from solid to liquid. The ice cubes appear to be different sizes and shapes.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates **phase transitions** - specifically the melting of ice (solid water) into liquid water. The anchoring phenomenon is the change of matter from one state to another due to temperature differences. When ice is placed in warmer water or air, thermal energy transfers from the warmer environment to the colder ice, causing the water molecules in the ice to move faster and break free from their rigid crystal structure, transforming into liquid water.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **States of Matter**: Water exists in three forms - solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor/steam)\n\n2. **Phase Transitions**: Matter can change from one state to another when energy is added or removed\n\n3. **Heat Transfer**: Thermal energy moves from warmer objects to cooler objects until they reach the same temperature\n\n4. **Density and Buoyancy**: Ice floats on water because solid water is less dense than liquid water\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"Think-Pair-Share\" strategy when introducing states of matter. Have students first think individually about examples of solids, liquids, and gases they know, then pair up to discuss, and finally share with the whole class. This builds confidence and activates prior knowledge.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to represent their understanding of states of matter - through drawings, physical demonstrations with their bodies (rigid for solid, flowing for liquid, bouncing for gas), or creating simple charts. This supports different learning preferences and abilities.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** At the molecular level, water molecules in ice are arranged in a rigid, hexagonal crystal structure held together by hydrogen bonds. As thermal energy increases, these molecules vibrate more rapidly until they break free from their fixed positions and begin to flow as liquid water.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This melting process is part of Earth's water cycle, where ice in glaciers, polar ice caps, and seasonal snow melts to feed rivers, lakes, and oceans. This melting ice contributes to sea level changes and weather patterns across the planet.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: \"Ice melts because it gets tired of being cold.\"\n   **Scientific Clarification**: Ice melts because thermal energy from the environment causes water molecules to move faster and change from solid to liquid state.\n\n2. **Misconception**: \"The water disappears when ice melts.\"\n   **Scientific Clarification**: The water doesn't disappear - it changes form from solid ice to liquid water. The same amount of water is still there.\n\n3. **Misconception**: \"All solids sink in liquids.\"\n   **Scientific Clarification**: Ice floats on water because it is less dense than liquid water. Whether something floats or sinks depends on its density compared to the liquid.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation**: 5-PS1-1 - Develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:PS1.A]] - Structure and Properties of Matter\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:PS3.B]] - Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer  \n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]]\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]]\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you think will happen to the ice over time, and why? (Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 2)\n\n2. How is the ice in this bowl similar to and different from ice you see outside in winter? (Bloom's: Compare | DOK: 2)\n\n3. If you wanted to make the ice melt faster or slower, what could you do? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 3)\n\n4. Why do you think ice floats on top of the water instead of sinking to the bottom? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Melting:** The process when a solid changes into a liquid due to heat\n* **Phase transition:** When matter changes from one state to another state\n* **Thermal energy:** The energy that comes from heat and makes molecules move faster\n* **Density:** How tightly packed the molecules are in a material\n* **Buoyancy:** The ability of an object to float in a liquid\n* **Water vapor:** Water in its gas form that you can sometimes see as steam\n\n## 🔗 Cross-Curricular Ideas\n\n1. **Math - Measurement & Graphing**: Have students measure the temperature of ice water over time using thermometers, then create a line graph showing how the temperature changes as the ice melts. This connects to data collection and represents real-world applications of measurement.\n\n2. **ELA - Descriptive Writing**: Ask students to write a detailed paragraph describing what they observe happening to the ice, using sensory words (words that describe what they see, hear, and feel). This builds vocabulary and observation skills while practicing descriptive writing techniques.\n\n3. **Social Studies - Water Around the World**: Connect melting ice to real-world contexts by discussing glaciers, polar ice caps, and how melting ice affects communities in different parts of the world. Students can research and present on how climate change impacts ice in places like Antarctica or mountain regions.\n\n4. **Art - Phase Transition Illustration**: Have students create a three-panel comic strip or poster showing the states of matter (solid ice, liquid water, and water vapor/steam) using different artistic materials - perhaps using actual ice, watercolor paints, and cotton or tissue paper to represent each state.\n\n## 🚀 STEM Career Connection\n\n1. **Hydrologist** - Hydrologists are scientists who study water on Earth, including how ice melts, how water moves through rivers and groundwater, and how water cycles through nature. They help predict floods, manage water resources, and understand climate change. Understanding melting ice and water phase changes is a key part of their job. *Average Annual Salary: $80,000 - $90,000*\n\n2. **Climate Scientist** - Climate scientists study Earth's weather patterns and long-term temperature changes. They track how melting glaciers and ice sheets affect our planet, sea levels, and weather around the world. This photo shows a concept climate scientists study every day! *Average Annual Salary: $85,000 - $100,000*\n\n3. **Materials Engineer** - Materials engineers design and test new materials by understanding how they change properties when heated or cooled, including phase transitions like melting. They use this knowledge to create better products for industries like transportation, construction, and technology. *Average Annual Salary: $95,000 - $110,000*\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- \"What Is the World Made Of?
