Explain that white light from the sun is made up of different colors of light with different wavelengths.\n2. Demonstrate how light bends (refracts) when it passes through a transparent material like water.\n3. Construct a model showing how water droplets separate sunlight into a rainbow spectrum.\n4. Predict when and where rainbows will appear based on the position of the sun and water droplets.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the rainbow photograph (large enough for all students to see clearly)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: colored pencils or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector without comment. Allow students 30 seconds of silent looking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions in sequence:**\n   - \"What do you notice in this photograph? Describe what you see.\" (Accept all observations: road, cars, trees, sky, colors)\n   - \"Where is the rainbow in the picture? How do you know it's a rainbow?\" (Students identify the arc and the colors)\n   - \"What do you think caused the rainbow to appear? What had to happen for this to form?\" (Guide toward: rain, sun, water, light)\n   - \"Have you ever seen a rainbow in real life? When did it happen? What was the weather like?\" (Activate personal experience)\n\n3. **Present the wonder prompt:** \"The sun's light looks white to us, but somehow when it shines through raindrops, it turns into a rainbow with all these beautiful colors. How does white light become colorful? Let's investigate!\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper: \"What do you think happens to sunlight when it hits a raindrop?\" Have 4-5 students share predictions aloud.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become light detectives and discover exactly how rainbows are made using water, light, and our own observations.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how light refracts through water.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Clear plastic cup or clear glass\n- Water\n- White paper or index card\n- Flashlight or mobile phone light (use classroom lights dimmed for better effect)\n- Optional: white pencil, stick, or wooden skewer\n- Optional: prism (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Light Refraction with Water (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** and have students work in pairs or small groups at tables.\n\n2. **Give these step-by-step student directions:**\n\n   - \"Fill your cup about 3/4 full with water.\"\n   - \"In a dimly lit area, shine your flashlight through the water from the side of the cup at a slight angle (not straight down).\"\n   - \"Look at where the light hits the white paper beneath the cup. Does the light beam travel in a straight line, or does it bend? Record what you observe by drawing it on your paper.\"\n   - \"Now try shining the light straight down through the top of the water. How does the light travel differently? Write your observation.\"\n   - \"Try placing a pencil or stick in the water at an angle while shining light on it. Does the pencil look straight or bent in the water? Why might this happen?\"\n\n3. **Connection to the photograph:** \"The water droplets in the air are like tiny cups of water in the sky. When sunlight hits them at just the right angle, the light bends—or refracts—the same way we just saw it bend. But raindrops are special because they contain all the colors of sunlight separated inside them!\"\n\n4. **What students should record:**\n   - Drawings showing light traveling straight vs. bent\n   - Descriptions of what they observed\n   - Predictions: \"If a raindrop bent light this way, what color would we see?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to each group and ask guiding questions: \"What happened to the light beam when it entered the water? Did it go straight or bend? Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Avoid explaining refraction directly; let students observe and wonder.\n- If a prism is available, show students how it separates white light into colors and ask: \"How is this like what might happen inside a raindrop?\"\n- Help students refocus their flashlights if needed, but don't do the activity for them.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students should observe that light bends when passing through water\n- Students should notice that light travels differently depending on the angle\n- Students should recognize that water causes light to change direction\n- Students should make connections between their cup of water and raindrops\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the science of rainbows.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- Color wheel or spectrum poster (optional)\n- Rainbow photograph still visible\n- Diagram of light refraction and rainbow formation (teacher-created or from NGSS-aligned resource)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 pairs to share their observations aloud\n   - Repeat back what they said: \"So you noticed the light bent when it went through water. That's exactly right! And that bending is key to making rainbows.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   - **Light:** Energy that travels in waves and allows us to see. Light from the sun appears white, but it's actually made of many colors mixed together.\n   \n   - **Refraction:** The bending of light when it passes from one transparent material into another (like from air into water or from water into air). Light bends because it travels at different speeds in different materials.\n   \n   - **Spectrum:** All the colors of light that make up white light, appearing in order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet (ROY G. BIV).\n   \n   - **Wavelength:** The distance between one wave peak and the next. Different colors of light have different wavelengths. Red has the longest wavelength; violet has the shortest.\n   \n   - **Water Droplet:** A tiny sphere of water in the air (rain or mist). When sunlight enters a water droplet, it refracts, reflects off the back, and refracts again as it exits—separating into a spectrum.\n\n3. **Explain Rainbow Formation (5 minutes):**\n   - \"When sunlight hits a raindrop, something amazing happens. The white light enters the droplet and bends. Then it bounces off the back of the droplet. Then it bends again as it leaves. Each bend separates the colors slightly more. Red light bends the least, so it appears on the outside of the rainbow. Violet bends the most, so it's on the inside. All the colors in between make the full spectrum.\"\n   - Point to the photograph: \"See how the colors are arranged? Red is on the outside, violet on the inside. That's because different colors bend different amounts!\"\n   - \"Rainbows only appear when three things line up perfectly: the sun behind you, rain or water droplets in front of you, and you standing at exactly the right angle. If any of these is wrong, no rainbow!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If light didn't bend in water, would we see a rainbow?\" (No—all colors would stay mixed as white light)\n   - Ask: \"Why does red appear on the outside and violet on the inside?\" (Red bends less; violet bends more)\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if there were no water droplets in the air?\" (No rainbow, because water is needed to refract the light)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|--------------------------|\n| **Light** | Energy from the sun that lets us see. It looks white, but is actually made of many colors mixed together. |\n| **Refraction** | The bending of light when it enters a different material, like going from air into water. |\n| **Spectrum** | All the colors in light arranged in order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. |\n| **Wavelength** | How far apart the waves of light are. Different colors have different wavelengths. |\n| **Water Droplet** | A tiny ball of water floating in air. Raindrops and fog are made of millions of water droplets. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that white light is made of many colors\n- Students can explain that refraction (bending) separates the colors\n- Students can identify the order of colors in a rainbow\n- Students recognize that water droplets and the sun's position are necessary for rainbows\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by creating a rainbow model and exploring variables.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear glass or cup with water (reuse from Explore if possible)\n- Flashlight or sunlight from a window\n- White paper or white poster board\n- Mirror (optional, but helpful)\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- Prism (if available; not essential)\n- \"Rainbow Prediction\" worksheet (teacher-created)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Create a Rainbow Model (10 minutes)**\n\n1. If possible, take students outside on a sunny day to try to create a rainbow with a hose, spray bottle, or cup of water held up to the sun. If outdoors is not possible, simulate sunlight indoors:\n   - Darken the room\n   - Place a flashlight on one side\n   - Position a clear cup of water in the \"sun\" position\n   - Hold white paper on the other side to catch light\n   - Adjust angles until students see color separation (this works best with a prism, but water can work)\n\n2. **If direct rainbow creation is difficult,** use this alternative:\n   - Display the photograph again\n   - Have students use colored pencils to trace the path of light through a raindrop diagram (teacher-provided or drawn together)\n   - Label where refraction happens (entering the droplet, bouncing inside, exiting)\n   - Color the spectrum that emerges\n\n**Part B: Predict and Test (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Present this scenario:** \"If you wanted to see a rainbow tomorrow morning, what would need to happen? What would the weather need to be like? Where would the sun need to be? Where would you need to stand?\"\n\n2. **Give students the \"Rainbow Prediction Worksheet\"** with these prompts:\n   - Draw a picture showing the sun, rain, and where you would stand to see a rainbow\n   - Write: \"The sun needs to be __________ of me\"\n   - Write: \"The rain needs to be __________ of me\"\n   - Explain: \"Why would standing in the wrong spot mean you can't see the rainbow?\"\n\n3. **Discuss predictions as a group.** Correct misconception: You stand with the sun *behind you* and rain *in front of you*.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Guide students in positioning themselves, the light, and the paper correctly\n- Ask: \"What happens to the light when it hits the water?\" and \"Where do the colors go?\"\n- Help students make connections: \"This is what's happening in real raindrops in the sky!\"\n- Provide positive feedback: \"You're thinking like a scientist—testing ideas and making observations!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe (or see in demonstration) light separating into colors through a water model\n- Students can draw and explain the geometry of rainbow viewing (sun position, observer position, rain position)\n- Students can predict conditions needed for rainbow formation\n- Students deepen their mental model of refraction through hands-on experimentation\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light refraction and rainbow formation.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n\n- **Observation:** Circulate during Explore and Elaborate phases. Note which students can identify refraction, explain color separation, and make reasonable predictions.\n- **Discussion Questions:** Ask probing questions throughout: \"Why did the light bend?\" \"What would happen without water?\" \"Why are the colors in that order?\"\n- **Group Share-Out:** Listen to student explanations during the group share phase. Do they use correct vocabulary? Can they connect observations to ideas?\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (written or drawn) with these prompts:\n\n**Option A (Written):**\n\n1. \"Explain in 2-3 sentences how white light becomes a rainbow.\" (Look for: light bends in water, colors separate, spectrum visible)\n\n2. \"Draw a picture showing where YOU would stand, where the SUN would be, and where the RAIN would be if you wanted to see a rainbow.\" (Look for: student behind sun, rain in front, correct positioning)\n\n3. \"True or False: If there were no water droplets in the air, you could still see a rainbow by shining a flashlight. Explain your answer.\" (Look for: False, because water is needed to refract the light)\n\n**Option B (Drawn/Visual):**\n\n- Provide a simple diagram of a raindrop\n- Ask students to: Label where light enters, label the spectrum colors inside, draw arrows showing the path of light and its bending\n- (Look for: correct understanding of refraction and color separation)\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- ✓ Students correctly explain that refraction (bending of light) separates colors\n- ✓ Students identify that water droplets are necessary for rainbows\n- ✓ Students can position themselves correctly relative to the sun and rain\n- ✓ Students use vocabulary: light, refraction, spectrum, water droplet, wavelength\n- ✓ Students make logical connections between the classroom model and real rainbows\n- ✓ Students can predict conditions for rainbow formation\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should demonstrate:\n- Clear understanding of light refraction as bending of light through water\n- Recognition that different colors bend at slightly different angles\n- Ability to explain why rainbows require specific positioning of sun, observer, and rain\n- Correct use of science vocabulary in written and verbal explanations\n- Confidence in modeling and predicting rainbow phenomena\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Reference Card:** Provide a laminated card with pictures and one-sentence definitions of key terms (light, refraction, spectrum, water droplet). Students keep this during activities and assessments.\n\n2. **Guided Refraction Exploration:** Instead of independent discovery in Explore, conduct the water refraction activity as a guided whole-group demonstration first. Then have students replicate with a partner while you circulate closely, asking guiding questions and providing immediate feedback.\n\n3. **Adapted Exit Ticket:** Offer a multiple-choice or matching version of the exit ticket instead of open-ended writing. For example: \"Which picture shows where you should stand to see a rainbow?\" with labeled diagrams to choose from.\n\n4. **Sentence Frames for Explanation:** Provide sentence starters like: \"When light goes through water, it ________. This makes the colors __________. Rainbows appear because __________.\"\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Secondary Rainbow Investigation:** After mastering the primary rainbow, challenge advanced students to research and draw secondary rainbows (the fainter arc outside the primary rainbow with reversed colors). Ask: \"Why is a secondary rainbow dimmer? Why are the colors reversed?\" Provide simple research resources or have them explain based on how light bounces twice inside the droplet.\n\n2. **Wavelength and Color Relationships:** Challenge students to graph the wavelengths of each color in the visible spectrum (use pre-made data or have them research). Ask them to explain why red refracts less than violet using wavelength information: \"How do you think wavelength affects how much light bends?\"\n\n3. **Design a Rainbow Detector:** Have advanced students design and build a simple device (using mirrors, water, transparent containers, or prisms) that deliberately creates a rainbow in the classroom. Require them to document the angle of light, explain their design using refraction concepts, and test it with different conditions (different angles, different water levels, etc.).\n\n4. **Spectrum in Everyday Objects:** Challenge students to find and photograph other examples of light separation in the real world (oil slicks, soap bubbles, CDs, glass prisms in classroom windows, etc.). Have them explain the science behind each using refraction and wavelength concepts.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rainbow Art + Science:** Students create a mixed-media \"Rainbow Science Journal\" page where they:\n   - Draw a real or imagined rainbow scene\n   - Annotate it with labels explaining refraction, wavelength, spectrum order, and the position of sun/rain/observer\n   - Write a creative paragraph from the perspective of a light ray traveling through a raindrop\n   - (Connects: art integration, deepened vocabulary use, creative expression of science understanding)\n\n2. **Investigate Light Speed in Different Materials:** Build on refraction understanding with a kinesthetic activity: students walk in a straight line (representing light in air), then walk through a \"water zone\" marked with tape on the floor, slowing down and changing direction slightly as they enter/exit (representing refraction). Discuss: \"Why does light slow down in water? How does that cause bending?\" (For advanced fifth graders or intro to 6th-grade concepts)\n\n3. **Rainbow Prediction Challenge:** Give students a calendar and weather forecast. Ask: \"Look at the next week of weather. On which days could rainbows form, and why? Where and when of day would you most likely see them?\" Have students write predictions with scientific reasoning, then track actual rainbow sightings or check weather archives to verify. (Connects: real-world application, data analysis, weather relationships)\n\n4. **Prism Station Activity:** If access to multiple prisms is possible, set up a \"light exploration station\" where students experiment with white light through prisms at different angles, through colored filters, and reflected off mirrors. Have them document what happens to the spectrum under different conditions and write conclusions about light behavior.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
