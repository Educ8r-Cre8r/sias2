Exploring Liquids and How We Keep Them Safe**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 30-minute sessions (or three 20-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** K-PS2-1, K-PS2-2\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Observe and describe the properties of liquids in containers\n- Compare different types of containers and explain what they hold\n- Demonstrate how containers protect liquids from spilling\n- Identify the shapes liquids make when placed in different containers\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest in liquids and containers using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Color-printed or digital display of the photograph (large enough for whole-class viewing)\n- Interactive whiteboard or poster board\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the image of the car engine compartment with the yellow liquid (coolant) visible in the clear reservoir container. Point to the container and ask students what they notice.\n\n2. **Guided Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is that yellow stuff?\"\n   - \"Why do you think someone put the yellow liquid into a clear container instead of letting it sit on the ground?\"\n   - \"What would happen if we didn't have a container to hold this liquid?\"\n   - \"How is this container different from a water cup you drink from?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what other liquids need special containers to keep them safe and in the right place? Let's explore and find out!\"\n\n4. **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Ask students to name liquids they see at home or at school (water, milk, juice, soap). Chart their responses on a large poster.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's investigate different containers and see how they hold liquids!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how liquids behave in different containers through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic cups (various sizes: small, medium, large)\n- Clear plastic bottles with different shapes\n- Water colored with food coloring (blue, red, yellow)\n- Shallow trays or cookie sheets to contain potential spills\n- Plastic funnels\n- Measuring cups\n- Small containers with lids (plastic bottles with caps, jars with tight lids)\n- Closed containers without lids (open cups, bowls)\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Student observation sheets with simple drawings of different container shapes (pre-drawn outlines)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Station Setup:** Create 2-3 exploration stations in the classroom. Each station has a tray with different containers and a small amount of colored water.\n\n2. **Student Exploration Steps:**\n   - Divide the class into small groups (3-4 students per group).\n   - At each station, students pour colored water from a measuring cup into different containers one at a time.\n   - Students observe how the water takes the shape of each container.\n   - Students try pouring water into a container with a lid; they observe it cannot be poured without opening the lid.\n   - Students use a funnel to pour water into a narrow-mouth bottle; they observe the funnel makes pouring easier.\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:** As students explore, ask: \"Like the yellow liquid in the car picture, our water needs a container too. What happens if we don't cover our container? What if we tip it?\"\n\n4. **Documentation:** Students draw or mark on their observation sheets which containers held the water best, and which ones made water want to spill.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among stations; ask open-ended questions: \"What shape is the water now? Did the shape change when you moved it to a different container?\"\n- Help students make predictions before pouring: \"What do you think will happen to the water if we pour it in this tall, skinny bottle?\"\n- Provide paper towels for inevitable spills and model safe cleanup.\n- Avoid telling students the answer—let them discover through direct experience.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that liquids take the shape of their containers.\n- Students discover that containers with lids keep liquids from spilling.\n- Students recognize that some containers are better designed for holding and pouring liquids.\n- Students produce simple drawings showing how water looks in different containers.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and solidify understanding after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Picture cards of containers (bottles, cups, jars, buckets)\n- Real samples of containers used in Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Gather the class. Ask students to share what they discovered:\n   - \"What happened to the water when you poured it into different containers?\"\n   - \"Which containers worked best for holding the water? Why?\"\n   - \"What happened when you tried to pour into a container with a lid?\"\n\n2. **Connect to the Photograph:** Point back to the image. \"Remember the yellow liquid in the car? It's in a clear plastic container. Why do you think that container was chosen? What could happen if it wasn't in a container?\"\n\n3. **Introduce Vocabulary:** Write terms on chart paper with simple illustrations:\n   - **Liquid:** A substance like water or juice that flows and takes the shape of its container.\n   - **Container:** Something that holds a liquid and keeps it in one place (cup, bottle, tank, jar).\n   - **Spill:** When a liquid leaves its container by accident.\n   - **Lid or Cap:** A cover that closes a container to keep the liquid from spilling.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Hold up various containers one at a time. Ask: \"Is this a good container for holding juice? Why or why not?\"\n   - Ask a student to pour water into two containers: one with a lid and one without. Ask: \"Which one keeps the water safer?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Liquid:** Something that pours and flows, like water or juice; it takes the shape of whatever container holds it.\n- **Container:** A cup, bottle, bucket, or tank that holds something liquid inside it.\n- **Spill:** When liquid accidentally comes out of its container.\n- **Lid or Cap:** A cover on top of a container that keeps the liquid from spilling out.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word \"liquid\" to describe water and other pourable substances.\n- Students explain that containers hold liquids and keep them from spilling.\n- Students recognize that lids and caps are important features of containers.\n- Students make a simple statement: \"Containers keep liquids safe.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a container for a specific purpose.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Plastic cups of various sizes\n- Plastic bottles with and without lids\n- Plastic bags\n- Tape (masking tape and clear tape)\n- Markers\n- Water\n- Aluminum foil\n- Shallow trays for testing\n- Pictures of real-world containers (water bottle, milk jug, paint can, fuel tank)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario Introduction:** \"We need to design the best container for keeping juice safe in a lunchbox. The juice container needs to keep the juice inside and not spill. What makes a good juice container?\"\n\n2. **Brainstorm Together:** Chart student ideas on paper:\n   - It should have a lid.\n   - It should not be too tall so it tips over.\n   - It should have a handle to carry it.\n   - It should be made of plastic or strong material.\n\n3. **Design Challenge:** Give each small group two or three different containers. Challenge them to:\n   - Select the best container for juice.\n   - Add a lid if one is missing (use tape or aluminum foil to create a cover).\n   - Decorate it with markers to show it's a juice container.\n   - Test it by gently tipping it or shaking it to see if it \"spills.\"\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:** Show pictures of actual juice containers, water bottles, and milk jugs. Ask: \"How is our container like the ones you see in stores? What features did designers include to keep liquids safe?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group discussions; ask: \"Why did you choose this container? How would you improve it?\"\n- Support students in problem-solving: \"What could you use to make a lid?\"\n- Allow safe, small-scale testing of designs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design a simple container with at least one safety feature (lid or secure closure).\n- Students explain their design choice in simple words: \"We picked this bottle because it has a lid.\"\n- Students test their design and observe whether it prevents spilling.\n- Students make connections to real-world containers.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of liquids, containers, and their properties.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n   - Observation during Explore phase: Can students pour water without significant spillage? Do they recognize when a lid prevents pouring?\n   - Listen to student language during Explain phase: Are they using words like \"liquid,\" \"container,\" and \"spill\"?\n   - Observe during Elaborate phase: Do students make thoughtful choices about container design and include safety features?\n\n2. **Exit Ticket Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n   - Show each student a picture of a liquid (water, milk, juice) and ask: \"What do we need to keep this safe?\" Listen for answers like \"a container\" or \"a bottle with a lid.\"\n   - Ask: \"If we didn't have a container, what would happen to the water?\" (Expected: \"It would spill\" or \"It would go all over the place.\")\n   - Have a student pour water into two different containers and ask: \"Which container keeps the liquid safer? Why?\"\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n   - Student correctly identifies liquids and the need for containers.\n   - Student explains that containers prevent spilling.\n   - Student can describe at least one feature of a good container (lid, shape, material).\n   - Student makes a simple design choice based on the purpose of the container.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Kindergarteners demonstrate understanding by pointing to and naming containers.\n- Students explain in simple words why containers are important (keeping things from spilling, keeping things clean, keeping things organized).\n- Students apply concepts by choosing or designing a container for a specific liquid.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n- **Simplified Language:** Use only the words \"liquid\" and \"container\" if vocabulary becomes overwhelming; keep definitions very simple: \"A liquid is something wet that pours. A container is something that holds it.\"\n- **Guided Exploration:** Pair students with more advanced peers during Explore phase. Provide pre-selected containers with one or two clear choices rather than overwhelming options.\n- **Visual Supports:** Use picture cards showing containers with simple labels (cup, bottle, jar, bucket) so students can point and identify rather than always speak.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n- **Extended Design Challenge:** Ask advanced students to design TWO containers—one for carrying juice safely in a backpack, and one for storing juice in a refrigerator. Compare their designs and explain the differences.\n- **Prediction and Explanation:** Pose \"what if\" questions: \"What would happen if we poured hot liquid into a plastic cup? What about a metal cup? Why?\" Let them make predictions and test safely with warm (not hot) water.\n- **Real-World Research:** Show students pictures of different containers (water bottles, gasoline containers, paint cans, cereal boxes). Ask them to sort and explain: \"Which containers hold liquids? Which hold solids? How can you tell?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Container Sort and Match Game:** Provide pictures of liquids (milk, juice, water, paint, gasoline) and pictures of containers (milk jug, juice box, water bottle, paint can, gas tank). Have students match liquids to appropriate containers and explain their choices. This reinforces the idea that different liquids need different containers based on their use and safety.\n\n2. **Dramatic Play: Grocery Store or Gas Station:** Set up a pretend store or gas station in the classroom with empty containers (bottles, jugs, cartons). Students practice \"pouring\" (with water or pretend) into different containers, developing fine motor skills while reinforcing concepts about liquids and containers.\n\n3. **Family Connection: Container Hunt at Home:** Send a simple note home asking families to help their child find three different containers in the kitchen or garage that hold liquids. Students draw or bring pictures to school and share: \"This container holds _____ (milk/water/juice). It has a _____ (lid/cap/spout).\" This extends learning beyond the classroom and connects to home experiences.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\nThis lesson keeps concepts concrete and hands-on, appropriate for kindergarteners' developmental level. The photograph of the car engine compartment provides a real-world anchor that shows liquids in containers serve important purposes beyond play. By progressing from observation to exploration to explanation and design, students build understanding naturally. Be prepared for water spills—frame them as learning opportunities: \"Oops! That's why we need containers with lids!\"",
