Identify that vibrations create sound.\n2. Demonstrate that different objects vibrate to make different sounds.\n3. Predict what will happen when an object vibrates.\n4. Use simple tools to create and observe vibrations that make sound.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about sound and vibrations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (printed or displayed on screen/projector)\n- 1–2 percussion instruments (drum, tambourine, or triangle) for teacher demonstration\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector so all students can see clearly. Say: \"Look at this picture! What do you see these students doing?\"\n\n2. **Ask focus questions** (pause after each for think-pair-share):\n   - \"What are these shiny objects the students are holding?\" (Instruments—specifically brass instruments, though students may just say \"shiny tubes\" or \"music makers.\")\n   - \"Do you think these instruments make sound? How do you know?\"\n   - \"What do you think these students had to DO to make the sound come out of their instruments?\"\n   - \"Have you ever felt something shaking or vibrating? What was it?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** Hold up a drum or tambourine. Say: \"I'm going to hit this drum gently. Before I do, put your hand on your cheek or your neck. What do you think you might feel?\" Tap the drum and let students feel the vibration on their own bodies.\n\n4. **Wonder statement:** \"Today, we're going to investigate: What makes sound? Does it shake? Does it move? Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do some exploring to discover what makes sound!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover that vibrating materials create sound.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Rubber band (various thicknesses if possible)\n- Ruler or wooden craft stick\n- Small paper cups or containers\n- Dried rice or beans (small amount)\n- Plastic or paper plates\n- Tape\n- Small bells or metal spoons (optional, if available)\n- Crayons/pencils\n- Observation recording sheet (simple, with pictures and lines for drawing/words)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Rubber Band Vibration (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Give each student or pair a rubber band and a ruler.** Say: \"You're going to make the rubber band vibrate and listen to it.\"\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - Stretch the rubber band around your hand or ask a partner to hold it.\n   - Pluck the rubber band with your finger (like a guitar string).\n   - **Listen.** Do you hear a sound?\n   - Pluck it again, but this time, **FEEL** the rubber band while you listen. What do you notice? Is it shaking? Is it moving?\n   - Now pluck it very gently. Then pluck it hard. Does the sound change?\n\n3. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask questions: \"What do you feel?\" \"Is the rubber band moving?\" \"Does it sound the same every time?\" Resist answering—let students discover through observation.\n\n4. **Record:** Students draw or write what they felt and heard on their observation sheet.\n\n**Part B: Making Sound Shake Things (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Provide each student with a paper cup or plate and a small handful of dried rice.** Say: \"We're going to see if sound can make things move!\"\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - Sprinkle a few grains of rice on your paper cup or plate.\n   - Make a sound near it (sing, hum, or tap a surface).\n   - **Look carefully.** Does the rice move? Does it bounce?\n   - Try different sounds: whisper, talk loudly, clap.\n   - Which sound makes the rice jump the most?\n\n3. **Teacher role:** Model the activity first. Ask: \"What's moving the rice? Is it the sound?\" Help students see the connection without explaining it yet.\n\n4. **Record:** Students draw the rice jumping and label what sound made it move most.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that rubber bands wiggle when they vibrate.\n- Students notice that louder sounds make rice move more.\n- Students make the connection that sound and movement go together.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize the concept that vibrations make sound.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary illustrated\n- Photograph from Engage phase\n- Visual anchor chart or diagram showing a vibrating object making sound waves\n- Students' observation recordings from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover when you plucked the rubber band?\"\n   - Call on 3–4 students to share. Write key words: \"shaking,\" \"moving,\" \"wiggling,\" \"vibrating.\"\n   - Ask: \"What happened when you made sounds near the rice?\"\n   - Students respond: \"It moved! It jumped!\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   Write each term on chart paper with a simple picture:\n\n   - **Vibration (or Vibrate):** When something shakes back and forth, back and forth, very fast. (Draw a simple line showing movement back and forth.)\n   - **Sound:** What we hear when something vibrates. (Draw ear and sound waves.)\n   - **Energy:** The power that makes things move and vibrate. (Draw a person blowing or hitting something.)\n\n   Say each word aloud and have students repeat 2–3 times.\n\n3. **Connect to photograph (5 minutes):**\n   Display the photograph again. Say: \"Look at the students with the brass instruments. They blow air into the instruments. The air makes the metal inside **vibrate**. The vibrations make **sound**. The sound is so strong that we can hear it way over here! The students used their breath energy to make the vibrations.\"\n\n   Point to specific students: \"This student is blowing hard. What is vibrating inside the instrument? **The metal and the air!**\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   Ask: \"If I want to make a LOUD sound, do I vibrate gently or hard?\" (Hard!) \"Show me with your hand—shake gently, then shake hard. Which makes a bigger vibration?\" Students demonstrate.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Vibrate:** To shake back and forth really fast.\n- **Sound:** What we hear when something vibrates.\n- **Energy:** The power from our body (lungs, hands, voice) that makes things move.\n- **Material:** What something is made of (metal, rubber, plastic, paper).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand the connection between vibration and sound.\n- Students can use the word \"vibrate\" in context.\n- Students recognize that vibrations need energy to happen.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by creating their own sound-making instruments.\n\n**Materials (per student or small group):**\n- Paper cup or tin can (cleaned, no sharp edges)\n- Rubber bands (various sizes)\n- Tape\n- Stick or ruler to use as a \"plucking tool\"\n- Optional: small bells, dried rice, aluminum foil, cardboard\n- Observation sheet for new predictions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Challenge:** \"Now you're going to be an instrument maker! You're going to create something that vibrates and makes sound, just like the brass instruments in the picture.\"\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - Stretch a rubber band across the opening of a cup or can.\n   - Tape or hold it in place.\n   - Use a stick or pencil to pluck the rubber band.\n   - **Listen.** What sound does it make?\n   - Try a **thicker** rubber band. Does the sound change?\n   - Try a **thinner** rubber band. Does the sound change?\n   - Try plucking gently, then hard. What happens?\n\n3. **Extension option:** Students can decorate their instrument and give it a name. Invite them to play a simple rhythm (clap pattern) that others copy.\n\n4. **Teacher role:** \n   - Circulate and ask: \"What is vibrating?\" \"How is your sound different from your friend's?\"\n   - Encourage students to predict before testing: \"What do you think will happen if you use a bigger rubber band?\"\n   - Document student thinking with photos or notes.\n\n5. **Optional: Instrument parade or performance:**\n   Have students stand in a line and play their instruments together for 10–15 seconds, similar to the photograph. Let them feel the vibrations and hear the combined sound.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a working vibrating instrument.\n- Students observe that different rubber bands (sizes/thicknesses) vibrate differently and create different sounds.\n- Students make predictions and test them.\n- Students apply the concept of vibration to a new context.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of vibrations and sound.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing):**\n- During Explore and Elaborate: Listen to student language. Do they use words like \"vibrate,\" \"shaking,\" \"moving,\" \"sound\"?\n- Observe their hands-on investigations. Can they feel the vibration? Do they repeat successful actions?\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why do you think it makes a sound?\" \"What's moving?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5–7 minutes):**\nProvide each student with a simple sheet with three tasks:\n\n1. **Draw a vibration:** \"Draw something that is vibrating. Show the movement with lines or arrows.\" \n   - *Look for:* Evidence of back-and-forth movement; shaking lines; or repeated motion.\n\n2. **Sound question:** \"What do you think makes a sound?\" \n   - *Look for:* Student uses word \"vibrate,\" \"shaking,\" \"moving,\" or describes an object moving.\n\n3. **Prediction:** Show a picture of a drum or bell (or hold one up). Ask: \"If I hit this drum, what will vibrate to make sound?\" \n   - *Look for:* Student points to or names the part that vibrates (drumhead, beater, etc.).\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies that vibrations make sound.\n- ✓ Student can describe or show what vibration looks like.\n- ✓ Student applies the concept to a new object.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most First Graders will demonstrate understanding through drawings and simple words.\n- Students should use emerging vocabulary related to vibration and movement.\n- Evidence of deeper understanding: Students explain why something vibrates (energy/force applied) rather than just observing that it does.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide hand-over-hand guidance:** If a student struggles to pluck the rubber band or feel the vibration, physically guide their hand and say, \"Feel it shaking? That's vibration!\" Then have them do it independently.\n\n2. **Use larger, more obvious vibrations:** Provide thicker rubber bands, drums, or a tuning fork (with teacher moderation) that produce more pronounced vibrations easier to feel and hear.\n\n3. **Simplified exit ticket:** Offer drawing-only or yes/no questions instead of requiring written words. Example: \"Does this vibrate?\" with pictures of instruments and non-instruments to sort.\n\n4. **Pair with a strong peer:** During Explore, pair a struggling student with a communicative peer who can narrate observations aloud.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Investigate variables:** Ask: \"What happens if you stretch the rubber band **tighter**? Does it vibrate differently?\" Encourage students to test and document their findings using words or drawings.\n\n2. **Create a scale of sounds:** Ask students to order rubber bands from \"lowest sound\" to \"highest sound\" and explain why. Introduce the term \"pitch\" if appropriate.\n\n3. **Design a purpose:** \"Can you create an instrument that sounds like a frog? A bird? A thunder storm?\" This adds a creative, purposeful challenge.\n\n4. **Explore multiple materials:** Provide various materials (foil, plastic, metal, wood) and ask: \"Which material vibrates and makes the best sound for a musical instrument? Why?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Sing and Feel Vibrations (5–10 minutes):**\n   Have students place their hands on their throats while humming or singing. Discuss: \"Do you feel your throat vibrate when you sing? You are making sound with your voice vibrating! Try high and low sounds. Do they feel the same?\"\n\n2. **Sound Scavenger Hunt (15–20 minutes):**\n   Walk around the classroom or school. Students listen and identify sounds. When they hear one, they whisper the sound source to a partner and try to identify what is vibrating to make that sound (fan, voice, footsteps, door, etc.). Create a list on chart paper.\n\n3. **Make a Shaker Instrument (10–15 minutes for homework or next day):**\n   Send home a simple shaker craft: students fill a paper cup with dried rice or beans, tape it closed, decorate it, and bring it back to share. Discuss: \"What is vibrating inside your shaker when you shake it? Can you feel the vibrations in your hands?\"\n\n4. **Read-Aloud Connection:**\n   Share a picture book like *Pete the Cat* or *Bear Snores On* (with sound words) and clap or tap rhythms to the story. Discuss: \"When we clap, are we making vibrations? What is vibrating—your hands? The air?\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure no sharp edges on cups or cans. Supervise rubber band use (no snapping at others).\n- **Preparation:** Pre-gather all materials in containers labeled by activity. Test the rubber band activity yourself to ensure it works.\n- **Engagement:** The photograph is powerful because it shows real students their age making music together. Use this relatability throughout the lesson.\n- **Language:** First graders are still developing vocabulary. Repeat key terms often. Use gestures (shaking hands, moving back-and-forth) to reinforce language.\n- **Flexibility:** If students are highly engaged in Explore, extend it. If focus is waning, move to Explain and Elaborate quickly.\n- **Connection to real world:** Point out everyday sounds and vibrations: car engines, bells, your voice, doors slamming, etc.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is fully grounded in 1-PS4-1 and uses the photograph's brass instrument context to make vibration and sound concrete and relatable for First Grade learners.",
