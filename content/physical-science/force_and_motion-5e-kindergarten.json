ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest in forces and motion through the photograph.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Printed or projected photograph of the child jumping over the cone\n  - Whiteboard/chart paper\n  - Markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Introduction (Display the photograph):**\n  Project or display the photograph on a screen or poster board. Ask students to sit on the carpet where everyone can see clearly.\n  \n  **Discussion Questions:**\n  1. \"What is the child in the picture doing?\" (Allow students to respond: jumping)\n  2. \"How did the child's body get up in the air? What did they have to do?\" (Listen for responses about pushing with their legs)\n  3. \"Why do you think the child is jumping over that orange cone? Do you think they could jump over a pile of blocks?\"\n  4. \"When you jump, what part of your body pushes? Can you show me a jumping motion right now?\" (Invite students to stand and demonstrate)\n  \n  **Prediction Prompt:**\n  \"Today, we're going to be like the child in the picture. We're going to investigate how we push with our legs to jump. I wonder: Does a BIG push help us jump higher and farther than a LITTLE push? Let's find out!\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Let's move to our investigation space and try jumping for ourselves to see what we discover about pushing and jumping.\"\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate the relationship between the force of a push and the distance/height of a jump through hands-on experimentation.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Clear floor or outdoor space (gym, hallway, or open classroom area)\n  - 5-6 orange or colored cones (or use foam blocks, tape markers on ground)\n  - Tape measure or marked starting line (chalk or tape on floor)\n  - Chart paper for recording observations\n  - Masking tape for marking jump distances\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Setup:**\n  Create a safe jumping area with a clear starting line. Space cones at different distances from the starting line (1 foot, 2 feet, 3 feet, 4 feet). Ensure at least 6 feet of open space beyond the final cone.\n  \n  **Student Directions (Model first):**\n  1. \"Stand at the starting line with your feet together.\"\n  2. \"Watch me jump with a LITTLE push—I won't bend my knees very much.\" (Demonstrate a small jump, barely clearing the first cone.)\n  3. \"Now watch me jump with a BIG push—I'll bend my knees low and push hard!\" (Demonstrate a larger jump, going over more cones.)\n  4. \"Your turn! First, try jumping with a little push. Where did you land?\" (Students take turns; teacher marks or notes landing spot.)\n  5. \"Now, try jumping with a BIG push. Where did you land this time?\" (Repeat; teacher marks landing spot.)\n  6. \"Did the bigger push help you jump farther? How do you know?\"\n  \n  **What Students Record/Document:**\n  - Teacher creates a simple chart on poster board with columns: \"Little Push — Jumped This Far\" and \"Big Push — Jumped This Far\"\n  - Students contribute by placing stickers or drawing marks on the chart to show which jump was farther\n  - Teacher takes photos or marks jump distances on floor with tape for visual comparison\n  \n  **Teacher Role:**\n  - Observe students as they jump and ask guiding questions: \"What did you feel in your legs?\" \"Which jump felt more powerful?\" \"How far did you go this time?\"\n  - Do NOT tell students the answer; let them discover through their own jumping\n  - Ensure safety: check space is clear, no obstacles in landing zone\n  - Encourage all students to try both a \"little push\" and \"big push\" jump\n  - Use positive language: \"You're testing different forces!\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  Students will observe and discover that a bigger push (more force) results in jumping farther or higher than a smaller push. They will collect informal data through their own movement.\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize student observations about pushes and forces.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper from Explore phase\n  - Visual cards or pictures showing pushes and pulls\n  - Whiteboard for vocabulary words\n  - Photograph from Engage phase (displayed again)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Group Share-Out:**\n  Gather students on the carpet. Point to the chart created during Explore.\n  - \"Let's look at what we discovered. Look at our chart. When you used a BIG push with your legs, what happened?\" (Elicit: jumped farther, jumped higher)\n  - \"When you used a LITTLE push, what happened?\" (Elicit: didn't jump as far)\n  - \"Everyone show me with your hands: where did you land with your little push? Where with your big push?\"\n  \n  **Introduce Key Vocabulary:**\n  Write each word on the board and use gestures or simple actions to demonstrate:\n  \n  1. **Push:** When you use force to move something away from you (demonstrate by pushing against the wall gently, then firmly)\n  2. **Force:** The strength or power that makes things move (hold up a small object, push it gently, then push harder: \"This is force!\")\n  3. **Jump:** A movement where you use a push to lift your body off the ground\n  4. **Motion:** The movement of something from one place to another (walk slowly, then run: \"This is motion!\")\n  \n  **Connection Back to Photograph:**\n  Point to the photograph again.\n  - \"The child in this picture is using a PUSH force with their legs. The push makes their body move UP and OVER the cone. The bigger the push, the higher they jump!\"\n  - \"Do you see their legs are bent? They're getting ready to push. When they push hard, their body flies through the air!\"\n  \n  **Check for Understanding:**\n  Ask individual students:\n  - \"Show me a push motion.\" (Students demonstrate pushing)\n  - \"Is jumping a push or a pull?\" (Students respond: push)\n  - \"If you want to jump really high, do you need a big push or a little push?\" (Students respond: big push)\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Push:** Using force to move something away from you\n  - **Force:** The power that makes things move or change\n  - **Jump:** To push your body up and off the ground with your legs\n  - **Motion:** The movement of something from one place to another\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  Students understand that:\n  - Pushes are forces that make things move\n  - Bigger pushes create more motion (jumping higher/farther)\n  - A push with legs is how we jump\n  - Jumping is an example of motion caused by force\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply understanding of pushes and forces in new contexts.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Objects of varying weights (small toy blocks, foam balls, balls)\n  - Open floor space or table surface\n  - Optional: cones, tape markers\n  - Picture cards showing different pushes and pulls\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Extension 1: Pushing Different Objects**\n  - \"Now that we know about pushes making things move, let's try pushing OTHER things!\"\n  - Provide objects (foam ball, toy block, toy car) and a clear pushing area\n  - \"Try pushing this ball with a LITTLE push. Where does it go?\"\n  - \"Now push it with a BIG push. Where does it go this time?\"\n  - Students discover that bigger pushes move objects farther\n  - Ask: \"Is this the same as when you jumped? Did the bigger force move things farther?\"\n  \n  **Extension 2: Direction of Push Matters**\n  - Set up cones in different directions (forward, to the side, at an angle)\n  - \"Let's see what happens when we push in DIFFERENT directions!\"\n  - \"Can you jump over the cone in front of you? Now try jumping to the side. Or backward?\" (Backward only if safe and supervised)\n  - Students observe that the direction of the push changes the direction of the motion\n  - Ask: \"Where did you go when you pushed forward? Where did you go when you pushed to the side?\"\n  \n  **Extension 3: Sorting Pushes and Pulls**\n  - Show picture cards of actions (kicking a ball, pulling a door, pushing a swing, pulling a rope, etc.)\n  - Students sort into two groups: \"This is a PUSH\" and \"This is a PULL\"\n  - Discuss: \"Jumping is a push. What other pushes did we see in the pictures?\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Ask questions to guide discovery: \"What happened when you pushed harder?\" \"Did the direction change where it landed?\"\n  - Provide encouragement and reinforce vocabulary: \"You're testing the force of your push!\"\n  - Ensure safe space for all activities\n  - Allow students to make predictions before trying: \"What do you think will happen?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students recognize that force strength affects motion in multiple contexts (not just jumping)\n  - Students observe that direction of push affects direction of motion\n  - Students can identify and name pushes in different contexts\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of pushes, forces, and motion.\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n  - Observation during Explore: Do students attempt both a \"little push\" and \"big push\"? Can they describe the difference in landing distance?\n  - Question responses in Explain: Can students demonstrate a push? Do they use vocabulary (push, force, jump, motion)?\n  - Participation in Elaborate: Do students predict outcomes before trying? Can they explain why bigger pushes moved objects farther?\n  \n  **Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n  Ask each student individually or in small groups. Accept verbal responses (kindergarten appropriate):\n  \n  1. **\"Show me a push with your body. What happens when you push?\"** \n     - Success: Student demonstrates a pushing motion and says something moves or goes away from them\n  \n  2. **\"Jump for me. What part of your body makes you jump? What force are you using?\"**\n     - Success: Student jumps and identifies legs; mentions \"push\" or \"push my legs\"\n  \n  3. **\"If you want to jump REALLY far to get over this cone, should you use a little push or a big push?\"**\n     - Success: Student responds \"big push\" and can explain why (goes farther, faster, higher)\n  \n  4. **\"Can you find something in the room that someone PUSHED? How do you know someone pushed it?\"**\n     - Success: Student identifies an object and gives evidence (it moved, it's not where it started, etc.)\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students demonstrate understanding that pushes are forces\n  - Students can compare small and large pushes\n  - Students recognize that forces cause motion\n  - Students can identify pushes in the environment\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support:**\n  1. **Verbal Rehearsal:** Before jumping, have struggling learners repeat: \"I'm going to push my legs. This is a force. It makes me jump.\" Use repetition and modeling to build confidence.\n  2. **Physical Assistance:** If a student has difficulty jumping, allow them to walk over the cone, then practice jumping with a buddy holding their hand for support. Celebrate their effort equally.\n  3. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use shorter phrases: \"Big push = far jump. Little push = short jump.\" Use pictures and gestures alongside words.\n\n- **Challenge:**\n  1. **Multiple Variables:** Invite advanced students to investigate: \"Does the height of the cone change how hard you need to push? Jump over cones of different heights and compare.\"\n  2. **Prediction and Testing:** Ask: \"Can you predict which will move farther if I push a toy car and a ball with the SAME push? Let's test!\" Encourage hypothesis formation.\n  3. **Real-World Application:** \"Basketball players push with their legs to jump high. Can you jump as high as you can? How is that different from jumping over the small cone?\"\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Pushing Exploration Station:** Set up a table with balls, blocks, and toy cars. Students rotate through, pushing objects with \"little pushes\" and \"big pushes,\" observing and discussing distance traveled. Create a visual graph showing which objects moved farthest.\n\n2. **Jump Measurement Project:** Tape a measuring tape on the floor. Students jump with a \"big push\" and the teacher marks where they land. Over time, create a picture graph of \"How far did we jump?\" Celebrate growth and compare class records.\n\n3. **Pushes and Pulls Hunt:** Send students on a classroom scavenger hunt to find examples of pushes and pulls: Find something you can push (door, ball, box), something someone pulls (drawer, rope, wagon). Take photos or draw pictures to create a class book titled \"Pushes and Pulls in Our Classroom.\"",
