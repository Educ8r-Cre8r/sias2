Investigating Forces and Motion**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or one 90-minute block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 3-PS2-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object.\n  - 3-PS2-2: Make observations and/or measurements of an object's motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Describe** how forces make objects move and change direction.\n2. **Explain** that engines use fuel to create a force that moves cars.\n3. **Predict** how a car will move based on the amount of force applied to it.\n4. **Compare** how different forces (weak vs. strong pushes) change how fast or far something moves.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student interest using the engine photograph and activate prior knowledge about how cars work and what makes things move.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Photograph:** Printed or displayed image of the car engine (p21.jpg)\n- **Chart paper** and markers\n- **Optional:** Video clip of a car engine running (30 seconds maximum)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display the photograph:**\n- Show the engine image with the hood open on a screen or printed poster where all students can see clearly.\n- Allow 1–2 minutes of silent observation time for students to look closely at the different parts.\n\n**Discussion Questions (pose one at a time, wait for multiple student responses):**\n1. *\"What do you notice inside this car engine? What parts can you see?\"*\n2. *\"Why do you think a car needs an engine? What does it do?\"*\n3. *\"If an engine is like the 'heart' of a car, what do you think it does to make the car move?\"*\n4. *\"Have you ever pushed a toy car or roller skates and felt the force? How do you think a car engine creates that push?\"*\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n- *\"I wonder what happens inside this engine to make all these parts move. I wonder what makes the car go faster or slower. Let's investigate how forces can make things move!\"*\n\n**Transition:**\nNext, we're going to become engineers and test how different forces affect motion using our own simple machines.\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate how force affects motion through hands-on experimentation with toy cars and ramps.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Per group of 3–4 students:**\n  - 1 toy car (matchbox-style or similar)\n  - 1 wooden board or cardboard ramp (approximately 12–18 inches long)\n  - Blocks, books, or ramp stands (to adjust height)\n  - 1 meter stick or measuring tape\n  - 1 stopwatch (or teacher timer)\n  - Masking tape\n  - Paper for recording data\n  - Pencils\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Setup (Teacher-led, 3–5 minutes):**\n1. Demonstrate how to set up the ramp at a low angle using books or blocks.\n2. Show students how to release a toy car at the TOP of the ramp and observe where it stops.\n3. Explain: *\"We're going to test how the steepness of the ramp affects how far the car rolls. A steeper ramp means a bigger force pushing the car down.\"*\n\n**Student Investigation (15–20 minutes):**\n\nProvide each group with these written steps (or read aloud as needed):\n\n1. **Set up your ramp** at a low angle using just 1 block under the high end.\n2. **Mark the starting line** with tape at the top of the ramp where the car will start.\n3. **Release the car** (don't push it—just let go) from the starting line.\n4. **Measure** how far the car rolled from the bottom of the ramp using the meter stick. Record this distance.\n5. **Repeat 2 more times** with the ramp at this same angle. Record all three distances.\n6. **Make the ramp steeper** by adding another block under the high end.\n7. **Repeat steps 2–5** with the steeper ramp.\n8. **Make the ramp even steeper** by adding a third block.\n9. **Repeat steps 2–5** one more time.\n\n**Data Recording:**\nStudents draw a simple table on paper with three rows (Ramp Height 1, 2, 3) and columns for three trials. They fill in distances for each trial.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"What did you notice when the ramp got steeper? Did the car roll farther or not as far? Why do you think that happened?\"*\n- Avoid telling students what to conclude; instead, ask them to observe and think.\n- Ensure ramps are set up safely (on a flat surface, away from edges).\n- Help groups struggling with measurement by demonstrating again or providing a template.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students observe that **steeper ramps = greater force = car travels farther**.\n- Students collect and record data showing a pattern: distance increases as angle increases.\n- Students make informal predictions: *\"If we make it even steeper, the car will probably go even farther.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and connect the exploration activity to engine concepts and the photograph.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Chart paper** with vocabulary words written in large letters\n- **Printed or projected photograph** of the engine (p21.jpg)\n- **Simple diagram** showing a ramp with arrows (labeled \"force,\" \"motion,\" \"distance\")\n- **Optional:** Picture cards or illustrations of forces (push, pull)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n1. Ask 2–3 groups to share what they discovered: *\"What changed when your ramp got steeper?\"*\n2. Record their observations on chart paper: *\"Steeper ramp → car goes farther\"* (use pictures/arrows for visual clarity).\n3. Ask: *\"Why do you think the car went farther? What was different about the ramp?\"*\n\n**Introduce Vocabulary (8–10 minutes):**\n\nPresent these terms using the ramp activity and the engine photograph as references:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Third Grade-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Force** | A push or pull that makes something move or change direction. In the ramp, gravity pulled the car down, creating a force. In an engine, tiny explosions push pistons, creating a force. |\n| **Motion** | Movement; when something changes position and travels from one place to another. The car rolling down the ramp is motion. |\n| **Energy** | The power to make things move or change. Fuel in a car engine has energy that turns into motion. |\n| **Unbalanced Forces** | When pushes or pulls are not equal, so something moves. A steeper ramp creates a stronger push, which is an unbalanced force. |\n| **Speed** | How fast something moves. A stronger force can make something move faster or go farther. |\n\n**Connection Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n- Point to the engine in the photo: *\"Inside this engine, tiny explosions happen really fast. These explosions create a FORCE that pushes pistons (metal parts that move up and down). The force from the pistons moves other parts, which turns the wheels. The engine creates UNBALANCED FORCES that make the car MOVE!\"*\n- Compare: *\"In our ramp experiment, gravity created a force pushing the car. In a real engine, explosions create a force pushing the pistons. Both are forces creating motion.\"*\n\n#### Check for Understanding\n- Ask: *\"If an engine creates more force, what do you predict will happen to the car? Will it go faster or slower?\"*\n- Have students do a \"thumbs up, thumbs down\" signal: *\"Thumbs up if you think a stronger force makes a car go faster.\"*\n\n#### Vocabulary\n- **Force:** A push or pull that makes something move or stop.\n- **Motion:** Movement from one place to another.\n- **Energy:** The power to do work and make things move.\n- **Unbalanced Forces:** Pushes and pulls that are not equal, causing something to move.\n- **Speed:** How fast something is moving.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\nStudents understand that:\n- Forces (pushes and pulls) make things move.\n- Stronger forces create faster motion or longer distances.\n- Engines create forces that move cars.\n- Energy from fuel becomes the motion of the car.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply force and motion concepts to a new scenario: designing a toy car obstacle course.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Toy cars** (same ones from Explore)\n- **Various \"obstacles\" and materials to build with:**\n  - Plastic cups or cones (to represent barriers)\n  - Small ramps or cardboard tubes (to represent hills)\n  - Straight wooden blocks or foam strips (to create a track)\n  - Index cards (for barriers or ramps)\n  - Tape and markers\n- **Meter stick** (for measuring)\n- **Design worksheet** (simple, with picture prompts):\n  - *\"Draw your obstacle course\"*\n  - *\"What force will make your car go through it?\"*\n  - *\"Will you need a weak push, medium push, or strong push?\"*\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Challenge Prompt (2 minutes):**\n- *\"You are now car engineers! Your job is to design a mini obstacle course that a toy car must travel through. You'll use what you learned about forces and motion to plan it.\"*\n\n**Student Design Phase (10–15 minutes):**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Plan your course:** Use your worksheet to draw an obstacle course. Include at least 2 obstacles (a small hill, a turn, or a barrier to avoid).\n2. **Build your course:** Use the materials to create your design on a table or on the floor.\n3. **Test the force needed:** Release your car from different heights (creating different forces) to see what force is strong enough to get it through the course.\n4. **Adjust and test:** If the car gets stuck, think: *\"Do I need more force? Should I make the ramp steeper or push harder?\"* Modify your course or try different forces.\n5. **Record:** On your worksheet, write or draw: *\"My car needed a [weak/medium/strong] force to complete the obstacle course.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide the materials and worksheet, then step back and observe.\n- Ask prompts, not answers: *\"What happened when the car didn't make it through? What force do you think you need?\"*\n- Encourage students to predict: *\"Before you test it, what do you think will happen if you use a stronger force?\"*\n- Celebrate problem-solving: *\"I noticed you made the ramp less steep—nice thinking! How did that change the force needed?\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students **design** a simple obstacle course showing understanding of force and motion.\n- Students **predict** what force is needed for their course (weak, medium, or strong).\n- Students **test and adjust** their design based on observations, showing cause-and-effect thinking.\n- Students **explain** their design choices using vocabulary from the Explain phase (force, motion, energy).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of forces, motion, and how engines work using both formative and summative strategies.\n\n#### Formative Assessment (During the Lesson)\n\n**Observation Checklist** (use during Explore and Elaborate):\n- ✓ Student accurately measures and records distances\n- ✓ Student observes the pattern (steeper = farther)\n- ✓ Student makes predictions before testing\n- ✓ Student explains observations using \"force\" and \"motion\"\n- ✓ Student adjusts design based on test results\n\n**Questioning for Understanding** (use throughout):\nAsk individual students:\n- *\"Why did the car go farther when the ramp was steeper?\"*\n- *\"What do you think would happen if we used an even heavier car?\"*\n- *\"How is the force in our ramp experiment like the force in a real engine?\"*\n\n#### Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson 2)\n\n**Written or Oral Exit Ticket** (provide one simple prompt per student or small group):\n\n**Option 1 (Picture-Based):**\n- Show a picture of a car engine (or use the original photo).\n- *\"Draw an arrow to show where a force is made in this engine. Then write or tell me: What does this force do?\"*\n\n**Option 2 (Multiple Choice):**\n- *\"Which one would make a toy car go the FARTHEST?\"*\n  - A. Pushing it gently on flat ground\n  - B. Releasing it from a low ramp\n  - C. Releasing it from a very steep ramp\n- *\"Why did you choose that answer?\"*\n\n**Option 3 (Open-Ended):**\n- *\"How is the force that made our toy car roll down the ramp like the force in a real car engine?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| **Meets Standard** | **Approaching Standard** | **Below Standard** |\n|---|---|---|\n| Student correctly identifies that a steeper ramp (stronger force) makes the car go farther AND can explain why using the term \"force.\" | Student observes that steeper ramps make cars go farther but has difficulty explaining the reason or using \"force\" vocabulary. | Student does not observe a clear pattern or cannot explain how force affects motion. |\n| Student predicts how force will affect motion in a new scenario and explains reasoning. | Student makes a prediction but reasoning is unclear or partially correct. | Student makes predictions without reasoning or incorrectly. |\n| Student applies force concepts to the obstacle course design and adjusts based on testing. | Student designs a course but testing and adjustment are limited or undirected. | Student struggles to connect force concepts to design or testing. |\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students should be able to:\n1. **Demonstrate** that stronger forces (steeper ramps) create greater distances traveled.\n2. **Explain** (verbally or in writing) that engines use forces to make cars move.\n3. **Predict** how a car will move given a specific force.\n4. **Apply** force concepts to design and troubleshoot a simple obstacle course.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Data Recording:** Provide a pre-drawn table with spaces for students to just write numbers or draw pictures instead of creating their own chart. Reduce the number of trials from 3 to 2.\n\n2. **Ramp Stabilization & Setup:** Pre-build ramps at two fixed angles (low and high) so students only release the car and measure distance. Eliminate the task of adjusting the ramp themselves.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Support:** Use picture cards alongside written vocabulary terms. Have students match vocabulary cards to pictures from the lesson (ramp, car, force arrow). Pair struggling students with a peer or adult for the explanation phase.\n\n4. **Guided Questioning:** Instead of open-ended questions, offer choices: *\"Did the car go farther or shorter? Which ramp was steeper—this one or this one?\"* Use yes/no or either/or formats to build confidence.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Multiple Variables Investigation:** Ask advanced students to investigate TWO variables at once: *\"How does both the ramp angle AND the car's starting position affect how far it goes? Test different combinations and make a prediction.\"* Introduce the idea of \"fair testing\" (changing only one variable at a time).\n\n2. **Real-World Connection:** Challenge students to research or discuss (with images): *\"In a real car, what is the 'ramp' or source of the force? How is a car engine different from our ramp experiment? Where does the energy come from?\"* Have them draw a comparison diagram.\n\n3. **Obstacle Course Complexity:** Instead of just predicting force needed, ask advanced students to *\"calculate or estimate the distance their car travels and compare it to the ramp experiment results. Is the force similar or different?\"* Introduce the idea that distance can show how much force was applied.\n\n4. **Engineering Design Challenge:** *\"Design an obstacle course where the car must stop at a specific spot, not go as far as possible. What forces or barriers will you use? Test and adjust.\"* This reverses the challenge and requires deeper problem-solving.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Friction Investigation:** *\"What happens when we put different surfaces on our ramp (sandpaper, wax paper, foam)? Does the car still go the same distance? Investigate how different materials create different amounts of friction, which changes motion.\"* (Connects to force and surface interaction.)\n\n2. **Real Engine Video Deep Dive:** Show an age-appropriate short video (2–3 minutes) of a real engine running or an animated engine showing pistons moving. Have students label or point to where they see \"force,\" \"motion,\" and \"energy\" being used. Create a classroom poster: *\"How an Engine Works: The Force Connection.\"*\n\n3. **Design a Toy Car Launch System:** *\"Using a rubber band, spring, or catapult mechanism, design and build a device that launches a toy car across the floor. Test different 'forces' (tight rubber band vs. loose one) and predict which creates the most motion. Record and compare results.\"* (Connects to stored energy, force application, and prediction.)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety First:** Ensure ramps are stable and positioned away from sharp edges or fall hazards. Test all materials before the lesson.\n- **Vocabulary Exposure:** Repeat the key terms (force, motion, energy) multiple times throughout the lesson using consistent language.\n- **Visual Learners:** Use lots of arrows, diagrams, and the photograph frequently. Third graders benefit from seeing concepts illustrated.\n- **Peer Teaching:** Pair students strategically during Explore so that observation and data collection are shared responsibilities.\n- **Connection to Student Life:** Reference everyday examples: *\"When you push a swing, you're using force. When you ride a bike downhill, gravity creates a force. When a car accelerates, the engine creates a force.\"*\n\nThis lesson plan builds from concrete, hands-on exploration of forces to abstract understanding of how engines work, meeting the developmental needs of Third Grade learners while remaining grounded in the NGSS physical science standards.",
