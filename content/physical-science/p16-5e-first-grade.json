Exploring Light and Surfaces**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90 minutes (two 45-minute sessions, or one extended block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 1-PS4-2: Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that objects in darkness can be seen only when illuminated.\n  - 1-PS4-3: Plan and conduct investigations to determine the effect of placing objects made with different materials in the path of a beam of light.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Observe and describe** how different materials look when light shines on them.\n2. **Compare** shiny and dull surfaces and explain why some things reflect light differently.\n3. **Predict and test** whether different materials become visible when light is added.\n4. **Communicate findings** using drawings and simple sentences about light and materials.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the salad with fried chicken\n- Flashlight or desk lamp\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:**\n   - Show students the photograph on a screen or printed poster.\n   - Darken the room slightly (but safely).\n   - Shine a flashlight on the image and ask students to watch what happens to the colors and textures.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (calibrated for First Grade):**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What colors do you notice?\" *(Activate observation skills)*\n   - \"Why can we see the food so clearly? Is it bright or dark in this picture?\" *(Connect to light)*\n   - \"Which parts look shiny or sparkly? Which parts look dull?\" *(Distinguish reflective surfaces)*\n   - \"What would happen if we turned off all the lights? Could we still see the food?\" *(Introduce the idea that light is needed to see)*\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n   - \"I wonder: If we took this photo in a dark room with NO light, what would happen? Would we still see the beautiful colors?\" \n   - Record student predictions on chart paper: \"We think we would see... because...\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be light scientists! We'll test what happens when light shines on different things, just like light is shining on this yummy food.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Flashlight or small LED light\n- Various materials in a \"light exploration box\":\n  - Shiny aluminum foil (crumpled and flat)\n  - Dull black paper or construction paper\n  - White paper\n  - Clear plastic wrap\n  - Lettuce or green leaf\n  - Pieces of textured food items (raw carrot, bread crust) if available\n  - Toy chicken or brown textured object (to mimic the fried coating)\n- Dark box, bag, or cloth to create darkness\n- Recording sheet (simple picture chart with columns: \"Bright/Shiny\" and \"Dull/Dark\")\n\n**Activity (Student Directions):**\n\n1. **Setup:** \"Sit in your group. I'm going to give you a dark place (box or under a cloth) and a flashlight.\"\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Investigation:**\n   - \"Pick one material from the box. Place it inside the dark area.\"\n   - \"Turn OFF the light. Can you see it? What do you notice?\" (Record: It's hard to see / very dark)\n   - \"Now turn ON the flashlight and shine it on your material. What happens now? Can you see it?\" (Record: I can see it!)\n   - \"Does the light bounce off it brightly, or does it get swallowed up by darkness? Is it shiny like a mirror, or dull like paper?\"\n   - \"Draw or color your material on the recording sheet. Put it in the 'Bright/Shiny' or 'Dull/Dark' column.\"\n   - \"Trade materials with a friend. Try the next one.\"\n\n3. **Connection to the Photograph:**\n   - \"The fried chicken in the picture is shiny and golden. The lettuce is darker and more dull. Let's see if our materials act the same way!\"\n\n4. **What Students Should Record:**\n   - Simple drawings or pictures of materials\n   - Tally marks or stickers in \"Bright\" or \"Dull\" columns\n   - Teacher scribe or verbal description: \"The foil is super shiny! Light bounces off it. The black paper is dark—the light doesn't bounce back as much.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \n  - \"What do you see when the light is OFF? What about when it's ON?\"\n  - \"Does light bounce off this material?\"\n  - Avoid saying \"shiny\" or \"dull\"—let students discover and name the difference.\n- Ensure students experience the light ON/OFF contrast clearly.\n- Provide vocabulary hints only after observation: \"When light bounces off, we call it *shiny*. When it doesn't bounce, it looks *dull*.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that materials are invisible in darkness.\n- Students notice that some materials reflect light brightly (foil, white paper) while others absorb it (black paper, natural materials).\n- Students create a simple sorting record of materials.\n- Students use emerging vocabulary like \"bright,\" \"shiny,\" \"dark,\" \"see,\" \"light.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student recording sheets from Explore\n- Picture vocabulary cards (with illustrations):\n  - **Light** (sun, flashlight, lamp)\n  - **Shiny** (mirror, foil, polished object)\n  - **Dull** (paper, fabric, matte surface)\n  - **Reflect** (arrow showing light bouncing)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Let's talk about what we discovered! Who wants to show their materials?\"\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to hold up their \"shiny\" and \"dull\" materials.\n   - Ask: \"Why did you put aluminum foil in the shiny group? What happened when you shined the light?\"\n   - \"Why did you put black paper in the dull group?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - **Light:** \"Light is what helps us see things. Light can come from the sun, a flashlight, or a lamp.\" (Show examples)\n   - **Shiny:** \"Shiny things are smooth. Light bounces off them like a ball bouncing off the ground. We see bright colors and sparkles.\" (Show foil and white paper)\n   - **Dull:** \"Dull things are rougher or darker. Light doesn't bounce off as much. These things absorb the light, like a sponge absorbs water.\" (Show black paper)\n   - **Reflect:** \"When light bounces off something shiny, we say it *reflects* light. Reflect means bounce!\" (Demonstrate with flashlight and foil)\n\n3. **Connection Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at our picture again. See the fried chicken coating? It's golden and shiny, right? That's because light is bouncing off it and reflecting. We can see it clearly!\"\n   - \"The green lettuce is darker and more dull. Light doesn't bounce off as brightly, so it's not as sparkly.\"\n   - \"Without light, we wouldn't see ANY of these colors. Everything would be pitch black!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Hold up different classroom objects (mirror, textbook, pencil, black shoe) and ask: \"Is this shiny or dull? Why? Does light bounce off it?\"\n   - Thumbs up/down signal: \"Light bounces off shiny things—true or false?\" (Encourage individual signals)\n   - Quick picture sort: Show three images; students point to \"shiny\" vs. \"dull.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Light** | Something that helps us see things; it can come from the sun, flashlight, or lamp |\n| **Shiny** | A smooth surface where light bounces off brightly so we can see sparkles and bright colors |\n| **Dull** | A surface where light doesn't bounce as much; it looks darker and less sparkly |\n| **Reflect** | When light bounces off a shiny surface like a ball bouncing off the ground |\n| **Darkness** | When there is no light; we cannot see things in darkness |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and identify shiny vs. dull materials.\n- Students understand that light is necessary to see.\n- Students make a simple connection between light reflection and visibility.\n- Students use vocabulary: light, shiny, dull, reflect, see, bounce.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One flashlight per group\n- Craft materials:\n  - Aluminum foil\n  - Black construction paper\n  - White poster board\n  - Tape\n  - Crayons or markers\n- \"Light Signals\" template (simple illustration of a dark room with a target)\n- Optional: String for hanging signals\n\n**Activity: \"Design a Light Signal\"**\n\n1. **Introduction (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Imagine a firefighter is looking for help at night. It's very dark! They need to see a bright signal. Your job: design a signal that REFLECTS light really well so the firefighter can see it far away.\"\n\n2. **Student Directions (13 minutes):**\n   - \"Choose a shiny material from our box. Foil or white paper works great because light bounces off them!\"\n   - \"Decorate your signal. You can use markers, draw shapes, or make patterns.\"\n   - \"Tape your shiny material to a stick or piece of paper to make a flag.\"\n   - \"Test it! Shine a flashlight on it. Does the light bounce off really well? Can you see it from across the room?\"\n   - \"If it's not bright enough, add MORE shiny material or switch to an even shinier surface.\"\n\n3. **Real-World Application:**\n   - \"Real signals use shiny, reflective materials like on firefighter vests, road signs, and bicycle reflectors. They need light to bounce off so people can see them at night!\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Facilitate material selection.\n   - Ask: \"Does your signal work? How bright is the reflection? Would a firefighter be able to see it?\"\n   - Encourage iteration: \"Try a different material if this one isn't shiny enough.\"\n   - Test signals with flashlight and provide feedback.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply understanding that shiny materials reflect light better.\n- Students create a functional light-reflecting object.\n- Students understand a real-world application (safety signals).\n- Students demonstrate that material choice affects light reflection.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Do students systematically test materials with light ON/OFF? Do they notice the difference?\n- **Questioning during Explain:** Can students identify shiny vs. dull materials? Do they use vocabulary correctly?\n- **Artifact Review:** Are their recording sheets organized? Do drawings match descriptions?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple picture card or paper with three images:\n1. A flashlight shining on aluminum foil (shiny, reflective)\n2. A flashlight shining on black paper (dull, non-reflective)\n3. A room in complete darkness with no light source\n\n**Prompt (read aloud for First Grade):**\n\"I'm going to ask you questions. Show me with your thumb or finger which picture answers best.\"\n\n1. **\"Which picture shows something SHINY where light bounces off?\"** (Answer: Image 1 - foil)\n2. **\"Which picture shows something DULL where light doesn't bounce as much?\"** (Answer: Image 2 - black paper)\n3. **\"Which picture shows a place where you CAN'T see anything because there is no light?\"** (Answer: Image 3 - darkness)\n\n**OR (for more advanced/independent students):**\nProvide a simple drawing task:\n- \"Draw or color a shiny object that reflects light.\" (Assess: Does student choose a light-reflective material? Do they show light bouncing?)\n- \"Draw or color a dull object.\" (Assess: Do they recognize non-reflective materials?)\n- \"Draw the sun or a flashlight making something visible.\" (Assess: Do they show light as a requirement for seeing?)\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies shiny vs. dull materials (2/3 correct)\n- ✓ Student explains that light is needed to see (can point or say: \"We need light\")\n- ✓ Student demonstrates that light bounces off shiny things (observed during Explore or Elaborate)\n- ✓ Student creates a reflective object in Elaborate that visibly reflects light\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will correctly identify shiny and dull materials.\n- Most students will understand that light enables visibility.\n- Students will recognize that reflective materials are useful for safety/visibility.\n- Some students may begin to explain cause-and-effect: \"Light bounces → I see shiny.\"\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Materials:** Reduce the number of exploration materials to 2-3 highly contrasting items (shiny aluminum foil vs. black paper). Eliminate moderately reflective items that might confuse.\n\n2. **Structured Questioning:** Use yes/no or binary choice questions instead of open-ended:\n   - \"Is this shiny? YES or NO?\"\n   - \"Can you see it better with the light ON or OFF?\"\n\n3. **Buddy System:** Pair with a more advanced peer or assign a teacher/aid to guide investigations step-by-step during Explore. Pre-teach vocabulary with picture cards before the lesson.\n\n4. **Hand-Over-Hand Facilitation:** During Explore, physically guide the student's hand to turn the flashlight on/off and notice the change in visibility. Use think-aloud narration: \"I'm turning the light ON. Now I can see the foil really bright!\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Hypothesis Testing:** Before investigating, have students predict which materials will be shiny or dull. Record predictions. Then compare to results: \"Were you right? Why or why not?\"\n\n2. **Extended Vocabulary:** Introduce \"opaque,\" \"transparent,\" and \"translucent.\" Have advanced students classify materials into these categories using clear plastic, frosted plastic, and opaque materials. Explore: \"Does light pass through or bounce off?\"\n\n3. **Complex Application:** Challenge students to design a signal that works in THREE conditions: bright daylight, twilight (dim light), and darkness with only a flashlight. Which materials work best in all conditions? Why?\n\n4. **Investigation Extension:** Provide mirrors and ask: \"Can you use a shiny material to reflect light and make it bounce in a different direction? Show me!\" This introduces the directionality of light reflection.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Shiny Treasure Hunt\"** (10-15 minutes, any time)\n   - Provide students with a flashlight and a checklist of \"shiny\" vs. \"dull\" items to find around the classroom.\n   - Students search and mark off: aluminum foil, mirrors, book covers, poster board, shoes, etc.\n   - Debrief: \"What did you find that was shiny? What was dull? Why do you think some things are shiny?\"\n\n2. **\"Light and Shadow Exploration\"** (20 minutes, follow-up lesson)\n   - Extend to NGSS 1-PS4-3 (shadows and light blocking).\n   - Set up a light source (lamp or flashlight). Place opaque objects in front of it.\n   - Students observe and trace shadows on paper.\n   - Discussion: \"The light is blocked by this object, so we see a dark shadow. The light can't pass through because it's *opaque*.\"\n   - Activity: Have students create shadow puppets with their hands.\n\n3. **\"Reflective Safety Gear Exploration\"** (15 minutes, home/family extension)\n   - Send a note home: \"Ask your family to find items that REFLECT light (bicycle reflectors, safety vests, watch faces, car reflectors). Bring one to school or draw a picture.\"\n   - Discuss real-world applications: firefighters, crossing guards, bicyclists, hikers use reflective gear to stay visible and safe.\n   - Extension: Visit a local fire station or safety workshop if available.\n\n4. **\"Make a Shiny Picture\"** (20 minutes, art integration)\n   - Students create a collage using shiny and dull materials (foil, paper, felt, magazine clippings).\n   - Label which parts are \"shiny\" (reflect light) and which are \"dull\" (absorb light).\n   - Display under classroom lights to show the contrast.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety First:** Ensure flashlights are not aimed at students' eyes. Use LED lights if available—they are cooler and safer than incandescent bulbs.\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Use the terms \"shiny\" and \"dull\" consistently throughout the day when referring to classroom objects. Build vocabulary naturally.\n- **Photo Connection:** Reference the food photograph multiple times—it's a concrete, familiar context that keeps First Graders engaged.\n- **Light Sensitivity:** Some students may be sensitive to bright lights or darkness. Ensure the darkened room is still safe and that students feel secure. Provide opt-outs if needed.\n- **Repetition:** First Graders benefit from repetition. Plan to revisit this lesson or these concepts in follow-up activities.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson leverages the photograph's visible properties of light reflection while meeting NGSS 1-PS4-2 and 1-PS4-3 standards. Students engage with concrete materials, build vocabulary, and leave with an understanding that light is essential for seeing and that materials affect how light behaves.",
