Different colors of light send different messages.\n- **Sound as a Warning Signal:** Railroad crossing signals produce sounds (bells, horns) that vibrate the air and alert people to danger—demonstrating how sound travels to communicate warnings at a distance.\n- **Energy in Communication:** Both the glowing red light and the sound from crossing signals are forms of energy that travel through space to send messages to observers, helping keep people safe.\n- **Materials and Light:** The metal and reflective surfaces on the train and signal equipment interact with light in different ways—some materials reflect light brightly, while others absorb it, affecting how visible the train is to approaching vehicles.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Red Light, Loud Sound: How Trains Tell Us to Stay Safe**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Physical Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 40-50 minute sessions (or three 30-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 1-PS4-1: Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that vibrating materials can make sound and that sound can make materials vibrate.\n  - 1-PS4-4: Use tools and materials to design and build a device that uses light or sound to solve the problem of communicating over a distance.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to...\n- **Explain** that trains use light (red signals) and sound (bells/horns) to tell people an important message: \"Stay away! A train is coming!\"\n- **Demonstrate** how vibrations create sound by making objects shake and observing the sound that results.\n- **Design and build** a simple light or sound device that sends a safety warning message to someone far away.\n- **Predict** what would happen if the red light or warning sound were not working at a railroad crossing.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest using the railroad crossing photograph and activate prior knowledge about warning signals.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image or large printout of the railroad crossing photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Red and green construction paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or large screen. Point out the big train, the red light, the \"RAILROAD CROSSING\" sign, and the yellow and red striped barriers.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"Why do you think that light is RED instead of green or blue?\"\n   - \"What does this red light tell people in cars to do?\"\n   - \"Have you ever heard a loud bell or horn at a railroad crossing? What do you think it's trying to tell people?\"\n   - \"If the red light was broken and didn't work, what might happen?\"\n\n3. **Make a prediction chart** on the board. Write: \"What does a train crossing signal do?\" Have students turn and talk to a neighbor for 1 minute, then collect their ideas:\n   - *Examples of student responses:* \"It tells cars to stop,\" \"It warns us,\" \"It makes noise so we hear the train coming,\" \"The light flashes red.\"\n\n4. **Read-aloud moment:** Hold up a red piece of construction paper. Say: \"This red color is VERY important. It means STOP and PAY ATTENTION. Trains are BIG and HEAVY, and they can't stop quickly like cars. These signals keep everyone safe.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to discover exactly HOW these signals work—how light sends a message and how sound travels to warn us.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22-28 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how vibrations make sound and discover how light and sound can send messages.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Station 1 (Sound/Vibration):** Rubber bands stretched across empty containers or cardboard boxes, paper plates, popcorn kernels or rice, spoons, flashlights\n- **Station 2 (Light Messages):** Flashlights, red cellophane or red plastic sheets, white paper or white wall, dark room or closet corner\n- **Station 3 (Sound at a Distance):** Two paper cups, string, scissors, tape\n- Chart paper or worksheet for recording observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\nStudents rotate through **three short stations** (6-8 minutes each) with a partner or small group. Teacher stations students; no ability grouping necessary as all students participate in all stations.\n\n**STATION 1: Vibrations Make Sound**\n- **Student Directions:** \n  1. Pluck a rubber band stretched across the container. Listen and WATCH.\n  2. Place your hand gently on the rubber band while someone else plucks it. What do you feel?\n  3. Sprinkle rice or popcorn kernels on the paper plate. Tap a spoon against the plate. Watch what happens to the rice!\n  4. Record: Draw what the rice did when the plate vibrated.\n\n- **What They're Discovering:** Moving things (vibrations) make sound. You can see and feel vibrations.\n\n**STATION 2: Light Sends a Message**\n- **Student Directions:**\n  1. In the dark area, shine a flashlight on the white paper. What do you see?\n  2. Put red cellophane in front of the flashlight. Shine it on the white paper again.\n  3. Turn off the red light. What happens?\n  4. Record: Draw what the light looked like with and without the red cellophane.\n\n- **What They're Discovering:** Light travels and makes things visible. Red light sends a warning message. Without light, we can't see.\n\n**STATION 3: Sound Carries a Message Far Away**\n- **Student Directions:**\n  1. Make a \"phone\" with two cups and string: Poke a hole in the bottom of each cup. Thread string through and tie knots.\n  2. One partner holds one cup to their ear; the other holds the cup to their mouth far away.\n  3. Talk quietly into the cup. Can your partner hear you? How far away can you be?\n  4. Record: How many steps away could you hear the message?\n\n- **What They're Discovering:** Sound travels through materials (the string) and can reach people far away, just like a train's horn reaches drivers far down the road.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate with a clipboard, listening to student conversations.\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"What happened when...?\" \"Why do you think...?\"\n- Gently guide without revealing answers: \"Let's try that again and watch carefully.\"\n- Ensure all students get a turn at each station.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe vibrations create sound.\n- Students see red light and understand it signals \"warning.\"\n- Students experience how sound travels through materials to reach distant listeners.\n- Students record observations via drawings and simple written notes.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (16-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to railroad crossing signals.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph from Engage phase\n- Pictures of railroad crossing signals (bell, light, horn)\n- Index cards with vocabulary terms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a circle.** Ask: \"What did you notice at each station? Who wants to share?\"\n   - Invite 2-3 volunteers from each station to share one observation.\n   - Write student discoveries on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** using student-friendly language:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Vibration** | When something shakes back and forth really fast. Vibrations make sound. |\n| **Sound** | Energy that travels through the air (or string or water) so we can hear it. |\n| **Light** | Energy that travels so we can see things. Light can be many colors. |\n| **Signal** | A message sent using light, sound, or both to tell someone something important. |\n| **Warning** | A sign that says \"Be careful!\" or \"Danger!\" to keep people safe. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the red light on the crossing signal. Say: \"This RED LIGHT is a SIGNAL. It vibrates on and off, sending the message: 'STOP! Train coming!'\"\n   - Point to where the bell/horn would be. Say: \"The bell or horn VIBRATES and makes a loud SOUND that travels through the air. People far away can hear it and know a train is near.\"\n   - Ask: \"How are the light and sound the same?\" (Both send messages. Both travel. Both warn people.)\n   - Ask: \"How are they different?\" (Light is what we see; sound is what we hear. Light travels very fast; sound is a little slower.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Thumbs up/sideways/down: \"Do vibrations make sound?\" (Thumbs up)\n   - Quick-draw: \"Draw a red light. What does it tell us?\" (Collect drawings; look for evidence students understand \"warning\" or \"stop\")\n   - Think-pair-share: \"If you were a car driver far from the train, which signal would reach you first—the light or the sound? Why?\" (Sound takes longer to travel; both reach, but light seems instant.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Vibration:** When something shakes back and forth really fast. Vibrations make sound.\n- **Sound:** Energy that travels through the air (or string or water) so we can hear it.\n- **Light:** Energy that travels so we can see things. Light can be many colors.\n- **Signal:** A message sent using light, sound, or both to tell someone something important.\n- **Warning:** A sign that says \"Be careful!\" or \"Danger!\" to keep people safe.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and define vibration, sound, light, signal, and warning.\n- Students connect their observations (rice bouncing, red light shining, sound through string) to how real railroad crossing signals work.\n- Students understand that light and sound are used TOGETHER to keep people safe.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18-22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing and building a simple safety warning device.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small flashlights or LED tea lights\n- Red cellophane or red plastic sheets\n- Paper cups, paper tubes, or tin cans\n- Rubber bands\n- Bells, spoons, or other materials that make noise\n- Tape, scissors, craft materials\n- \"Safety Warning Device Design Sheet\" (worksheet with boxes for: Draw your device, Label the light/sound part, Write what your signal says, Test results)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Design Challenge: Make a Safety Warning Device**\n\n1. **Present the challenge:** \"Pretend you are an engineer for a train company. You need to design a NEW safety warning device that uses LIGHT and/or SOUND to tell people: 'STOP! Something dangerous is here!' What would your device look like? How would it work?\"\n\n2. **Brainstorm together** (2 minutes):\n   - Show a few simple examples on the board:\n     - *Example 1:* A flashlight with red cellophane that blinks on and off\n     - *Example 2:* A cup with rice inside that you shake to make noise\n     - *Example 3:* A bell attached to a rubber band that vibrates\n   - Emphasize: \"Your device can be SIMPLE! It just needs to use light OR sound (or both!) to send a warning.\"\n\n3. **Students design in pairs or small groups** (12-15 minutes):\n   - Hand out the **Design Sheet** and materials.\n   - **Step 1:** Draw your device on the design sheet.\n   - **Step 2:** Build it using the materials (tape, cups, flashlights, bells, rice, etc.).\n   - **Step 3:** Test it: Does your light shine red? Does your sound work? Is the message clear?\n   - **Step 4:** Write or draw on the design sheet: \"My signal says: ___________\" (e.g., \"STOP!\" or \"DANGER!\" or \"TRAIN COMING!\")\n\n4. **Gallery walk** (3-5 minutes):\n   - Display all devices in the room or on a table.\n   - Students do a quick walk to see others' designs.\n   - Ask: \"Which designs use light? Which use sound? Which use both?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without building FOR students. Ask: \"What material could make a red light?\" \"How could you make it vibrate?\"\n- Encourage creativity: \"There's no one 'right' answer!\"\n- Help groups that struggle by offering a narrowed choice: \"Would you like to use light OR sound?\" and providing one material option.\n- Take photos of finished devices for documentation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design and build a working safety warning device using light, sound, or both.\n- Students can explain what their signal does and how it keeps people safe.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that light and sound are effective ways to send important messages.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of light, sound, signals, and how they communicate warnings.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Station observations:** Teacher notes during Explore phase—do students observe vibrations, see light effects, hear sound through string?\n- **Vocabulary check:** During Explain, observe thumbs up/down and listen to think-pair-share responses. Do students use \"vibration,\" \"signal,\" and \"warning\" appropriately?\n- **Device design:** During Elaborate, circulate and ask: \"How does your device send a message? Why did you choose light/sound/both?\"\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (written for you to read aloud; students may answer verbally, draw, or write):\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Draw or tell:** \"Draw a red light signal. What does it tell people?\"\n   - *Success Criterion:* Student shows a light and mentions \"stop,\" \"warning,\" \"be careful,\" or \"train coming.\"\n\n2. **Vibration question:** \"When a bell at a train crossing rings, what is happening to make the sound?\"\n   - *Success Criterion:* Student mentions \"shaking,\" \"moving back and forth,\" or \"vibrating.\"\n\n3. **Distance question:** \"Why is a loud horn sound important at a railroad crossing?\"\n   - *Success Criterion:* Student explains that sound travels far and helps people who are far away know the train is coming.\n\n4. **Design thinking:** \"If you could add one more thing to a railroad crossing signal to make it even better at warning people, what would it be? Why?\"\n   - *Success Criterion:* Student suggests a creative addition and gives a logical reason (e.g., \"Add more lights so it's even brighter,\" \"Add a horn sound so people who can't see the light can hear it\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding when they:\n- ✓ Correctly identify red light as a warning signal\n- ✓ Explain that vibrations create sound\n- ✓ Describe how sound travels to warn distant people\n- ✓ Show they can apply learning by designing a simple warning device\n- ✓ Use vocabulary terms (vibration, signal, warning, light, sound) appropriately in context\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Scaffold vocabulary with visuals:** Pair each vocabulary term with a picture card (real photo of a vibrating fork, a red traffic light, a sound wave symbol, etc.). Reference these during Explain and throughout activities.\n\n2. **Partner strategically during Explore:** Pair emerging readers/scientists with confident peers. Assign the same station rotation but allow the struggling student to be the \"observer\" first while the partner is the \"doer,\" then switch roles.\n\n3. **Simplify the design challenge:** Offer pre-assembled device options for students who struggle with fine motor skills or planning. Example: \"Here's a flashlight with red cellophane already attached. Now test it and tell me if the red light sends a good warning.\" Allow them to focus on testing and evaluation rather than construction.\n\n4. **Use repetition and multisensory input:** Repeat key phrases (\"Vibrations make sound!\" \"Red light means stop!\") throughout the lesson. Have students repeat them back. Use hand motions (shaking for vibration, pointing to eyes for light, pointing to ears for sound).\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Add complexity to the design:** Challenge students to create a device that uses BOTH light AND sound together, just like a real railroad crossing. Ask: \"How would you make the light and sound work at the same time? Why would both signals be better than just one?\"\n\n2. **Investigate variables:** Ask: \"Does the color of light matter? Let's test red, green, and white light and see which one people notice first as a warning.\" Have students predict, test, and record results.\n\n3. **Research and present:** Have students look up (with teacher guidance) other places that use light or sound to warn people (fire alarms, school bells, traffic lights, sirens, car horns). Create a class chart: \"Warning Signals We Use.\"\n\n4. **Design an improved signal:** Ask: \"What if someone couldn't see the red light or hear the sound? How could we change the signal so everyone—including people who are deaf or blind—would know about the danger?\" (This opens discussion of accessible design and multiple ways to communicate.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Field Trip or Virtual Visit:** If possible, arrange a visit to a nearby railroad crossing (from a safe distance) or show a video of a real train crossing in action. Students can listen for the bell/horn and see the red light activate. Afterward, have students draw what they observed and write/tell one new thing they learned about how the signals work together.\n\n2. **Vibration Scavenger Hunt:** Send students around the school or classroom to find things that vibrate and make sound. Examples: a buzzing timer, a vibrating phone, a doorbell, a singing greeting card, a guitar string. For each discovery, have students draw the object and write or say: \"This _______ vibrates to make a sound.\"\n\n3. **Create a Class Train Safety Poster:** As a group, design a large poster about railroad crossing safety that shows: (1) the red light signal, (2) the sound signal, (3) a picture of people staying back from the crossing, and (4) text that says: \"When you see the red light and hear the sound, STOP and WAIT! A train is coming!\" Hang it in the hallway or classroom.\n\n4. **Sound Telephone Relay:** Expand the cup-and-string phone experiment. Create a longer \"telephone line\" with more than two cups. Have students pass a message down the line: \"Train coming!\" Did the message stay the same? This reinforces how sound travels through materials but also introduces the idea of signal loss or degradation over distance.\n\n5. **Light and Color Exploration:** Set up a station where students can shine flashlights through different colored cellophanes (red, yellow, green, blue) and observe which color seems brightest or most \"attention-getting\" as a warning signal. Have them vote on which color would be the best for a railroad crossing signal.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis lesson uses a real-world photograph of a railroad crossing to help first graders discover that **vibrations create sound** and that **light and sound are forms of energy that travel to send important messages**. Through hands-on exploration, vocabulary building, and a meaningful design challenge, students understand how these signals work together to keep people safe. The lesson aligns perfectly with 1-PS4-1 (vibrations and sound) and 1-PS4-4 (designing a device using light or sound to communicate), and it bridges abstract physics concepts to something students recognize and can directly relate to: a train crossing signal they may have encountered.",
