Identify and describe the body structures of a dragonfly and explain how each structure helps the dragonfly survive and hunt\n2. Explain how a dragonfly's adaptations allow it to move through its water-based habitat and catch food\n3. Develop a model showing how dragonflies fit into a food chain as predators in their ecosystem\n4. Predict how changes to a dragonfly's water habitat might affect its survival\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about dragonflies and activate prior knowledge about animal adaptations using the striking photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy of the dragonfly photograph (color, 8.5\" × 11\" minimum, or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Video clip of dragonfly flying in slow motion (30 seconds, YouTube)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and hook:** Project or display the dragonfly photograph prominently. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Opening prompt:** Say, \"This creature is one of the fastest insects on Earth. It can fly forward, backward, and hover in place. What do you notice about its body that might help it do these amazing things?\"\n\n3. **Discussion questions** (pose one at a time; allow 1-2 minutes for partner talk, then share out):\n   - \"What parts of this dragonfly's body do you notice first? Why do you think those parts stand out?\"\n   - \"Where do you think dragonflies live, and what clues from the photo might tell us?\" (Look for references to water, weathered surfaces near water, etc.)\n   - \"What do you think dragonflies eat? What body parts might help them catch food?\"\n   - \"If a dragonfly's wings didn't work, how would its life be different?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** Record student responses on chart paper titled \"What We Wonder About Dragonflies.\" Keep this visible throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become dragonfly detectives and discover how this insect's body is perfectly designed to survive where it lives.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate dragonfly adaptations through hands-on observation and model-building.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large images of dragonflies (one per pair of students, printed or displayed) — include labeled diagrams showing: wings, compound eyes, body segments, legs\n- Craft materials: pipe cleaners (4-6 per student), tissue paper or cellophane, googly eyes, yarn, tape\n- Observation sheets (template provided below)\n- Real dragonfly specimens OR high-quality photos if specimens are unavailable\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but recommended)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Structured Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute dragonfly images and observation sheets to student pairs.\n\n2. Direct students: \"Your job is to carefully observe the dragonfly's body. Look at the photograph of the real dragonfly we just saw. Use a magnifying glass if you have one.\"\n\n3. **Observation sheet prompts** (students draw and label or write):\n   - What do you see where the dragonfly's head is? (Look for: compound eyes, mouth parts)\n   - How many legs does it have? Where are they located?\n   - Describe the wings. How many are there? What are they made of? (Thin, transparent, delicate)\n   - What does the body (abdomen) look like? How many sections does it have?\n   - Why might each of these body parts be important for hunting other insects?\n\n4. Teacher circulates and asks: \"What do you think this body part does?\" rather than providing answers. Push thinking: \"Why would large eyes be helpful for a predator?\"\n\n**Part B: Dragonfly Model Building (15 minutes)**\n\n1. Explain: \"Now you're going to build your own model dragonfly using craft materials. Your model should show the four main body parts we observed: the head, thorax (middle section), abdomen (long tail), and wings.\"\n\n2. **Step-by-step directions:**\n   - Use a pipe cleaner bent into a body shape (pipe cleaner curled for head, straightened for thorax, coiled or twisted for abdomen)\n   - Add googly eyes to the head\n   - Attach tissue paper or cellophane to represent wings (tape to thorax area)\n   - Add yarn legs to the thorax area (6 total, 3 on each side)\n   - Label each part\n\n3. **Discussion while building:** Ask, \"Why did we make the wings so thin and light? What about the eyes — why are we putting them on the head?\"\n\n4. **Documentation:** Students take a photo of their model or sketch it and label the parts.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without solving; ask guiding questions\n- Ensure students are observing carefully before building\n- Encourage students to explain their design choices: \"Tell me why you made the wings that way\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Completed observation sheets with descriptions/drawings of dragonfly body parts\n- A 3D model dragonfly showing head, thorax, abdomen, wings, and legs\n- Verbal explanations of why each structure matters for survival\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and connect observations to adaptation concepts using the photograph and student work.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Projected image of the dragonfly from the photograph\n- Vocabulary reference cards (printed, 1 per student or displayed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 student pairs to show their models and explain one body part and why it matters\n   - Display models around the room\n\n2. **Introduce and define key vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n\n   Create a visible anchor chart as you introduce each term. Use the dragonfly photograph to point to examples:\n\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment. *\"The dragonfly's large eyes are an adaptation because they help it see small insects moving in the air.\"*\n   \n   - **Compound eyes:** Eyes made up of many tiny lenses that allow the dragonfly to see in almost all directions at once. *\"Look at the huge eyes on this dragonfly's head. These help it spot prey flying around it.\"*\n   \n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts other animals for food. *\"Dragonflies are predators because they catch and eat other insects.\"*\n   \n   - **Prey:** Animals that are hunted and eaten by other animals. *\"Mosquitoes and small flies are prey for dragonflies.\"*\n   \n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. *\"Dragonfly habitats are usually near ponds, streams, or marshes where water is present.\"*\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to the dragonfly's compound eyes: \"These huge eyes can see in almost every direction. Imagine hunting an insect that flies fast—you'd need eyes like these!\"\n   - Point to the transparent wings: \"These wings are so thin and light that the dragonfly can move in any direction—forward, backward, side to side, and even hover in one spot.\"\n   - Point to the body: \"See how streamlined and smooth the body is? This shape lets it move through the air quickly.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why is a dragonfly a predator, not prey? Turn and talk to a partner.\"\n   - Ask: \"If a dragonfly didn't have those large eyes, what would happen when it was hunting?\"\n   - Have students point to a body part on their model and say, \"This is an adaptation because...\"\n\n**Vocabulary Chart (Posted and referenced throughout):**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive |\n| **Compound Eyes** | Huge eyes made of many tiny pieces that help the dragonfly see all around it |\n| **Predator** | An animal that hunts other animals for food |\n| **Prey** | An animal that is hunted and eaten by another animal |\n| **Habitat** | The home or place where an animal lives |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name at least 3 dragonfly adaptations\n- Students understand the relationship between body structures and survival\n- Students can use the vocabulary in context (e.g., \"The compound eyes are an adaptation that helps the dragonfly be a successful predator\")\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of dragonfly adaptations to model a food chain and explore ecosystem relationships.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large index cards or cardstock (one set per group of 3-4 students)\n- Markers\n- String or yarn\n- Scissors\n- Optional: iPad or tablet for research\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Build a Dragonfly Food Chain (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set the context:** \"Dragonflies don't live alone. They are part of something called a food chain—a path that shows how energy moves from one living thing to another. Let's build a food chain that includes our dragonfly.\"\n\n2. **Explain the concept using the photograph:**\n   - \"The dragonfly hunts insects like mosquitoes and small flies. But who hunts the dragonfly?\"\n   - Introduce: fish, herons, birds, and bats eat dragonflies\n   - At the start of every chain: plants (aquatic plants dragonfly nymphs hide in; plants that produce seeds fish eat, etc.)\n\n3. **Student task—groups of 3-4:**\n   - Each group creates a food chain showing: **Aquatic Plants → Mosquito → Dragonfly → Heron**\n   - **Materials:** \n     - Draw or write each organism on a separate card\n     - Arrange cards in order\n     - Connect with string or arrows showing energy movement\n     - Label each arrow with: \"eats\" or \"is eaten by\"\n\n4. **Share and discuss:**\n   - Each group presents their chain (1-2 minutes per group)\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if all the dragonflies disappeared? Who would be affected?\"\n\n**Part B: Habitat Connection (5 minutes)**\n\n1. Return to the photograph: \"Remember, dragonflies live near water. Why is water so important?\"\n   - Dragonflies lay eggs in water\n   - Dragonfly nymphs (babies) live in water for months or years\n   - Many of their prey (mosquitoes, small aquatic insects) are also found near water\n   - Herons and other predators come to water to hunt dragonflies\n\n2. **Conclude:** \"The dragonfly's body adaptations are amazing, but they only work if the dragonfly lives in the right habitat—near clean, healthy water.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Model creating one food chain before students begin\n- Ask: \"Where does the dragonfly fit in this chain—is it a predator or prey?\" \n- Push thinking: \"What would happen if the water got polluted?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- A visual food chain showing the dragonfly's role as both predator and prey\n- Verbal explanation of how energy moves through the food chain\n- Understanding that adaptations only help animals survive if they have the right habitat\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of dragonfly adaptations, food chains, and ecosystem relationships.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation notes:** As students work, record which students can identify adaptations and explain their purpose\n- **Partner talk exit checks:** Listen to \"turn and talk\" conversations to gauge understanding\n- **Model explanations:** Listen to student explanations of their dragonfly models and food chains\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes):**\n\nDistribute an index card to each student. Students may draw, write, or write with labeled drawings. Teachers may read questions aloud for students needing support.\n\n**Exit Ticket Prompts (Choose 1-2 based on time):**\n\n1. **Adaptation question:** \"Draw one body part of a dragonfly and explain how it helps the dragonfly survive. (Example: Large eyes help the dragonfly see insects flying.)\"\n\n2. **Food chain question:** \"You are a dragonfly. What do you eat? Who eats you? Draw or write your answer.\"\n\n3. **Habitat question:** \"Why do dragonflies need to live near water? Give at least one reason.\"\n\n4. **Prediction question:** \"A developer wants to drain a pond and build a parking lot. What would happen to the dragonflies? Explain using what you've learned.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Correctly identify at least 2 dragonfly adaptations (e.g., compound eyes, transparent wings, streamlined body)\n- ✓ Explain how at least 1 adaptation helps the dragonfly survive (hunting, moving, finding habitat)\n- ✓ Show that dragonflies are both predators (eat insects) and prey (hunted by birds, fish)\n- ✓ Recognize that dragonflies need a water habitat to survive\n- ✓ Use vocabulary correctly (adaptation, predator, prey, habitat, compound eyes)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show students can identify and explain at least one adaptation\n- Students demonstrate understanding of dragonfly's role in a food chain\n- Students recognize the connection between adaptation, habitat, and survival\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Provide a labeled diagram:** Give students a dragonfly diagram with body parts already labeled (head, thorax, abdomen, wings, legs, compound eyes) so they focus on function rather than identification\n\n2. **Sentence frames for explanations:** Provide sentence starters for verbal explanations:\n   - \"The _______ (body part) helps the dragonfly _______ (action).\"\n   - \"The dragonfly is a predator because it _______.\"\n   - \"The dragonfly's habitat is _______ because _______.\"\n\n3. **Simplified food chain:** Provide a pre-drawn food chain with 3 organisms (Plant → Mosquito → Dragonfly) and ask students to add one more predator\n\n4. **Pair with a stronger reader/writer:** During Explore and Elaborate, pair struggling learners with students who can help document observations and ideas\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research extension:** Ask students to research and present on: \"Other animals that live near water and have similar adaptations to dragonflies\" (e.g., water striders, diving beetles, herons). Have them compare adaptations\n\n2. **Complex food web:** Instead of a simple food chain, ask students to create a food web showing multiple organisms and their connections. Include: aquatic plants, mosquitoes, other aquatic insects, fish, dragonflies, birds, and decomposers\n\n3. **Habitat change scenario:** Provide a scenario: \"A drought causes the pond to dry up for two months each year. Predict how this would affect the dragonfly's life cycle and adaptations. Would it evolve differently? Why or why not?\"\n\n4. **Vocabulary extension:** Challenge students to use all five vocabulary terms (adaptation, compound eyes, predator, prey, habitat) in a short paragraph or comic strip explaining why dragonflies are successful hunters\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Dragonfly Life Cycle Poster:** Create a detailed visual showing the complete dragonfly life cycle (egg → nymph in water → metamorphosis → adult). Students research and illustrate each stage, then present to explain how the dragonfly's water habitat is critical for all stages\n\n2. **Design Your Own Predator:** \"Using what you've learned about dragonfly adaptations, design a new predatory insect that lives near water. What adaptations would it need? Why? Draw your insect and label at least 4 adaptations.\" (This deepens understanding of form-function relationships)\n\n3. **Dragonfly Habitat Walk:** If your school has access to a nearby pond, marsh, stream, or wetland, take a field walk to observe dragonflies in their natural habitat. Students sketch what they observe, record the habitat features (water depth, plants, sun exposure), and compare to their classroom learning. Upon return, discuss: \"How did seeing real dragonflies in nature change your understanding?\"\n\n4. **Food Chain Flip Book:** Students create a mini flip book (5-8 pages) showing a dragonfly food chain, where each page reveals the next organism. Include illustrations and brief descriptions of each organism's role (producer, consumer, predator, prey)\n\n5. **Compare and Contrast: Dragonfly vs. Butterfly:** Create a Venn diagram or comparison chart showing how dragonflies and butterflies are similar (both insects, have wings) and different (life cycles, habitats, hunting behaviors, adaptations). This reinforces that adaptations vary based on lifestyle and habitat\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Sourcing dragonfly images:** Use high-quality photos from iNaturalist, National Geographic, or the Smithsonian. Print color copies for better observation and engagement\n- **Real specimens:** If possible, contact a local nature center, university entomology lab, or museum to borrow preserved dragonfly specimens. Student observation of real specimens dramatically increases engagement\n- **Pacing:** This lesson works as two 45-minute sessions (Engage/Explore on Day 1; Explain/Elaborate/Evaluate on Day 2) or one intensive 90-minute block. Adjust timing based on your students' pace and needs\n- **Vocabulary reinforcement:** Use the anchor chart throughout the unit. Refer to it when discussing other predators, ecosystems, or adaptations\n- **Safety note:** If using live dragonflies (unlikely but possible), handle gently or observe from a distance. Never capture for extended periods—these insects need to hunt to survive\n- **Connection to NGSS:** This lesson directly addresses 5-LS2-1 by having students model food chains and movement of matter (energy) through an ecosystem. The dragonfly serves as a concrete example of how organisms are interconnected and depend on their habitat\n\n---\n\n**This lesson plan is ready to implement. All materials are classroom-accessible, and the progression honors the 5E model while keeping Fifth Graders engaged with a charismatic organism they can observe and understand.**",
