      "dokLevel": 1,
      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student identifies at least three body parts (e.g., front legs with claws, large eyes, head) and explains how each part works together as a system to catch and hold prey with specific details about function.",
        "meets": "Student identifies at least two body parts used for catching prey and explains how each one helps in the hunting process with accurate, grade-appropriate descriptions.",
        "approaching": "Student identifies one or two body parts but provides only partial or incomplete explanations of how they help catch prey.",
        "beginning": "Student names a body part or makes a vague attempt to explain how the mantis catches prey, but shows minimal understanding of structure and function."

      "questionText": "If a praying mantis lived on a brown tree trunk instead of green leaves, what do you think might happen to it over time, and why?",
      "bloomsLevel": "Analyze",
      "dokLevel": 2,
      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student explains that the mantis's green color would make it visible to predators and prey, predicts it could be caught more easily or struggle to hunt, and connects this to the concept of camouflage as an adaptation for survival.",
        "meets": "Student recognizes that the green color would stand out on brown bark, explains it might be easier for predators to see or harder to catch prey, and identifies camouflage as relevant to survival.",
        "approaching": "Student suggests the mantis might be seen more easily or have trouble hunting but provides incomplete reasoning about why color matching to the environment matters.",
        "beginning": "Student makes a simple observation (e.g., 'it would be different') but provides little or no explanation connecting color to predator-prey interactions."

      "questionText": "How would an insect's life be different if it lived in an environment with praying mantises compared to an environment without them?",
      "bloomsLevel": "Analyze",
      "dokLevel": 2,
      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student explains that insects would face predation pressure from mantises and describes multiple effects (e.g., need to hide, faster reproduction, different feeding behaviors, population changes) with clear cause-and-effect reasoning.",
        "meets": "Student explains that insects would need to avoid or hide from mantises and describes at least one consequence such as changed behavior or lower insect populations.",
        "approaching": "Student recognizes that mantises hunt insects and mentions one effect (danger or predation) but reasoning is incomplete or somewhat unclear.",
        "beginning": "Student states that mantises catch insects but provides minimal explanation of how this would change an insect's life."

      "questionText": "What other animals do you know that use camouflage like the praying mantis does? How are their hiding strategies similar or different?",
      "bloomsLevel": "Analyze",

      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student identifies at least two animals with camouflage and describes how each uses color or pattern to blend in, then explains specific similarities (both use color-matching) and differences (e.g., one animal stays still while another moves, different environments).",
        "meets": "Student identifies one or two animals that use camouflage and compares their strategies to the mantis by noting at least one similarity and one difference.",
        "approaching": "Student names one or two animals with camouflage but provides only superficial or incomplete comparison to the mantis's strategy.",
        "beginning": "Student names an animal or mentions camouflage but provides little to no comparison with the mantis's hiding strategy."
