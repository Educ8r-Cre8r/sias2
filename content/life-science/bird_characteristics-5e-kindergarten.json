ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by connecting students to animals they see every day.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the pigeon\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pictures of other common animals (optional: sparrow, duck, chicken, squirrel)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Show students the close-up image of the pigeon standing on the ground.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What animal is this?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this bird lives? What does it need to live there?\"\n   - \"What parts of the bird's body do you see? Can you point to them?\" (Head, beak, wings, feet, feathers, eye, body)\n   - \"Why do you think the bird has these parts? What do they help it do?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what this bird needs every day to stay healthy and alive, just like you need food, water, and a place to sleep. Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Prior knowledge activation:** Ask students, \"What do YOU need to live? What does a pet dog or cat need?\" Create a simple class list: food, water, air, shelter, sleep.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to look at this pigeon more carefully and discover what it needs to survive in the world.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate external body parts and infer their functions through observation and hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of the pigeon (one per small group or pair) or a projected image\n- Chart paper labeled \"Bird Body Parts and What They Do\"\n- Colored markers or crayons\n- Index cards with simple illustrations of bird body parts (beak, wing, foot, feather, eye)\n- Real feathers (if available) for students to touch and observe\n- Hand mirrors (optional, for students to compare their own eyes and skin to the bird's features)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Arrange students in pairs or small groups** (3-4 students per group).\n\n2. **Distribute the photograph or display it** and give each group a copy or access to view it.\n\n3. **Guided observation walk-through:**\n   - \"Look at the pigeon's head. What do you see? Can you find the beak? The eye?\"\n   - \"Now look at the body. Do you see feathers? Are they smooth or bumpy?\"\n   - \"Look at the wings. What color are they? Are they folded or spread?\"\n   - \"Look at the feet. Are they big or small? Why do you think the pigeon needs feet?\"\n\n4. **Hands-on investigation:**\n   - If you have real feathers, pass them around. Let students feel the feathers and talk about how they might help the bird.\n   - Have students use mirrors to look at their own eyes and compare them to the pigeon's eye. Discuss: \"The pigeon uses its eyes to see, just like you do!\"\n\n5. **Record observations:**\n   - On large chart paper titled \"Bird Body Parts and What They Do,\" draw two columns: one column labeled with pictures/names of body parts (head, beak, wing, foot, feather, eye), and a second column for \"What it helps the bird do.\"\n   - Ask students to call out ideas: \"What does the beak do?\" (eat, peck at seeds) \"What do wings do?\" (fly, move around) \"What do feet do?\" (stand, hold onto branches, walk)\n   - Write student responses in simple words with quick drawings.\n\n6. **Connection to the photograph:**\n   - Point back to the image: \"See how the pigeon is standing on the ground? Its feet help it balance there. See the feathers? They keep the bird warm. See the beak? It helps the bird eat seeds and food.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate observation by asking open-ended questions rather than giving answers.\n- Listen to student ideas and record them without judgment.\n- Redirect observations back to the photograph: \"Where can you see that in the picture?\"\n- Use language like \"I notice...\" and \"What do you think that part does?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will identify 3-5 external body parts of the bird.\n- Students will make simple connections between body parts and what they do (e.g., \"Wings fly,\" \"Beak eats,\" \"Feet stand\").\n- Students will verbalize observations in their own words.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts after students have explored and discovered ideas on their own.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart from Explore phase\n- Picture cards showing pigeon and other birds (sparrow, duck, chicken)\n- Simple picture chart showing \"What Animals Need to Survive\"\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:**\n   - Bring the class together and review the chart created during Explore.\n   - Ask, \"What parts of the pigeon did we find?\" Point to each body part on the photograph.\n   - Validate student observations: \"Yes! The wings help the pigeon fly and move. The beak helps it eat seeds and food.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with picture support:\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|----------|--------------------------------|\n| **Feathers** | Soft, fluffy parts that cover a bird's body and keep it warm and dry |\n| **Beak** | The hard, pointed part a bird uses to eat food |\n| **Wings** | The big parts on the sides of a bird's body that help it fly |\n| **Feet** | The parts at the bottom of a bird's legs that help it stand, walk, and hold on |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy |\n\n3. **Discuss what all animals need to survive:**\n   - Create a simple chart: \"What Do Animals Need?\"\n   - Draw or use pictures to show: **Food** (seeds, bugs), **Water** (puddles, streams), **Shelter** (bushes, trees, buildings), **Air** (to breathe)\n   - Point to the pigeon photo: \"This pigeon needs all of these things, just like you do!\"\n   - Say: \"The pigeon's body parts help it GET what it needs. Its beak helps it find food. Its eyes help it see food. Its wings help it fly to find water and shelter.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask simple questions: \"What does a bird use to eat?\" \"What helps a bird fly?\" \"What do all animals need to live?\"\n   - Have students point to body parts on the image: \"Show me the wing.\" \"Where is the beak?\"\n\n5. **Connection back to the image:**\n   - Show the photograph again: \"Now we know why this pigeon looks the way it does. All these parts help it survive!\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Feathers:** The soft, fluffy parts on a bird that keep it warm, dry, and help it fly.\n- **Beak:** The hard pointed mouth part that birds use to pick up and eat food.\n- **Wings:** Large body parts that birds flap to fly through the air.\n- **Feet:** The parts at the bottom of a bird's legs for standing, walking, and gripping.\n- **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy by getting what you need.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use vocabulary terms (feathers, beak, wings, feet) to describe the pigeon's body parts.\n- Students will explain that animals need food, water, shelter, and air to survive.\n- Students will connect the pigeon's body parts to what it needs to survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts by comparing different animals and their survival needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos of 4-5 different animals: pigeon, duck, chicken, robin, sparrow, squirrel\n- Chart paper titled \"How Are Birds Different?\"\n- Venn diagram (optional, or simple comparison chart)\n- Crayons and paper for drawing activity\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Comparative observation:**\n   - Show students pictures of different birds and animals.\n   - Ask: \"How is the duck different from the pigeon? How is a sparrow different? How is a squirrel different?\"\n   - Guide students to notice: different beak sizes/shapes, different foot sizes, different feather colors, different sizes.\n   - Record observations: \"Ducks have big flat beaks for eating water plants. Pigeons have smaller beaks for eating seeds. Some birds have big feet, some have small feet.\"\n\n2. **Discussion of adaptation:**\n   - Use simple language: \"Different animals have different body parts because they need different things to survive.\"\n   - \"A duck needs to eat water plants, so it has a wide, flat beak. A pigeon eats seeds, so it has a smaller beak.\"\n   - \"Birds live in different places, so their bodies are different!\"\n\n3. **Drawing activity:**\n   - Have students draw the pigeon or another bird and label its body parts.\n   - Ask students to draw one thing the bird needs to survive (food, water, shelter) near the bird.\n   - Students can color their drawings.\n\n4. **Real-world connection:**\n   - Ask: \"Do you see pigeons or birds near your house? What do you think they eat? Where do they sleep?\"\n   - If appropriate: \"If you want to help birds survive, what could you do?\" (Put out water, seeds, don't harm them)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate comparisons by asking open-ended questions: \"What do you notice? How are these different?\"\n- Help students make connections between body parts and survival: \"Why do you think that bird's beak looks different?\"\n- Validate all observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will identify similarities and differences between different animals.\n- Students will infer that different body parts help animals survive in different ways.\n- Students will create a visual representation (drawing) showing a bird and what it needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal body parts, their functions, and what animals need to survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (during the lesson):**\n- Listen to student responses during Engage and Explore discussions.\n- Observe student ability to identify body parts on the photograph.\n- Note whether students make connections between body parts and their functions.\n\n**Exit ticket (end of Lesson 2):**\nAsk students to respond to these prompts (verbally or with drawing):\n1. **\"Show me the beak on the pigeon. What does the pigeon use its beak for?\"**\n2. **\"What is one thing this bird needs to survive?\"**\n3. **\"Point to the wings. Why does a pigeon need wings?\"**\n\nAlternatively, use a simple picture-based exit ticket:\n- Show the pigeon photo.\n- Ask students to point to: the feathers, the beak, the feet, the wings.\n- Ask: \"What would happen if the pigeon didn't have wings?\" or \"What does the pigeon eat?\"\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Student can identify at least 2-3 external body parts of the bird (feathers, beak, wing, foot, eye).\n- Student can state what at least one body part does (e.g., \"Wings help it fly,\" \"Beak eats seeds\").\n- Student can name at least one thing the bird needs to survive (food, water, shelter, or air).\n- Student recognizes that body parts help animals meet their survival needs.\n\n**How to determine if students met learning objectives:**\n- Review exit ticket responses and drawings.\n- Students who can identify multiple body parts and explain simple functions have met the objectives.\n- Students who can list at least one survival need and connect it to a body part show understanding of K-LS1-1.\n- Use this information to plan next lessons: if most students are struggling with vocabulary, spend more time on Explain phase in the next lesson.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce the number of body parts to focus on:** Concentrate on the three most obvious: beak, wings, and feet. Use simple sentences: \"Wings help it fly. Beak helps it eat. Feet help it stand.\"\n\n2. **Provide tactile models:** Use a stuffed animal bird or hand puppet to physically demonstrate how beak opens, wings flap, and feet stand. This helps kinesthetic learners understand function.\n\n3. **Use picture matching instead of open-ended questions:** Show two pictures—one of a wing, one of feet—and ask, \"Which one helps the bird fly?\" This is easier than asking \"What do wings do?\"\n\n4. **Pair with a peer or aide:** Have a more verbal student or adult repeat information and model responses so the struggling student hears examples.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Compare multiple birds:** Ask, \"Why does a duck's beak look different from a pigeon's beak? What do you think ducks eat?\" Have students predict what different birds eat based on beak shape.\n\n2. **Research follow-up:** Give advanced students a project: \"Find pictures of two different birds. Draw them and write (or tell) one way they are the same and one way they are different.\"\n\n3. **Design a bird habitat:** Ask, \"If we wanted to help pigeons survive in our neighborhood, what would we need to put out for them? Where would they need to live?\" Have them design a simple bird feeder or shelter on paper.\n\n4. **Extend to human comparison:** Ask, \"How are your feet like a bird's feet? How are they different? Why?\" This develops higher-order thinking about adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bird watching walk:** Take students on a nature walk to observe real birds (if safe and possible). Have them point out beaks, feathers, feet, and where birds might find food, water, and shelter. Create a simple tally chart of birds seen.\n\n2. **Build a bird feeder:** Using pine cones, peanut butter, birdseed, and string, have students make a simple bird feeder to hang outside. Discuss: \"What are we giving the bird to survive? What does it need?\" Observe birds over the next week.\n\n3. **Create a classroom bird habitat diorama:** Using a shoebox, have students create a scene where a bird lives. Include: food sources (drawn or made), water, shelter (trees, bushes), and a bird figure. Students label the parts and explain: \"This bird has [body part] to help it [function] and get [survival need].\"\n\n4. **Read-aloud and discussion:** Read aloud a simple book about birds (e.g., *The Pigeon* by Mo Willems, *What Do Birds Need?* by Wikki Stubs, or similar). Pause to ask: \"What part of the bird is important here? What does the bird need?\"\n\n5. **Movement activity:** Play \"Bird Dance.\" Call out body parts (\"Flap your wings!\") and have students move like birds. Discuss afterward: \"Why do birds have wings? What else can birds do with their bodies?\"\n\n---",
