Identify external body structures of the snowy egret and explain how each structure helps the bird survive\n2. Describe how the egret uses its senses to hunt for food in its wetland habitat\n3. Compare the egret's body structures to other animals and explain why different habitats require different body features\n4. Use evidence from observations to support claims about how structure and survival are connected\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about how animals' bodies help them survive by examining the snowy egret photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the snowy egret (large, visible to all students)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or document camera large enough for all students to see clearly. Keep it covered or hidden initially.\n\n2. **Uncover the image dramatically** and allow 20-30 seconds of silent observation. Say: \"Look carefully at this bird. Don't raise your hand yet—just observe.\"\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions** to activate curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about this bird's legs? Why might they be so long and skinny?\"\n   - \"Look at the bird's bill—what does it look like to you? What do you think it's used for?\"\n   - \"This bird is standing in water. How do you think its body helps it live and hunt here?\"\n   - \"What do you think this bird eats, and how might its body help it find and catch food?\"\n\n4. **Record student observations and wonderings** on chart paper. Write exact student words, including: \"I wonder...\" and \"I think...\" responses.\n\n5. **Wonder Prompt:** \"How do you think the parts of this bird's body help it survive and find food?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's investigate how different body parts help animals survive by building our own egret!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover the relationship between body structure and function through a hands-on model-building activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Straws or thin dowels (2-3 per student pair) to represent legs\n- Pipe cleaners (1 per student pair) for the neck\n- Foam cups or small containers (1 per student pair) for the body\n- Pencil or thin stick (1 per student pair) for the bill\n- Shallow trays or bins filled with water (1 per pair)\n- Small objects to \"hunt\" (popcorn kernels, beads, or pasta shapes in the water)\n- Clipboards and observation sheets (see below)\n- Tape and scissors\n\n**Observation Sheet Template** (printed for each student):\n\n---\n**My Egret Model Investigation**\n\n**Predictions:**\n- With long legs, I think the egret can _______________\n- With a long, sharp bill, I think the egret can _______________\n\n**What I discovered:**\n- When I used long straws for legs, I could _________________\n- When I used a pencil for the bill, I could _______________\n- My model was most successful when I ___________________\n\n---\n\n**Activity Steps:**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:** \"You're going to build a model egret using craft materials. Your model needs a body, long legs, a long neck, and a bill. You'll use your model to try to catch objects in water—just like a real egret hunts for fish!\"\n\n2. **Demonstrate quickly** how to assemble a simple model (2 minutes max). Show one example assembled on the table. Don't make it perfect—let students see it's okay to be creative.\n\n3. **Students work in pairs.** Distribute materials and provide 10 minutes for assembly:\n   - Body: foam cup or container\n   - Legs: 2-3 straws or dowels taped to the bottom (must be long enough to reach water when cup is held)\n   - Neck: pipe cleaner curled and attached to the top\n   - Bill: pencil or stick taped to the end\n\n4. **Test the model** (remaining 10 minutes):\n   - Fill shallow trays with water\n   - Place small objects (beads, popcorn) in the water\n   - Tilt the cup and use the \"bill\" (pencil) to try to grab objects\n   - Students record observations on their sheet\n   - Ask: \"Could you reach the water easily? Could you grab the objects?\"\n\n5. **Student-driven discovery:** Do NOT tell them the answers. Ask probing questions:\n   - \"What happened when your legs were too short?\"\n   - \"How did the long bill help you catch things?\"\n   - \"Why do you think a real egret needs such long legs?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and observe without giving answers\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What would happen if...?\" and \"Why do you think that worked?\"\n- Record interesting student observations verbally\n- Help with tape/assembly only—don't redesign their models\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that longer legs allow the egret to reach deeper water without getting wet\n- Students realize the thin, pointed bill is effective for catching small prey\n- Students understand that body structure directly relates to how animals find and eat food\n- Students produce written observations and working models\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize learning by introducing vocabulary and connecting exploration to the real egret's adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original snowy egret photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary list\n- Picture cards of different water birds (optional, for comparison)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out** (5 minutes):\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share what they discovered with the whole class\n   - What worked? What didn't? Why?\n   - Write student observations on a \"What We Learned\" chart\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (7-8 minutes) using the photograph and student discoveries:\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. (Point to the egret's long legs and bill as examples.)\n   - **Structure:** A body part that has a specific job—like legs for walking, a bill for eating, eyes for seeing.\n   - **Function:** The job or purpose that a body part does. (Example: The function of the egret's long bill is to catch fish.)\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives, like a wetland, forest, or ocean. (The egret's habitat is shallow water.)\n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts other animals for food. (The egret is a predator that hunts fish.)\n\n3. **Make connections** (5 minutes):\n   - Point to the egret's long, thin legs in the photograph: \"Our models showed us why real egrets have these legs—they help the bird wade into deeper water without getting wet.\"\n   - Point to the bill: \"Your models showed that a sharp, pointed bill is perfect for catching slippery fish.\"\n   - Point to the eye: \"The egret's big, sharp eye helps it see fish in the water—that's its sense of sight at work.\"\n   - Show how the neck is curved and flexible: \"This long neck lets the egret reach down and strike at fish very quickly.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding** strategy:\n   - Ask: \"Turn to your partner: Why do you think an egret's body would NOT work well for a bird that lives in the desert?\" (Listen for responses about habitat and food.)\n   - Ask: \"Thumbs up if you can explain how one body part helps the egret survive. Thumbs sideways if you're not sure yet.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and define 4-5 vocabulary terms related to structure and function\n- Students can explain that the egret's external structures (legs, bill, neck, eyes) directly support its survival and hunting behavior\n- Students understand the connection between habitat (shallow water) and body structures\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to a new context and deepen knowledge about how different animals are adapted to different habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of 4-5 different water or wetland animals (heron, duck, alligator, fish, frog)\n- Comparison chart template (printed)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce comparison challenge** (2 minutes):\n   \"Now that we know how the egret's body helps it survive in shallow water, let's compare it to other animals in the same habitat. Are all wetland animals built the same way?\"\n\n2. **Show picture cards** of other wetland animals (one at a time):\n   - Great Blue Heron\n   - Mallard Duck\n   - American Alligator\n   - Dragonfly\n\n3. **Guided comparison** (10 minutes):\n   - For each animal, ask: \"What does this animal look like? What body parts do you see? How is it different from the egret? Why might it be different?\"\n   - Fill in a class comparison chart together:\n\n   | Animal | Legs | Bill/Mouth | Where It Hunts | What It Eats |\n   |--------|------|-----------|---|---|\n   | Snowy Egret | Long, thin | Long, sharp, pointed | In shallow water | Fish |\n   | Duck | Short, webbed | Flat, wide | On water surface | Plants, small bugs |\n   | Alligator | Short, strong | Large jaws | Underwater or shore | Fish, larger animals |\n\n4. **Student task** (5 minutes):\n   - Provide blank comparison chart\n   - Students choose TWO animals and complete the chart, explaining why each body structure helps that animal survive\n\n5. **Share findings:**\n   - Invite volunteers to explain their choices\n   - Ask: \"Even though these animals all live in water, why are their bodies so different?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide the discussion by asking \"Why do you think...?\" questions\n- Validate all observations before gently redirecting misconceptions\n- Encourage students to refer back to their models and what they learned\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different animals, even in the same habitat, have different structures because they hunt in different ways\n- Students explain that structure and survival are closely connected\n- Students apply the concept of adaptation to new animals\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how structures support survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Observation of model-building and testing (Do students use long legs and pointed bills?)\n- Listen to pair discussions (Do they explain function?)\n- Review observation sheets (Are explanations present?)\n- Thumbs up/sideways/down checks (Can they identify structures?)\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative)** — Provide one of these options:\n\n**Option A (Written/Drawing):**\n*\"Draw the snowy egret and label two body parts. For each part, write one sentence explaining how it helps the egret survive.\"*\n\n**Option B (Oral or Written Response):**\n*\"Pretend an egret is moving to a new habitat—a thick, muddy swamp with lots of tall plants. Would its long, thin legs still be helpful? Why or why not? Explain your thinking.\"*\n\n**Option C (Quick Check):**\nAsk these questions verbally or on a worksheet:\n1. Name one body structure of the egret and explain what it does.\n2. How does the egret's body structure help it find food?\n3. True or False: All birds in wetlands have the same body shape. Explain your answer.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student can identify at least ONE structure and describe its function\n- Student uses evidence from the lesson (model, observation, photograph)\n- Student demonstrates understanding that structure supports survival\n- Student can compare/contrast with at least one other animal (if applicable)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can name a structure and explain its purpose\n- Students use vocabulary learned (adaptation, structure, function, habitat)\n- Students connect structures to survival and hunting behavior\n- Exit tickets show understanding of the relationship between body and behavior\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards** with pictures: Create cards with just the word and a simple picture (no long definition). Use these during Explain phase and let students refer to them during Elaborate.\n\n2. **Scaffolded observation sheet:** Instead of open-ended questions, provide sentence starters:\n   - \"The egret's long legs help it _________\"\n   - \"The sharp bill is good for _________\"\n   - \"I noticed that when I made my legs longer, __________\"\n\n3. **Paired support during Explore:** Deliberately pair with a stronger peer or assign a teacher/aide to ask guiding questions rather than have them work independently. Model the \"testing\" step together first.\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Use the picture option—students just draw and label with teacher-written or provided labels to circle.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Research extension:** Provide field guides or tablets/iPads with images of other wading birds (roseate spoonbill, sandpiper, ibis). Challenge: \"How are these birds' bills different from the egret's? What different foods or hunting strategies might they use?\"\n\n2. **\"Design a bird\" challenge:** \"If an egret needed to hunt in a thick forest instead of shallow water, what would you change about its body? Sketch or build a new version and explain your changes.\"\n\n3. **Predator-prey simulation:** Have advanced students predict: \"If the egret is the predator, what challenges does its prey (fish) face? What body structures do YOU think fish have to escape predators?\" (Connects to natural selection; can be formalized in later grades.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Wetland food web investigation:** Create a food web with the egret as one animal. Students research what the egret eats, what eats the egret, and what plants are in the habitat. Draw and label connections. (Connects to ecosystems in 5th grade.)\n\n2. **Compare-a-bird field observation:** If possible, visit a local pond, wetland, or park with water. Students observe real birds with binoculars or cameras, sketch what they see, and identify body structures using field guides or a simple app like Merlin Bird ID (free).\n\n3. **\"Body Part Superpower\" poster:** Students choose one animal from the lesson (duck, alligator, egret) and create a colorful poster highlighting one \"superpower\" body part. Example: \"The Duck's Webbed Feet: Built for Speed in Water!\" Include labeled diagram, function, and why that animal is successful in its habitat. Display in classroom or hallway.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Tips\n\n- **Safety note:** Ensure water trays are shallow, supervised, and dried immediately after use.\n- **Preparation:** Pre-cut straws and pipe cleaners to save class time.\n- **Real-world connection:** If you have a local naturalist, wetland guide, or birding expert, invite them to share photos or video of egrets hunting. Students love seeing real footage!\n- **Video supplement (optional):** Brief (2-3 min) video of a real snowy egret hunting can reinforce the lesson—search \"snowy egret hunting\" on YouTube (preview first).\n- **Reusable models:** Keep student models for science fair displays or as a reference when teaching about other animals next unit.",
