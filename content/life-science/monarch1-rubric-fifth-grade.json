        "exceeds": "Student identifies multiple specific observations (bright green color, yellow spots, black line, change from caterpillar form) and explains how these features demonstrate internal transformation and preparation for becoming a butterfly.",

      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student explains how chrysalis timing connects to seasonal changes (weather, food availability, migration) and describes how completing metamorphosis at the right time helps monarchs find resources or avoid harsh conditions.",
        "meets": "Student identifies that timing of metamorphosis relates to survival and provides at least one reasonable explanation such as matching with flower blooming or favorable weather.",
        "approaching": "Student recognizes that metamorphosis timing is important for survival but gives vague or partially correct reasoning without clear environmental connections.",
        "beginning": "Student mentions timing or survival but does not make a clear connection between when metamorphosis occurs and how it helps monarchs survive."

      "dokLevel": 3,
      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student predicts population decline and explains multiple consequences: caterpillars cannot transform into adults, fewer adults to reproduce, population decreases significantly or disappears, possibly affecting other organisms that depend on monarchs.",
        "meets": "Student predicts that populations would decrease and provides logical reasoning that without chrysalises, caterpillars cannot become adult butterflies needed for reproduction.",
        "approaching": "Student predicts a negative outcome but explanation is incomplete, such as stating populations would decline without fully explaining why (reproduction/life cycle connection is unclear).",
        "beginning": "Student provides a brief answer with minimal reasoning or states only that something bad would happen without explaining the connection to the monarch life cycle."

        "exceeds": "Student identifies multiple advantages such as caterpillars and butterflies eating different foods, living in different habitats, or reducing competition, and explains how these benefits help survival and reproduction.",
        "meets": "Student identifies at least one clear advantage of complete metamorphosis (such as different life stages having different food sources or using different environments) and explains why this is beneficial.",
        "approaching": "Student mentions a possible advantage of metamorphosis but reasoning is incomplete or partially unclear, such as naming a benefit without explaining why it helps insects survive.",
