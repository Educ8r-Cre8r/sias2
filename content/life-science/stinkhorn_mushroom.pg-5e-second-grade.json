Identify the basic body parts of a mushroom (cap, stem, gills) and describe what they observe\n2. Explain that mushrooms are living organisms that are different from plants and animals\n3. Describe the habitat where mushrooms grow and what they need to survive\n4. Compare how mushrooms and plants are alike and different as living things\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the stinkhorn mushroom\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around a printed copy. Let students look quietly for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing wait time):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe the colors and shapes you notice.\"\n   - \"Is this a plant, an animal, or something else? What makes you think that?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this living thing grows? What is it sitting on?\"\n   - \"Has anyone ever seen something like this in their yard or garden? Tell us about it.\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what this strange orange and green creature is. Do you think it's alive? What would it need to stay alive?\"\n\n4. **Record 3-4 student wonderings** on chart paper with quick sketches or words. Save this for later comparison.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become mushroom detectives and discover what this mysterious living thing really is and how it lives!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real mushrooms (store-bought button or cremini mushrooms work well — avoid foraged mushrooms) OR high-quality pictures of mushrooms\n- Paper plates (one per student)\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per pair or small group)\n- Hand lenses or simple magnifiers\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Observation sheet (template provided below)\n- Damp paper towels for cleaning hands\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Get into pairs. One person is the Mushroom Observer, and one is the Recorder. You will switch jobs halfway through.\"\n\n2. \"Place your mushroom on a paper plate. Use your magnifying glass to look very carefully at every part of the mushroom.\"\n\n3. \"Observer, describe what you see. Tell your partner about the colors, textures, shapes, and any markings. Recorder, draw and label what you see on your observation sheet.\"\n\n4. \"Gently touch the mushroom (you can touch, but do not pick off pieces). Tell your partner how it feels. Is it hard or soft? Smooth or bumpy?\"\n\n5. \"Try to identify these three parts on your mushroom: the cap (top), the stem (the part holding it up), and look underneath the cap to find gills (thin lines or ridges).\"\n\n6. \"Now switch roles! Let the Recorder become the Observer and look at a different part or a different mushroom.\"\n\n**How the activity connects to the photograph:**\nStudents directly observe the same body parts visible in the stinkhorn photograph — the colorful cap, the stem structure, and unusual textures — but using accessible store-bought mushrooms.\n\n**What students should record:**\n- Labeled drawings of the mushroom parts (cap, stem, gills)\n- Written or picture descriptions: \"The mushroom is ___. It feels ___. I see ___.\"\n- A comparison: \"The mushroom is the same as/different from plants because___.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups asking open-ended questions: \"What does that part do? Why is it that shape? How is this different from the stinkhorn in our photo?\"\n- Do NOT tell students what things are called yet; let them describe in their own words\n- Encourage sensory observation without leading answers\n- Ensure all students get a chance to touch and observe\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce labeled drawings showing the three main parts (cap, stem, gills)\n- Students describe observations using sensory language (bumpy, smooth, orange, spotted)\n- Students notice that mushrooms have parts similar to plants (stem) but also unique features (gills)\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The photograph of the stinkhorn mushroom (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n- The observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Diagram showing mushroom parts (teacher-created or found online)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 pairs to hold up their observation sheets\n   - Ask: \"What was interesting about your mushroom? What parts did you find?\"\n   - Create a class list of observations on chart paper\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Write each term on chart paper with a simple picture or icon next to it\n   - Use the mushrooms from Explore or the photograph to point to real examples\n   - Say: \"Detectives, now we have special names for what you observed!\"\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Show the stinkhorn photo again\n   - \"This is a different KIND of mushroom, but it has the same body parts you found: a cap, a stem, and gills. The colors are different because different mushrooms look different, just like different dogs look different!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (interactive):**\n   - Show the photograph and ask: \"Can you point to the cap? Where is the stem? This mushroom is special because...\"\n   - Play a quick game: Hold up your observation sheet. Say a body part. Students point to that part on their drawings.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Mushroom** | A living thing that grows in damp, dark places and has a cap and stem, but is not a plant or an animal — it's its own kind of living thing called a fungus |\n| **Cap** | The umbrella-shaped part on top of the mushroom; this is where special dust called spores lives |\n| **Stem** | The part that holds up the cap, like the trunk of a tree (also called the stalk) |\n| **Gills** | Thin lines or ridges under the mushroom cap; they make and spread spores to help new mushrooms grow |\n| **Fungus** | A special kind of living thing (like a mushroom) that is not a plant and not an animal; it helps break down dead things in nature |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the vocabulary words cap, stem, and gills correctly when discussing their observations\n- Students understand that mushrooms are a special kind of living thing (fungus), different from plants and animals\n- Students can point to and name the three main parts on a diagram or photograph\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Recycled paper or paper plates\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Optional: plastic bags, paper cups, damp soil (for extended activity below)\n- Pictures of different mushrooms (teacher-collected or from educational websites)\n- Habitat pictures (forest floor, rotting log, mulch pile, cave)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Mushroom Habitat Investigation (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show pictures of different mushroom habitats:** rotting logs, dark forest floors, mulch piles, under decaying leaves\n\n2. **Ask:** \"Why do mushrooms grow in these damp, dark places? What do mushrooms need to survive?\"\n\n3. **Students complete this sentence on their paper:**\n   - \"Mushrooms need ___ and ___ to grow. They live in ___ because ___.\"\n\n4. **Create a class habitat poster:** Students draw or label a place where mushrooms would be happy to live and explain why in 2-3 sentences.\n\n5. **Compare to plants:** \"Plants need sunlight to make their own food. Mushrooms don't have green leaves, so they can't make food from sun. Instead, they break down dead plants and trees to get what they need. That's why they grow on rotting wood!\"\n\n**Option B: Fungus in the Garden Observation (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **If possible, take students outside** to look for mushrooms or fungi in a garden, near a mulch pile, or on a log\n\n2. **If outdoor observation is not possible,** show 3-4 photographs of different fungi (including the stinkhorn) and ask: \"Where do you think each one is growing? What do you see around it?\"\n\n3. **Record observations:** \"I found/saw a fungus growing in ___. It was growing on/near ___ because ___.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discovery by asking questions, not providing answers: \"What do you notice about the places where mushrooms grow? Are they wet or dry? Bright or dark?\"\n- Connect observations back to the stinkhorn habitat shown in the original photograph\n- Validate all student thinking while gently correcting misconceptions\n- Guide students to infer WHY mushrooms need damp, dark places (they break down dead material, which is found in those places)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify characteristics of fungal habitats (damp, dark, on dead material)\n- Students explain that mushrooms are different from plants because they don't need sunlight\n- Students apply their understanding to explain why the stinkhorn mushroom was found on decomposing wood in the photograph\n- Students create drawings or written descriptions showing a mushroom's habitat with 2-3 supporting details\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist during Explore phase:** Can students identify and label the three main parts (cap, stem, gills)? Do they use sensory vocabulary?\n- **Vocabulary check during Explain phase:** When you point to the photo and ask \"Where is the cap? Where are the gills?\" do students respond correctly?\n- **Question prompts during Elaborate phase:** Listen to student responses when you ask, \"Why do mushrooms grow in dark, damp places?\" Do they mention that mushrooms break down dead things or don't need sunlight?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\nProvide students with a simple assessment sheet. Read each question aloud; students may respond by drawing, circling, or dictating to an aide.\n\n**Assessment Questions:**\n\n1. **\"Show me with your finger on this picture: Where is the cap of the mushroom?\"** (Point to photograph)\n\n2. **\"Is a mushroom a plant, an animal, or something else? Circle the right answer.\"** \n   - Plant / Animal / Something Else (called a fungus)\n\n3. **\"Where do mushrooms like to grow? Why?\"** (Accept any answer mentioning: dark, damp, dead wood/leaves, wet places)\n\n4. **\"What are two ways mushrooms are different from plants?\"** (Accept: mushrooms don't have leaves, don't need sunlight, grow on dead things, etc.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n\n- ✓ **Proficient:** Student correctly identifies all three parts (cap, stem, gills); correctly identifies mushroom as \"fungus\" or \"something else\"; gives one reason why mushrooms grow in damp/dark places\n- ✓ **Developing:** Student identifies 2 of 3 parts; shows mushroom is different from plants; needs prompting for habitat reasoning\n- ✓ **Beginning:** Student identifies 1 part; shows awareness that mushrooms are different; needs significant support with habitat concepts\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents demonstrate understanding that:\n1. Mushrooms have identifiable body parts (cap, stem, gills)\n2. Mushrooms are living things that are different from plants and animals\n3. Mushrooms live in specific habitats where they can survive\n4. Mushrooms play a role in breaking down dead material in nature (introduced concept)\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide a pre-labeled diagram:** Before Explore phase, give students a simple mushroom outline with the words \"cap,\" \"stem,\" and \"gills\" already labeled. They match their observations to the labels rather than creating labels from scratch.\n\n2. **Use real, large mushrooms:** Provide store-bought mushrooms that are bigger and easier to observe (portobello or cremini) so fine details are easier to see with simple magnifiers.\n\n3. **Reduce writing demands:** Allow students to dictate observations to a partner or adult rather than writing; provide sentence starters: \"The cap is ___. The stem is ___. The gills are ___.\"\n\n4. **Simplify vocabulary:** Use simpler terms initially (top/bottom, stick, lines under the cap) before introducing formal terms (cap, stem, gills).\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Research and compare fungal diversity:** Provide 4-5 pictures of different mushrooms, molds, and fungi. Ask: \"How are these all alike? What is different? Why might different fungi look different?\" Students create a comparison chart or poster.\n\n2. **Investigate spore dispersal:** Explain that gills make spores, which spread like seeds. Show a mushroom with a spore print (place cap gill-side down on paper overnight; spores create a pattern). Ask: \"How do you think spores travel? What are they for?\" Students hypothesize and draw their thinking.\n\n3. **Explore the role of fungi in ecosystems:** Ask: \"What would happen to dead leaves and wood if there were no mushrooms?\" Students discuss and draw a food chain or web showing how mushrooms help other living things.\n\n4. **Compare life cycles:** Create a simple Venn diagram comparing how mushrooms grow vs. how plants grow. Students research or discuss: plants grow from seeds with roots/leaves; mushrooms grow from spores underground and pop up suddenly.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Mushroom Hunt Field Journal (homework or outdoor follow-up):**\n   - Send home or take students on a neighborhood \"fungus walk\" with a camera or journal\n   - Students find and photograph mushrooms, fungi, or moldy items (safely, from a distance)\n   - They draw or describe what they find and bring observations back to class\n   - Create a class \"Fungi Around Our Town\" poster combining student findings\n\n2. **Grow Your Own Mushroom Kit (2-3 week follow-up):**\n   - Use an inexpensive mushroom-growing kit (oyster mushrooms are reliable and fast-growing)\n   - Students plant and observe daily, sketching growth stages\n   - Observe the life cycle: mycelium (white threads underground) → pins (baby mushrooms) → mature caps and gills\n   - Harvest and discuss how this connects to the Elaborate phase learning about habitats (what did the mushroom need to grow?)\n\n3. **Fungi in Daily Life Discovery:**\n   - Explore safe examples of fungi in food: bread (yeast), cheese (mold gives flavor), yogurt (cultures)\n   - Discuss: \"Fungi help us in cooking and food! They're not all bad — some help us!\"\n   - Students create a poster or presentation: \"Good Fungi Around Us\"\n   - (Note: Keep food safety standards strict; observe, don't taste)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Use only store-bought or verified edible mushrooms. Never use foraged mushrooms due to toxicity risks. Wash hands after activity.\n- **Photography alternative:** If live mushrooms are unavailable, use high-quality close-up photographs throughout the lesson for all phases.\n- **Connection to prior knowledge:** Second graders often know about plants and animals. This lesson introduces a \"third kingdom\" of living things, expanding their understanding of biodiversity.\n- **Pacing:** This can be split across two days (Day 1: Engage/Explore; Day 2: Explain/Elaborate/Evaluate) or condensed into one 90-minute block.\n- **Real-world context:** If a student has seen a fairy ring, toadstool, or mushroom in their yard, celebrate that connection and ask them to share during Engage phase.",
