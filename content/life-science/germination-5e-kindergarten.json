Growing Plants from the Start**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Five 20-30 minute sessions over 2-3 weeks (initial planting + weekly observations)\n- **NGSS Standards:** K-LS1-1 (Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals need to survive)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Observe and describe what they see as a seed begins to grow.\n- Identify what a seed needs to sprout and grow (water, warmth, and soil).\n- Use words like \"sprout,\" \"stem,\" and \"leaves\" to talk about a growing seed.\n- Predict and describe patterns of how seeds change over time.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about seeds and growth using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on a screen or printed large (8.5\" x 11\" minimum)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen where all students can see clearly. Allow 30-45 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask specific discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe it to a friend?\"\n   - \"What do you think is happening here? Is the seed sleeping or waking up?\"\n   - \"What do you see growing from the green stem? What might it need to keep growing?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a seed? What do seeds feel like or look like?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge** by asking: \"Who has planted a seed before or seen a plant grow? What did you do to help it grow?\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper. Write down their ideas about what seeds need and what they think will happen next. Use drawings and simple words.\n\n5. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"In the next few weeks, we're going to plant seeds like the ones in this picture. Let's predict: What do you think will happen to our seeds?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to plant our own seeds and watch them grow, just like the seed in this picture. Let's become seed scientists!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what seeds need to grow by planting seeds and beginning observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small paper cups or biodegradable seed pots (one per child)\n- Potting soil (enough to fill cups halfway)\n- Fast-germinating seeds (lima beans, sunflower seeds, or bean seeds work well for kindergarteners)\n- Water in spray bottles or small watering cans\n- Labels and crayons or markers for naming pots\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Tray or shallow pan to contain soil\n- Optional: magnifying glasses\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Take a cup and fill it about halfway with soil. Pat it down gently with your fingers—not too hard!\"\n\n2. \"Choose a seed and feel it. How does it feel? Is it smooth or bumpy? Hard or soft? Draw what you see on your label.\"\n\n3. \"Make a small hole in the soil with your finger, about as deep as your thumb.\"\n\n4. \"Place your seed in the hole and gently cover it with soil.\"\n\n5. \"Use the spray bottle to give your seed a drink of water. Make the soil moist, but not muddy.\"\n\n6. \"Write your name on the label and stick it in your pot so we remember whose seed it is.\"\n\n7. \"Place your pot in the sunny spot we set up together.\"\n\n**Connection to photograph:** \"Your seed is like the one in the picture. Right now it's sleeping under the soil. Soon it will need water and warmth to wake up and start growing a stem and leaves, just like in our photo.\"\n\n**What students should record or document:**\n- Drawing of what the seed looks like before planting\n- Labeled pot with their name\n- Daily or weekly observation drawings in a simple journal (stick figures of the plant growth stages)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What does your seed feel like? What do you think it needs? Where should we put it so it gets warm?\"\n- Model the planting process first if students need support.\n- Help students make careful observations without directing them to the \"right\" answer.\n- Ensure all seeds are watered appropriately.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each student has planted a seed and watered it.\n- Students have made initial observations about what seeds look and feel like.\n- Students have drawn or described what they predict will happen.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain patterns of plant growth after exploration begins.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Photograph from Engage phase\n- Photos or illustrations of seed germination stages (root emerging, stem pushing up, leaves unfurling)\n- Optional: real seeds cut in half (if available) to show inside structure\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather students in a circle. Ask:\n   - \"What did you notice about your seed today? What does it look like now?\"\n   - \"What did you do to help your seed? Why did you give it water?\"\n   - \"Where did we put our seeds? Why did we choose that spot?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** using the photograph and real examples:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Seed:** A tiny package that contains a baby plant inside, along with food to help it start growing.\n   - **Sprout:** When a seed begins to grow and push out of the soil; the first part we see is usually a root or stem.\n   - **Stem:** The green part of the plant that grows up and holds the leaves.\n   - **Leaves:** The green parts that grow from the stem; they help the plant make food using sunlight.\n   - **Roots:** The parts that grow down into the soil; they drink water and hold the plant in place.\n\n3. **Connect back to photograph:** \n   - \"Look at this picture again. We can see the green stem and the beginning of leaves. The roots are underground where we can't see them. The seed is waking up!\"\n   - Point to each part of the photographed plant and name it.\n\n4. **Describe the pattern of growth:**\n   - \"All seeds follow a pattern. First, roots grow down into the soil. Then, a stem pushes up through the soil. Finally, leaves unfold from the stem. This always happens in the same order.\"\n   - Show simple illustrated stages if available.\n\n5. **Explain what seeds need (patterns for survival):**\n   - \"Seeds need three things to sprout and grow: water, warmth, and soil. Water helps the seed swell and wake up. Warmth (from sunlight) helps the seed grow. Soil gives the seed nutrients it needs.\"\n   - Hold up a cup of moist soil. \"This is what our seeds need!\"\n\n6. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your fingers: point down for roots, point up for stems, and wiggle your fingers for leaves.\"\n   - \"What happens first when a seed wakes up—does the stem grow first, or the roots?\"\n   - \"Name one thing seeds need to grow.\"\n\n**Vocabulary List:**\n- **Seed:** A tiny package with a baby plant inside.\n- **Sprout:** When a seed starts to grow and comes out of the soil.\n- **Stem:** The green part that grows up from the soil and holds the leaves.\n- **Leaves:** The green parts that grow from the stem and catch sunlight.\n- **Roots:** The parts that grow down into the soil to drink water.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name parts of a plant (roots, stem, leaves).\n- Students understand that seeds follow a pattern: roots first, then stem, then leaves.\n- Students can name at least two things seeds need to grow (water and warmth/sun).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by observing their growing seeds over time and predicting growth patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student seed pots from Explore phase\n- Simple observation journals (can be 5-6 sheets of paper stapled together, or a notebook)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Rulers (optional, for measuring)\n- Water bottles for continued watering\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Establish an observation routine:** Decide on a schedule (every day for a week, then every few days for 2 weeks). Each day/session:\n   - Students gather their pots and examine them carefully.\n   - They draw what they see in their journal.\n   - They water their seeds if the soil is dry.\n   - They answer one simple question: \"What is different from yesterday?\" or \"What grew?\"\n\n2. **Create a classroom growth chart:** On chart paper, draw simple pictures showing the stages you're observing across the class:\n   - Stage 1: Just soil (sleeping seed)\n   - Stage 2: First sprout/root emerging\n   - Stage 3: Stem pushing above soil\n   - Stage 4: First leaves unfurling\n   - Stage 5: Taller plant with more leaves\n   - Students place a sticker or mark next to their plant's stage each day.\n\n3. **Make predictions:** After 3-4 days of observation, ask:\n   - \"What do you think your plant will look like in a week?\"\n   - \"What do you think it will need to keep growing tall?\"\n   - \"Can your plant grow forever, or will it stop?\"\n\n4. **Practice describing growth patterns:**\n   - \"Who can tell me a pattern you see? Is your plant growing every day? Getting taller? Getting more leaves?\"\n\n5. **Compare observations:** \n   - \"Whose plant is tallest? Whose has the most leaves? Why might some plants be different sizes?\" (Discuss: different watering amounts, different amounts of sunlight, seeds growing at different speeds—that's okay!)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Model observation skills: \"I notice this plant has a strong green stem. Let me measure it. It's about 2 inches tall.\"\n- Ask questions that encourage detailed observation: \"Tell me about the color of the leaves. Are they all the same size?\"\n- Gently guide students who forget to water: \"Your soil feels dry. What do you think your plant needs?\"\n- Celebrate growth: \"Look how much your plant grew since yesterday!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a journal showing the growth of their plant over time.\n- Students can describe changes using words like \"taller,\" \"more leaves,\" \"greener.\"\n- Students recognize and describe the pattern of growth (roots → stem → leaves).\n- Students understand that continued water and sunlight help plants grow.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what plants need to survive and growth patterns.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Do they handle seeds carefully? Do they water appropriately?\n- Listen to student descriptions during Explain phase: Can they name plant parts? Do they explain why seeds need water?\n- Review observation journals: Are drawings showing actual growth? Are students noticing changes?\n- Ask questioning prompts: Observe student responses to \"What does your plant need?\" and \"What changed?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (choose one or combine):**\n\n**Option 1 – Draw and Label:**\n- Provide a simple drawing of a growing seed/plant with blank labels.\n- Students label: seed, roots, stem, leaves.\n- Ask: \"What does this plant need to keep growing?\" Students draw water drops, sun, or soil.\n\n**Option 2 – Observation & Explanation:**\n- Ask individual students to show their plant and explain:\n  - \"Show me the stem of your plant. What does it do?\"\n  - \"Where are the roots? Why does the plant need them?\"\n  - \"What did you do to help your plant grow?\"\n\n**Option 3 – Fill-in-the-Blank Interview:**\n- Ask each student to complete these sentences (you write or record):\n  - \"My seed needed _______ to grow.\"\n  - \"First the _______ grew down into the soil. Then the _______ grew up.\"\n  - \"I know my plant is alive because _______.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Emerging:** Student can identify that seeds grow and name one thing seeds need (water or sunlight).\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student can name plant parts (stem, leaves) and explain that seeds need water and warmth to grow.\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student can describe a growth pattern (roots → stem → leaves), explain what seeds need to survive (water, warmth, soil), and use observations to support their ideas.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most kindergarteners will demonstrate understanding through drawings, pointing, and simple explanations.\n- Students should be able to identify at least 2-3 plant parts and name at least one thing plants need.\n- Students should show through their observation journals that they noticed growth over time.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use consistent, repetitive language. Stick to \"seed,\" \"stem,\" \"leaves,\" \"water,\" \"sun.\" Point to each part each time you name it.\n\n2. **Peer observation partners:** Pair students with a buddy who can describe observations together. One student draws while the other talks about what they see.\n\n3. **Hands-on model:** Keep a large seed and bulb available to manipulate. Let students touch and explore plant parts (celery, plant cuttings, or other classroom plants) so they understand structure concretely.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Measurement and data tracking:** Provide rulers or yarn to measure plant height each day. Create a simple bar graph showing growth over time. Ask: \"How much did your plant grow in one week?\"\n\n2. **Comparative investigation:** Give advanced students two seeds with different conditions (one in sun, one in shade; one watered daily, one watered less). Ask them to predict and observe which grows better and why.\n\n3. **Research and communication:** Have students create a poster or book page explaining \"What Plants Need to Grow\" using words and pictures. Encourage them to teach a younger class or family member.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Plant a classroom garden:** If you have outdoor space, plant seeds as a class in spring/summer. Observe plants over many weeks, harvest, and discuss how plants change with seasons.\n\n2. **Seed exploration station:** Create a discovery table with various seeds (bean seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, rice, corn). Let students sort by size, color, and texture. Use magnifying glasses to observe details. Discuss: \"Which seeds do you think will grow into tall plants?\"\n\n3. **Read-aloud follow-up:** Share plant-themed picture books such as *The Seed* by Joey Comeau or *From Seed to Plant* by Gail Gibbons. Discuss how the stories match what students observed in their own seeds.\n\n4. **Family activity:** Send home a packet with a bean seed and instructions for families to plant and observe at home. Ask families to send back a drawing or photo showing their plant's growth. Create a class display of home observations.\n\n5. **Sensory writing:** Have students practice descriptive language by completing: \"My seed feels _____. My plant smells _____. My plant looks _____.\" Create a class book of sensory observations.\n\n---\n\n**Ready to grow!** This lesson builds kindergarten-level observation and inquiry skills while establishing foundational understanding of plant life cycles and survival needs—core to K-LS1-1.",
