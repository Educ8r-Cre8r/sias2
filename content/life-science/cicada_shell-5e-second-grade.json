  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Cicada Shell Discovery\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Life Cycles:** Cicadas go through different stages of life, including a stage where they shed their outer skin (exoskeleton) as they grow, leaving behind an empty shell.\n- **Animal Adaptations and Structures:** The hard outer shell protects the cicada's body and helps it survive. When cicadas grow too big for their shell, they must shed it to continue growing.\n- **Diversity of Life in Habitats:** Cicadas are one of many animals that live in wooded or natural areas where trees are found, showing that different animals have different homes.\n- **Observation and Evidence:** By examining a cicada shell, students can observe details about animal body structures and gather evidence about how animals change as they grow.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Cicadas Grow and Change: Discovering Life Cycles in Our Own Backyards**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** 2nd Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 40-minute sessions (or three 30-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-LS4-1: Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n  - (Secondary connection: Understanding animal structures and habitats as foundation for life cycles)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- **Observe and describe** the physical features of a cicada shell using their senses and simple tools.\n- **Explain why** cicadas shed their shells and what this tells us about how animals grow and change.\n- **Compare** cicada habitats to other habitats they know and identify why cicadas live in wooded areas with trees.\n- **Use evidence** from the cicada shell to construct an explanation about animal life cycles and adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal growth and change using the cicada shell photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the cicada shell on bark/lichen (photograph provided)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Real cicada shells if available for safe classroom handling\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image on the board. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking, just observing.\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe it to a neighbor.\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen anything like this before? Where?\"\n   - \"What do you think this brown thing is? Is it alive right now?\"\n   - \"Why do you think something would leave behind an empty shell on a tree?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \n   - \"I'm wondering... what animal could fit inside that shell, and where did it go?\" \n   - Have students turn and talk to a partner: \"If you were growing and your clothes got too small, what would you do?\"\n\n4. **Record Predictions:** Create a class \"I Wonder\" chart on chart paper. Write down 3-4 student predictions or questions about the shell. Examples: \"Is it a bug?\" \"Did it die?\" \"Did something eat it?\" \"Did the bug grow bigger?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be scientists and investigate what this shell really is. We'll look for clues to figure out what animal left it behind and why.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the cicada shell through close observation, collecting evidence about its structure and what it tells us about the animal that made it.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Per small group (2-3 students):**\n  - 1 real cicada shell (or high-quality photographs printed at 8.5\" x 11\" if shells unavailable)\n  - 1 hand lens or magnifying glass\n  - 1 observation sheet (see template below)\n  - Colored pencils or crayons\n  - Optional: soft paintbrush for gentle examination\n\n- **Classroom:**\n  - Bark or branch sample (optional, to show natural habitat)\n  - Ruler (for measuring shell size)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Look Carefully:** Using your hand lens, examine the shell from all sides. Look at:\n   - The shape (Is it smooth or bumpy? Does it look like a body?)\n   - The color (What colors do you see?)\n   - The texture (Is it hard or soft? Rough or smooth?)\n   - Any openings or cracks (Where might the animal have exited?)\n\n2. **Sketch and Label:** On your observation sheet, draw the shell as carefully as you can. Label what you notice:\n   - The hard outside\n   - Any legs you can see\n   - The opening where the animal came out\n   - Anything else that looks interesting\n\n3. **Measure and Compare:** Use a ruler to measure the length of the shell. Compare it to your finger or thumb. Is it bigger or smaller? Record the size.\n\n4. **Ask Questions:** As you observe, write down 2 things you're wondering about. Examples: \"Why is it see-through in some spots?\" or \"What happened to the legs?\"\n\n5. **Habitat Clues:** Look at where the shell is in the photograph (on bark with lichen). Talk with your group: \"Why might an animal make a shell here? What does the animal need from this place?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking open-ended questions without revealing answers:\n  - \"What do you notice about the texture? Why might that be?\"\n  - \"Where does it look like the animal came out? How do you know?\"\n  - \"Do you think this shell is still being used? Why or why not?\"\n- Encourage students to use descriptive language: hard, papery, delicate, bumpy, etc.\n- Help students handle shells gently; allow time for sensory exploration.\n- Document observations with photos or notes for later discussion.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create detailed sketches with labels\n- Students record 2-4 observations about the shell's physical features\n- Students identify the \"exit hole\" or crack where the animal emerged\n- Students make connections between shell placement and habitat\n- Students ask genuine questions that show curiosity about the animal's life cycle\n\n**Observation Sheet Template:**\n\n---\n\n**(SIMPLE OBSERVATION SHEET for 2nd Grade)**\n\n**Name:** ________________     **Date:** ________________\n\n**My Cicada Shell Investigation**\n\n1. **What does the shell look like?** (Draw and label)\n   - [Space for sketch]\n   - Colors I see: _________________________________\n   - Textures I feel: _________________________________\n\n2. **How big is it?** (Measure with ruler)\n   - My shell is about _____ inches long.\n   - It's _____ than my thumb.  ☐ bigger  ☐ smaller  ☐ same size\n\n3. **Where did the animal go?** (Look for the opening)\n   - I see a crack or opening here: (circle on drawing)\n   - I think the animal came out because: _________________________________\n\n4. **Two things I'm wondering:**\n   - I wonder... _________________________________\n   - I wonder... _________________________________\n\n---\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts about animal life cycles and habitats after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Projected cicada shell photograph\n- Optional: Simple life cycle diagram (visual aid)\n- \"Vocabulary Word Cards\" (printed or written on board)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share one observation from their investigation.\n   - Display student sketches on a board or table for all to see.\n   - Ask the class: \"What do all the sketches have in common?\" (hard shell, cracks, no animal inside)\n\n2. **Introduce the Animal: The Cicada (3 minutes)**\n   - \"The shell you observed belonged to a **cicada** (say: suh-KAH-duh). It's an insect that lives in trees.\"\n   - Show the photograph again: \"This cicada was living on tree bark with lichen, just like in the picture. Can anyone point to where the lichen is?\"\n\n3. **Teach Key Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions (5 minutes):**\n\n   Present each term with a concrete example or action:\n\n   - **Exoskeleton (EX-oh-SKEL-uh-tun):** A hard shell on the outside of an animal's body that holds its shape and protects it, like a suit of armor. *Action: \"Tap your arm—your skin is soft. But a cicada's outside is hard like this shell.\"*\n\n   - **Shed/Molting (SHED or MOHL-ting):** When an animal outgrows its exoskeleton and splits out of it to grow a new, bigger one underneath. *Action: \"Imagine your jacket got too tight. You'd take it off, right? Cicadas do the same thing, but with their shell!\"*\n\n   - **Life Cycle:** All the stages an animal goes through from birth to growing up to making babies. Cicadas have a life cycle with different stages.\n\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives that has everything it needs—like food, water, and shelter. Cicadas live in trees.\n\n4. **Connect to the Investigation (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"The shell you studied is called a **cicada nymph shell**. Before it shed, a young cicada lived inside.\"\n   - \"When the cicada got too big, its hard shell didn't stretch. So it split open—see that crack?—and the cicada climbed out. A new, soft shell grew underneath and hardened.\"\n   - \"This is called **molting**. Cicadas do this many times as they grow up!\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Who can show me with your hands what happens when a cicada molts?\" (Students mime splitting/emerging)\n   - \"Why does a cicada need to shed its shell?\" (Because it grows bigger and the old shell doesn't fit anymore.)\n   - \"Where do cicadas live?\" (In trees, on bark, in wooded habitats.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Cicada** | A medium-sized insect with wings that lives in trees and makes loud buzzing sounds. |\n| **Exoskeleton** | A hard shell on the outside of an animal's body that protects it and gives it shape. |\n| **Shed/Molting** | When an animal outgrows its shell or skin and splits out of it to grow a new, bigger one. |\n| **Life Cycle** | All the different stages an animal goes through from when it's born until it grows up and has babies. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives that has everything it needs to survive, like food, water, shelter, and the right weather. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain why a cicada sheds its shell (it grows too big).\n- Students understand that molting is a natural part of an animal's life cycle.\n- Students recognize that cicadas live in tree habitats.\n- Students use the new vocabulary in sentences during discussion.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of animal growth and habitats by researching cicada diversity and comparing different animal homes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pictures or illustrations of cicadas in different habitats (print from reliable sources or use provided images)\n- \"Animal Homes\" chart (template below)\n- Index cards or sticky notes\n- Optional: Short video clip (2-3 min) showing cicada emergence (search: \"cicada molting\" on YouTube)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Cicada Diversity & Habitats (All Students)**\n\n1. **Compare Cicada Habitats:**\n   - Show 2-3 images of cicadas in different settings: on oak bark, pine trees, in gardens, etc.\n   - Ask: \"What's the same about all these habitats? What's different?\"\n   - Chart student observations on a large \"Cicada Homes\" chart:\n     - What they all need: **Trees, bark, warm weather, soil**\n     - Differences: **Different types of trees, different regions**\n\n2. **Diversity of Life in Different Habitats:**\n   - Explain: \"Cicadas live in many different habitats, but they all have trees. Other animals live in different habitats—like spiders in gardens, ants in the ground, and birds in nests.\"\n   - Create a class chart:\n     | Habitat | Animals | Why They Live There |\n     |---------|---------|-------------------|\n     | Trees | Cicada, bird, squirrel | Food, shelter, protection |\n     | Underground | Ant, earthworm, mole | Safe, cool, food |\n     | Grass | Cricket, grasshopper | Shelter, plants to eat |\n\n3. **Personal Connection:**\n   - Ask: \"Do you have a favorite outdoor place? What animals might live there? Why?\"\n   - Have students draw or write about an animal in a habitat they know.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify key features of cicada habitats (trees, bark, warmth).\n- Students compare cicada habitats to other animal habitats.\n- Students understand that different animals need different things from their homes.\n- Students recognize diversity among animal homes.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of cicada life cycles, exoskeletons, and animal habitats.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Did students handle the shell carefully and record detailed observations?\n- **Vocabulary Check during Explain:** Can students use \"shed,\" \"molt,\" and \"exoskeleton\" correctly in conversation?\n- **Think-Pair-Share Questions:**\n  - \"Turn to a neighbor: Why did the cicada leave this shell behind?\"\n  - \"What does a cicada need in its habitat to survive?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes at end of Lesson 2):**\n\n**Choose one format based on class level:**\n\n**Option 1: Drawing + Sentence (Lower support)**\n- \"Draw a cicada coming out of its shell.\"\n- \"Write or tell: Why does a cicada shed its shell?\" \n  - *(Expected: \"It grows too big.\" \"It's too small now.\" \"It needs a bigger shell.\")*\n\n**Option 2: Three-Question Exit Ticket (Standard)**\n\n*Directions: Answer in words or pictures.*\n\n1. **What is the hard shell that the cicada left behind called?**\n   - ☐ Exoskeleton    ☐ Skin    ☐ Cocoon\n\n2. **Why did the cicada leave its shell?** (Circle one or more)\n   - It grew too big.    /    It was done using it.    /    The shell broke.\n\n3. **Where do cicadas live? Name one thing their habitat has.**\n   - _________________________________\n\n**Option 3: Observation & Explanation (Higher challenge)**\n\n*Cicada Shell Detective*\n\n1. Look at your sketch from the investigation. Point to where you think the cicada came out of the shell.\n\n2. **Explain:** Why do you think the shell opened there? What does this tell you about how the cicada molted?\n\n3. **Compare:** How is a cicada shell like a jacket that gets too small? How is it different?\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Student accurately identifies the shell as an exoskeleton or outer covering.\n\n✓ Student explains that the cicada shed the shell because it outgrew it or because it's part of molting/growing.\n\n✓ Student identifies at least one feature of a cicada habitat (trees, bark, warm weather, soil).\n\n✓ Student uses evidence from the shell (cracks, hard texture, empty interior) to support their explanation.\n\n✓ Student demonstrates curiosity and asks follow-up questions about cicada life cycles.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify why cicadas shed their shells.\n- 75% of students can name a habitat feature cicadas need.\n- Students recognize molting as a normal part of animal growth.\n- Student questions and explanations show developing understanding of life cycles.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:**\n   - Provide a sheet with images already labeled (exoskeleton, opening, legs).\n   - Students point to or color the parts instead of drawing from scratch.\n   - Use single-word or simple-phrase labels only.\n\n2. **Pre-Teach Vocabulary:**\n   - Before Explain phase, introduce the five vocabulary words with visual supports (pictures or real examples).\n   - Use word cards with pictures. Say each word 3-4 times in context.\n   - Example: Hold the shell and say, \"This is the exoskeleton. It's hard. It protects the cicada.\"\n\n3. **Guided Questions During Explore:**\n   - Provide sentence starters: \"The shell feels ___.\" \"I think the cicada came out here because ___.\"\n   - Sit with small group and ask: \"What color is this part?\" \"Is this bumpy or smooth?\"\n   - Validate all observations: \"Yes, you're noticing details like a scientist!\"\n\n4. **Partner the Shell Study:**\n   - Pair a struggling student with a stronger student. The stronger student can demonstrate careful observation while the other participates.\n   - Assign one student to draw while the other describes what they see.\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Research on Cicada Life Cycles:**\n   - Provide a fact sheet or simple article about cicada life cycles: underground stage → emergence → molting → adulthood.\n   - Task: \"Create a labeled diagram showing all the stages of a cicada's life. How long does each stage take?\" \n   - Connect to the shell: \"Which stage did this shell belong to?\"\n\n2. **Comparison Investigation:**\n   - Provide images of other animal exoskeletons (insect shells, crab shells, snake skin shed).\n   - Ask: \"How are these shells the same? How are they different? Why do you think animals shed?\"\n   - Challenge: \"Which animals shed? Which don't? Why?\"\n\n3. **Habitat Design Challenge:**\n   - Provide a shoebox and natural materials (bark, leaves, soil, twigs).\n   - Task: \"Design a habitat where a cicada could live. Include everything a cicada needs. Explain your choices.\"\n   - Extension: \"Could your habitat work for a cricket or grasshopper? Why or why not?\"\n\n4. **Writing Extension:**\n   - \"Write a day-in-the-life story from a cicada's perspective. Start from inside the shell and describe molting and finding food in the tree habitat.\"\n   - Or create a comic strip showing the molting process.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cicada Sound Investigation (Science Practice & Real-World Connection)**\n   - **What:** Cicadas are famous for their loud buzzing sound. Play a 30-second audio clip of cicada sounds.\n   - **Activity:** Students investigate: \"Where does the sound come from? How does a cicada make noise without a voice?\"\n   - **Materials:** Audio clip, pictures of cicada anatomy showing sound-making organs (tymbals).\n   - **Connection:** Bridges to sound and vibration (1-PS4-1 from earlier grades) and animal adaptations.\n\n2. **Molting Through the Seasons (Life Cycle Extension)**\n   - **What:** Create a classroom timeline showing cicada life stages throughout the year.\n   - **Activity:** Students research or are given information about when cicadas molt in your region. Create a monthly calendar showing:\n     - Spring: Nymphs underground begin to emerge\n     - Early summer: Molting begins\n     - Mid-summer: Most adults visible and \"singing\"\n     - Fall: Cicadas decline\n   - **Product:** Illustrated timeline or poster for classroom display.\n\n3. **Backyard Habitat Hunt (Field Observation & Habitat Comparison)**\n   - **What:** Take students outside to search for animal evidence (shells, exoskeletons, webs, nests, burrows, shed skin).\n   - **Activity:** If cicada shells are available locally and it's the right season, search for them on tree bark. If not, search for other evidence of animals in the habitat.\n   - **Recording:** Create a \"What Lives Here?\" chart documenting different animals found and the habitats where they were discovered.\n   - **Connection:** Directly applies 2-LS4-1 (observing animals in different habitats) in an authentic outdoor setting.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Closure & Reflection\n\n**End of Lesson 1 or 2 (3-5 minutes):**\n\nGather students and revisit the \"I Wonder\" chart from the Engage phase.\n\n- \"Look at the questions you asked at the beginning. Can we answer any of them now?\"\n- \"What surprised you most about the cicada shell?\"\n- \"What would you still like to know about cicadas?\"\n- Document new questions for future exploration.\n\n**Optional Reflection Prompt (for 2nd graders ready for self-assessment):**\n- \"Show me with your thumb: Did this lesson help you understand how animals grow? 👍 Thumbs up means 'yes!' Sideways means 'kind of,' and down means 'not yet.'\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Implementation Tips\n\n- **Sourcing Cicada Shells:** If live cicada shells aren't available, high-quality printed images or online resources work well. Real shells are preferable for sensory engagement.\n- **Timing Flexibility:** This lesson can span 2-3 sessions depending on depth of exploration and class pace. The EXPLORE phase can be extended if students show high engagement.\n- **Safety Considerations:** Shells are fragile; remind students to observe gently. No eating or putting near mouths.\n- **Seasonal Timing:** Cicada emergence is regional and seasonal (typically summer in temperate zones). Adjust lesson timing accordingly, or use preserved shells/photographs if timing doesn't align.\n- **Home Connection:** Encourage families to search for cicada shells outdoors and bring photos or shells to class. Create a class collection.\n- **Assessment Note:** At 2nd grade, oral explanations and drawings are as valuable as written responses. Accept all forms of communication.",
