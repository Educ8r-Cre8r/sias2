ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by having students examine the photograph and wonder about seasonal tree changes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed copy of the photograph (11×14\" or projector display)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Sticky notes (1 per student)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without commentary. Show the image on a projector or as a large printed poster where all students can see clearly.\n\n2. **Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds.** Say: \"Look very carefully at this picture. What do you see? Don't talk yet—just watch and think.\"\n\n3. **Facilitate discussion with these specific First Grade-level questions:**\n   - \"What colors do you see on the trees? Are all the trees the same color?\"\n   - \"Why do you think some trees are orange, yellow, and red while others are still green?\"\n   - \"Do the trees look the same as they do right now outside our classroom? What's different?\"\n   - \"What do you think happens to all those colorful leaves? Where do they go?\"\n\n4. **Activate prior knowledge:** Ask: \"Has anyone noticed leaves changing color or falling down where you live? Tell me what you've seen.\"\n\n5. **Create a class \"Wonder Wall.\"** Write student predictions and questions on chart paper. Examples might be: \"Why do leaves turn red?\" \"Do leaves come back?\" \"Why do trees get naked?\" Validate all responses.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become leaf detectives and discover why trees put on this amazing fall fashion show and then say goodbye to their leaves!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate leaf changes through direct observation and hands-on exploration with real leaves and tree-inspired materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real autumn leaves (collect 1-2 days before: at least 3 per student—variety of colors: red, yellow, orange, brown, and green if available)\n- Chart paper with columns labeled: \"Color,\" \"Texture,\" \"Size,\" \"What I Notice\"\n- Crayons and colored pencils (match to actual leaf colors)\n- Hand lenses (optional but helpful)\n- Tracing paper (optional, for leaf rubbings)\n- Pencils and clipboards\n- Small paper bags for collecting fallen leaves\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Direct Leaf Observation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute real autumn leaves** to each student (3-4 leaves of different colors and stages).\n\n2. **Give exploration directions:**\n   - \"Pick up one leaf. Look at its color. What color is it?\"\n   - \"Feel the leaf. Is it stiff or soft? Bendy or snappy?\"\n   - \"Look very close. Do you see lines or veins in the leaf? What do they look like?\"\n   - \"Smell the leaf. Does it have a smell?\"\n   - \"Is this leaf still attached to a tree, or did it fall down?\"\n\n3. **Record observations on shared chart:** As students explore, invite volunteers to call out colors and textures they observe. Write these on the chart paper column titled \"What I Notice.\"\n\n4. **Introduce the concept informally:** \"These colorful leaves were on a tree a long time ago, like in the picture. But now they've changed color and fallen down. When leaves fall off, they don't hurt the tree. The tree is getting ready for winter, like when you wear a coat in the cold.\"\n\n**Part B: Leaf Sorting and Matching (8 minutes)**\n\n5. **Sort leaves by color.** Have students organize their leaves into groups: \"Put all the red ones together, all the yellow ones together...\" Ask: \"Which color has the most leaves? Which has the least?\"\n\n6. **Draw or trace a favorite leaf** on paper and color it to match the real leaf.\n\n7. **Teacher circulates** asking: \"Why do you think this leaf is this color?\" Accept all responses; gently guide toward ideas like \"It's getting ready for winter\" or \"The tree is changing.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe and document leaf colors, textures, and features\n- Students will begin to notice that leaves go through changes (color and condition)\n- Students will handle real evidence, building curiosity about the \"why\" behind the changes\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce scientific vocabulary and connect exploration findings to the concept that tree changes are a survival adaptation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple drawings\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Picture book (recommended): *Fall Leaves* by Loretta Holland or *Leaf Man* by Lois Ehlert (short, 5-7 minute read)\n- Sentence strips with key ideas\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover about the leaves? What did they feel like? Look like?\"\n   - Invite 4-5 students to share one observation\n   - Affirm all observations and build on them: \"Yes! The leaves turned colors. That's a clue that something is happening to the tree.\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with student-friendly definitions (10 minutes):**\n\n   Display each word on chart paper with a simple drawing:\n\n   - **Autumn (or Fall):** The season when leaves change color and fall off trees; it comes before winter when it gets cold\n   - **Deciduous Trees:** Trees that lose all their leaves in fall to rest and save energy for winter (point to the photograph: \"These trees in the picture are deciduous trees\")\n   - **Adaptation:** Something a plant or animal does to stay alive and healthy; trees dropping leaves is an adaptation to help them survive winter\n   - **Survival:** Staying alive and healthy; trees change to survive the cold months\n   - **Cycle:** Something that happens again and again in the same order; trees have a yearly cycle of growing leaves, changing color, and dropping leaves\n\n3. **Connect back to photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again\n   - Point to trees with different colors: \"These trees are going through autumn. Soon all their leaves will fall, like the leaves we felt. This is their adaptation—their special way of staying alive when it gets cold.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think trees drop their leaves? Turn and talk to a partner.\"\n   - Listen for responses connecting to: saving energy, preparing for winter, staying alive when it's cold\n\n4. **Read a short picture book (2-3 minutes)** if time allows, to reinforce the concept with engaging storytelling.\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why do trees change colors?\" (Answer: Getting ready for winter)\n   - Ask: \"Is it OK for a tree to lose its leaves?\" (Answer: Yes, it helps the tree stay alive)\n   - Ask: \"Do you think the leaves will come back next year?\" (Answer: Yes, that's what happens every year—it's a cycle)\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Chart (displayed and referenced):**\n\n| Word | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| **Autumn** | The season when leaves change colors and fall off |\n| **Deciduous** | Trees that drop all their leaves to prepare for winter |\n| **Adaptation** | A special thing a living thing does to stay alive |\n| **Survival** | Staying alive and healthy |\n| **Cycle** | Something that happens over and over again |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that autumn is a season of change\n- Students recognize that leaf loss is an *adaptation*—a survival strategy\n- Students can answer \"why\" questions about tree changes in simple terms\n- Students see patterns in nature (cycles)\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by mimicking how trees survive and predicting future tree behavior.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Construction paper (brown, red, yellow, orange, green)\n- Scissors (safety scissors for First Grade)\n- Glue sticks\n- Pre-made tree trunk templates (outline of a simple tree trunk, 8×10\")\n- Markers\n- Large floor space or tables\n- Chart paper with seasonal predictions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Create a Tree Through the Seasons (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge:** \"Trees have an adaptation to survive winter—they drop their leaves. Today, YOU are going to help a tree survive by showing what it looks like in different seasons!\"\n\n2. **Provide each student a tree trunk template** (pre-drawn or traced by teacher).\n\n3. **Give directions:**\n   - \"Cut out leaves from colored paper—red, yellow, orange, and green.\"\n   - \"For summer: Glue LOTS of green leaves on your tree. Trees need many leaves to eat energy from the sun.\"\n   - \"For autumn: Glue some orange, red, and yellow leaves mixed with a few green ones. Some leaves are dropping—leave some of your trunk showing!\"\n   - \"For winter: Glue VERY FEW or NO leaves on your tree. Your tree is resting and saving energy.\"\n\n4. **Circulate and ask guiding questions:**\n   - \"Why did you put fewer leaves on your winter tree?\"\n   - \"How is your tree's adaptation helping it survive?\"\n   - \"What will happen when spring comes?\"\n\n5. **Students glue leaves onto their trees** following the seasonal progression. This mimics the standard 1-LS1-1 by having students design (create) a model of how trees use their external parts (leaves) to survive.\n\n**Part B: Predict and Discuss (6 minutes)**\n\n6. **Gather students on the carpet** with their seasonal trees.\n\n7. **Ask predictive questions:**\n   - \"After winter, what do you think happens to your tree?\"\n   - \"Will the leaves come back in spring?\"\n   - \"How many leaves do you think will grow back?\"\n   - \"What season comes after winter?\"\n\n8. **Create a class prediction poster:** Draw or label a simple seasonal cycle (Summer → Autumn → Winter → Spring → Summer) and write student predictions. This addresses 1-LS1-2 by recognizing patterns in plant behavior.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding by creating a visual model of tree adaptation\n- Students predict that the cycle will repeat (leaves will return in spring)\n- Students explain their thinking: \"The tree drops leaves to stay alive\" or \"The tree needs lots of leaves when it's warm\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of tree adaptations, seasonal changes, and survival strategies.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore: Can students identify leaf colors and textures?\n- **Listen to student language** during Explain: Are they using words like \"adaptation,\" \"survive,\" \"winter,\" and \"cycle\"?\n- **Circulate during Elaborate:** Can students explain WHY they're adding/removing leaves from their seasonal tree?\n- **Ask informal check questions:** \"Why do you think trees drop their leaves?\"\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\nAdminister one of these options (choose based on your students' writing levels):\n\n**Option 1: Draw and Label**\n- Provide a simple worksheet with a tree outline\n- Ask: \"Draw what the tree looks like in autumn. Draw one thing that is happening to help the tree survive winter.\"\n- Students draw leaves dropping, colors changing, etc.\n- Label together or with support\n\n**Option 2: Oral Exit Ticket**\n- Ask each student individually or in small groups:\n  - \"What color did the leaves turn?\" (Observational—easy)\n  - \"Why do trees drop their leaves?\" (Conceptual—harder)\n  - \"What do you think happens to the tree in spring?\" (Predictive—hardest)\n- Record responses on a clipboard\n\n**Option 3: True/False Statements (using images)**\nShow pictures or verbal statements:\n- \"Trees drop leaves because they are sick.\" (False)\n- \"Leaves change color to help the tree get ready for winter.\" (True)\n- \"After winter, new leaves will grow back in spring.\" (True)\n- Students hold up thumbs up (true) or thumbs down (false)\n\n**Success Criteria – Students Demonstrate Understanding if They:**\n\n✓ Accurately identify autumn tree changes (colors, leaf loss) from the photograph\n✓ Explain that trees drop leaves to survive/prepare for winter (not because the tree is dying)\n✓ Recognize that leaf loss is an *adaptation*—a survival strategy\n✓ Predict that trees will grow leaves again in spring (understanding the cycle)\n✓ Use vocabulary: autumn, adaptation, survive, deciduous, cycle (in context, even imperfectly)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nMost First Grade students should be able to:\n- Observe that trees change colors and lose leaves\n- State (with support) that this helps trees survive winter\n- Predict leaves return in spring\n\nAdvanced students may:\n- Explain the full cycle (all four seasons)\n- Connect to other plant/animal survival strategies\n- Ask deeper questions about why certain leaves are certain colors\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:**\n   - Use simpler terms: \"The tree is getting ready for winter\" instead of \"adaptation\"\n   - Focus on 2 key vocabulary words (autumn, survive) instead of 5\n   - Use more visuals and fewer words; point to the photograph repeatedly\n\n2. **Hand-over-Hand Exploration:**\n   - During Explore, sit beside students who need support\n   - Guide their hands: \"Let's feel this leaf together. It's soft, right? Can you say 'soft'?\"\n   - Ask only one question at a time instead of multiple questions\n\n3. **Simplified Explain Activity:**\n   - During the tree creation, provide pre-cut leaves instead of having students cut\n   - Glue the first leaf on together to model the activity\n   - Accept fewer leaves on their seasonal tree; focus on the concept, not completion\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Explore Additional Evergreen Trees:**\n   - Introduce the idea that NOT all trees drop leaves (evergreens keep their leaves year-round)\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think some trees keep their leaves? How is that a different adaptation?\"\n   - Research or observe evergreen trees in the schoolyard\n\n2. **Deepen the Cycle Understanding:**\n   - Create a **4-season wheel** instead of individual seasonal trees; rotate and explain each quarter\n   - Add temperature information: \"Summer is warm, so trees need many leaves. Winter is cold, so they drop them.\"\n   - Predict: \"What other animals might need to adapt when trees lose their leaves?\" (birds flying south, squirrels storing food, etc.)\n\n3. **Write or Draw an Explanation:**\n   - Ask advanced students to draw AND write/dictate a sentence: \"Why do trees drop leaves? Trees drop leaves because ________.\"\n   - Create a simple book: \"The Life of a Leaf\" (where does it go after it falls?)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Leaf Decay Investigation (1-2 weeks)**\n   - Place fallen leaves in a clear plastic container with soil\n   - Observe weekly: \"What happens to the leaves? Do they change more? Where do they go?\"\n   - This connects to decomposition and cycles in nature\n   - Record observations with drawings\n\n2. **Tree Through the Year Bulletin Board**\n   - Create a large class mural with four sections: Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring\n   - Each section shows the same tree in different seasons\n   - Students contribute leaves, snow, or spring blossoms to their assigned section\n   - Walk past daily as a visual reminder of the cycle\n\n3. **Interview: \"Ask a Tree\" Role-Play**\n   - In small groups, one student is a tree and others ask questions: \"Why are you changing colors?\" \"Where do your leaves go?\" \"Will you grow them back?\"\n   - The \"tree\" answers using vocabulary from the lesson\n   - This reinforces understanding through dialogue and creativity\n\n4. **Home Connection: Fall Walk & Collection**\n   - Send home a note: \"This week, go on a walk with your family. Collect 3-5 fallen leaves. Notice what color they are and where you found them. We'll use them in class!\"\n   - Students bring leaves back and add to a classroom display labeled \"Leaves from Our Neighborhood\"\n   - Compare to the photograph: \"Are these the same colors as the trees in our picture?\"\n\n5. **Read-Aloud: Seasonal Plant Books**\n   - *Fall Leaves: Leaves Changing Colors* by Loretta Holland\n   - *What Do You Do in Fall?* by Marianne Berkes\n   - *Little Tree* by Loren Long\n   - Discuss: How do these stories show trees adapting?\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson works best in September-October when fall is visibly happening in your region. If teaching outside autumn, emphasize that this is what trees do \"in a place far away\" or \"later this year,\" then connect to trees students can observe outdoors.\n\n- **Safety:** Remind students that fallen leaves may have small bugs or mold. Wash hands after handling. Ensure no allergies to mold/mildew.\n\n- **Real-World Connection:** If your school has deciduous trees, take students outside to observe them during autumn. Compare colors and leaf fall to the photograph. This makes the lesson tangible.\n\n- **Vocabulary Progression:** First Grade students don't need to master \"deciduous\" terminology. Focus on the behavior: \"Trees that drop their leaves\" is sufficient. Use the formal term, but don't test on it.\n\n- **Misconception Alert:** Some students may think trees are \"dead\" when they lose leaves. Repeatedly affirm: \"The tree is still alive. It's sleeping and saving energy, like when you rest at night.\"\n\n- **Photo Return:** Revisit the photograph in each phase. Students need multiple exposures to understand it as evidence of the concept.\n\n---\n\n**Congratulations!** This lesson teaches students that plant structures and behaviors (like seasonal leaf loss) are *adaptations*—survival strategies. Students observe evidence, develop vocabulary, and predict future plant behavior based on understanding natural cycles. This is exactly what First Grade life science should accomplish.",
