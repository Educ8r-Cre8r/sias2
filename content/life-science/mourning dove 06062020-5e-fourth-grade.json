ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how animals' bodies help them survive by exploring the photograph of the mourning dove in the garden.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph of the mourning dove in the garden (color, large enough to see details)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: bird field guide or images of other bird species\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Give students 30-45 seconds of quiet \"think time\" to observe without talking.\n\n2. **Facilitate guided observation** with these specific discussion questions:\n   - \"What do you notice about the bird's eyes? Why do you think they are positioned on the sides of its head?\" (Answer: Helps birds see predators coming from different directions)\n   - \"Look at the bird's beak. How is it shaped? What do you think the bird uses its beak for?\" (Answer: Picking up seeds, insects, food from the ground)\n   - \"This bird is standing very still and alert. What senses do you think it's using right now to stay safe?\" (Answer: Sight and hearing)\n   - \"Why do you think this bird is in a garden with plants instead of somewhere else?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge:**\n   - Ask: \"What do you know about how birds' bodies are different from your body? What special body parts do birds have that you don't have?\"\n   - Record student responses on chart paper under two columns: \"Bird Body Parts\" and \"What They're Used For.\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:**\n   - \"I wonder... how does a bird's body help it find food, stay safe, and live in places like gardens. What do you wonder about how bird bodies help them survive?\"\n   - Have students turn and talk to a partner, then share one wonder aloud.\n\n**Transition:** Now that we're curious about how bird bodies help them survive, let's investigate bird body structures up close with a hands-on exploration.\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate bird external structures and their functions through a hands-on modeling activity.\n\n**Materials (per student or small group):**\n- Pipe cleaners (3-4 per student) in various colors\n- Index cards or cardstock\n- Scissors\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- Feathers (real craft feathers or paper strips to represent feathers)\n- Small googly eyes or drawn eyes\n- Glue stick or tape\n- Diagram handout: \"Bird Body Parts and Their Jobs\" (teacher-prepared)\n- Observation recording sheet (see below)\n\n**Student Observation Recording Sheet:**\n```\nBIRD BODY STRUCTURE INVESTIGATION\nDirections: As you build your model bird, draw and label each part. \nThen write what you think each part helps the bird do.\n\nBODY PART          WHAT I DREW          WHAT IT DOES\nBeak               [space]              [space]\nEyes               [space]              [space]\nWings              [space]              [space]\nFeet/Legs          [space]              [space]\nFeathers           [space]              [space]\n```\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge** (2 minutes):\n   - \"You're going to build a 3D model of a bird's body using pipe cleaners, feathers, and other materials. As you build, think about each body part and why a bird needs it to survive in a garden.\"\n\n2. **Model the process** (3 minutes):\n   - Show students how to:\n     - Bend a pipe cleaner into a body shape\n     - Attach smaller pipe cleaners for legs and wings\n     - Add feathers, eyes, and a beak made from cardstock\n     - Label each part\n\n3. **Students build independently or in pairs** (12 minutes):\n   - Provide the \"Bird Body Parts and Their Jobs\" diagram as reference\n   - Circulate and ask probing questions (do NOT tell them answers):\n     - \"Why did you make the wings that shape?\"\n     - \"How do you think the bird uses that body part in a garden?\"\n     - \"What would happen if the bird didn't have eyes?\"\n\n4. **Students complete the observation recording sheet** (3-5 minutes):\n   - Have them draw or write labels for each body part\n   - Ask them to write or dictate one job each part does\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without giving direct answers\n- Ask clarifying questions that guide thinking\n- Observe which students understand structure-function relationships and which need additional support\n- Take notes on misconceptions to address in the Explain phase\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a 3D model that includes major bird body structures (beak, eyes, wings, legs, feathers)\n- Students can articulate at least one function for 3-4 body parts\n- Recording sheets show emerging understanding of how structures support survival (even if explanations are simple)\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal scientific vocabulary and deepen understanding of structure-function relationships using evidence from exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Poster or printout: \"Bird Body Structures and Their Functions\" (teacher-created, with photos)\n- The original photograph of the mourning dove\n- Student recording sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: Real feather or bird skeleton diagram\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out** (5 minutes):\n   - Invite 3-4 students to share their model and what they discovered about one body part\n   - Display models at the front so all can see\n   - Emphasize: \"Notice how each student's bird model has similar parts. That's because all birds have body structures that help them survive.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with definitions** (8 minutes):\n   - Write each term on the chart as you define it. Use visuals (point to the photograph or real examples).\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition | Example from Photo/Models |\n|------|----------------------------|-------------------------|\n| **External Structures** | Body parts on the outside of an animal that help it do important jobs like finding food, moving, and staying safe | The dove's beak, wings, eyes, and feathers |\n| **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat (where it lives) | A bird's wings help it fly away from danger; a pointed beak helps it pick up seeds |\n| **Beak/Bill** | The hard, pointed or flat mouth part a bird uses to pick up food and drink water | The mourning dove uses its small beak to pick up seeds from the ground |\n| **Feathers** | Special body covering made of tiny strands that keeps a bird warm, helps it fly, and protects its skin | You can see the dove's feathers in the photo—they overlap like roof shingles |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs: food, water, shelter, and safety | The garden with plants, soil, and hiding places is a good habitat for the dove |\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph and Explore activity** (5 minutes):\n   - Project the original photograph\n   - Point out specific structures: \"Look at this dove's eyes. They're on the sides of its head. Why is that useful? Because the dove can see predators coming from almost any direction—that's an adaptation for staying safe!\"\n   - Compare a student's model to the real bird: \"Your model shows wings. Real birds use wings to fly away from danger and to move around the garden to find food.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding** (2 minutes):\n   - Ask: \"Can you point to a body part on the real dove and tell your partner one job that body part does?\"\n   - Listen in to 2-3 partnerships\n   - Ask follow-up: \"How does that body part help the dove survive?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name 3-4 external structures of birds\n- Students can explain that body structures have functions (jobs) that help birds survive\n- Students use vocabulary correctly in oral responses\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding of bird body structures and sensory responses to a new context: comparing different habitats and bird adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Three habitat scenario cards (see below)\n- Images of different birds (cardinal, hummingbird, duck, woodpecker) — printed or projected\n- Paper and markers\n- Optional: Live observation of birds if garden is accessible\n\n**Habitat Scenario Cards:**\n\n```\nSCENARIO 1: BIRD IN A DENSE FOREST\nThe bird needs to: Navigate through branches, hide from predators, \nfind insects in tree bark. What body structures would be useful?\n\nSCENARIO 2: BIRD AT A LAKE OR POND\nThe bird needs to: Swim, dive for fish, stay warm and dry. \nWhat body structures would be useful?\n\nSCENARIO 3: BIRD IN AN OPEN MEADOW\nThe bird needs to: Fly fast and far, see predators from far away. \nWhat body structures would be useful?\n```\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the scenarios** (2 minutes):\n   - \"Different birds live in different habitats. Each habitat requires different body structures. Let's think about what body parts help birds survive in different places.\"\n\n2. **Show images of varied birds** (3 minutes):\n   - Project images of 4-5 different birds (e.g., cardinal, duck, woodpecker, hummingbird, hawk)\n   - Ask: \"Do all these birds look the same? What's different about their beaks? Their size? Their feet?\"\n   - Explain: \"These birds all have bodies adapted for the habitat where they live.\"\n\n3. **Small group or individual activity** (8 minutes):\n   - Assign each small group one habitat scenario card OR have students choose\n   - Task: \"Draw or list the body structures a bird would need to survive in this habitat. Label each part and explain why it's useful.\"\n   - Provide the option to: sketch a bird, make a labeled list, or create a simple diagram\n\n4. **Gallery walk or share-out** (2 minutes):\n   - Invite groups to post their work\n   - Have students walk around and notice patterns\n   - Ask: \"What body parts showed up in multiple habitats? Which body parts were only useful in one habitat?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide guiding questions: \"What does this bird need to do to survive here? What body part would help with that?\"\n- Ensure students are making explicit connections between structures and habitat survival needs\n- Note which students are secure with concepts and which need reinforcement\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify habitat-specific body structures\n- Students explain adaptations as solutions to survival challenges\n- Students recognize that different birds have different structures suited to their homes\n- Work shows evidence of cause-and-effect thinking (\"The duck has webbed feet BECAUSE...\")\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of bird body structures, their functions, and how animals use senses to respond to their environment.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Observation during Explore: Student model-building and recording sheets\n- Listen-in during Explain: Small group discussions and vocabulary use\n- Elaboration activity: Habitat-specific drawings and explanations\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nAdminister this at the end of the lesson. Students can respond with drawings, words, or a combination.\n\n```\nBIRD BODY STRUCTURES EXIT TICKET\n\n1. Look at this picture of a mourning dove (show the original photo).\n   \n   Name ONE external structure you can see on this bird: _______________\n   \n2. What does that body part help the bird do?\n   _________________________________________________________________\n\n3. The dove is standing very still in the garden. \n   Which senses is the dove probably using right now to stay safe?\n   Circle: SIGHT    HEARING    SMELL    TASTE    TOUCH\n   \n   How do you know? ___________________________________________________\n\n4. (Challenge Question) Why is a garden a good habitat for a bird?\n   Use the word \"structure\" or \"adaptation\" in your answer.\n   _________________________________________________________________\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| Level | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Proficient** | Student identifies a bird body structure and explains its function. Correctly identifies at least one sense the bird uses. Explains habitat choice using appropriate vocabulary. |\n| **Developing** | Student identifies a body structure but function explanation is unclear or partial. Identifies a sense but reasoning is vague. Explains habitat choice without using specific vocabulary. |\n| **Beginning** | Student names a body part but cannot explain its function. Does not identify sensory use. Cannot explain habitat connection. |\n\n**How to Use Results:**\n- Proficient: Students are ready for extension (see Differentiation/Challenge)\n- Developing: Students benefit from small group review using the photograph and real examples\n- Beginning: Students need one-on-one discussion with concrete examples (show real feathers, point out eyes in photos, demonstrate how senses work)\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Guided Model-Building During Explore:**\n   - Pair with a confident peer or paraprofessional\n   - Provide a step-by-step photographic guide showing how to assemble the pipe cleaner model\n   - Simplify the recording sheet to yes/no questions: \"Does the beak help the bird eat? Yes/No\" instead of open-ended writing\n\n2. **Simplified Vocabulary:**\n   - Use simpler synonyms: \"Outside body parts\" instead of \"external structures\"; \"Special fit\" instead of \"adaptation\"\n   - Pre-teach vocabulary using real objects (craft feather, bird beak image, etc.) before the lesson\n\n3. **Concrete Connections:**\n   - Spend extra time with the original photograph, pointing out and naming structures one at a time\n   - Use \"I see, I think, I wonder\" sentence frames: \"I see a beak. I think the bird uses it to pick up food. I wonder if the beak helps the bird...\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Comparative Anatomy Exploration:**\n   - Provide images of 3-4 different bird species (cardinal, hummingbird, duck, woodpecker)\n   - Ask: \"How are the beaks different? Why do you think each bird has a different beak shape? What does each bird eat?\"\n   - Have students create a comparison chart: \"Beak Shape → What the Bird Eats → Habitat\"\n\n2. **Sensory Processing Extension:**\n   - Deepen understanding of 4-LS1-2 by creating a \"Sensory Response Flowchart\":\n     - \"The dove SEES a shadow → Its brain says 'Danger!' → The dove FLIES away\"\n   - Task: \"Create a flowchart showing three different things a garden bird might sense and how it responds\"\n\n3. **Habitat Design Challenge:**\n   - \"Design a garden that would be perfect for a mourning dove. What plants, shelter, and food sources would you include? Draw your design and label the parts that meet the dove's survival needs.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Backyard Bird Survey (Real Observation):**\n   - If accessible, take students outside to observe actual birds in your school garden or nearby outdoor space\n   - Provide binoculars (optional) and a simple bird identification guide\n   - Have students sketch what they see, label body parts, and note behaviors\n   - Return to classroom and compare real observations to the mourning dove lesson\n\n2. **Feather Investigation Lab:**\n   - Provide real craft feathers or teacher-collected feathers (ethically sourced)\n   - Students examine feathers with hand lenses\n   - Task: \"Describe what you see. How are the tiny strands arranged? How does this design help keep a bird warm and dry?\"\n   - Connect to waterproofing: Test water droplets on feather vs. paper towel\n\n3. **Bird Sense Simulation Game:**\n   - Play \"Hawk and Doves\" or \"Predator and Prey\" game on the playground\n   - Student \"doves\" must use their senses (sight, hearing) to detect \"hawks\" (other students)\n   - Debrief: \"Which sense helped you stay safe? How is this like how a real bird uses its senses in a garden?\"\n   - Connects back to 4-LS1-2 (sensory input → brain processing → response)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Photograph Analysis Tip:** The mourning dove's alert posture, visible eyes, and garden habitat make it ideal for discussing sensory awareness and habitat selection. The variety of plants in the background supports discussion of food sources and shelter.\n\n- **Safety Reminder:** If using real feathers, source from ethical suppliers (craft stores, humane sources). Ensure no students have allergies to feathers or other materials before starting the lesson.\n\n- **Pacing:** This lesson can be taught in one 90-minute block or split into two 45-minute sessions: Day 1 (Engage + Explore), Day 2 (Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate).\n\n- **Real-World Connection:** Relate to student experience: \"Have you ever seen a bird in your backyard or the park? What was it doing? What helped it survive there?\"\n\nThis lesson directly aligns with both Grade 4 LS standards by having students identify external structures, explain their functions for survival, and consider how sensory input drives animal behavior in a real-world habitat context.",
