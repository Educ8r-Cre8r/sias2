ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the mysterious organisms in the photograph and activate prior knowledge about living things and habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the photograph (fungi on wood chips) or printed copies\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Small objects from outdoors (dead leaf, piece of bark, small stick) to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or overhead. Do NOT say what the organisms are yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause for 3–5 students to respond after each):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe it to your neighbor?\"\n   - \"Do you think these yellowish things are alive? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this photo was taken? What clues tell you that?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this in your yard, playground, or garden? What was it doing there?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:**\n   - \"I wonder what these living things need to grow here... Let's find out together!\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper (e.g., \"Does it need light?\" \"Does it need water?\" \"Why does it live on old wood?\") to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore these mysterious living things by building our own little home for them and watching what happens.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate conditions for fungal growth through a hands-on decomposition exploration activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3–4):**\n- 1 clear plastic container (shoe box or small storage bin) with a lid\n- Dead leaves, small twigs, and wood chips (students can collect these outdoors)\n- Damp paper towels or soil\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Small labels and tape\n- Optional: magnifying glasses (1 per group)\n\n**Activity: \"Build a Decomposer Home\"**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Fill your container about halfway with dead leaves, small sticks, and wood chips. Mix them together.\"\n\n2. \"Dampen (not soak) your material by spraying it a few times with the spray bottle. It should feel like a wrung-out sponge.\"\n\n3. \"Add a damp paper towel to help keep moisture in. Close the lid most of the way, but leave a tiny crack so air can get in.\"\n\n4. \"Put your container in a quiet, shady place in the classroom (not in direct sunlight).\"\n\n5. \"Every 2–3 days, spray a little water inside and observe. Write or draw what you see on your observation sheet.\"\n\n6. \"Over the next 2–3 weeks, fungi (and other decomposers) may appear. Watch and record changes!\"\n\n**Connection to photograph:** \"We're creating the same habitat the fungi in the photo need—dead wood, moisture, and shade. Let's see if fungi come to live in our container!\"\n\n**What students should record:**\n- Date and drawing of what they observe each day\n- Simple descriptions: \"It's wet,\" \"I see green stuff,\" \"I see something orange/yellow like the photo\"\n- Predictions: \"What do you think will happen next?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups and ask **discovery questions** (not answers):\n  - \"What changed since yesterday?\"\n  - \"Why do you think we added water?\"\n  - \"Is your container getting darker or lighter?\"\n  - \"What do you think the fungi needs to grow?\"\n- Do NOT tell students \"that's a fungus.\" Let them observe first.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Containers show increasing moisture and possibly visible mold/fungi growth\n- Students observe that dark, damp places attract decomposers\n- Observation sheets show changes over time with drawings/words\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts after students have observed decomposition happening.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original photograph\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Chart paper for vocabulary\n- Optional: 1–2 additional photos of fungi in nature (from Google Images search: \"mushrooms in forest\" or \"mold on log\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations from Explore activity:**\n   - Ask 2–3 groups: \"What did you see growing in your container? Tell us what it looked like.\"\n   - Point out similarities to the photograph: \"Does anything you found look like these yellow things in the photo?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** using simple, concrete definitions:\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|----------------------------|\n   | **Fungi** | Living things that are not plants or animals. They break down dead stuff like wood and leaves and help them turn into soil. |\n   | **Decompose** | To break down and fall apart. Dead plants and animals decompose, and fungi help make this happen. |\n   | **Habitat** | A place where a living thing has everything it needs to survive (food, water, shelter). |\n   | **Moisture** | Water in the air or in the soil. Fungi need it to grow. |\n\n3. **Make connections:**\n   - \"The fungi in the photo are decomposers. Their job in nature is to break down dead wood, just like the mold or fungi you saw (or might see) in your containers.\"\n   - \"Fungi need a damp, dark habitat to grow—like the shady forest floor where this photo was taken.\"\n   - Point to the observation sheets: \"You created the perfect home for decomposers!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - **Quick-show strategy:** \"Hold up 1 finger if fungi are living things. Hold up 2 fingers if fungi are like plants. Hold up 3 fingers if fungi help break down dead stuff.\"\n   - **Sentence stem:** \"Fungi need __________ and __________ to grow. I know this because...\"\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Display:** Post the chart in the room for reference.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name \"fungi\" and explain (in their own words) that they break down dead materials\n- Students identify moisture and shade as habitat needs for fungi\n- Students see the connection between their observations and the photograph\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to a new, real-world context and deepen knowledge about fungi's role in nature.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or poster board (1 per group)\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- Optional: small items to glue (dried leaves, twigs)\n- Index cards with different habitats written on them (Forest Floor, Under a Log, Kitchen Sink, Dead Tree)\n\n**Activity: \"Where Else Do Decomposers Live?\"**\n\n1. **Assign each small group a different habitat** (Forest Floor, Under a Rotting Log, Damp Basement, Dead Tree Stump).\n\n2. **Task:** \"Draw and label your habitat. Show where fungi might live there and what dead things they might break down.\"\n\n3. **Guiding questions for groups:**\n   - \"What dead things might be in your habitat?\"\n   - \"Would it be wet or dry there? Dark or light?\"\n   - \"Would fungi be happy living there? Why?\"\n\n4. **Create a \"Decomposer Habitat Gallery\":**\n   - Post all group drawings around the room\n   - Do a brief gallery walk where students observe other habitats\n   - Ask 1–2 volunteers to explain their habitat to the class\n\n5. **Real-world connection:**\n   - \"Fungi are working right now in your yard, in forests, and even in some places in your house. They're nature's cleanup crew! Without them, dead leaves would pile up forever and never turn back into soil.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask thought-provoking questions: \"Why is that habitat wet/dark?\"\n- Encourage students to think about places they've actually seen fungi or mold\n- Validate all observations and connections\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Drawings show appropriate environmental conditions (moisture, darkness)\n- Students explain why fungi would survive in their assigned habitat\n- Students articulate the role of fungi in nature (breaking things down, helping create soil)\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fungi as living decomposers and their role in specific habitats.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation sheets from Explore phase:** Check for evidence of careful observation and prediction-making\n- **Check-for-understanding finger voting and sentence stems during Explain phase**\n- **Group discussions and gallery walk comments during Elaborate phase**\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\n**Provide each student with a card or paper with these 3 prompts. Students can draw or write answers:**\n\n1. **\"What are fungi?\"**\n   - *Success: Student identifies fungi as living things that break down dead stuff* ✓\n\n2. **\"Draw or write: What does a fungus need to grow?\"**\n   - *Success: Student identifies at least 2 of: moisture, shade/darkness, dead material* ✓\n\n3. **\"Where might you find fungi growing? Why would it grow there?\"**\n   - *Success: Student names a realistic habitat (forest, under logs, garden) and gives a reason (wet, dark, has dead material)* ✓\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students meet all 3 prompts with age-appropriate responses (drawings + simple labels are acceptable)\n- Responses show understanding that fungi are living decomposers in damp, dark places\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Review exit tickets and observation sheets for evidence of understanding\n- Use responses to inform small-group review or reteaching if needed\n- Note which students are ready for extensions vs. need additional support\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Sentence frames during exit ticket:**\n   - \"Fungi are _____________.\"\n   - \"Fungi grow in places that are _____________ and _____________.\"\n   - \"Fungi help by _____________.\"\n\n2. **Paired observations:** Assign struggling students to observe containers with a strong partner; provide them with a picture card of \"fungi\" to match against their observations.\n\n3. **Simplified vocabulary focus:** Instead of all 4 vocabulary terms, focus only on fungi, decompose, and habitat. Use the chart paper frequently for reference.\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Fungi life cycle drawing:** Have students research and draw or label the stages of how a fungus grows (spore → mycelium → fruiting body/mushroom).\n\n2. **Decomposition experiment:** Challenge students to design a test: \"Does fungus grow better in dry or wet conditions?\" Have them set up 2 containers with different moisture levels and compare results over time.\n\n3. **Food web extension:** Introduce the concept that fungi are one type of decomposer. Have students create a simple food chain or web showing how decomposers fit into an ecosystem (e.g., Dead Leaf → Fungus → Soil → New Plant).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Field Investigation: \"Fungi Hunt\" (15–20 minutes):**\n   - Take students on a walk around the school grounds or a local park (with permission)\n   - Search for fungi, mold, or decomposition in progress (under logs, on tree stumps, in mulch piles)\n   - Photograph or sketch findings\n   - Document where fungi are found and discuss habitat patterns as a class\n\n2. **Fungi in Art & Literature:**\n   - Read an age-appropriate book featuring fungi or decomposition (e.g., *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle touches on growth and renewal; *Who Eats What?* by Patricia Lauber covers food chains)\n   - Create a detailed illustration of a fungus using the photograph as a model\n   - Write a short paragraph from a fungus's perspective: \"I am a fungus. My job is...\"\n\n3. **Cooking Connection: \"Where Does Our Food Come From?\"**\n   - Discuss that soil (made partly by decomposition) grows the food we eat\n   - Plant seeds in soil and observe growth; discuss what decomposers did to create rich soil\n   - Make a simple \"compost in a jar\" using leaves, soil, and a little water to show decomposition (much faster than the week-long observation)\n\n4. **Home Observation Assignment:**\n   - Send home a \"Fungi Detective\" observation sheet\n   - Ask families to look for mold or fungi at home (bathroom, kitchen, under sinks, in the yard) and report back\n   - Class shares findings; discuss why those locations are habitats for fungi\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Patience with timing:** Visible fungal growth in student containers may take 1–3 weeks. Consider starting this lesson early and checking containers throughout the month, or have a backup set of containers prepared with visible growth to show if student containers are slow.\n- **Safety:** Review classroom expectations about not touching mold without permission and washing hands after handling containers.\n- **Variability:** Some containers may develop mold, others may not. Use this as a teaching moment: \"Why might one container have fungi and another doesn't?\" (Excellent scaffold for the concept of habitat requirements.)\n- **Connection to standards:** This lesson emphasizes **2-LS4-1** through observation of organisms in different habitats and their adaptations (fungi in damp, dark places). It also hints at ecosystem roles, preparing students for later learning about food webs and decomposition.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson provides concrete, observable evidence of a living organism playing a specific ecological role—perfect for Second Grade learners building foundational understanding of biodiversity and habitats.**",
