ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about how animals get what they need to survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the American robin (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Introduce the Photograph:** Project the image of the robin standing on the rock. Ask students to examine it silently for 30 seconds, noticing details.\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What is this bird doing right now, and why might it be standing on a rock?\"\n   - \"What do you think this robin needs to survive—what would it eat, where would it live, and where would it get water?\"\n   - \"This robin has a sharp, pointed beak. Why do you think it has that shape? What job does it do?\"\n   - \"If all the insects and worms disappeared from this habitat, what would happen to this robin?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Invite students to share, \"I wonder how this robin gets the energy it needs each day\" or \"I wonder where all the materials in the robin's body come from.\" Record their wonderings on chart paper.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become food chain detectives. We're going to trace all the materials and energy that this robin needs—and where that energy originally comes from.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how energy and matter move through an ecosystem by creating a food web centered on the robin.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards (one per student or small group)\n- Markers and colored pencils\n- String or yarn\n- Pushpins or tape\n- Chart paper or poster board (one per group)\n- Field guide images or printed pictures of: grass, insects (beetles, earthworms), worms, berries, robin, hawk, decomposer organisms (mushrooms, bacteria)\n- Optional: Clipboards for outdoor observation (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set Up the Investigation:** Divide students into small groups (3-4 per group). Assign each group a role:\n   - Group A: Producer Detectives (find and research plants the robin might eat)\n   - Group B: Prey Detectives (find insects and small animals the robin eats)\n   - Group C: Consumer-Predator Detectives (find larger animals that might eat the robin)\n   - Group D: Decomposer Detectives (find organisms that break down dead material)\n\n2. **Student Discovery Process:**\n   - Each group receives printed pictures, field guide excerpts, or research cards about their assigned organisms.\n   - Students record the name of each organism, what it eats or needs, and one fact about it.\n   - Groups use index cards to create organism cards with pictures and labels.\n\n3. **Build the Food Web:**\n   - Reconvene the entire class. Lay out all organism cards on a large poster board or floor space.\n   - Place the robin in the center. Explain: \"The robin connects to multiple food sources. Let's trace them.\"\n   - As a whole class, use string to connect the robin to each organism it eats (insects, worms, berries).\n   - Then extend connections backward: What do the insects eat? (plants, decomposing material). What eats the robin? (hawks, owls).\n   - As connections grow, highlight that this is a **food web**—a network showing how energy and matter move through the ecosystem.\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Students draw the food web in their science notebooks or on a large class poster.\n   - They label arrows and add notes: \"Energy flows from plants to insects to robin\" or \"The robin depends on insects for survival.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What did you discover this organism eats?\" \"Where does that organism get its energy?\" \"How does this connect to the robin?\"\n- Avoid giving direct answers; instead, prompt students to look at their research and make inferences.\n- Ensure all groups understand that they are tracing *matter* (the actual food/material the robin eats) and *energy* (the sun's energy captured by plants and passed along).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- A visual food web showing the robin connected to multiple food sources, predators, and decomposers.\n- Student notes identifying at least 5-6 organisms and their relationships.\n- Evidence of student understanding that the robin is not at the top of the food chain—it both eats other organisms and is eaten by larger predators.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after exploration; connect findings back to the photograph and the 5-LS2-1 standard.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Diagram or model showing energy flow (sun → plants → consumers → decomposers)\n- Colored markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Each group briefly shares one discovery from their role (e.g., \"We found that robins eat earthworms and berries\").\n   - Display all food webs side by side and note similarities and differences.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary and Concepts (10 minutes):**\n   - Use the food webs and observations to define and discuss:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Producer:** An organism (like plants, grass, berries) that makes its own food using sunlight and is the start of the food chain.\n   - **Consumer:** An organism (like a robin or insect) that eats other organisms to get energy and materials to survive.\n   - **Food Chain:** A simple path showing how energy and matter move from one organism to the next (e.g., grass → insect → robin).\n   - **Food Web:** A more complete picture showing multiple food chains connected together, showing how animals depend on many different food sources.\n   - **Decomposer:** An organism (like mushrooms or bacteria) that breaks down dead materials and returns matter to the soil and air, completing the cycle.\n   - **Matter:** The material that makes up all living things; it moves from organism to organism through the food web.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph and Standard:**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"This robin is part of a food web. Everything it eats—insects, worms, berries—comes from organisms and materials in its environment.\"\n   - Explain: \"The matter in the robin's body (its feathers, bones, muscles) originally came from plants that captured energy from the sun. The sun's energy was passed along the food chain.\"\n   - Reference 5-LS2-1: \"Today, we developed a model [the food web] that shows how matter and energy move among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If a robin eats an insect, where did that insect get its energy?\" (from plants)\n   - Ask: \"When the robin dies, what happens to the matter in its body?\" (decomposers break it down and return it to soil)\n   - Ask: \"Why is the sun important to this food web, even though the robin doesn't eat sunlight directly?\" (Plants capture sun's energy; robins eat plants/plant-eaters)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define producer, consumer, food chain, food web, and decomposer in their own words.\n- Students understand that energy flows from the sun → plants → consumers.\n- Students recognize that matter (the actual material in organisms' bodies) cycles through the food web.\n- Students can point to the photograph and explain how the robin fits into its food web.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by exploring how changes in the environment affect the robin's survival and the entire food web.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Scenario cards or printed situations (see below)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Student science notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present Real-World Scenarios:**\n   Provide students with 3-4 environmental change scenarios. Have them work in small groups to predict and explain the consequences using their food web models.\n\n   **Scenario 1:** A drought causes all the grass and berries in the robin's habitat to die. What happens to the insects that eat plants? What happens to the robin?\n\n   **Scenario 2:** Humans spray pesticide to kill insects. How would this affect the robin? Which food source is affected?\n\n   **Scenario 3:** A forest fire destroys most of the vegetation. How would this change the habitat for the robin and other organisms?\n\n   **Scenario 4:** An invasive species of beetle arrives and eats the plants and insects. How might this affect the robin's food web?\n\n2. **Group Discussion and Reasoning:**\n   - Students use their food web model to trace the consequences of each scenario.\n   - They record their predictions: \"If [this happens], then [this consequence] because [explanation using food web].\"\n   - Encourage use of evidence: \"Look at what the robin eats. If that food source disappears, the robin will have less energy...\"\n\n3. **Whole-Class Share and Deepen:**\n   - Groups share their predictions. Discuss which organisms are most affected by each change.\n   - Introduce the concept of **interdependence:** \"All the organisms in this food web depend on each other. A change that seems small—like losing one plant—can affect everything.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to use their food web models as evidence for predictions.\n- Ask: \"Look at your web. What other organisms might be affected by this change?\"\n- Validate reasoning and encourage deeper thinking: \"That's a good prediction. Can you trace how the energy flow would change?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students make evidence-based predictions about how environmental changes affect the robin and other organisms.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that organisms are interdependent and that changes ripple through the food web.\n- Students use scientific reasoning and their models to support explanations.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of food webs, energy/matter movement, and ecosystem interdependence.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observe student participation during food web construction and scenario discussions.\n- Listen to explanations and check for use of vocabulary and correct understanding of energy/matter flow.\n- Review student drawings and notes in science notebooks.\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide students with this assessment (written or verbal for younger/struggling readers):\n\n**Part 1 – Food Web Understanding:**\n\"Look at the robin photograph again. Draw or describe a simple food chain that shows:\n- One plant the robin might eat\n- One insect or animal the robin might eat\n- The robin itself\n- One predator that might eat the robin\nUse arrows to show the direction energy and matter move.\"\n\n**Part 2 – Application and Reasoning:**\n\"Explain in 2-3 sentences: Why would it be a problem if all the earthworms in a robin's habitat died? Use the words 'energy,' 'matter,' or 'food web' in your answer.\"\n\n**Part 3 – Vocabulary Check:**\n\"Match the word to its definition:\n1. Producer ___     A. An organism that eats other organisms\n2. Consumer ___    B. An organism that makes its own food from sunlight\n3. Food Web ___   C. Connected food chains showing how energy moves\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student correctly identifies at least one complete food chain with a producer and consumer.\n- Student explains how a change in the food web affects the robin with reference to energy, matter, or food connections.\n- Student correctly matches 2 of 3 vocabulary terms.\n- Student demonstrates understanding that the robin depends on other organisms and is part of an interconnected system.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets reveal student mastery of food web concepts and interdependence.\n- Students can apply their models to predict and explain real-world scenarios.\n- Students use scientific vocabulary accurately and with understanding.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Food Web:** Provide a pre-made skeleton food web with only 4-5 organisms (sun, grass, insect, robin, hawk). Students fill in labels and draw arrows rather than creating from scratch. This reduces cognitive load while maintaining conceptual learning.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create and display a visual anchor chart with pictures of each vocabulary term (producer = sunflower, consumer = robin, food chain = arrows between images). Students can reference this during writing and discussions. Pair vocabulary with pictures to support ELL and visual learners.\n\n3. **Guided Scenario Questions:** For students struggling with the Elaborate phase, provide sentence frames:\n   - \"If [organism] dies, the robin would lose _____ to eat.\"\n   - \"This is a problem because the robin needs _____ to survive.\"\n   - \"Without this food, the robin might _____.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Complex Food Web with Energy Loss:** Introduce the concept that only about 10% of energy is passed from one organism to the next. Ask advanced students: \"If 100 units of energy are in plants, how much reaches the robin? If a hawk eats a robin, how much energy does the hawk get?\" Have them calculate and discuss why robins eat many small meals.\n\n2. **Population Dynamics:** Challenge students to predict what happens if the robin population increases dramatically. \"If there were 10 times more robins in this habitat, would there be enough insects and worms? What might happen to the insect population? Would the hawk population change? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Decomposer Deep Dive:** Have advanced students research and present on a specific decomposer (e.g., earthworms, fungi, bacteria) and create a detailed explanation of how decomposers return matter to the soil and air, completing the cycle. They can present to the class or create an informational poster.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Local Habitat Food Web Research Project:** Students research a local bird or animal in your region and create a food web specific to that organism and local habitat. They can interview a local wildlife biologist, use field guides, or research online. This extends learning to real ecosystems students may encounter and deepens place-based science understanding.\n\n2. **Food Web Card Game:** Create or have students create a matching or sequential card game showing organisms in a food web. Students play in pairs or small groups, matching predators to prey and building chains. This reinforces vocabulary and relationships in an engaging, kinesthetic way suitable for review or homework.\n\n3. **Decomposer Observation Experiment:** Set up a composting or decomposition station in the classroom. Students observe how organic matter (leaves, food scraps, grass) breaks down over 4-6 weeks. They keep a journal documenting changes, identify decomposers (fungi, worms), and connect observations back to the food web lesson—matter is returned to the soil and can be used by plants again, completing the cycle.\n\n---",
