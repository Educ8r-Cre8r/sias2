Identify that dragonflies are living animals and describe what they see on a dragonfly's body\n2. Explain that dragonflies need water to live and survive\n3. Describe one special body part of a dragonfly and tell what job it does\n4. Recognize that different animals live in different places based on what they need\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about dragonflies and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the dragonfly (large, visible to all students)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or poster board at student eye level. Do NOT explain what it is yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause for responses after each):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe it to a friend?\"\n   - \"Do you think this is an animal or not an animal? How do you know?\"\n   - \"What parts of its body can you point to?\" (Guide them to notice wings, eyes, long body, legs)\n   - \"Where do you think this animal lives? What do you see it's sitting on?\" (Prompt them to notice the gray, rough surface—like wood or rock near water)\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to tell you this animal is called a dragonfly. Why do you think it has that name? What part of its name tells you it might live near water?\" (Accept all ideas; don't correct yet.)\n\n4. **Write student predictions on chart paper** — this becomes your reference throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Let's explore dragonflies up close and discover what they need to stay alive.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate dragonfly body parts and habitat needs through hands-on discovery.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large poster showing simple dragonfly body diagram (wings, eyes, legs, long body—unlabeled)\n- Markers (multiple colors)\n- Picture cards or photos of different water habitats (pond, stream, lake, marsh—printed or drawn)\n- Dry-erase boards or paper for recording observations\n- Hand lenses (optional, if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Station Setup:** Divide class into two stations that rotate after 12 minutes.\n\n   **Station A: Dragonfly Body Parts**\n   - Display a large, unlabeled diagram of a dragonfly (simple line drawing, age-appropriate)\n   - Provide markers and ask students: \"Color each body part a different color. Point to the wings. Point to where you think its eyes are. Show me the long tail.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think dragonflies have such big wings?\" and \"What do those giant eyes help it do?\" (Students make guesses—don't correct yet)\n   - Students draw or label (with teacher scribing) one body part they notice\n\n   **Station B: Habitat Homes**\n   - Display 3–4 picture cards showing water habitats (pond with plants, rocky stream, quiet lake, marshy area)\n   - Ask: \"Which of these places would a dragonfly like? Why?\" \n   - Have students point to or color the habitat they think is the dragonfly's home\n   - Ask: \"What do you see in this place? Is there water? Are there plants?\" (Guide observation to water and vegetation)\n\n2. **Teacher Role:** \n   - Circulate without giving answers\n   - Ask follow-up questions: \"Tell me more about that,\" \"What else do you notice?\", \"How do you know?\"\n   - Record phrases students use (e.g., \"It likes water,\" \"It has big eyes,\" \"It flies fast\")\n\n3. **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n   - Students identify major body parts (wings, eyes, legs, long body)\n   - Students recognize water as part of a dragonfly's home\n   - Students make connections between body parts and what the animal does\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize observations with key vocabulary and clear connections to dragonfly survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The original photograph (projected or large print)\n- Picture of a pond or stream environment\n- Small toy/model dragonfly (optional visual aid)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students** in a circle or on the carpet with the photograph visible.\n\n2. **Share-out from Explore:**\n   - Ask 3–4 volunteers to share one thing they discovered at their stations\n   - Point to the photograph and say, \"You're right! Look at the dragonfly's wings here. They're perfect for flying fast.\"\n   - Affirm all observations on your chart from Engage phase\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** (use simple, clear language; show examples in the photo):\n\n   | **Term** | **Kid-Friendly Definition** |\n   |----------|----------------------------|\n   | **Dragonfly** | A small animal with wings and a long body that lives near water |\n   | **Wings** | The flat, see-through parts on its back that help it fly |\n   | **Eyes** | The big round parts on its head that help it see really well |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs |\n   | **Water** | The liquid that dragonflies need to live—found in ponds, streams, and lakes |\n\n4. **Make connections explicitly:**\n   - \"Dragonflies have WINGS so they can FLY. Flying helps them catch food and get away from animals that might hurt them. That's why they NEED to fly.\"\n   - \"Dragonflies have BIG EYES so they can see really, really well. They use their eyes to find food in the water. They need good eyes to survive.\"\n   - \"Dragonflies live near WATER because that's their HABITAT. They need water to drink, to lay eggs, and to find food. Without water, dragonflies cannot survive.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Point to the water in the picture. Why is water important for this dragonfly?\" (Students point and respond)\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think this dragonfly's eyes are so big?\" (Students answer based on their learning)\n   - Ask: \"Can a dragonfly live in a desert with no water? Why or why not?\" (Students explain using what they learned)\n\n6. **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n   - Students name and point to dragonfly body parts\n   - Students explain that dragonflies need water to live\n   - Students connect body parts to survival (e.g., \"wings help it fly to find food\")\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply dragonfly concepts to a new context and deepen understanding of animal needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with drawings of different animals (butterfly, fish, bird, frog, dragonfly) or printed picture cards\n- Markers\n- Index cards with simple habitat pictures\n- Chart titled \"What Does This Animal Need to Survive?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Compare and Contrast:** \n   - Show pictures of 3–4 different animals: butterfly, fish, frog, and the dragonfly\n   - Ask: \"Which of these animals need water like the dragonfly does? Point to it.\"\n   - Ask: \"Which animals have wings like the dragonfly?\" \n   - Create a simple table on chart paper:\n\n     | **Animal** | **Needs Water?** | **Has Wings?** | **Where It Lives** |\n     |-----------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n     | Dragonfly | YES | YES | Near water |\n     | Fish | YES (lives in it) | NO | In water |\n     | Frog | YES | NO | Near water |\n     | Bird | Sometimes | YES | Different places |\n\n2. **Application Task: \"Design a Dragonfly Home\"**\n   - Give each student or small group a large piece of paper with an outlined area\n   - Ask: \"Draw a home for a dragonfly. Remember: dragonflies need water. They also need plants to rest on. What else might they need?\" (Accept all reasonable answers)\n   - Students draw and label their habitat with teacher support\n   - Encourage them to include: water, plants, a place to rest\n\n3. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Ask guiding questions: \"Where's the water in your drawing?\", \"Where will the dragonfly rest?\", \"What could it eat here?\"\n   - Affirm thinking: \"You remembered that dragonflies need water!\"\n\n4. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students apply knowledge by creating a dragonfly habitat\n   - Students demonstrate understanding that dragonflies need water and plants\n   - Students explain their choices (e.g., \"I drew a pond because dragonflies need water\")\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of dragonfly needs and body parts.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage and Explore phases\n- Listen to explanations during Explain phase\n- Document what students can point to and describe using the checklist below\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nAsk each student these 2–3 questions (one-on-one or small group, depending on your classroom):\n\n1. **Show the photograph and ask:** \"Tell me two things this dragonfly needs to survive.\" (Acceptable answers: water, food, a place to rest, air)\n\n2. **Point to a body part in the photo and ask:** \"What is this part? What does it help the dragonfly do?\" (Acceptable answers may include: wings help it fly, eyes help it see, long body holds it together)\n\n3. **Ask:** \"Where do dragonflies live? Why do they live there?\" (Acceptable answer: near water because they need water)\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n\n✓ **Objective 1 (Identify body parts):** Student points to and names at least 2 dragonfly body parts (wings, eyes, legs, long body)\n\n✓ **Objective 2 (Explain water need):** Student states that dragonflies \"need water\" or \"live near water\" when asked why\n\n✓ **Objective 3 (Connect body parts to function):** Student makes one connection between a body part and what it does (e.g., \"wings help it fly\")\n\n✓ **Objective 4 (Recognize habitat match):** Student identifies water/pond as dragonfly habitat and attempts to explain why\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding of at least 2–3 learning objectives\n- 80%+ of students can name water as something dragonflies need\n- Most students can point to and identify wings and eyes\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Use only \"wings,\" \"eyes,\" and \"water\" if needed. Build to other terms over time.\n\n2. **Provide sentence frames:** \n   - \"A dragonfly needs ___________.\"\n   - \"The __________ helps the dragonfly ___________.\"\n   - Have these written and available for students to point to or repeat\n\n3. **Use hand-over-hand guidance during Explore:** \n   - Physically point together at body parts in the photo\n   - Color-code body parts in the diagram (e.g., all wings one color, all legs another) to reduce confusion\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extend investigation:** \n   - Ask: \"What other animals live near water? Do they look like dragonflies? How are they different?\"\n   - Introduce the term \"insect\" and ask: \"How many legs do insects have? Count the dragonfly's legs.\"\n\n2. **Deeper comparison:**\n   - Provide pictures of dragonfly nymphs (water stage) and adults (flying stage)\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think baby dragonflies live in the water, but grown-up dragonflies fly in the air?\"\n\n3. **Research prompt:**\n   - \"Dragonflies eat other small insects. What do you think they need to eat? How do their big eyes and fast wings help them catch food?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Dragonfly Life Cycle Visual Timeline**\n   - Create a simple 4-step chart: Egg → Nymph (in water) → Changing → Flying Adult\n   - Have students draw or place pictures on the timeline\n   - Read a simple book about dragonfly life cycles (e.g., *From Tadpole to Dragonfly* by Debbie Bliss or similar)\n\n2. **Water Habitat Diorama**\n   - Provide a shoebox or paper bag\n   - Students create a dragonfly habitat inside: water (blue paper), plants (green construction paper), rocks (painted rocks)\n   - Place a toy/model dragonfly in the habitat\n   - Display and label with \"Dragonflies Need: Water, Plants, Food\"\n\n3. **Observational Nature Walk**\n   - Take students to a nearby pond, stream, or water feature (if available and safe)\n   - Look for dragonflies or other water insects with binoculars\n   - Sketch what you see; discuss how this habitat has everything dragonflies need\n   - Back in class, create a class mural of \"What We Saw at the Water\"\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is scaffolded to meet Kindergarteners at their level of concrete, observational learning while building foundational life science understanding.**",
