ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital projection of the mourning dove photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: binoculars or magnifying glasses to create excitement\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Let students observe silently for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Ask students to turn and talk** with a partner: *\"What living things do you see in this picture? What do you think they need to survive?\"*\n\n3. **Facilitate a whole-group discussion** using these guiding questions:\n   - *\"How many different living things can you spot? What are they?\"* (Students should identify: bird, green plants, soil, yellow flowers, grass, possibly insects or decomposers in the soil)\n   - *\"Why do you think the dove is in this garden? What might it be looking for?\"* (Food, shelter, water)\n   - *\"What do the plants need to grow? Where do they get those things?\"* (Water from the soil, sunlight, nutrients)\n   - *\"How do you think the dove and the plants are connected?\"* (Accept all responses—this activates schema)\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** *\"If all the plants disappeared from this garden tomorrow, what would happen to the dove? Let's investigate to find out.\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to become garden detectives. We'll discover how the plants and animals in this garden depend on each other to survive.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how plants and animals interact in an ecosystem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small bags of potting soil (one per pair or small group)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- White paper or paper towels (for sorting observations)\n- Pictures or illustrations of: plant roots, plant leaves, seeds, insects, decomposers (earthworms, fungi)\n- Optional: live earthworm(s) in a clear container, or pre-made soil sample with visible organisms\n- Observation worksheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Exploring Soil (What do plants need?)**\n\n1. **Distribute a small bag of potting soil to each pair.** Ask students: *\"What's in this soil? What do you think helps plants grow?\"*\n\n2. **Using hand lenses, students should:**\n   - Break apart the soil gently and observe the particles\n   - Look for evidence of decomposers (worms, insects, dark organic material)\n   - Identify different textures (sand, clay, organic matter)\n   - Record observations on the worksheet: *\"Draw or write what you found in the soil.\"*\n\n3. **Ask:** *\"Where does the dark stuff in soil come from? Why would plants need it?\"* (Guide toward: dead plants and animals break down, making nutrients)\n\n**Part B: Connecting Garden Organisms (What eats what?)**\n\n1. **Display picture cards** of different garden organisms: plant leaf, flower, seed, insect, earthworm, bird, decomposer/fungus.\n\n2. **Ask students to arrange the cards in order** by answering: *\"If this bird eats seeds, what do seeds come from? What do plants need to make seeds?\"*\n\n3. **Students should arrange a simple chain:** Sun → Plant (with roots in soil, leaves in air) → Bird\n\n4. **Students sketch and label their chain** on the worksheet with arrows showing how matter/energy flows.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask clarifying questions: *\"Why do you think the plant is at the beginning? What does the bird need from the plant?\"*\n- Do NOT correct or lead students to right answer—let them hypothesize.\n- Encourage observations with lenses: *\"What do you notice about the decomposers in the soil?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify soil components and recognize that soil contains organic matter (dead stuff).\n- Students begin to see a chain: plants need soil/water/sun, animals eat plants or seeds, decomposers break down dead material.\n- Incomplete or imperfect chains are acceptable—refinement happens in Explain phase.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts; clarify misconceptions from Explore.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Poster or slide with key vocabulary\n- Photograph on screen for reference\n- Hand lenses (for closer look at plant parts in photo, if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Invite 2–3 pairs to share their organism chains. Write them on chart paper without judgment.\n\n2. **Clarify and build vocabulary:**\n   - *\"You did amazing detective work! Let me introduce some scientist words for what you discovered.\"*\n\n3. **Co-create a visual definition** for each term (draw simple pictures on chart paper):\n\n**Vocabulary (Student-Friendly Definitions):**\n\n- **Producer:** A living thing that makes its own food using sunlight, air, and water. *Example: plants and flowers.* (Draw a plant with sun and water arrows pointing to it)\n\n- **Consumer:** A living thing that eats plants or other animals for food because it cannot make its own food. *Example: the dove eats seeds; the earthworm eats dead plant matter.* (Draw bird eating seeds)\n\n- **Decomposer:** A living thing that breaks down dead plants and animals, returning nutrients to the soil so new plants can grow. *Example: earthworms, fungi, bacteria.* (Draw worm and soil)\n\n- **Ecosystem:** All the living things in an area plus the non-living things (soil, water, sunlight) they need. *Example: this garden is an ecosystem.* (Draw the whole garden)\n\n- **Food Chain:** The path that shows how energy moves from producers to consumers. *Example: Sun → Plant → Bird.* (Draw arrows between)\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - *\"Look at our dove again. It's a consumer. What producer does it depend on?\"* (Plants—seeds, berries)\n   - *\"Where do the plants get what they need?\"* (Roots in soil for water and nutrients; leaves in air for sunlight and carbon dioxide; light from the sun)\n   - *\"What happens to a dead leaf? Who breaks it down?\"* (Decomposers turn it into soil nutrients)\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Hold up pictures of organisms and ask: *\"Is this a producer or consumer? How do you know?\"*\n   - Scenario: *\"If there were no earthworms in the soil, what would happen to the plants?\"* (Expect: dead stuff wouldn't break down, soil wouldn't have nutrients, plants couldn't grow, dove would have no food)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can label organisms as producers, consumers, or decomposers.\n- Students understand that plants get materials from air, water, and soil.\n- Students see the connection: matter (nutrients, energy) flows from soil → plants → animals → back to soil.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to model a food chain and predict ecosystem changes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or poster board (one per pair/group)\n- Colored pencils, markers, crayons\n- Optional: yarn or string to show energy flow\n- Pictures or clipart of garden organisms\n- Scenario cards (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Create an Ecosystem Model**\n\n1. **In pairs or small groups, students draw a detailed garden ecosystem** showing:\n   - Sun (top)\n   - Plants with visible roots in soil\n   - At least two consumers (bird, insect, etc.)\n   - Decomposers in soil\n   - Arrows showing movement of: water, sunlight, nutrients, food\n\n2. **Students label each organism as producer or consumer** and write one sentence for each explaining its role. *Example: \"The plant is a producer. It makes food from sunlight and water.\"*\n\n3. **Optional: Use string or yarn to trace energy flow** from sun through plants to animals.\n\n**Part B: Predict & Problem-Solve**\n\n1. **Present scenario cards** (one per group). Examples:\n   - *\"What if all the plants died in the garden? What would happen to the dove?\"*\n   - *\"What if there were no earthworms to break down dead leaves? What would the soil look like?\"*\n   - *\"Why do farmers add compost (decayed plants) to their gardens?\"*\n\n2. **Students discuss** and write/draw a prediction with reasoning.\n\n3. **Gallery walk:** Post models around room. Students observe peers' work and notice similarities/differences.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group discussions with prompts: *\"Why did you draw the arrow that way? Where is the energy coming from?\"*\n- Guide without correcting: *\"Tell me your thinking about what would happen...\"*\n- Reinforce vocabulary: *\"You said plants need water—where does that water go in your model?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Models show understanding that producers, consumers, and decomposers interact.\n- Arrows or descriptions show matter/energy movement.\n- Predictions demonstrate cause-and-effect thinking: *\"If X is gone, then Y happens because...\"*\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of ecosystems, food chains, and plant needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe hand lens observations in Explore phase; note which students can identify soil components.\n- Listen to pair/group discussions in Elaborate phase; ask: *\"Why did you put the arrow there? How does that organism get food?\"*\n- Review organism cards from Explain phase: Can students classify as producer/consumer/decomposer with reasoning?\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\nDistribute an index card or half-sheet with the following prompts. Students can draw, write, or both.\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Look at this picture of a plant.** (Show simple plant diagram) **Where does it get water? Where does it get energy from the sun? Label your answers.**\n\n2. **Draw a simple food chain with three organisms from a garden. Use arrows to show the direction energy flows.** (Expect: Sun → Plant → Animal, or similar)\n\n3. **Finish this sentence: The soil is important to a garden ecosystem because ___________________.**\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ **Plant needs (5-LS1-1):** Student correctly identifies that plants get water from soil/roots and energy/light from sun. Diagrams show roots in soil, leaves toward sun.\n\n- ✓ **Food chain (5-LS2-1):** Student draws a 3-part chain with arrows pointing toward the consumer (showing energy direction). Organisms are appropriate for a garden (plant, insect, bird, etc.).\n\n- ✓ **Ecosystem understanding:** Student explains soil's role: *\"Soil has nutrients for plants,\"* *\"Earthworms break down dead plants,\"* or *\"Soil holds water for roots.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- **Proficient:** Student answers 2–3 prompts accurately, showing understanding that plants need air, water, and sunlight; can model a basic food chain; and explains ecosystem interconnections.\n\n- **Developing:** Student partially answers prompts; may show a food chain but miss arrow direction; explains one plant need.\n\n- **Emerging:** Student's responses show limited connection between organisms or plant needs; may need one-on-one clarification.\n\n**Follow-up:** Collect exit tickets. Use data to identify students needing reteaching (Differentiaton: Support section) and those ready for extensions.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Organism Cards:** Provide only 3–4 large, labeled pictures (plant, earthworm, bird, sun) instead of complex scenarios. Ask: *\"Which one makes food? Which one eats?\"* Focus on producer-consumer relationship first; introduce decomposers later.\n\n2. **Soil Exploration Scaffold:** Pre-identify items in soil (dark bits, light bits, maybe a small worm). Ask: *\"What do you think this dark stuff is? Could it have been a leaf once?\"* Guide observation with yes/no questions rather than open exploration.\n\n3. **Model Templates:** Provide a partially drawn ecosystem model (sun, soil, outlined plants). Student adds and labels animals, arrows, and labels. Reduces cognitive load of creating from scratch.\n\n4. **Exit Ticket Modifications:** Offer multiple-choice or matching options: *\"The plant gets water from: (a) the sun, (b) the soil, (c) the air.\"* Allow drawings only if writing is a barrier.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Complex Food Webs:** Instead of simple chains, ask: *\"What if the dove eats both seeds AND insects? Draw a food web showing all the connections.\"* Introduce branching energy paths and discuss energy loss at each level.\n\n2. **Decomposition Investigation:** Design a mini-experiment: *\"Bury dead leaves in soil and compare them to leaves left on top. Predict and test which decomposes faster. Why?\"* Record observations over a week.\n\n3. **Ecological Scenarios:** Present real-world problems: *\"A pest eats all the garden plants. What could happen? How might farmers solve this without harming the ecosystem?\"* Encourage systems thinking.\n\n4. **Research Extension:** *\"Choose one decomposer (earthworm, fungus, bacteria) and research how it breaks down dead matter. Create an infographic explaining its role in the ecosystem.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Backyard Ecosystem Investigation:** Students observe a real garden, outdoor space, or potted plant area. Record 5–10 organisms visible. Create a field guide with drawings and descriptions of roles. *Connects to: real-world observation, citizen science.*\n\n2. **Compost Lab:** Set up a small compost jar or pile (leaves, vegetable scraps, soil, water). Predict and observe decomposition over 2–3 weeks. Compare a sealed jar (no decomposers) with an open jar (decomposers present). Record changes weekly. *Connects to: decomposition, experimental design, 5-LS2-1.*\n\n3. **Garden Design Project:** Students design their own garden ecosystem on paper. Include producers (flowers, vegetables), consumers (insects, birds), and plan where to add compost for decomposers. Write captions explaining why each organism is included and what role it plays. *Connects to: systems thinking, application of concepts.*\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Real garden connection:** If your school has a garden or outdoor space, this lesson is ideal for field observations during Explore. Even observing a potted plant and soil sample works well indoors.\n- **Safety:** If using live earthworms or organisms, ensure students handle gently. Remind: *\"Living things deserve respect. Observe carefully, then return gently.\"*\n- **Vocabulary reinforcement:** Create a class \"Ecosystem Word Wall\" with student-drawn definitions. Refer to it daily for one week.\n- **Photograph anchor:** Return to the dove photograph multiple times (Explore, Explain, Elaborate) to reinforce: *\"Remember our garden detective picture? Let's see what else we can discover.\"*\n\n---\n\nThis lesson scaffolds students from observation (Engage/Explore) through vocabulary and models (Explain/Elaborate) to application and assessment (Evaluate), meeting both NGSS standards through hands-on, photograph-inspired inquiry.",
