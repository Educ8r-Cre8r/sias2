ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color photograph of the cicada (8.5\" × 11\" or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and marker (for recording \"I notice, I wonder\" observations)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or as a large print. Do NOT label the insect yet. Show the image and say: \"I found something amazing on a plant branch. Let's look at it together very carefully.\"\n\n2. **Ask students to observe silently** for 15–20 seconds. They should look at colors, shapes, and parts.\n\n3. **Facilitate discovery with these specific questions:**\n   - *\"What do you see on this creature? Point to it without touching the screen.\"* (Allow students to gesture and describe legs, wings, body, etc.)\n   - *\"How many legs do you think this animal has? Count them with me.\"* (Model counting aloud.)\n   - *\"What do you notice about the wings? What color are they?\"*\n   - *\"Where is this animal sitting? What is it holding onto?\"*\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** *\"I wonder... what do you think this animal uses its legs for? What about its wings? Why might it have such big eyes?\"* Write student responses on chart paper under \"I Wonder About This Insect.\"\n\n5. **Personal connection:** *\"Have you ever seen an insect on a plant or tree? What was it doing?\"* Allow 2–3 students to share briefly.\n\n**Transition:** \"Scientists ask questions about how animals use their body parts to stay alive. Let's be scientists and discover how this insect uses its special parts!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Per pair or small group:**\n  - 1 hand lens or magnifying glass\n  - Images of 3–4 different insects (printed on cards or in simple picture books): ant, butterfly, beetle, grasshopper\n  - Large sheet of paper divided into 4 sections with simple labels: \"Legs,\" \"Wings,\" \"Eyes/Head,\" \"Other Parts\"\n  - Colored pencils or crayons\n  - (Optional) Live insects in clear containers with air holes—if available and ethically collected; otherwise, use photographs only\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs or small groups of 3.**\n\n2. **Distribute materials.** Give each group one insect image and a hand lens.\n\n3. **Student task (read aloud and display on chart paper):**\n   - *\"Look closely at your insect with the hand lens. Draw or point to each body part you see.\"*\n   - *\"On your paper, draw circles around the legs. Count them.\"*\n   - *\"Draw circles around the wings (if you see them).\"*\n   - *\"Point to the head and eyes. What color are they?\"*\n   - *\"Look for any other special parts—like a long nose for drinking or a smooth surface for hiding.\"*\n\n4. **Teacher circulates and asks guiding questions (without answering):**\n   - *\"What body parts does your insect have?\"*\n   - *\"How many legs are touching the plant or ground?\"*\n   - *\"Do all insects have the same number of legs? How do you know?\"*\n   - *\"Why might the wings be so thin and see-through?\"*\n\n5. **Documentation:** Students record observations by:\n   - Drawing the insect and labeling visible parts\n   - Making a tally mark for each leg they count\n   - Coloring the wings and noting the color\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe and record at least 3–4 external body parts of their assigned insect.\n- Students will discover that insects have legs, wings (sometimes), eyes, and a body.\n- Students will notice similarities between insects (all have multiple legs, most have eyes).\n- Students will produce a labeled drawing or annotated diagram of their insect.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary list\n- The original cicada photograph (large format)\n- Picture cards of insects doing activities (feeding, flying, gripping, walking)\n- Markers in multiple colors\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on the carpet with the photograph visible.**\n\n2. **Share discoveries from Explore phase:**\n   - *\"Let's tell each other what we found! What body parts did you see?\"* Call on 3–4 students to share one observation each.\n   - Record responses on chart paper under \"Body Parts We Found.\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary with First Grade-friendly definitions** (point to each part on the cicada photo as you define):\n   - **Legs:** Parts that stick out from the body and help the animal hold on, walk, and climb. *\"Our cicada has six legs. Count them with me on the picture!\"*\n   - **Wings:** Thin, flat parts that help the animal fly through the air. *\"See these beautiful clear wings? They help the cicada get from one plant to another.\"*\n   - **Eyes:** Special parts on the head that help the animal see. *\"Insects have big eyes to watch for danger and find food.\"*\n   - **Antennae:** Two long, thin parts on the head that help the animal feel and sense things. *\"Antennae are like feelers—they help insects know what's around them.\"*\n   - **Insect:** A small animal with six legs, a body with three sections, and usually wings.\n\n4. **Make connections:**\n   - *\"Why do you think this cicada has such strong legs?\"* (To grip the branch so it doesn't fall.)\n   - *\"What do the wings help it do?\"* (Fly to new plants to eat.)\n   - *\"Look at the photograph again. The cicada is on a plant branch. How do the legs, wings, and eyes work together to help it survive?\"* (Guide students to see that legs grip while wings help escape, eyes find food, etc.)\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show picture cards of insects doing actions (ant carrying food, butterfly flying, grasshopper jumping).\n   - *\"Point to the body part that helps this insect [do the action].\"*\n   - Ask 3–4 students to respond.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Legs** | Parts of the body that help animals walk, hold on, and climb. |\n| **Wings** | Thin parts that help animals fly. |\n| **Eyes** | Parts that help animals see. |\n| **Antennae** | Long feelers on the head that help animals sense things. |\n| **Insect** | A very small animal with six legs and a body (often with wings). |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use at least 3 of the new vocabulary words correctly in simple sentences.\n- Students will be able to point to or describe a body part and explain what it helps the insect do.\n- Students will understand that external body parts have specific jobs that help insects survive.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards showing human activities (picking up objects, climbing, reaching far, running)\n- Building materials (pipe cleaners, straws, cardboard tubes, tape, craft sticks, clothespins, rubber bands)\n- Pre-drawn simple hand outline on paper (for each student)\n- Real-world problem: *\"How can we pick up small objects like a cicada's legs grip a branch?\"*\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Insect Design Challenge (recommended for this lesson)**\n\n1. **Present a human problem:** *\"We have five pencils on a table, and our hands are tied behind our backs. How can we pick them up? Let's think like the cicada!\"*\n\n2. **Show the cicada's legs:** *\"The cicada has six legs with claws. The claws grip and hold onto things. Can we make something that grips like cicada legs?\"*\n\n3. **Student task:**\n   - In pairs, students design a **gripper tool** using pipe cleaners, straw, tape, and craft sticks.\n   - They test it: Can it pick up a small object like a pencil, block, or pom-pom?\n   - They compare their design to the cicada's legs: *\"How are they the same? How are they different?\"*\n\n4. **Teacher role:**\n   - Ask guiding questions: *\"What did the cicada use to grip? How can we copy that idea?\"*\n   - Encourage testing and redesigning if the first attempt doesn't work.\n   - Celebrate attempts and improvements.\n\n**Option B: Compare and Contrast (if materials are limited)**\n\n1. **Give each student a picture of a human hand and a cicada leg (or show the photograph).**\n\n2. **Student task:**\n   - Draw or dictate to teacher: How are a human hand and a cicada leg the same? How are they different?\n   - Complete this sentence: *\"My hand can ___, and a cicada leg can ___.\"*\n\n3. **Share-out:** Call on 3–4 students to share one similarity or difference.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate exploration without correcting designs.\n- Ask: *\"What happens when you try to pick up that object? Do your gripper legs work like cicada legs?\"*\n- Encourage persistence: *\"That didn't work. What could you try next?\"*\n- Validate all attempts as scientific thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create or describe a tool/idea inspired by an insect's body part.\n- Students will test and observe their design working (or identify why it needs adjustment).\n- Students will explain the connection between the insect's body part and their design.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of insect body parts and their functions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist:** During Explore and Elaborate, note whether students:\n  - ✓ Can identify at least 3 body parts on an insect\n  - ✓ Can explain what one body part does\n  - ✓ Can compare their body to an insect's body\n\n- **Question prompts during discussion:**\n  - *\"Show me a leg on the insect. What does it do?\"*\n  - *\"Why do you think cicadas need wings?\"*\n  - *\"How is a cicada's body different from yours?\"*\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n\nChoose one format based on student ability:\n\n**Format 1: Draw and Label (Recommended for emerging writers)**\n- Provide a large outline drawing of an insect (or cicada).\n- Students label or point to 3 body parts: legs, wings, head.\n- Teacher records student's verbal explanation: *\"What does this part help the insect do?\"*\n\n**Format 2: Simple Written Response (For students ready for writing)**\n- *\"Draw or write: What body part does a cicada use to hold onto a plant branch?\"*\n- *\"Name one way an insect's body is different from your body.\"*\n\n**Format 3: Picture Sort (For visual learners)**\n- Show 4 picture cards of insects doing activities.\n- Student points to the body part being used (legs/wings/eyes).\n- Teacher records choices and accuracy.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n✓ Student identifies at least **2 insect body parts correctly**.\n✓ Student explains what **at least 1 body part does** (may be verbal, drawing, or pointing).\n✓ Student makes **at least 1 comparison** between insect and human body parts.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will successfully identify legs and wings on an insect.\n- Most students will explain that legs help grip/climb and wings help fly.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that insects and humans have different body parts for different purposes.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Scaffolding for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce complexity during Explore:**\n   - Assign only ONE insect image to each pair (not multiple insects to compare).\n   - Use a hand lens to magnify the image; point to each part yourself first, then have the student repeat after you.\n   - Simplify the recording sheet to just 2 body parts (legs and wings) instead of 4.\n\n2. **Provide sentence frames for explanation:**\n   - *\"I see ___. It helps the insect ___.\"*\n   - *\"Legs look like ___. I use ___ to do the same thing.\"*\n\n3. **Use real or model insects if available:**\n   - Provide a plastic toy insect or a safely contained live insect so students can point directly rather than interpreting a photo.\n\n### Challenge (Extensions for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Compare multiple insect types in depth:**\n   - Give advanced students images of 4–5 different insects (ant, fly, beetle, grasshopper, butterfly).\n   - Task: *\"Sort these insects by how many legs they have. Do they all have the same number?\"* (Guide them to discover all insects have 6 legs.)\n   - *\"Do all insects have wings? Which ones don't? Why might some insects not have wings?\"*\n\n2. **Research a specific insect's adaptations:**\n   - Provide a simple fact sheet about one insect (e.g., *\"A grasshopper's back legs are very strong. It uses them to jump very high.\"*)\n   - Task: *\"Draw or tell how a grasshopper's legs are special. How are they different from other insects' legs?\"*\n\n3. **Engineer a more complex solution:**\n   - During Elaborate, challenge students to build a tool with multiple \"body parts\" (e.g., a gripper with a moving arm AND a container to hold items).\n   - Task: *\"Can you make your cicada-inspired tool do TWO things at once, like real cicada legs can?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Insect Scavenger Hunt (In-class or homework):**\n   - Provide students with a simple picture checklist of 4 insects (ant, butterfly, beetle, ladybug).\n   - Task: *\"Find pictures of these insects in magazines, books, or online (with a parent). Cut them out and glue them on your poster. Label one body part on each insect.\"*\n   - This reinforces vocabulary and extends learning beyond the cicada.\n\n2. **Compare Young and Adult Insects (connects to 1-LS3-1):**\n   - Show photographs of a young insect (nymph or larva) and its adult form side-by-side (e.g., dragonfly nymph and adult dragonfly, or cicada nymph and adult cicada).\n   - Task: *\"How are they the same? How are they different? The young one doesn't have wings yet. Why might that be?\"*\n   - This introduces the concept that young and adult animals are similar but not identical.\n\n3. **Body Part Function Gallery Walk:**\n   - Post 4 large pictures around the room, each showing an insect or insect body part.\n   - Under each picture, write a function question: *\"What does this help the insect do?\"*\n   - Students walk around, observe, and write or draw their answers on sticky notes.\n   - Debrief together to review correct answers.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** If using live insects, ensure containers have adequate airflow and insects are released unharmed after observation. Consult school policy.\n- **Accessibility:** Have printed and digital versions of the cicada photograph available. Use large fonts and high-contrast images for students with vision needs.\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Use the new vocabulary words consistently throughout the lesson. Students need multiple exposures to retain new terms.\n- **Real-World Connection:** If possible, take students outside to observe insects on plants. Discuss the body parts they see and how the insect is using them (gripping, flying, feeding).\n- **Assessment Flexibility:** Accept drawings, verbal responses, pointing, and writing as valid evidence of understanding based on student developmental level.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly grounds itself in the cicada photograph, uses concrete, observable features (legs, wings, antennae) to teach how body structures support survival, and progresses from observation to explanation to application—a true 5E experience for First Grade learners.",
