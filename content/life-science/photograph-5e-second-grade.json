Identify and describe different plants and animals that live in a forest habitat.\n2. Explain why forests are good homes for plants and animals.\n3. Observe and compare the needs of plants (sunlight, water, soil) using evidence from the forest photograph and classroom investigations.\n4. Create a simple drawing or model showing how plants and animals live together in a forest habitat.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about forest habitats using the aerial forest photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected copy of the forest photograph (enlarged for whole-class viewing)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Display and Introduction:**\nDisplay the photograph prominently so all students can see it clearly. Say: \"Today we're going on an adventure to explore a very special place. Look at this picture—what do you see?\"\n\n**Discussion Questions (calibrated for Second Grade):**\n1. \"What color do you see the most in this picture? Why do you think there's so much green?\"\n2. \"Do you see any animals in this picture? Where do you think they might be hiding?\"\n3. \"What kinds of plants can you point to? Are they all the same size?\"\n4. \"Why do you think this place would be a good home for animals and plants?\"\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n\"I wonder what animals live in all these trees and plants. Can you think of an animal that would make its home here? Draw it and tell your partner why it would like to live in this forest.\"\n\nHave 4-5 students share their ideas. Record their predictions on chart paper titled \"What Lives in the Forest?\" to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \n\"Great predictions! Now let's become forest explorers and discover what plants need to grow big and strong like the trees in this photograph.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant growth needs through hands-on experimentation, discovering that plants need sunlight and water.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4 small potted bean plants (pre-planted 1 week prior, or use fast-sprouting seeds in clear cups with soil)\n- Water in cups\n- Labels and markers\n- A dark closet, cabinet, or covered box\n- A sunny windowsill\n- Paper towels and a spray bottle with water\n- Observation journals or clipboards with paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Setup (Teacher-led with student participation):**\n   - Show students the 4 bean plants. Explain: \"We're going to be plant scientists. We're going to find out what plants need to grow.\"\n   - Label the plants:\n     - **Plant A:** Sunny windowsill, water daily\n     - **Plant B:** Dark closet, water daily\n     - **Plant C:** Sunny windowsill, NO water\n     - **Plant D:** Control (the \"perfect\" home—sunny + water daily)\n\n   **Teacher Note:** Plant C may wilt quickly. Monitor daily and be ready to \"rescue\" it on day 2 if needed to prevent student distress, then explain that the plant was thirsty.\n\n2. **Student Tasks:**\n   - In small groups, students will care for the plants by:\n     - Watering Plants A, B, and D each day (use measured water)\n     - Checking on Plant C without watering it\n     - Drawing pictures of each plant every 2-3 days in observation journals\n     - Measuring (with teacher help) the height of new growth using paper clips or craft sticks\n     - Noting the color and condition of leaves: Are they green and strong or pale and droopy?\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:**\n   - Point back to the forest photo: \"Just like the trees in this forest photo get sunlight and rain, our plants need these things too. Let's see what happens when they don't!\"\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Students draw pictures and write/dictate observations: \"Plant A looks ___. Plant B looks ___. Plant C looks ___.\"\n   - Create a simple chart showing which plants look healthy.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without revealing the outcome. Ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about Plant B in the dark? Why do you think it looks different?\" \n- Help students measure and record data.\n- Encourage observations rather than conclusions: \"Tell me what you see, not what you think yet.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe visible differences in plant growth (Plant D grows best; Plant C wilts; Plant B becomes pale/weak).\n- Students record observations through drawings and simple descriptions.\n- Students begin to recognize that sunlight and water affect plant survival.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The four experimental plants from Explore phase\n- Forest photograph\n- Picture cards of forest animals (optional: squirrel, bird, deer, insect—simple clip art or drawings)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\nGather students in a circle with the four plants visible. Ask:\n- \"What did we discover? Which plants grew the best and why?\"\n- \"What did plants A, B, C, and D need?\"\n- Record student responses on chart paper.\n\n**Introduce Key Vocabulary (with Second Grade-friendly definitions):**\n\n1. **Habitat** - A place where plants and animals live. It has everything they need to survive, like food, water, and shelter. (Point to forest photo: \"This forest is a habitat.\")\n\n2. **Sunlight** - Light and warmth from the sun. Plants need sunlight to make food and grow strong. (Point to sunny plants vs. dark plants.)\n\n3. **Water** - A liquid that plants drink through their roots to stay healthy and grow. (Show watered vs. dried plant.)\n\n4. **Forest** - A large area covered with many trees and plants. Many animals make their homes there. (Reference the aerial photo.)\n\n5. **Survive** - To stay alive and healthy. Plants and animals need the right habitat to survive. (Example: \"The plant in the dark couldn't survive because it had no sunlight.\")\n\n**Connection to Photograph:**\n\"In this forest photograph, there are thousands of plants that get plenty of sunlight and rain. That's why all the trees are so big and green. The forest is a perfect habitat for trees because they can get what they need!\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\nAsk students to show \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs sideways\" to questions:\n- \"Do plants need sunlight to grow?\" (Thumbs up = yes)\n- \"Can plants grow without water?\" (Thumbs sideways = some confusion; clarify)\n- \"Is a dark closet a good habitat for a plant?\" (Thumbs down = no)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name 3 things plants need to survive (sunlight, water, soil).\n- Students understand that a habitat must have what an organism needs to live.\n- Students can connect the forest photo to the concept of habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a forest habitat for a real or imaginary animal.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Shoe boxes or small containers\n- Construction paper, tissue paper, craft materials (twigs, leaves, soil if available)\n- Pictures of forest animals (or students draw their own)\n- Markers, glue, scissors\n- Printed \"Animal Needs\" cards (simple cards listing: food, water, shelter, sunlight)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Forest Habitat Design Challenge:**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:**\n   \"We learned that forests are habitats for plants and animals. Now YOU are going to design a forest habitat for an animal. You get to choose an animal that lives in a forest. What does it need to live there?\"\n\n2. **Student Steps:**\n   - **Choose an animal:** Real (squirrel, bird, fox) or imaginary. Younger/struggling students can choose from a provided list.\n   - **Identify needs:** Using the \"Animal Needs\" cards, students sort and select what their animal needs.\n   - **Build the habitat:** Using a shoe box as the base, students create a habitat that includes:\n     - Trees or plants (rolled paper, twigs, or drawn)\n     - A shelter or hiding place (box, tube, or drawn)\n     - Water (drawn or blue paper)\n     - Food (drawn or craft material)\n     - Sunlight (yellow paper or window cutout)\n   - **Label and explain:** Students label their creations and tell/write one sentence: \"My animal [name] lives in this forest because it has ___, ___, and ___.\"\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:**\n   \"Look at the real forest photo. Your habitat should have some of the same things that the real forest has—trees, sunlight, water, and places to hide. Does yours?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Why did you add that? What does your animal need it for?\"\n- Support students in making connections between their habitat and the real forest.\n- Encourage creativity while ensuring basic needs are represented.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a labeled habitat model that includes sunlight, water, plants/shelter, and food.\n- Students can explain (verbally or in writing) why their habitat is a good home for their chosen animal.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that habitats must meet an organism's survival needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitats, plant needs, and biodiversity.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Are students recording plant changes? Do they notice differences?\n- Questions during Explain: Can students identify plant needs?\n- Circulating during Elaborate: Are habitats functional and thoughtfully designed?\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple drawing or use the questions below. Students can draw, dictate to an adult, or write:\n\n1. **Draw or tell:** \"Draw a forest. Show one plant and one animal. Label what the plant needs: sunlight, water, soil.\"\n\n2. **Multiple choice or verbal:**\n   - \"What does a plant need to grow? (a) only dirt (b) sunlight and water (c) just water\"\n   - Correct answer: **(b) sunlight and water**\n\n3. **Short answer (dictated or written):**\n   - \"Why is a forest a good habitat for trees?\" \n   - *Success criterion: Student mentions at least one of: sunlight, water, soil, rain, or protection.*\n\n**Success Criteria for Mastery:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least 2 plant needs (sunlight, water, soil)\n- ✓ Student can describe a habitat as a place with what an animal or plant needs\n- ✓ Student can name or draw 1-2 animals that live in forests\n- ✓ Student explains why the forest in the photo is a good habitat (mentions plants, sunlight, water, or animals)\n\n**How to Determine if Learning Objectives Were Met:**\n- Review exit tickets and habitat models for evidence of understanding.\n- Listen to student explanations during Elaborate—do they reference plant needs and animal requirements?\n- Revisit the \"What Lives in the Forest?\" chart from Engage. Have students added new animals based on learning?\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visuals:**\n   - Provide picture cards for animal and plant vocabulary instead of words alone.\n   - Use consistent visual icons (☀️ = sunlight, 💧 = water, 🌱 = soil, 🏠 = shelter).\n\n2. **Guided plant observation:**\n   - Pair struggling students with a partner or teacher during plant sketching.\n   - Provide a template with drawings of plants and checkboxes: \"Is it green? Is it growing? Is it droopy?\"\n   - Use pre-drawn plant outlines for students to color rather than requiring original drawings.\n\n3. **Habitat design scaffolding:**\n   - Provide a habitat template or checklist: \"Does your habitat have: [ ] plants [ ] water [ ] hiding place [ ] sunlight?\"\n   - Allow students to use pre-made model trees and animals instead of creating them.\n   - Assign a \"simpler\" animal with fewer needs (e.g., squirrel vs. complex creature).\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Investigate plant growth variables:**\n   - Ask: \"What if we changed the water amount? Or the temperature?\" Design a second mini-experiment.\n   - Have students predict what would happen if a plant got TOO MUCH sunlight or water.\n\n2. **Research forest biodiversity:**\n   - Using picture books or simple websites, students research 3-4 different animals that live in the forest and create a \"Forest Field Guide\" with pictures, names, and one fact about each.\n   - Compare forest habitats to another habitat (pond, desert, grassland)—how are they different?\n\n3. **Complex habitat design:**\n   - Challenge students to create a habitat for TWO animals with different needs (e.g., a squirrel AND a bird).\n   - Add a food chain element: \"What does your animal eat? Does your habitat provide that food?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Plant Detective\" Observation Walk:**\n   - Take students outside (or use a school courtyard or nearby garden). Have them hunt for plants and observe: Where are the sunniest spots? Where is there water or moisture? Which plants look healthiest? Use clipboards to sketch and note findings. Connect back to the experiment: \"Why do you think that plant is healthy?\"\n\n2. **Forest Habitat Diorama Gallery:**\n   - Compile all student shoe-box habitats into a classroom display. Create \"visitor passes\" and have students tour the gallery, writing or drawing one observation about a classmate's habitat. This reinforces observation skills and peer learning.\n\n3. **Story or Diary Activity:**\n   - Students write or dictate a short story from an animal's perspective: \"A Day in My Forest Home.\" Example: \"I am a squirrel. In the morning, I climb the big tree because it gets sunlight. I drink water from the puddle. I hide acorns in the soil.\" This extends vocabulary use and narrative skills while deepening habitat understanding.\n\n4. **Plant Growth Chart**\n   - Continue measuring and graphing the heights of the experimental plants over 2-3 weeks. Create a simple bar graph showing which plants grew the most. Discuss why and revisit the vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n**Timing:**\n- **Session 1:** Engage (10 min) + Explore setup and first observations (20 min) = 30 minutes\n- **Days 2-4:** Daily plant care and observations (5 minutes each day)\n- **Session 2:** Explore data review (5 min) + Explain (15 min) + Elaborate (20 min) + Evaluate (10 min) = 50 minutes\n\n**Pre-Lesson Prep:**\n- Plant bean seeds 5-7 days before Lesson 1 so they've sprouted and are visible but not fully grown by the start of investigations.\n- Prepare the dark location (closet/cabinet) and ensure sunny windowsill access.\n- Print or enlarge the forest photograph; have it visible throughout both sessions.\n- Gather craft materials and shoe boxes in advance.\n\n**Safety Considerations:**\n- Ensure plants are not toxic (beans are safe; verify any other plants).\n- Supervise use of scissors.\n- Use tap water at room temperature for plant watering.\n\n**Inclusive Practices:**\n- Allow non-verbal students to communicate understanding through drawings, gestures, or AAC devices.\n- Pair visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners in small groups.\n- Use real objects (plants, soil, water) alongside pictures for multi-sensory learning.\n\nThis lesson bridges direct observation with abstract concepts, making ecosystem understanding concrete and memorable for Second Grade learners.",
