        "exceeds": "Student explains that dark green color and bumpy texture help the alligator blend in with the swamp environment and identifies this as camouflage; may add that this helps the alligator hide from prey or predators.",
        "meets": "Student correctly identifies that the alligator's dark green, bumpy skin helps it hide or blend in with its swampy surroundings.",
        "approaching": "Student recognizes that the alligator's appearance relates to its environment but explanation is incomplete; may mention color or texture but not both, or state camouflage without clear reasoning.",

      "bloomsLevel": "Analyze",
      "dokLevel": 2,
      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student predicts the alligator would be easily seen because its dark green skin would stand out against white snow, making it difficult to catch food or hide from danger; clearly connects camouflage to survival.",
        "meets": "Student predicts the alligator would be easier to see in a snowy environment and explains this is because its dark color doesn't match the white background.",
        "approaching": "Student makes a prediction about the alligator in snow but reasoning is partial; may say it would be 'hard to see' or 'easy to see' without clear explanation of why.",
        "beginning": "Student provides a response that shows little understanding, such as a vague answer or one unrelated to camouflage or visibility."

      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student identifies at least two animals that use camouflage and explains both similarities (all use color/pattern to blend in) and differences (e.g., some change color, some use stripes vs. solid colors, some hide on land vs. water).",
        "meets": "Student names at least one other camouflaged animal and explains one way it is similar to or different from the alligator's camouflage strategy.",
        "approaching": "Student names an animal that uses camouflage but comparison to the alligator is vague or incomplete; may identify similarity or difference but not both clearly.",

        "meets": "Student designs a camouflaged animal with appropriate colors and/or patterns for the classroom or schoolyard and explains that these features help it blend in with its environment.",
        "approaching": "Student designs an animal with some attempt at camouflage for the chosen environment, but colors/patterns have limited connection to the setting, or explanation of how it survives is unclear.",
        "beginning": "Student attempts to design an animal but camouflage is not connected to the classroom or schoolyard environment, or response lacks specific details about colors and patterns."
