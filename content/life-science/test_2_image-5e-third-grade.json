Identify the physical traits of a dragonfly visible in the photograph and explain how those traits help it survive in its habitat.\n2. Compare the dragonfly's body parts and colors to understand how different traits give animals advantages for catching food and staying safe.\n3. Explain why dragonflies need water and plant habitats to survive and thrive.\n4. Construct an argument using evidence from observations about how the dragonfly's environment shapes its ability to live successfully.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about insects and habitats using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital projection of the dragonfly photograph\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or board where all students can see clearly. Don't reveal the insect's name yet.\n\n2. **Ask these focus questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about this creature? Describe what you see in the picture.\"\n   - \"What colors and shapes do you see? Why do you think this insect has a bright blue color?\"\n   - \"What is this insect doing in this environment? Why is it surrounded by grass and plants?\"\n   - \"Where have you seen insects like this before? What was it doing?\"\n\n3. **Make a prediction prompt:**\n   - \"This insect is called a dragonfly. Before we learn more, what do you predict this insect eats? Where does it live? How does it move?\"\n   - Record student predictions on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n4. **Show the photograph a second time** and ask: \"Look at the wings, the long body, and the color. Why might having these features be helpful for surviving in this grassy area?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore what makes dragonflies such amazing insects and discover how their bodies and their habitats help them survive!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate dragonfly traits and habitats through hands-on observation and data collection.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Copies of the dragonfly photograph (one per student or pair)\n- **Dragonfly Trait Observation Sheet** (teacher-created, see template below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Magnifying glasses (optional)\n- Reference images of different dragonfly species (if available, showing color variation)\n- Real or plastic model insects (optional comparison)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Observe the photograph closely.** You and your partner will become \"dragonfly scientists.\"\n\n2. **Complete your Observation Sheet** by:\n   - Drawing the dragonfly shape and coloring it to match the photograph\n   - Labeling the body parts you can see: head, wings, abdomen (long body), legs\n   - Circling traits in color: \"What color is the dragonfly? What about its wings?\"\n\n3. **Answer these questions on your sheet:**\n   - \"What body parts help a dragonfly fly fast?\"\n   - \"Why might a bright blue color be helpful for this dragonfly?\"\n   - \"What do you see in the background? Why is the dragonfly in this place?\"\n\n4. **Compare two dragonflies** (if you have reference images showing different species or color variations):\n   - \"How are these dragonflies the same?\"\n   - \"How are they different in color or size?\"\n   - \"Why might different dragonflies have different colors?\"\n\n5. **Make a prediction:** \"If a dragonfly lost its wings, could it survive? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"What do you notice about the wing structure?\" \"How does the blue color help this dragonfly hide or be seen?\"\n- Use a magnifying glass with interested students to examine wing detail in close-up photographs.\n- Guide students to observe without providing answers—let them discover connections.\n- Prompt students to discuss with their partner: \"How do you think this habitat helps the dragonfly?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students complete observation sheets identifying dragonfly body parts.\n- Students recognize that wings, body shape, and color are important traits.\n- Students begin to notice connections between the dragonfly's habitat (grasses/plants) and its survival needs.\n- Students produce drawings and written descriptions showing evidence of careful observation.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts about adaptation, traits, and habitat after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words written large\n- Completed student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Large labeled diagram of a dragonfly (teacher-created or commercial poster)\n- Optional: Video clip of dragonfly flying or hunting (60 seconds max)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 student pairs to share one observation from their sheet.\n   - Display their drawings on a board.\n   - Ask the class: \"What do all these dragonflies have in common? What is different?\"\n   - Record responses and connect to trait variation.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7-10 minutes):**\n   - Use the student observations to anchor each term.\n   - **Trait:** A characteristic of a living thing (like blue color, wing shape, or body length). \"This dragonfly has the trait of being bright blue. What other traits do you see?\"\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. \"The dragonfly's wings are an adaptation that helps it fly and catch food quickly.\"\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. \"This dragonfly's habitat is near grass and water where it can rest and hunt.\"\n   - **Variation:** Differences in traits among animals of the same kind. \"Some dragonflies are more blue, some are more green—that's variation.\"\n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals. \"Dragonflies are predators of small insects.\"\n\n3. **Make Connections Back to the Photograph (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the bright blue color: \"This trait helps the dragonfly. How?\"\n     - *Guide to answer:* Blue helps it blend with the sky so other animals can't see it as easily when hunting.\n   - Point to the long wings: \"Why is this adaptation important?\"\n     - *Guide to answer:* Wings help the dragonfly fly super fast to catch insects and escape from birds.\n   - Point to the grassy habitat: \"Why does this dragonfly need this environment?\"\n     - *Guide to answer:* Grass and plants give the dragonfly places to rest and hide, and insects to hunt live there.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Ask students to turn to a partner and answer: \"If we moved the dragonfly to a desert with no water and no grass, could it survive? Why or why not?\"\n   - Listen to responses and clarify misconceptions.\n   - Ask: \"What trait helps the dragonfly catch insects?\" (Answer: fast wings, good eyes)\n   - Ask: \"What is the dragonfly's habitat?\" (Answer: areas with water, grass, and plants)\n\n**Vocabulary List:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Trait** | A characteristic or feature that a living thing has, like color, size, or shape. |\n| **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and succeed in its home. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs to survive: food, water, and shelter. |\n| **Variation** | Differences in how individual animals look or act, even if they are the same kind. |\n| **Predator** | An animal that hunts and eats other animals for food. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use new vocabulary correctly in discussions.\n- Students explain that the dragonfly's blue color, fast wings, and habitat are connected to survival.\n- Students understand that different dragonflies can have different colors (variation) but are still dragonflies.\n- Students recognize that a dragonfly needs its specific habitat (water and plants) to survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by analyzing how habitat and traits work together for survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Habitat Cards** (teacher-created—see examples below)\n- Dragonfly illustration with traits labeled\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Optional: Images of different habitats (pond, desert, forest, city)\n- Student notebooks or worksheet\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Matching Game (15-20 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up the scenario:** \"Imagine there are different dragonfly habitats in our region. Some dragonflies live by ponds, some by rivers, some in marshes. Each habitat has different plants and challenges.\"\n\n2. **Distribute Habitat Cards** (teacher creates 4 different cards):\n   - **Card 1 (Sunny Pond):** Lots of open water, bright sunlight, few plants\n   - **Card 2 (Grassy Marsh):** Tall grass everywhere, plenty of insects, water below\n   - **Card 3 (Shaded Stream):** Dense vegetation, cooler, fewer insects visible\n   - **Card 4 (Dry Field):** No water, mostly dry grass, very few insects\n\n3. **Small group task (3-4 students per group):**\n   - Each group receives one Habitat Card and an illustration of a dragonfly.\n   - Task: \"A dragonfly with bright blue color and fast wings lives in your habitat. Will this dragonfly survive well, survive a little, or struggle to survive? Use evidence to explain.\"\n   - Groups discuss and record their reasoning on chart paper.\n\n4. **Gallery Walk:** Groups post their responses. Class walks and reads, then discusses:\n   - \"Why does the blue dragonfly do well in the sunny pond but struggle in the shaded stream?\"\n   - \"How would a green dragonfly do in each habitat?\"\n   - \"Why are different traits good for different places?\"\n\n**Option B: Design a New Dragonfly (15-20 minutes)**\n\n1. **Present the challenge:** \"Scientists discovered a new environment—a dense, dark forest with very few insects and thick plants. What traits should a dragonfly living there have to survive best?\"\n\n2. **Students sketch and label** their ideal dragonfly for this habitat:\n   - What color would help it hide?\n   - What wing size and shape would work best in a crowded forest?\n   - What body length would help?\n\n3. **Explain their design:** Students write or dictate 2-3 sentences: \"My dragonfly has [trait] because [reason connected to habitat].\"\n\n4. **Share:** Volunteers present their designs and explain how the traits match the habitat.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why did you choose that color? How does it help your dragonfly survive?\"\n- Encourage evidence-based reasoning: \"What in the habitat made you think that?\"\n- Facilitate sharing and discussion without judgment.\n- Connect back to the original photograph: \"How is your designed dragonfly like the one we saw? Different?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students explain connections between specific traits and habitat survival (e.g., \"Blue helps hide in the sky\").\n- Students recognize that the same trait might work well in one habitat but poorly in another.\n- Students create evidence-based arguments: \"This dragonfly would struggle in the desert because...\"\n- Students design realistic adaptations grounded in habitat needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of dragonfly traits, adaptations, habitats, and survival advantages.\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n- Observe student engagement and accuracy during Engage (prior knowledge).\n- Review Observation Sheets from Explore for understanding of dragonfly body parts and traits.\n- Listen to student discussions during vocabulary check-in (Explain): Can they explain why dragonflies need their habitat?\n- Circulate during Elaborate activity and note quality of reasoning in habitat matching and design explanations.\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment:**\n\n**Option A: Quick Response (5-7 minutes)**\n\nProvide students with the dragonfly photograph again and ask them to respond (verbally, written, or drawn):\n\n1. \"Look at this dragonfly. Name two traits you see and explain how each one helps the dragonfly survive.\" (Accept answers like: \"Blue color helps hide,\" \"Long wings help fly fast,\" \"Legs help grab insects.\")\n\n2. \"Why does this dragonfly need grass and water in its habitat? What would happen if we took it to a desert?\"\n\n3. \"Look at the grassy environment in the photo. Why do you think dragonflies survive well here but might not survive in a busy parking lot with no plants?\"\n\n**Option B: Drawing and Explanation (7-10 minutes)**\n\nStudents draw and label:\n- A dragonfly with at least three labeled traits\n- Its habitat (water, grass, plants)\n- One sentence: \"This trait helps the dragonfly survive because...\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Excellent (Exceeds):** Student identifies 2-3 specific traits, clearly explains how each provides a survival advantage, and connects traits to the habitat environment with specific evidence. (Example: \"The blue color helps the dragonfly because it hides in the sky. The fast wings help because they catch insects.\")\n\n✓ **Proficient (Meets):** Student identifies at least 2 dragonfly traits and explains with some clarity how they help survival. Makes a reasonable connection between the dragonfly and its habitat. (Example: \"Blue helps hide. Wings help it fly to catch food. It needs grass and water.\")\n\n✓ **Developing (Approaches):** Student identifies 1-2 traits and offers basic explanations. May need prompting to fully connect traits to survival or habitat. (Example: \"The dragonfly is blue. It has wings. It lives in grass.\")\n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Review Exit Ticket responses and look for evidence of trait identification and survival explanation.\n- Confirm students use vocabulary (trait, adaptation, habitat, variation) appropriately in discussions.\n- Verify students can construct simple arguments with evidence: \"This dragonfly survives here because...\"\n- Observe whether students recognize that habitats matter for survival—organisms cannot live everywhere.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support for Struggling Learners:**\n\n1. **Sentence Frames:** Provide written sentence starters on a reference card:\n   - \"This trait helps because ___________.\"\n   - \"The dragonfly lives in _____________ because it needs ____________.\"\n   - \"If the dragonfly moved to __________, it might struggle because ___________.\"\n\n2. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Reduce the number of questions and offer multiple-choice options instead of open-ended responses. Example: \"The dragonfly's color is: A) Red  B) Blue  C) Yellow. This color helps it: A) Hide  B) Run Fast  C) Eat.\"\n\n3. **Peer Support:** Partner students with stronger readers/writers. Assign roles during Explore (one records, one observes). During Elaborate, provide adult support during group discussions to help clarify thinking.\n\n4. **Visual Supports:** Use labeled diagrams, color-coded vocabulary cards, and photographs of real dragonflies in different habitats to anchor understanding.\n\n**Challenge for Advanced Learners:**\n\n1. **Research Extension:** \"Find out about the dragonfly's life cycle—it spends most of its life in the water as a nymph before becoming an adult. Draw and label the life cycle stages. How are the nymph's traits different from the adult's? Why?\" (Connects to 3-LS1-1 on diverse life cycles.)\n\n2. **Comparative Adaptation Analysis:** Provide images of different dragonfly species with varying colors and body sizes. Task: \"Compare these three dragonflies. What habitats might each live in? What evidence supports your answer?\" (Builds toward 3-LS4-2.)\n\n3. **Habitat Change Scenario:** Present a scenario: \"A new shopping center is being built near the marsh where dragonflies live. The builders will cut down the grass and dry out some of the water. What will happen to the dragonfly population? What could we do to help dragonflies survive?\" (Connects to 3-LS4-4 on environmental change.)\n\n4. **Data Interpretation:** If available, provide a simple table showing dragonfly color frequency in different habitats (e.g., \"In sunny areas, 70% are blue; in shaded areas, 60% are green\"). Ask: \"What does this data tell us about how environment influences traits?\" (Extends 3-LS3-2.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Dragonfly Life Cycle Research Project:** Students research and create a diagram or poster showing all four stages of the dragonfly life cycle: egg, nymph (aquatic), transformation, adult. They explain how each stage has different traits suited to its environment. (Connection to 3-LS1-1.)\n\n2. **Habitat Diorama:** In small groups, students build a 3D dragonfly habitat using a box, craft materials, and plants (real or artificial). They include water, grass, and other insects. They write labels explaining why each part of the habitat is important for dragonfly survival. Present to the class with explanations.\n\n3. **Insect Trait Comparison Chart:** Students compare the dragonfly's traits to other insects they observe or research (ant, butterfly, grasshopper). Create a class chart: \"Traits,\" \"How They Help,\" \"Habitat.\" Discuss: \"Why do different insects have different traits?\" (Connects to 3-LS4-2 on variation providing advantages.)\n\n4. **Observation Journal—Insect Hunt:** If weather permits, take students outside to a grassy or wetland area (school pond, garden, park). Have them observe and sketch insects they find (including dragonflies if present). Record: what they see, where they found it, and what traits help it survive there. Discuss findings as a class.\n\n5. **Interview a \"Dragonfly Expert\":** Invite a local naturalist, wetland educator, or student volunteer (high school) to visit and discuss dragonfly ecology, habitat needs, and conservation. Students prepare questions beforehand based on their learning.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\n- **Pacing:** Adjust timing based on student engagement and needs. The Elaborate phase can extend across multiple days.\n- **Real-World Connection:** If your area has dragonflies or access to a wetland, plan a field observation trip to see dragonflies in their actual habitat.\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Post vocabulary words with images on a classroom wall and refer to them throughout the unit.\n- **Assessment Flexibility:** Accept drawings, oral responses, and written explanations—honor diverse communication styles.\n- **Safety Reminder:** If using real insects or visiting outdoor habitats, brief students on gentle observation practices (look, don't catch; stay on marked paths).\n\nThis lesson scaffold builds third-graders' understanding of how organism traits connect to habitat survival while maintaining engagement through observation, exploration, and creative application.",
