Explain how bees and other animals help plants reproduce by transferring pollen between flowers.\n2. Describe a symbiotic relationship and provide examples of how both plants and animals benefit from pollination.\n3. Create a visual model showing how matter (pollen, nectar, and energy) moves between plants and animals in an ecosystem.\n4. Support an argument that plants depend on animals and their environment to complete their life cycles and produce seeds.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate student curiosity about the relationship between bees and flowers using the photograph as an entry point.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of bee on flower (or printed copies)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the screen or document camera without explanation. Give students 30-40 seconds to observe silently.\n\n2. **Ask these focus questions** to spark discussion:\n   - \"What do you notice the bee is doing on the flower?\" (Students observe the bee's mouth parts near pollen, pollen clinging to its body)\n   - \"Why do you think the bee is visiting this flower? What could it be looking for?\" (Food—guide them to think about pollen and nectar)\n   - \"How might the bee help the flower, and how might the flower help the bee?\" (Establish the idea of give-and-take)\n   - \"What would happen to plants if there were no bees or other insects visiting flowers?\" (Engage them in predicting consequences)\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today we're going to discover how bees and flowers depend on each other to survive. Before we investigate, write down one question you have about how bees and flowers work together.\" (Students write or draw their wonder question on sticky notes.)\n\n4. **Post student questions** on a \"Wonder Wall\" to revisit at the end of the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an investigation to discover exactly what the bee is collecting from the flower and why both the bee and the flower need each other.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate pollination through hands-on simulation and observation, discovering how pollen transfers and how plants and animals interact.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Artificial flowers (or real flowers if available—carnations work well)\n- Bees made from craft foam or clay (or use toy bees)\n- Pollen substitute (baking powder, flour, or finely crushed chalk—use a contrasting color to the flower)\n- Small paintbrushes (one per pair of students)\n- Hand lenses (optional)\n- Paper plates or trays to catch powder\n- Paper towels\n- Student observation sheets (see below)\n- Pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Pollen Transfer Simulation (12-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** to pairs: one artificial flower, a bee (craft or toy), a paintbrush, baking powder in a small dish, and a paper plate.\n\n2. **Give explicit directions:**\n   - \"Lightly coat the paintbrush with baking powder (this represents pollen).\"\n   - \"Gently brush the powder onto different parts of your flower. Notice where the powder sticks most.\" (Students discover that powder adheres to textured petals and the flower's center)\n   - \"Now, move the bee across the flower as if it's landing and crawling. Observe what happens to the powder.\" (Powder transfers to the bee)\n   - \"Move the bee to touch a second flower (or another part of the first flower). What do you observe?\" (Powder (pollen) transfers from bee to flower)\n\n3. **Students record observations** on their sheets:\n   - Where did pollen stick to the flower?\n   - How did pollen get on the bee?\n   - Where did pollen go when the bee moved to the next flower?\n\n**Part B: Real Flower Observation (5-10 minutes, if time permits)**\n\n4. If fresh flowers are available, have students use hand lenses to observe:\n   - The yellow powder inside real flowers (actual pollen)\n   - How pollen might stick to a bee's body\n   - The sticky stigma (female part) that catches pollen\n\n5. **Students sketch and label** what they observe.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Where is the pollen sticking? Why do you think that happens? How does this help the flower?\"\n- Resist explaining; instead, ask students to observe and describe patterns.\n- Encourage precise vocabulary use: \"Tell me more about how the pollen moved.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that pollen transfers from flower to bee and then to another flower.\n- Students observe that pollen sticks to certain surfaces and that the bee's body acts as a carrier.\n- Students make the connection that movement of pollen is necessary for plants to make seeds.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the concept of pollination and symbiosis in an ecosystem context, connecting to plant growth and matter movement.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart paper (pre-prepared)\n- Diagram of flower parts (optional handout)\n- Markers\n- Student notebooks or journals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Facilitate a group discussion** based on Explore observations:\n   - \"What did you discover happens when a bee visits a flower?\" (Guide them to articulate: pollen sticks to the bee, then transfers to the next flower)\n   - \"Why do you think plants need pollen to move between flowers?\" (Guide toward: to make seeds, which grow into new plants)\n   - \"What did the bee need from the flower?\" (Pollen and nectar for food/energy)\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions:\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Pollen** | A yellowish powder made by flowers that contains the material plants need to make seeds. Bees and other animals carry pollen from flower to flower. |\n| **Pollination** | The process of moving pollen from one flower to another, usually by insects, so that plants can make seeds and reproduce. |\n| **Nectar** | Sweet liquid made by flowers that bees and other insects drink for energy, kind of like juice for insects. |\n| **Symbiosis / Symbiotic Relationship** | When two different living things work together and both benefit. The bee gets food, and the flower gets pollinated. |\n| **Reproduction** | Making new living things. For plants, pollination helps them make seeds that grow into new plants. |\n\n3. **Create an anchor chart** titled \"How Bees and Flowers Help Each Other\":\n   - **What the Bee Gets:** Pollen (food and protein), Nectar (energy/food)\n   - **What the Flower Gets:** Pollen moved to other flowers (so it can make seeds)\n   - **Why This Matters:** Without pollination, many plants can't make seeds, and without flowers, bees don't have food.\n\n4. **Connect to the photograph:**\n   - Point out the pollen visible on the bee's body in the original image.\n   - Explain: \"This bee is a pollinator. As it moves from flower to flower collecting nectar and pollen, it spreads pollen. This helps the plant make seeds.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to a partner and explain what pollination is in your own words.\"\n   - \"Why do both the bee and the flower need this relationship?\"\n   - Ask 2-3 students to share their explanations aloud.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Pollen:** A yellowish powder made by flowers that contains the material plants need to make seeds.\n- **Pollination:** The movement of pollen from one flower to another, usually by animals, so plants can make seeds.\n- **Nectar:** Sweet liquid made by flowers that provides energy for bees and other insects.\n- **Symbiotic Relationship:** When two different organisms work together and both benefit.\n- **Reproduction:** The process of making new living things; in plants, pollination allows them to produce seeds.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that pollination is the transfer of pollen between flowers.\n- Students recognize that the bee-flower relationship is mutually beneficial (symbiosis).\n- Students see pollination as essential to plant reproduction and seed production.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a model that shows how matter (pollen, nectar, energy) moves through an ecosystem involving plants, pollinators, and consumers.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster paper or chart paper (one per small group)\n- Colored markers or colored pencils\n- Printed images of flowers, bees, birds, humans, seeds, sun (pre-prepared clip art, or students can draw)\n- Glue sticks\n- Arrows cut from colored paper, or students draw arrows\n- Student \"Energy & Matter Flow\" worksheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into small groups** (3-4 per group).\n\n2. **Assign each group a scenario:**\n   - Group A: Apple tree → bee → ?\n   - Group B: Wildflower meadow → bumblebee → mouse → ?\n   - Group C: Garden flowers → hummingbird → ?\n\n3. **Give instructions for model creation:**\n   - \"Your job is to create a visual model showing how matter and energy move from a plant through an animal pollinator and into other organisms in the ecosystem.\"\n   - \"Start with the plant (draw or glue the image). Use arrows to show how pollen and nectar move to the pollinator. Then show what happens next—maybe the pollinator eats nectar, gains energy, and then is eaten by another animal, or uses that energy to do work.\"\n   - \"Label each organism and what matter/energy is being transferred.\"\n   - \"Include: the sun's energy, the plant, the pollinator, and at least one other organism.\"\n\n4. **Scaffold the thinking with guiding questions:**\n   - \"Where does the plant get energy to make nectar and pollen?\" (The sun)\n   - \"What does the bee do with the nectar it collects?\" (Eats it for energy; uses energy to fly, live, and reproduce)\n   - \"If the bee is eaten by a bird, what happens to the energy the bee collected from the flower?\" (Transfers to the bird)\n\n5. **Student groups draw/create their model** and prepare a 1-minute explanation to share with the class.\n\n6. **Gallery walk:** Display all models and have students view and ask clarifying questions.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Can you trace the path of energy from the sun to the plant to the bee to the next organism?\"\n- Prompt for more detail: \"What other animals might depend on these plants or bees?\"\n- Encourage students to think about what happens when one organism in the chain is missing.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a model showing the movement of matter (pollen, nectar) and energy through at least three organisms.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that energy from the sun flows through plants to animals.\n- Students recognize that pollination is one step in a larger ecosystem cycle.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pollination, symbiosis, and ecosystem matter movement.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation notes:** Document student responses during Engage discussion, Explore investigation, and partner explanations in Explain phase.\n- **Group model creation:** Assess the accuracy and completeness of models created in Elaborate phase, including labels and arrows showing matter/energy flow.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket to complete individually. Choose one format:\n\n**Option A (Written/Drawing):**\n1. \"Draw and label a bee visiting a flower. Show where the pollen is and explain how the pollen helps the plant.\"\n2. \"Explain in 2-3 sentences: What does the bee get from the flower, and what does the flower get from the bee?\"\n3. \"If all the bees in an area disappeared, what would happen to the plants? Why?\"\n\n**Option B (Multiple Choice + Short Answer):**\n1. Pollination is:\n   - A) The bee eating the flower\n   - B) Pollen moving from one flower to another\n   - C) The flower making nectar\n   - *Answer: B*\n\n2. A symbiotic relationship between a bee and flower means:\n   - A) The bee helps the flower, and the flower helps the bee\n   - B) The bee and flower compete for food\n   - C) Neither organism benefits\n   - *Answer: A*\n\n3. Explain: \"Where does a plant get the energy to make nectar for the bee?\" (Students should mention: the sun / photosynthesis / air and water)\n\n**Option C (Argument):**\nStudents complete this prompt:\n\"Support the argument that plants need animals (like bees) to survive and reproduce. Explain how the relationship between plants and their pollinators helps both organisms get what they need to grow and survive.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student accurately describes what happens during pollination (pollen transfer).\n- ✓ Student identifies benefits to both the bee and the flower.\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary (pollination, pollen, symbiosis, or pollinator) correctly.\n- ✓ Student connects pollination to plant reproduction or seed production.\n- ✓ Student recognizes the interdependence of plants and animals in an ecosystem.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students (80%+) demonstrate understanding that pollination is essential for plant reproduction and that bees and flowers have a mutually beneficial relationship.\n- Students use scientific vocabulary appropriately.\n- Students can explain how matter (pollen, nectar, energy) moves between organisms and why this matters to the ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary focus:** Pre-teach key terms (pollen, pollination, bee, flower) using picture cards and real examples before the lesson. Reduce the number of vocabulary terms introduced at once.\n\n2. **Structured exploration guide:** Provide students with a fill-in-the-blank observation sheet during Explore phase:\n   - \"I see pollen on the ___________.\"\n   - \"The bee is carrying ___________ to the flower.\"\n   - \"The pollen helps the flower make ___________.\"\n\n3. **Peer partnerships:** Pair struggling readers with strong readers during group work. Assign roles (e.g., one student draws while the other labels and explains).\n\n4. **Exit ticket modification:** Offer a simplified three-part exit ticket with sentence stems:\n   - \"Pollen moves from the flower to the _________.\"\n   - \"The bee needs ___________ from the flower.\"\n   - \"The flower needs the bee to ___________.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate multiple pollinators:** Provide images or information about different pollinators (butterflies, hummingbirds, moths, beetles). Have students research and compare which plants each pollinator visits and why (flower color, scent, shape). Have them present findings to the class.\n\n2. **Model a complete ecosystem:** Challenge students to extend their matter-flow models to include decomposers (bacteria, fungi) and show what happens to dead organisms and waste. Can they show the \"recycling\" of matter?\n\n3. **Real-world application project:** Have students design a native plant garden for their school or community that would attract and support local pollinators. They must research native plants, pollinator species, and create a labeled plan with explanations of why their choices support the ecosystem.\n\n4. **Critical thinking question:** \"What would happen to human food if all pollinators disappeared? Research one crop that depends on bees and explain how it would affect people.\" Encourage students to find real examples (almonds, apples, cucumbers, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Pollinator Observation Field Journal (Homework/Outdoor Activity):**\n   Students visit a garden, park, or natural area and observe pollinators visiting flowers for 10-15 minutes. They sketch and record:\n   - What types of insects/animals they see\n   - Which flowers each pollinator visits\n   - How long they stay\n   - How many flowers each pollinator visits\n   \n   Follow-up: Share observations in class and create a class chart of local pollinators and their preferred flowers.\n\n2. **Bee-Friendly Garden Design Project:**\n   Students design a small garden or window box that would attract bees and other pollinators. They research:\n   - Plants that bloom at different times of year\n   - Colors and scents that attract bees\n   - Water sources\n   Students create a labeled sketch or 3D model and present their design, explaining why their choices support pollinators.\n\n3. **Life Cycle of Plants & Pollinators Connection Activity:**\n   Students create a detailed life cycle diagram showing:\n   - Flower blooms → bee pollinates → fruit/seed develops → new plant grows → new flowers bloom\n   - Simultaneously show the bee's life cycle and how it depends on flowers for energy\n   Students use this to discuss how the cycles of plants and pollinators are interconnected and mutually dependent.\n\n---\n\n**Closing Reflection (Optional Follow-Up):**\nReturn to the \"Wonder Wall\" from the Engage phase. Have students revisit their original questions and share: \"What did you learn that answers your question? What new questions do you have?\" This reinforces learning and sparks interest in deeper investigation.",
