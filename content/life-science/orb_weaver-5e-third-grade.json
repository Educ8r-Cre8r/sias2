ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about spider body structures and their purposes through observation of the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of orb weaver spider on human hand (projected or printed for each small group)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student observation sheets (one per student)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or document camera where all students can see it clearly. Hold the image for 30 seconds in silence, allowing students to look closely.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** to spark wonder and curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about this spider's legs? How many legs can you count?\"\n   - \"Why do you think spiders need such long, thin legs instead of short, thick legs like humans have?\"\n   - \"How might the spider use those long legs to help it survive in the wild?\"\n   - \"What would happen if a spider was much bigger or much smaller than this one? Would it still be able to do the same things?\"\n\n3. **Elicit predictions** with this prompt: \"Think about a spider catching its food in a web. What body parts do you think are most important for this job? Turn to a neighbor and share your ideas.\"\n\n4. **Record** student responses on chart paper under the heading \"What We Wonder About Spiders\" to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become spider scientists and discover how every part of a spider's body—from its legs to its tiny fangs—helps it survive and catch food.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate spider anatomy through hands-on observation and model-building, discovering how body structures function for survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real (preserved or plastic) spiders or high-quality spider models (one per small group, or shared at a station)\n- Magnifying glasses (one per student or shared)\n- Pipe cleaners in various lengths (8-12 per student)\n- Googly eyes and craft foam or clay for body building\n- Observation recording sheets with labeled spider body diagrams\n- Rulers (optional, for measuring spider parts)\n- Markers and colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Close Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide students into small groups of 2-3. Provide each group with a preserved spider specimen, plastic spider model, or access to a station with a real (safely enclosed) spider to observe.\n\n2. **Direct students:** \"Using your magnifying glass, look very carefully at your spider. Count its legs. Notice the shape of its body. Look for the smaller parts like fangs or eyes. Draw or label what you see on your observation sheet. You have 5 minutes to become experts on your spider's body.\"\n\n3. **Circulate and ask guiding questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the legs? Are they all the same?\"\n   - \"Can you find where the spider's mouth might be?\"\n   - \"How would these legs help the spider move?\"\n\n4. **Regroup** and have 2-3 groups share one thing they observed. Record on chart paper.\n\n**Part B: Spider Model Building (15 minutes)**\n\n1. Explain: \"Now you're going to build your own spider model using pipe cleaners and craft materials. As you build, think about why spiders are shaped this way.\"\n\n2. **Provide instructions:**\n   - Create a body using foam, clay, or tightly rolled pipe cleaner\n   - Attach 8 pipe cleaners as legs (4 on each side)\n   - Make the legs different lengths based on real spider observations\n   - Add googly eyes and small details\n\n3. **Challenge:** \"Make your spider's legs the right length for hunting in a web. They need to be long enough to feel vibrations but not so long they get tangled. Test how your spider's legs move and balance.\"\n\n4. **Student recording:** Have students draw their spider model and label the body parts, writing 1-2 sentences about what each part does.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Observe which students understand form-function relationships\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"Why did you choose that leg length?\" \"How would shorter legs change how this spider hunts?\"\n- Encourage students to test their models (gently moving them, checking balance)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 5-8 key spider body parts (legs, body segments, fangs, eyes)\n- Models show 8 legs in a realistic arrangement\n- Students make a connection between body structure and function (e.g., \"long legs help the spider feel the web\")\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and concepts through teacher-led discussion that connects exploration to biological principles of adaptation and survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected photograph of orb weaver spider\n- Large labeled diagram of spider anatomy (8 legs, cephalothorax, abdomen, fangs, eyes)\n- Chart paper with \"Spider Body Parts & Jobs\" anchor chart being created live\n- Index cards with vocabulary terms (pre-made or on board)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Invite 2-3 groups to hold up their spider models and explain one thing their spider's body parts help it do. Ask the class: \"Did anyone notice something similar about how spiders are built?\" Guide them to recognize that all spiders have the same basic structures.\n\n2. **Introduce and define key vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   - **Legs (8 total):** The long, thin body parts attached to a spider's body that help it walk, run, and feel vibrations in its web.\n   - **Fangs:** Small, sharp, pointy structures near the spider's mouth used to catch and hold prey.\n   - **Web:** A sticky trap made of silk that the spider builds to catch insects for food.\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment.\n   - **Cephalothorax:** The front part of the spider's body where the legs and eyes are attached (can simplify to \"the spider's head and body stuck together\").\n\n3. **Create anchor chart together:** Display the photograph and circle/point to each body part as students name it. Record on chart paper:\n\n   **Spider Body Parts & How They Help:**\n   - **8 Legs** → Walking, climbing, feeling vibrations in the web\n   - **Fangs** → Catching and holding tiny insects\n   - **Eyes** → Seeing movement to know when prey is caught\n   - **Silk Glands** (internal) → Making the web to trap food\n   - **Small Body Size** → Fitting in tight spaces, using less energy, hiding from predators\n\n4. **Check for understanding (3 minutes):** Ask students to mime or act out spider movements:\n   - \"Show me how a spider uses its legs to walk up a plant stem.\"\n   - \"Show me how a spider might feel something land on its web.\"\n   - \"Can everyone show how small a spider's body is compared to ours?\"\n\n5. **Connect back to photograph:** \"Look at this spider on the scientist's hand. The hand is much bigger. Why is it good for the spider to be so small and have such thin, long legs?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Legs:** Long, thin body parts that help spiders walk, climb, and sense vibrations.\n- **Fangs:** Sharp, pointy parts near a spider's mouth for catching food.\n- **Web:** A sticky structure made of silk that spiders build to catch insects.\n- **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in nature.\n- **Cephalothorax:** The front body section where a spider's legs and eyes connect.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name 5-6 spider body parts and state a function for at least 3 of them\n- Students understand that all spiders share similar basic structures\n- Students begin to connect body structure to survival advantage (e.g., \"long legs help catch prey\")\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by investigating how spider adaptations provide survival advantages in different environments and comparing spiders to other animals.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pictures/cards of different spider species (orb weaver, jumping spider, tarantula, crab spider)\n- Pictures of different habitats (garden, tree bark, web in corner, sandy ground)\n- Large paper for creating comparison charts\n- Markers and colored pencils\n- \"Spider Habitat Cards\" (pre-made scenarios)\n\n**Activity: Spider Adaptation Challenge**\n\n1. **Part A: Matching Spiders to Habitats (10 minutes)**\n\n   Display pictures of 3-4 different spider types and 4-5 habitat pictures. Ask: \"Different spiders have different body shapes and sizes. Do you think all spiders live in the same places? Why or why not?\"\n\n   Explain: \"Some spiders are big and hairy. Some are tiny. Some have long legs. Some have short legs. These differences help different spiders survive in different places.\"\n\n   **Provide scenarios:**\n   - \"An orb weaver has long legs and a small body. It likes to live where there's space to build big webs between trees or on bushes. Why would a long body and short legs NOT work as well?\"\n   - \"A jumping spider has shorter legs and a bigger, stronger body. It hunts by jumping on insects in small spaces. Why would long, thin legs NOT work for jumping?\"\n   - \"A tarantula has thick, hairy legs. It lives in burrows in warm, dry places. How do thick legs help it dig?\"\n\n   Have students discuss in pairs which spider they think would survive best in different habitats and WHY (focusing on how body structures match the habitat).\n\n2. **Part B: Spider vs. Human Comparison (5 minutes)**\n\n   Show the original photograph again. Ask: \"Spiders and humans are both animals. We both have body parts that help us survive. Let's compare.\"\n\n   Create a simple Venn diagram on the board:\n   - **Spiders:** 8 legs, fangs, small body, make webs, see in different ways\n   - **Both:** Need food, have body parts for moving, eyes to see, use body parts to hunt/gather food\n   - **Humans:** 2 legs, no fangs, large body, use tools, large brains\n\n   Discuss: \"Our legs are different from spider legs. Our hands are different from spider fangs. How does this show that different animals are adapted for different ways of life?\"\n\n3. **Student application task:** Provide each student with a \"Spider Adaptations\" worksheet:\n   - Draw a spider in its habitat\n   - Label 3 body parts\n   - Write or tell: \"This body part helps the spider _______ so it can survive.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion by asking \"Why?\" and \"How does that body part help?\" rather than telling answers\n- Guide students to see patterns in how structure matches function\n- Prompt comparison thinking: \"Is this body part like anything humans have? How is it different and why?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students explain how at least 2 spider adaptations help survival in specific habitats\n- Students create a simple model or drawing showing a spider in its habitat with labeled body parts\n- Students make at least one comparison between spider and human body structures and discuss why they're different\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of spider adaptations, body structures, and how characteristics help spiders survive.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation notes during Explore phase: Can students identify body parts and suggest functions?\n- Discussion responses during Explain phase: Can students use new vocabulary accurately?\n- Elaboration task responses: Do students explain function-structure relationships?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with this three-part exit ticket:\n\n**Part 1: Drawing & Labeling**\nDraw a spider and label at least 4 body parts (legs, fangs, body, eyes). You may use the classroom's spider models or the photograph as reference.\n\n**Part 2: Function Matching**\nMatch each body part to its job:\n- Legs → A) To catch and hold food\n- Fangs → B) To walk, climb, and feel vibrations\n- Eyes → C) To see movement\n\n**Part 3: Short Answer (Verbal or Written)**\nChoose ONE question to answer:\n- \"How do a spider's long legs help it survive in nature?\"\n- \"Why do you think spiders are small instead of big like humans?\"\n- \"If a spider had short, thick legs instead of long, thin legs, how might that change how it hunts?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate proficiency if they:\n- ✓ Correctly label at least 4 spider body parts on a diagram\n- ✓ Match at least 2 body parts to their correct functions with 75% accuracy\n- ✓ Explain in at least 1 sentence or through acting out how a specific spider body part helps it survive (part must be observable in the photograph or models)\n- ✓ Use at least 1 vocabulary word (legs, fangs, adaptation, web, survive) correctly\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents will demonstrate understanding by:\n- Identifying major spider body structures from the photograph and their models\n- Explaining that body structures have specific functions for survival\n- Recognizing that different animals have different adaptations suited to their needs\n- Creating representations (drawings, models, descriptions) that show spider-environment fit\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Sentence frame and word bank:** Provide students with pre-printed sentence frames during explanation and elaboration:\n   - \"The spider's _______ helps it _______ so it can survive.\"\n   - Word bank: legs, fangs, web, walk, catch food, climb, hide, feel vibrations\n\n2. **Simplified observation sheet:** Create a sheet with large, labeled diagrams of a spider where students only need to circle or point to parts rather than draw from scratch. Use this during Explore and Evaluate.\n\n3. **One-on-one modeling:** During Explore, work closely with these students through a spider model, asking them to repeat functions back (\"Why are we making 8 legs?\") and providing lots of verbal scaffolding.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Spider species research:** Provide pictures and information cards about 3-4 different spider species (orb weaver, jumping spider, wolf spider, trapdoor spider). Ask students to research HOW each species' body is different and CREATE their own hypothesis about WHY those differences help each spider survive in its specific habitat. Students present findings to the class.\n\n2. **Comparative anatomy:** Challenge students to find and compare TWO other animals (insects, crustaceans, arachnids) and create a detailed comparison chart showing how leg number, body shape, and size differ across species and relate to each animal's lifestyle (hunting method, habitat, speed).\n\n3. **Design challenge:** \"If you were designing a robot spider to explore a cave, how would you build it based on real spider adaptations? Draw your design and explain which real spider features you copied and why.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Spider Web Geometry Project:** Students use string, yarn, and a frame (embroidery hoop, or geometry geoboard) to create their own geometric web patterns. They measure angles, count intersection points, and research how real orb weavers create such precise geometric webs. (Connects to math and engineering thinking)\n\n2. **Classroom Habitat Investigation:** Take students on a nature walk to look for spider webs and spiders in the schoolyard or garden. Have them photograph or sketch webs they find and identify the habitat (between shrubs, on flowers, in corners). Back in class, create a chart of \"Where Spiders Live in Our School Environment\" and discuss how each web location provides advantages for catching food.\n\n3. **\"Adopt a Spider\" Documentary Drawing:** Assign each student a fictional spider \"character\" (with a name, species, body feature variation such as \"has extra-long legs\" or \"is extra small\"). Students create a day-in-the-life comic strip or storyboard showing how their spider uses its body parts to hunt, escape predators, and survive. Include labels and explanations of adaptations.\n\n---",
