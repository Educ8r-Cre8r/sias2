  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Grasshopper on a Flower\n\n## Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Animals have body parts that help them survive** – The grasshopper's strong legs, large eyes, and antennae enable it to move, see, and sense its environment to find food and escape danger.\n- **Animals need food and plants to survive** – The grasshopper is eating from a seed head, showing that insects depend on plants for nourishment.\n- **Different animals live in different habitats** – Grasshoppers live in grassy, plant-filled areas where they can find food and shelter.\n- **Animals have specific features that help them get what they need** – The grasshopper's chewing mouth parts and strong legs are specially designed for eating seeds and jumping through vegetation.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**What Do Grasshoppers Need to Live?**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 70–90 minutes (two 35–45 minute sessions or one extended session with a break)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - K-LS1-1: Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Identify at least two body parts of a grasshopper and describe what each part helps the grasshopper do.\n2. Explain that grasshoppers need food (plants) and a habitat (place to live) to survive.\n3. Describe where a grasshopper might live and what it needs to find there.\n4. Use observations to show how a grasshopper's body helps it meet its needs.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about grasshoppers and what animals need to survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of the grasshopper on the flower (or displayed via projector)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Picture cards or small illustrations of grasshoppers, flowers, and other animals (optional, for visual reference)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the grasshopper image on a large screen or poster board where all students can see clearly. Give students 30 seconds to look silently and notice details.\n\n2. **Hook with Wonder:** Say: *\"Look carefully! What is this creature doing? What do you notice about its body?\"*\n\n3. **Facilitate Discussion with Targeted Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you point to the different parts?\"\n   - \"What is the grasshopper touching with its body? Why might it be there?\"\n   - \"If you were a grasshopper, what would you need to stay alive—food, water, a home, or something else?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a grasshopper? Where was it? What was it doing?\"\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** Ask: *\"What do you think this grasshopper needs to live? Let's write down your ideas.\"* Record 3–4 student predictions on chart paper (use drawings and words). Save this chart for the Explain phase.\n\n5. **Wonder Statement:** Invite students to share one question they have about grasshoppers. Write one or two on the chart: *\"We're going to find out what grasshoppers need and how their bodies help them!\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Now we're going to explore a pretend grasshopper up close and see what special body parts it has!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate grasshopper body parts and discover what features help grasshoppers survive.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- 1 large green pipe cleaner (for the body)\n- 2 yellow/tan pipe cleaners (for antennae)\n- 4 green pipe cleaners or craft sticks (for legs)\n- Small foam ball or pompom (for head)\n- Googly eyes (2 per student)\n- Glue stick or hot glue gun (teacher-managed)\n- Pre-cut leaf or flower template from colored paper\n- One hand lens or magnifying glass per pair (optional but recommended)\n- Chart or worksheet with labeled grasshopper diagram and simple prompts\n\n**Activity – Build and Observe:**\n\n1. **Introduction (2 minutes):** *\"We're going to make our own grasshopper body. As we build it, we'll think about what each part does. Let's use these materials to create the body parts we see in the photo.\"*\n\n2. **Guided Assembly (15 minutes):** \n\n   **Step 1:** Students glue the large green pipe cleaner horizontally on a sheet of paper—this is the body.\n   \n   **Step 2:** At the top (head end), glue the foam ball and add googly eyes. Say: *\"The grasshopper has big eyes. Why might it need big eyes? What does it look for?\"*\n   \n   **Step 3:** Insert two yellow pipe cleaners into or beside the foam ball as antennae. Ask: *\"Grasshoppers have long feelers called antennae. What might they feel or sense with these?\"*\n   \n   **Step 4:** Attach four green pipe cleaners or craft sticks along the body as legs. Bend them to show they can jump. Say: *\"Look at these strong back legs! Grasshoppers use these to jump. Why would jumping help a grasshopper survive?\"*\n   \n   **Step 5:** Glue the pre-cut leaf or flower template near the grasshopper's mouth. Say: *\"Our grasshopper is eating! What did we see the real grasshopper eating in the photo?\"*\n\n3. **Guided Observation (5–8 minutes):** Provide each pair with a hand lens. Have students examine the printed photo or a real (preserved or photo-based) grasshopper specimen. Ask them to:\n   - Find the antennae, eyes, legs, and mouth.\n   - Count the legs.\n   - Notice how the back legs look different from the front legs.\n   - Record or draw one body part they noticed on their worksheet.\n\n4. **Wonder Recording:** Ask: *\"What did your grasshopper model help you understand? Draw or write one thing your grasshopper's body can do.\"* Students draw or dictate (teacher writes) one action (e.g., \"jump,\" \"eat,\" \"see\").\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"Why do you think the grasshopper has such strong back legs?\"* or *\"What would happen if the grasshopper didn't have eyes?\"*\n- Do not provide answers; instead, encourage observation and reasoning.\n- Help students connect their models to the original photograph.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students construct a labeled model showing grasshopper body parts.\n- Students identify at least 3 body parts (legs, antennae, eyes, mouth).\n- Students predict or describe one function of a body part (e.g., legs for jumping, eyes for seeing, mouth for eating).\n- Students document observations on a simple worksheet or drawing.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and solidify understanding of grasshopper adaptations and survival needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart from Engage phase with student predictions\n- Large labeled diagram of a grasshopper (poster or projected image)\n- Picture cards showing a grasshopper's habitat (grass, flowers, garden)\n- Vocabulary cards with images (optional)\n\n**Activity – Group Discussion and Direct Teaching:**\n\n1. **Review Predictions (3 minutes):** Return to the chart created during Engage. Say: *\"We predicted what grasshoppers need. Let's see if our exploration taught us anything new!\"* Review each prediction and have students give a thumbs up if they think it was correct.\n\n2. **Share Discoveries (5 minutes):** Ask 3–4 students to show their grasshopper models and share one thing they learned. Ask follow-up questions:\n   - *\"Tell us about the body part you drew. What does it help the grasshopper do?\"*\n   - *\"Why is this important for survival?\"*\n   - *\"Did you see this on the photo?\"*\n\n3. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (5 minutes):** Display a large labeled diagram. Point to each part and say the word clearly. Use the definitions below:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Antennae** – Long feelers on the grasshopper's head that help it sense what is around it (smell, touch, feel vibrations).\n   - **Legs** – Strong body parts that help the grasshopper move, jump, and run away from danger. Grasshoppers have six legs (though back legs are biggest for jumping).\n   - **Eyes** – Body parts that help the grasshopper see food, danger, and other grasshoppers.\n   - **Mouth** – The part the grasshopper uses to eat plants, seeds, and flowers.\n   - **Habitat** – The place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs (food, water, shelter, space).\n\n4. **Connect to Survival Needs (5 minutes):** Create a simple web on chart paper:\n   - Center: \"What Grasshoppers Need to Survive\"\n   - Branches: \n     - **Food** – Plants, seeds, flowers (like the one in our photo!)\n     - **Habitat** – Grassy, plant-filled places\n     - **Body Parts** – Legs to escape danger, mouth to eat, eyes to see, antennae to sense\n\n   Point to the photograph and say: *\"This grasshopper is in a perfect habitat! It found a flower with seeds to eat. Its big legs help it jump to the next plant. Its eyes help it see where to go. Its antennae help it know if danger is near.\"*\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"What are two things this grasshopper needs to survive?\"* (Students respond: food and habitat.)\n   - Ask: *\"Which body part helps a grasshopper run away from danger?\"* (Students point to or name legs.)\n   - Ask: *\"Where do grasshoppers live?\"* (Students describe grass, gardens, plants.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the new vocabulary terms (antennae, legs, habitat, etc.) to describe what they observed.\n- Students can name 2–3 body parts and describe one function for each.\n- Students understand that grasshoppers need food (plants) and a habitat (place with plants and grass) to survive.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by exploring how grasshoppers meet their needs in different scenarios and thinking about other animals.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos showing different habitats (garden, meadow, desert, forest)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Drawing paper and crayons/colored pencils\n- Optional: video clip of grasshopper jumping or eating (2–3 minutes, YouTube or educational platform)\n- Picture cards of other insects or animals\n\n**Activity – Choose One Option Below:**\n\n**Option A: Grasshopper Habitat Hunt**\n\n1. Show picture cards of different habitats (garden, meadow, forest, desert, pond).\n2. Ask: *\"Which of these places would be a good home for a grasshopper? Why?\"*\n3. Have students discuss: *\"Does the place have plants? Does it have places to hide?\"*\n4. Guide students to conclude: *\"Grasshoppers need a home with lots of plants and grass where they can find food and hide from danger.\"*\n5. Have students draw or cut-and-glue a grasshopper into the habitat where it would survive best, and label what the grasshopper finds there (food, shelter, space).\n\n**Option B: Matching Body Parts to Needs**\n\n1. Display the chart made in Explain: \"What Grasshoppers Need to Survive\" (Food, Habitat, Body Parts).\n2. Show pictures of grasshopper body parts (legs, antennae, mouth, eyes).\n3. Ask: *\"Which body part helps the grasshopper find food?\"* (Students pick mouth, antennae, or eyes.)\n4. Have students match each body part to a survival need on the chart using yarn or by drawing connecting lines.\n5. Ask: *\"If a grasshopper didn't have strong legs, what would happen?\"* (Guide them to understand it would be caught by predators or couldn't escape danger.)\n\n**Option C: Compare Other Animals (Brief Extension)**\n\n1. Show pictures of other insects or animals (butterfly, ant, ladybug, bird).\n2. Ask: *\"Do all animals have the same body parts as grasshoppers?\"* \n3. Compare: *\"Butterflies have wings, but grasshoppers don't. Why might a butterfly need wings instead of legs for jumping?\"*\n4. Have students observe: *\"All animals need food and a place to live, but their bodies are different because they need different things.\"*\n5. Students draw an animal and label one body part that helps it survive.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions that encourage deeper thinking: *\"Why do you think this habitat is good for grasshoppers?\"*\n- Validate observations and guide students toward connections between body parts and survival.\n- Use the photograph as a reference point throughout.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify a suitable grasshopper habitat and explain why (has plants, places to hide, etc.).\n- Students match at least 2 body parts to a survival need.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that different animals have different body parts but all need food and habitat.\n- Students apply vocabulary in new contexts.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of grasshopper survival needs and body part functions.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n\n- **Observation Checklist:** During Explore and Elaborate, observe and note:\n  - Can the student identify 3 grasshopper body parts?\n  - Can the student describe what one body part does?\n  - Does the student connect the photograph to their model and observations?\n  - Can the student name something a grasshopper needs to survive?\n\n- **Questioning:** Ask probing questions during group discussions:\n  - *\"What does a grasshopper need to live?\"*\n  - *\"Which body part helps it jump?\"*\n  - *\"Why was the grasshopper on the flower in our photo?\"*\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nChoose one or both assessment methods:\n\n**Method 1: Individual Drawing + Dictation**\n\nGive each student a half-page with a simple outline of a grasshopper and a prompt:\n\n*\"Draw one body part of a grasshopper and tell me (or write) what it helps the grasshopper do. You can use our photo for help!\"*\n\n**Scoring Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies a correct body part (legs, antennae, eyes, mouth).\n- ✓ Student describes one function (e.g., \"legs help it jump,\" \"mouth helps it eat\").\n- ✓ Student's response shows connection to survival or the photograph.\n\n**Method 2: Verbal Response (Small Group or Individual)**\n\nAsk each student these three questions; record responses:\n\n1. *\"Show me a body part on your grasshopper model. What does it do?\"* (Success: Student points and describes a function.)\n2. *\"What do grasshoppers need to live?\"* (Success: Student names 2 of these: food, habitat, water, shelter.)\n3. *\"Why was the grasshopper in our photo eating from the flower?\"* (Success: Student says \"because it needs food\" or \"to survive.\")\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Proficient:** Student answers 2–3 questions correctly and uses at least one vocabulary term (antennae, legs, habitat).\n- **Developing:** Student answers 1–2 questions with prompting and identifies 1–2 body parts.\n- **Beginning:** Student identifies at least one body part but needs significant support to connect it to function or survival.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 80% of students correctly identify 2 grasshopper body parts and describe 1 function.\n- At least 75% of students can state that grasshoppers need food and a place to live.\n- Students demonstrate understanding by using evidence from the photograph in their explanations.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Model Building:** Pre-assemble the grasshopper body before the lesson. Students only add eyes and antennae, reducing fine motor demands. This keeps focus on observation and vocabulary.\n\n2. **Sentence Stems for Explanation:** Provide visual prompts and sentence frames:\n   - *\"The grasshopper's _______ help it _______.\"*\n   - *\"The grasshopper needs _______ to survive.\"*\n   - Use pictures to support fill-in-the-blank responses instead of open-ended writing.\n\n3. **Paired or Small Group Work:** Assign these students a peer partner during Explore and Elaborate. The partner can model the activity and provide language support. The teacher circulates to this group more frequently and asks simpler, more concrete questions.\n\n4. **Focus on One Body Part:** Instead of examining all body parts, have the student focus on one (e.g., just the legs). Ask: *\"What do the legs do? Why are they important?\" * This reduces cognitive load while maintaining learning.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Habitat Exploration:** Have students research (with pictures and teacher support) where grasshoppers live around the world. Ask: *\"Do grasshoppers in hot deserts have the same needs as grasshoppers in cool meadows? What might be different?\"* Students create a poster or simple diagram comparing two habitats.\n\n2. **Predator-Prey Dynamics:** Introduce the concept of survival from danger. Ask: *\"Grasshoppers are food for birds and spiders. How do grasshoppers use their body parts to escape? Why is jumping important?\"* Have students act out a grasshopper escaping a predator and describe which body parts help most.\n\n3. **Compare Multiple Insects:** Provide images of a grasshopper, cricket, and locust. Ask: *\"How are these insects alike? How are they different? Which body parts are the same? Why do you think they share these parts?\"* Students create a Venn diagram or simple comparison chart.\n\n4. **Extension Question on Adaptation:** Ask: *\"If a grasshopper lost its ability to jump, could it still survive in a meadow? Why or why not?\"* Encourage students to think about predators, food access, and habitat. Have them draw or dictate their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grasshopper Life Cycle Sequencing (Follow-up Lesson):** Introduce the idea that grasshoppers go through stages (egg → nymph → adult). Use picture cards to sequence the life cycle. Ask: *\"What does a baby grasshopper need to survive? Is it the same as what an adult needs?\"* This extends K-LS1-1 and prepares students for Grade 1 life cycle concepts.\n\n2. **Create a Grasshopper Habitat in a Shoebox (Extended Project):** Students bring a small shoebox (or use classroom boxes) and fill it with grass, leaves, and twigs to create a grasshopper home. Discuss: *\"What did you put in the habitat? Does it have food, water, and hiding places?\"* Students label their habitat and present it to the class, explaining why each item is important.\n\n3. **Sensory Exploration Station:** Set up a station with real leaves, flowers, seeds, and soft materials (to represent antennae touch). Have students close their eyes and feel different textures, then guess: *\"This feels like ______. Is this something a grasshopper might eat?\"* Connect this to the antennae's sensory role. Follow up with the question: *\"Why do you think antennae help a grasshopper find food?\"*\n\n4. **\"If I Were a Grasshopper\" Dramatic Play:** Have students act out a day in the life of a grasshopper—finding food, jumping away from danger, resting in the grass. Assign roles (grasshopper, predator, plant). Students narrate their movements: *\"I'm using my legs to jump to the next flower!\"* or *\"My eyes help me see the bird coming!\"* Reinforces vocabulary and body part functions in a kinesthetic way.\n\n5. **Observational Sketch + Observation Booklet:** If available, show a real grasshopper (in a container) or a high-quality video of one. Have students sketch what they observe and create a simple 4–6 page booklet (folded paper) with one body part per page, labeled and illustrated. Students take this home to share learning with families.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Photo Integration:** Return to the original photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. Use it as an anchor text. Ask: *\"Let's look at our photo again. What is the grasshopper doing now that we know more about it?\"*\n\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Kindergarteners learn through repetition. Use target words (antennae, habitat, legs, survive) consistently and point to visual references every time.\n\n- **Real-World Connection:** If possible, take students outside to a grassy area and search for grasshoppers or other insects. This grounds the lesson in authentic observation. Ask: *\"Why are grasshoppers here? What food can they find?\"*\n\n- **Inclusivity:** Ensure visual aids are large and clear. Pair students strategically. Allow responses through drawing, gestures, or words depending on English language proficiency and communication needs.\n\n- **Assessment Timing:** Do not rush the Evaluate phase. If students need more exploration, extend the Explore phase and complete Evaluate in a follow-up session. It's more important for students to develop genuine understanding than to \"finish\" quickly.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is designed to be reusable and adaptable to your classroom context. Adjust pacing and materials as needed based on student engagement and readiness.**",
