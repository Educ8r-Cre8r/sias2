Identify and label the main parts of a squash fruit and explain the function of seeds in plant reproduction.\n2. Describe the life cycle of a squash plant, including the stages of birth, growth, reproduction, and death.\n3. Observe and record variations in seed size, shape, and number among different squash fruits, recognizing these as inherited traits.\n4. Explain why seeds are important for creating new plants and how the fruit protects seeds.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about plant reproduction by examining actual squash fruit halves and connecting to their prior knowledge of seeds.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Two halved squash fruits (butternut, acorn, or delicata squash—cut lengthwise by teacher ahead of time)\n- Display chart or whiteboard\n- Camera or document camera (optional, for projecting close-up views)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board. Ask students to observe the two squash halves silently for 15 seconds, then turn to a partner and describe what they see without using the word \"seed.\"\n\n2. **Facilitate whole-group discussion** using these guiding questions:\n   - \"What do you notice inside the squash? What are those parts, and why do you think they're there?\"\n   - \"If I planted one of these small parts in soil, what do you think might happen?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen seeds before? Where? What were they doing?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this fruit might need so many seeds inside it?\"\n\n3. **Introduce a wonder prompt:** \"I wonder if every squash has the same number of seeds inside, or if some have more and some have fewer. How could we find out?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on the board under \"What We Think Will Happen.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become seed scientists. We'll look closely at real squash fruits, count and compare the seeds, and figure out how squash plants make baby squash plants.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate squash fruit anatomy and seeds through direct observation, measurement, and data collection.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 3-4 different squash fruits (butternut, acorn, delicata, or similar varieties), pre-cut in half lengthwise by teacher\n- Paper plates (one per student or pair)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Ruler (inches or centimeters)\n- Student recording sheets (template below)\n- Spoons for scooping seeds\n- Paper towels\n- Optional: large zip-lock bags for storing seeds\n\n**Student Recording Sheet Template:**\n\n| Squash Type | Number of Seeds | Approximate Fruit Size (inches/cm) | Seed Size: Small / Medium / Large | Shape of Seeds (circle, oval, other) | What I Notice About the Seed Coat |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Butternut | | | | | |\n| Acorn | | | | | |\n| (etc.) | | | | | |\n\n**Activity (Step-by-Step Student Directions):**\n\n1. **Observe the outside of the fruit:** Using your hand lens, look at the skin (rind) of your squash half. Feel it. Draw or describe what you see. Why might a fruit need a thick skin?\n\n2. **Look inside the fruit cavity:** Peer into the hollow center where seeds are clustered. What color are the seeds? What do you notice about how they're arranged? Are they loose or stuck to something?\n\n3. **Scoop out seeds carefully:** Use a spoon to gently scoop out all seeds from your squash half into a paper plate. Separate seeds from the stringy, fibrous material around them.\n\n4. **Count and record:** Count all the seeds from your squash. Write the number on your recording sheet. Compare your number with a partner's squash—are they the same or different?\n\n5. **Measure seed size:** Using a ruler, measure the length of 3-5 seeds. Are they all the same size? Record whether seeds are small, medium, or large.\n\n6. **Observe seed appearance:** Look at seeds with the hand lens. Draw one seed. Describe the color, texture, and shape. Is the seed coat smooth or bumpy?\n\n7. **Compare across fruits:** If you have access to different squash varieties, repeat steps 1-6 with another type. What's different? What's the same?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among student pairs, asking open-ended questions: \"Why do you think the fruit has a hard skin?\" \"Do all seeds look identical?\" \"What might these seeds need to grow?\"\n- Assist with counting and measurement without providing answers.\n- Encourage students to make predictions: \"If you plant this seed, what will grow?\"\n- Take photos of student observations for later use in the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that squash fruits contain multiple seeds of varying (though similar) sizes.\n- Students recognize that the fruit protects seeds and holds them together.\n- Students collect and record numerical and descriptive data.\n- Students compare variations in seed quantity and appearance across different squash types.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and connect observations to plant life cycles and inherited traits.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Life cycle diagram (teacher-prepared or digital, showing: seed → sprout → plant with leaves → flowering plant → fruit with seeds → death/decomposition)\n- Vocabulary poster or chart paper\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: life cycle images of actual squash plants at different stages\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share findings from Explore:** Invite 3-4 pairs to share their data. Ask:\n   - \"What was the most seeds anyone found? The least?\"\n   - \"Did different squash types have different numbers of seeds?\"\n   - \"Why might that be?\"\n\n2. **Introduce plant life cycle vocabulary** using the diagram:\n   - **Birth/Germination:** When a seed gets water and warmth, it wakes up and sprouts a tiny root and shoot.\n   - **Growth:** The plant gets bigger, develops leaves, and grows roots deeper into soil.\n   - **Reproduction:** The plant flowers and makes fruit with seeds inside (this is how plants make babies!).\n   - **Death/Decomposition:** When the plant gets old, it dies and breaks down, returning nutrients to the soil.\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph:** \"The squash halves you see have been through most of the life cycle. The plant flowered, the flower became a fruit, and now that fruit is full of seeds. These seeds are ready for the next life cycle to start.\"\n\n4. **Introduce inheritance and variation:**\n   - **Inherited trait:** A characteristic passed from parent plants to baby plants through seeds. For example, all squash from squash parents will be squash.\n   - **Variation:** Small differences among organisms of the same kind. You noticed some squash have more seeds than others, or seeds of slightly different sizes. This is variation—it's natural!\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Can anyone explain why a plant makes so many seeds?\"\n   - \"If you planted one of these seeds, would it grow a squash plant or a tomato plant? Why?\"\n   - \"What are the four stages in a plant's life?\" (Students should be able to name or describe: birth, growth, reproduction, death.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|---|---|\n| **Germination** | When a seed starts to grow and sends out a tiny root and shoot. |\n| **Life cycle** | The stages a living thing goes through: birth, growth, making babies (reproduction), and death. |\n| **Reproduction** | When plants or animals make new copies of themselves. For plants, this happens when flowers turn into fruits with seeds. |\n| **Inherited trait** | A characteristic that a baby plant or animal gets from its parents. All squash plants make squash fruits because that trait is inherited. |\n| **Variation** | Small differences between individuals of the same kind. Some squash are bigger, some have more seeds—that's variation. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and describe the four stages of a plant's life cycle.\n- Students understand that seeds are the way plants reproduce and create new plants.\n- Students recognize that inherited traits (like \"being a squash plant\") and variations (like different seed numbers) are normal in nature.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of plant life cycles and inheritance to design and plan a seed-growing investigation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Seeds saved from Explore phase (or fresh seeds if preferred)\n- Small pots or recycled containers (yogurt cups with drainage holes)\n- Potting soil\n- Water\n- Labels and markers\n- Observation journal or chart\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the challenge:** \"We're going to be seed scientists and grow our own squash plants from the seeds we examined. But first, we need to make a plan. What do you think seeds need to germinate and grow? What conditions help them?\"\n\n2. **Brainstorm and record:** Guide students to identify factors: water, warmth, soil, light. Create a class prediction chart:\n\n| Stage of Life Cycle | What the Plant Needs | How We'll Provide It |\n|---|---|---|\n| Birth (Germination) | Water, warmth, soil | We'll water the soil and keep pots in a warm place |\n| Growth | Water, light, nutrients in soil | We'll water regularly and place pots by a window |\n\n3. **Plant seeds (hands-on):**\n   - Students fill small pots with moist potting soil.\n   - Each student plants 2-3 seeds about ½ inch deep.\n   - Students label their pot with their name and the planting date.\n   - Place pots in a warm, well-lit location (windowsill is ideal).\n\n4. **Plan observations:** Distribute observation journals. Explain that students will observe and record:\n   - Days until first sprout appears (birth/germination stage)\n   - Number of leaves as plant grows\n   - Changes in size and color\n   - Predictions about when flowering might occur\n\n5. **Connect to life cycle:** \"As we watch these seeds grow over the next weeks, we'll see the birth and growth stages of the squash life cycle right in our classroom!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide the planting process and ensure proper seed depth and soil moisture.\n- Establish a watering schedule and assign student water monitors.\n- Take photos of pots at the start for before-and-after comparisons.\n- Prepare students for the possibility that not all seeds will germinate (discussing variation and probability naturally).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully plant seeds and create an ongoing observation log.\n- Students develop questions about what happens next in the life cycle: \"When will it flower?\" \"How long until we get squash?\"\n- Students understand that germination and growth require specific conditions (water, warmth, light).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant life cycles, seed function, and trait variation through multiple formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n- **Observation notes:** As students explored squash fruits, did they identify seeds, describe fruit structure, and make comparisons?\n- **Questioning during Explain:** Listen for students' ability to name life cycle stages and explain why plants make seeds.\n- **Recording sheets:** Review data sheets to see if students recorded counts, measurements, and descriptions accurately.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (administered at the end of session or next day):**\n\nProvide each student with a small diagram of a squash fruit (or use a photo similar to the lesson image). Students respond to these prompts:\n\n1. **Label the diagram** with these words: *seed, fruit, skin*. (Assess: Can students identify structures?)\n\n2. **Answer in complete sentences:**\n   - \"Why does a squash fruit have so many seeds inside?\" (Assess: Understanding of reproduction and survival strategy)\n   - \"Name two things you noticed that were different between the squash fruits we examined.\" (Assess: Recognition of variation and inherited traits)\n   - \"A squash seed is planted in soil with water and light. What stage of the plant's life cycle is this? What do you think will happen next?\" (Assess: Understanding of germination and life cycle sequence)\n\n3. **Optional—Draw and label:** \"Draw the life cycle of a squash plant. Label: birth, growth, reproduction, death.\" (Assess: Visual understanding of full cycle)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students correctly identify and label seed, fruit, and skin on a diagram.\n- Students explain that seeds are for making new plants and/or for spreading the plant species.\n- Students describe at least two differences observed in squash fruits (seed number, size, shape, etc.).\n- Students correctly name a life cycle stage (germination/birth) and predict what comes next.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that seeds have inherited traits (all make squash) and show variation (different sizes/numbers).\n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- All three learning objectives are met if students can:\n  1. Identify fruit and seed parts and explain that seeds make new plants.\n  2. Name the four life cycle stages and match observed squash to the reproduction stage.\n  3. Describe variations in seed traits and explain these as natural differences (inherited trait with variation).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-label diagrams:** Provide life cycle illustrations with terms already labeled. Students match descriptions to labels instead of generating labels independently.\n\n2. **Sentence stems for writing:** Offer frame sentences such as: \"Seeds are important because ___.\" \"The fruit protects ___.\" \"Two squash were different because ___.\" Students complete the sentences using word banks.\n\n3. **Peer pairing:** Pair students with strong observers during the Explore phase. The support student records while the stronger student counts and observes, then they switch roles.\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Provide multiple-choice options. For example: \"Why do plants make seeds? A) To make the plant pretty  B) To make new plants  C) To feed animals.\" Students circle the correct answer and copy the sentence.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate seed dispersal:** \"How do you think squash seeds get from the fruit into the soil to grow? Research and draw three ways seeds can travel (wind, water, animals eating fruit). Which method do you think works best for squash?\"\n\n2. **Calculate and graph:** Provide seed count data from multiple squash fruits. Students create a bar graph showing variation in seed quantity across different specimens, then write a conclusion about why variation might be important for plant survival.\n\n3. **Life cycle timeline project:** Students create a detailed timeline of a squash plant's life cycle from seed to death, including time estimates for each stage (e.g., \"Germination: 7–10 days,\" \"Growth: 6–8 weeks,\" \"Reproduction: 2–3 weeks\"). They research realistic timeframes and present findings.\n\n4. **Comparative study:** Students examine seeds from multiple plant types (bean, pumpkin, sunflower, lettuce). They hypothesize whether plants that make more seeds vs. fewer seeds have different survival advantages. Design a simple experiment to test (e.g., plant equal numbers of different seeds and track germination rates).\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed germination race:** Set up seeds from different squash varieties or plant types in clear containers with moist soil against one side (so seeds are visible). Students predict which will sprout first and check daily, recording germination time. Create a class graph of results and discuss why variation in germination speed might happen (inherited trait variation).\n\n2. **Plant life cycle story:** Students write and illustrate a narrative or comic strip from the perspective of a squash seed. The story follows the seed through germination, growth, flowering, fruit production, and eventually dispersal (or consumption by an animal). This reinforces all four life cycle stages and introduces the concept of seed dispersal.\n\n3. **Community gardening proposal:** Students research what it takes to grow squash plants in a school or community garden. They propose a plan that includes: watering schedule, sunlight needs, when to plant, when to expect harvest, and how to save seeds from mature fruits for next year. This connects reproduction and inheritance to real-world gardening and stewardship.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson transforms a simple photograph into a rich, multi-sensory investigation of plant reproduction and life cycles. Students handle real seeds, make authentic observations, and connect abstract concepts like \"inheritance\" and \"variation\" to tangible examples they've examined themselves. The ongoing seed-growing activity extends learning beyond the lesson, allowing students to witness germination and early growth firsthand—bringing the life cycle model they studied to living, observable reality.",
