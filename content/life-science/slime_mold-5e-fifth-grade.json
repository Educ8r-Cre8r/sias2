ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about this unusual organism and activate prior knowledge about living things and decomposition.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, high-quality projection or printed copy of the slime mold photograph (at least 11x14 inches)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: magnifying glasses for students to examine the photo up close\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently without explanation. Ask students to observe silently for 20 seconds while you circulate.\n\n2. **Pose initial wonder questions** (write student responses on chart paper):\n   - \"What do you think this yellow thing is? Is it alive?\"\n   - \"Where do you think it came from? Why is it yellow?\"\n   - \"What might it eat or need to survive?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen anything like this in your yard or garden?\"\n\n3. **Listen for misconceptions** (e.g., \"It's a fungus\" or \"It's not alive because it doesn't move like animals\"). Acknowledge all responses without correcting yet.\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"Some people call this a 'mystery organism.' I'm going to give you a clue: it eats dead leaves and wood. Make a prediction—what job do you think this organism has in nature? Why might that be important?\"\n\n**Transition:** \n\"Today, we're going to explore this mystery organism by creating our own version and watching how it behaves—just like real scientists do!\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposer behavior and matter transformation through a hands-on slime mold model.\n\n**Materials per student group (groups of 3-4):**\n- 1 clear plastic cup or shallow dish (4-6 oz)\n- 2 tablespoons of oatmeal or crushed cereal (representing dead plant matter)\n- 2-3 tablespoons of wet sand or soil (moist but not waterlogged)\n- 1 tablespoon of water or mist bottle\n- 3-4 small pieces of dried leaves or plant scraps\n- 1 plastic spoon\n- 1 observation sheet (simple template with drawings/labels)\n- Optional: ruler for measuring spread\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud; post visually):**\n\n1. **Create the habitat:** Mix the wet sand/soil with oatmeal in the cup. This represents the forest floor with dead plant material.\n\n2. **Add the food source:** Scatter dried leaf pieces and plant scraps on top of the mixture.\n\n3. **Add moisture:** Spray or sprinkle water lightly over the top until the surface is moist (like a damp forest floor after rain).\n\n4. **Predict:** Draw or write what you think will happen over the next 24 hours. Will anything change? Why?\n\n5. **Observe:** Place cups in a dim, cool location (not in direct sunlight). Students will observe daily for 2-3 days.\n\n6. **Record observations:** Each day, students sketch the mixture and note:\n   - Is anything growing?\n   - What color is it?\n   - Where is it growing most?\n   - Is anything disappearing? (Focus on the leaves/plant material)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: *\"What do you notice about where the growth is happening? Why do you think it's growing on that dead leaf instead of the soil?\"*\n- Do **not** tell students \"that's a slime mold.\" Let them discover.\n- Encourage observation without judgment. If growth is slow, normalize this: *\"Real scientists sometimes have to wait patiently for results.\"*\n- Use the mist bottle to help struggling groups maintain moisture without oversaturating.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Within 24-48 hours, students should observe visible fungal or mold-like growth (if not actual slime mold, this still demonstrates decomposition).\n- Students notice growth is attracted to organic matter (leaves, oatmeal).\n- Students begin to question *why* something is growing and *what it's doing* to the dead material.\n- Observation sheets show evidence of daily monitoring and emerging patterns.\n\n---\n\n## 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student observations to the ecosystem role of decomposers.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for vocabulary\n- The original slime mold photograph (display again)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: short video clip (2-3 minutes) of a real slime mold growing in time-lapse (search \"slime mold time lapse\" on YouTube)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 3-4 student groups to share what they observed:\n   - *\"What changed in your cup from Day 1 to Day 2?\"*\n   - *\"Did the dead leaves look different? How?\"*\n   - *\"Where did the growth seem to start?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce the organism:** Show the original photograph again. Say: *\"This is a real slime mold—one of nature's most interesting decomposers. Decomposers are living things that break down dead plants and animals. This yellow jelly-like organism is the slime mold hard at work!\"*\n\n3. **Play the time-lapse video** (2-3 minutes) if available. Students see the organism spreading and moving. Pause to highlight:\n   - The bright yellow color\n   - How it spreads across the forest floor\n   - How it seems to search for food\n\n4. **Introduce key vocabulary** (write each on chart paper with student-friendly definitions):\n\n   - **Decomposer:** A living thing that breaks down dead plants, animals, and other materials, turning them into soil and nutrients.\n   - **Nutrient:** Materials that living things need to grow and survive (like nitrogen and carbon in soil).\n   - **Organic matter:** Dead plants, animals, and waste products—the \"food\" for decomposers.\n   - **Decomposition:** The process of breaking down dead material into smaller pieces and nutrients.\n\n5. **Make explicit connections:**\n   - *\"When a leaf falls in the forest, it doesn't just disappear. Organisms like slime molds break it down. This returns nutrients to the soil.\"*\n   - *\"Remember in the Explore phase, your dead leaves started to look mushy and darker? That's decomposition happening! The slime mold (or mold in your cup) was eating and breaking down the dead material.\"*\n   - *\"Those nutrients go back into the soil, and plants can use them to grow, just like we learned about how plants need materials from the environment.\"*\n\n6. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"Why is it important to have decomposers like slime molds in forests and gardens?\"*\n   - Listen for: Ideas about recycling nutrients, breaking down waste, helping plants grow.\n   - If students struggle, prompt: *\"What would happen if dead leaves never broke down? Where would all those leaves go?\"*\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Decomposer** | A living organism that breaks down dead plants and animals and turns them into nutrients for soil. |\n| **Nutrient** | Food or materials that living things need to grow strong and healthy. |\n| **Organic matter** | Dead plants, animals, leaves, and food scraps—things that were once alive. |\n| **Decomposition** | The process of something breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces. |\n| **Ecosystem** | All the living things and non-living things in an area that work together. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can name and describe the role of decomposers.\n- Students connect their observations (growth on leaves, breakdown of material) to the scientific term \"decomposition.\"\n- Students understand that decomposers return nutrients to the environment for other organisms to use.\n\n---\n\n## 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply decomposer concepts to a new real-world scenario and deepen understanding of matter movement in ecosystems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or cardboard (11x14 inches)\n- Markers, colored pencils, or paint\n- Pictures/illustrations of forest ecosystems (optional: printed images or tablet access)\n- Small index cards with \"Nutrient Journey\" cards (see activity)\n\n**Activity: \"Nutrient Journey Modeling\"**\n\n**Scenario:** *\"An oak leaf falls from a tree in autumn. Help us follow the story of what happens to that leaf and where its nutrients go.\"*\n\n**Student task (in pairs or small groups):**\n\n1. **Create a visual pathway** on large paper showing the journey of nutrients from a dead leaf:\n   - Start: Leaf falls from tree (illustrate with drawing)\n   - Middle: Slime mold/decomposer breaks it down (draw the organism and leaf breaking apart)\n   - End: Nutrients return to soil; new plant roots absorb them (draw roots and new growth)\n\n2. **Label each stage** with:\n   - What the leaf looks like at each stage\n   - Which organism is involved\n   - What is happening to the nutrients\n\n3. **Add details:**\n   - Is the slime mold alive? How do students know?\n   - What materials from the leaf are being recycled? (carbon, nitrogen, minerals)\n   - Where does water fit into this cycle? (Decomposers need moisture; plants need water)\n\n4. **Gallery walk:** Post all diagrams. Students view others' work and place sticky notes with observations or questions.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask clarifying questions: *\"Where did those nutrients go after the leaf broke down? Can you trace a path to where a plant might use them?\"*\n- Help students use scientific vocabulary: *\"Instead of 'broken into pieces,' can you use the word 'decomposed'?\"*\n- Prompt connections to real ecosystems: *\"Have you ever seen a rotting log in the woods? That's decomposition happening!\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Visual models showing the cycle of matter from dead plant → decomposer → soil nutrients → new plant growth.\n- Use of vocabulary terms (decomposer, decomposition, nutrients, organic matter) in labels and explanations.\n- Evidence of understanding that matter is recycled, not lost, in ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n## 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of decomposers, decomposition, and matter cycling.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation checklists during Explore phase: Are students recording daily observations? Noting changes in dead material?\n- Questioning during Explain phase: Can students answer \"Why do decomposers matter?\" and \"What happens to nutrients in dead leaves?\"\n- Elaboration diagrams: Do visual models show understanding of matter cycling and the decomposer's role?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):** Administer after the Elaborate phase. Students respond on an index card or digital form:\n\n**Question 1 (Recall):**\n*\"What is a decomposer? Give one example we learned about.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:** Student names slime mold or another decomposer (fungus, bacteria) and states it breaks down dead material.\n\n**Question 2 (Application):**\n*\"A dead log sits on the forest floor for two years. Why does it get smaller and softer? What organisms are responsible?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:** Student mentions decomposers breaking it down; implies nutrients are released or returned to soil.\n\n**Question 3 (Reasoning):**\n*\"Why is it important for gardens and forests to have decomposers like slime molds?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:** Student indicates that decomposers recycle nutrients, help plants grow, or prevent dead material from piling up; uses at least one vocabulary term.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- 80% of students can define \"decomposer\" and name one example.\n- 75% of students explain that decomposers break down dead material and return nutrients to the environment.\n- 70% of students connect decomposition to ecosystem health (plants need nutrients, forests need to recycle material).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Provide visual vocabulary cards** with pictures of decomposers (mushroom, slime mold, bacteria) and the word written large. Students reference these during discussions and when completing exit tickets.\n\n2. **Simplify the observation sheet** to three checkbox options per day:\n   - ☐ Growth is visible\n   - ☐ Dead material looks mushy/darker\n   - ☐ Yellow/dark color appearing\n   \n   Instead of open-ended writing, students circle or check what they see.\n\n3. **Pair with a strong reader/partner** during the Explain phase so vocabulary is introduced verbally and reinforced through peer discussion. Provide a \"word wall\" poster of the five vocabulary terms on the classroom wall throughout the unit.\n\n4. **Simplify the Elaborate task:** Provide a sentence frame template:\n   - \"The leaf is _____. The decomposer is _____. The nutrients go to _____.\"\n   Students fill in blanks and draw simple pictures rather than create independent diagrams.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Expand the Explore phase:** Have students create *three different conditions* (e.g., dry cup, wet cup, sealed cup) and predict how moisture affects decomposition rate. Graph results over 5 days. Discuss variables and why scientists test multiple conditions.\n\n2. **Research extension:** Ask students to research and present on \"other decomposers\" (earthworms, pill bugs, fungi, bacteria). Create a poster showing different types of decomposers and what they break down. Present to the class.\n\n3. **Model complexity:** Challenge students to include *multiple food chains* in their Elaborate diagram:\n   - Leaf → Slime mold → ??? (What eats the slime mold?)\n   - Or: Leaf → Slime mold → Soil → Plant → Animal\n   \n   Discuss how the ecosystem is interconnected.\n\n4. **Data analysis:** If students tested multiple variables in Explore, have them calculate the *rate of decomposition* (e.g., \"The leaf area decreased by 20% in 3 days\"). Predict when it will be completely decomposed at that rate.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n**1. \"Decomposer Detective\" Outdoor Investigation (30-45 minutes)**\n\nTake students on a guided nature walk to observe decomposition in action:\n- Find a rotting log, leaf litter, or dead plant material.\n- Use magnifying glasses to search for visible decomposers (fungi, mold, insects).\n- Photograph or sketch observations.\n- Students create a field guide entry: *\"I found [organism] on [dead material]. It helps decomposition by [explanation].\"*\n- Connect to lesson: *\"These are slime molds' cousins! They're all part of the decomposition team.\"*\n\n**2. \"Nutrient Recycling in Our Classroom\" (20 minutes, ongoing)**\n\nCreate a visible compost container (clear plastic bin with layers):\n- Add food scraps (vegetable peels), leaves, shredded paper, dirt.\n- Keep moist.\n- Over 2-3 weeks, observe how the material breaks down.\n- Each week, invite students to predict: *\"What do you think happened since last week?\"*\n- Connect to lesson: *\"Real decomposers are working in this bin right now! In a garden compost, this would create nutrient-rich soil for plants.\"*\n\n**3. \"Design a Forest Floor Game\" (45-60 minutes, creative extension)**\n\nStudents create a board game or card game about the flow of matter through decomposers:\n- Example: *\"Leaf Drop\"*—Players move a token (leaf) through stages: whole leaf → partially decomposed → nutrients in soil → absorbed by plant roots.\n- Cards describe what happens at each stage and why.\n- Spaces include decomposer facts.\n- Players who learn the cycle fastest reach the \"New Plant Growth\" finish line.\n- Classmates play the game and review the science concepts.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n**Timing flexibility:**\n- If students want to observe longer than 2-3 days, extend the lesson to 3-4 sessions. The Engage and Explain phases can be condensed if needed.\n- The Elaborate phase can be homework if time is tight.\n\n**Real slime mold vs. mold growth:**\n- True slime molds may not appear in all Explore cups. Standard mold or fungal growth still achieves the learning objectives—both are decomposers breaking down organic matter. Normalize this: *\"Different decomposers work in different ways!\"*\n\n**Safety notes:**\n- Ensure students wash hands after handling soil/cups.\n- If students have mold allergies, provide gloves or assign observation roles (drawing, recording) rather than direct contact.\n\n**Connection to 5-LS2-1:**\n- Emphasize the model of matter movement: Dead organic matter → Decomposer → Nutrients in soil → Absorbed by plants. This directly supports the PE standard about describing matter movement among organisms and the environment.\n\n**Connection to 5-LS1-1:**\n- Use the lesson to reinforce that plants need materials (nutrients) from the environment. Decomposers are essential because they break down dead material and return nutrients plants need from soil (not just air and water).",
