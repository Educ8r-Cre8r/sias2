Describe the basic needs of plants (soil, water, light) and explain how these needs can be met in different types of containers or habitats.\n2. Identify and sequence stages in a plant's life cycle (seed, sprouting, growth) using observations and data collection.\n3. Explain how changing an organism's environment (like using a recycled bottle instead of soil outside) affects its survival and growth.\n4. Design a solution for growing a plant in a recycled container and predict whether the plant will survive based on whether its needs are met.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about plants growing in unusual places and activate prior knowledge about plant habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (8.5\" × 11\" or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Index cards\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice in this picture? What looks different or unusual?\"\n   - \"Where is this plant growing? Is this where plants usually grow?\"\n   - \"What things is the plant using to survive? Where does the soil come from?\"\n   - \"Do you think this plant can grow just as big as a plant growing outside? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Say: *\"I'm wondering: Can a plant survive and grow in a plastic bottle instead of soil in the ground? What does a plant need to stay alive, no matter where it grows?\"* Write student responses on chart paper as a \"Wonder Wall.\"\n\n4. **Connection Statement:** \"Today, we're going to investigate what plants really need to grow—and we'll test if a plant can grow in surprising places, just like the one in this picture!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore this mystery by creating our own bottle gardens.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant needs and design a simple growing system in a recycled container.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- 1 clear plastic bottle (2-liter, cut in half by teacher beforehand—*safety note: use pre-cut bottles*)\n- 2 cups potting soil\n- 1 small plant seedling or 3–5 bean seeds\n- 1 cup water\n- Measuring cup\n- Small spoon or shovel\n- Observation sheet (provided by teacher)\n- Markers for labeling\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** and show students a completed example (like the one in the photograph).\n\n2. **Give step-by-step directions:**\n   - \"Place soil in the bottom of your bottle until it's about 3 inches full.\"\n   - \"Gently place your seedling in the soil, or plant 3 seeds about 1 inch deep.\"\n   - \"Add water slowly until the soil feels damp, like a squeezed sponge.\"\n   - \"Place your bottle in a sunny window.\"\n   - \"Label your bottle with your name and today's date.\"\n\n3. **Have students predict and record** on their observation sheet:\n   - \"What do you think your plant needs to survive?\"\n   - \"Draw what you think your plant will look like in 2 weeks. In 1 month.\"\n\n4. **Observation Documentation:**\n   - Students draw the plant as it looks today.\n   - They write or label: soil, water, plant, sunlight (if visible through window).\n   - They sketch where their bottle will sit.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What happens if a plant doesn't get water?\" \"Why did you put it by the window?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answers; encourage them to think about what they know.\n- Ensure proper soil moisture; avoid overwatering.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students have created a working bottle garden.\n- Students have made a prediction about what the plant needs.\n- Students understand their bottle contains soil, water, and a plant in a sunny location.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to life science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Picture cards showing plant life cycle stages (seed → sprout → seedling → mature plant)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations:** Ask 3–4 students to share their predictions and drawings from the Explore phase. Ask: \"What did you decide your plant needs? Why?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** using the chart and the photograph as visual references:\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|\n   | **Habitat** | A place where a plant or animal lives that has everything it needs to survive. |\n   | **Life Cycle** | The stages a living thing goes through: being born (or sprouting), growing, reproducing, and dying. |\n   | **Adaptation** | When a plant or animal changes or is used in a special way to help it survive in its habitat. |\n   | **Seedling** | A baby plant that has just started to grow from a seed. |\n   | **Survival Needs** | Water, soil, sunlight, and air—things a plant must have to stay alive and grow. |\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph:**\n   - \"This bottle is the plant's habitat. Instead of growing outside in the ground, this plant is growing in soil inside a bottle. Both are habitats!\"\n   - \"The plant in the picture is in the seedling or growth stage of its life cycle. What stages might come next?\"\n   - Point to soil, water, and window light in the photo: \"This bottle has all the survival needs this plant requires.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we took the water away from our bottle plants, what would happen to their life cycle?\"\n   - Ask: \"Is a plastic bottle a good habitat for a plant? Why or why not?\"\n   - Have students give thumbs up/sideways/down to indicate confidence with vocabulary.\n\n**Vocabulary:** (Listed above in chart)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least 3 plant survival needs.\n- Students understand that a habitat is any place with what an organism needs.\n- Students can identify the seedling stage in a plant's life cycle.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts by predicting plant survival in different habitats and designing modifications to their own bottles.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards with habitat scenarios (prepared by teacher)\n- Student bottles from Explore phase\n- Optional add-ons: aluminum foil, cardboard, labels, dark paper\n- Chart paper: \"Will It Survive?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario Card Activity:**\n   Divide class into 4 small groups. Give each group one scenario card:\n   \n   - **Card 1:** \"A bottle garden sitting on a dark shelf with no sunlight. Will the plant survive? Why or why not?\"\n   - **Card 2:** \"A bottle garden in a sunny window that never gets water. Will the plant survive? Why or why not?\"\n   - **Card 3:** \"A bottle garden on a sunny windowsill with water and soil. Will the plant survive? Why or why not?\"\n   - **Card 4:** \"A bottle garden kept outside in the freezing cold all winter. Will the plant survive? Why or why not?\"\n\n2. **Group discussion:** Each group discusses their scenario for 5 minutes. They decide:\n   - Will the plant survive? (Yes/No/Maybe)\n   - What survival need is missing or present?\n   - What evidence supports their answer?\n\n3. **Gallery Walk:** Each group shares their card and prediction with the class (1 minute per group). Post cards on \"Will It Survive?\" chart.\n\n4. **Modification Challenge (optional extension):**\n   - \"Looking at your bottle garden, is there anything you could change or add to help your plant survive better?\"\n   - Students may add a label, move their bottle, or make a plan to care for it (e.g., \"water every 3 days\").\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Listen for accurate reasoning about survival needs.\n- Prompt groups with: \"What survival need does your scenario have? What's missing?\"\n- Affirm evidence-based thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain whether a plant survives based on available survival needs.\n- Students understand that environment directly affects an organism's survival.\n- Students apply their knowledge to new scenarios beyond their own bottle.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant needs, habitats, life cycles, and environmental influence on survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student predictions and explanations during Engage and Explore phases.\n- Listen to group discussions during Elaborate phase for evidence of reasoning about survival needs.\n- Review observation sheets for accurate drawings and predictions.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nDistribute an exit ticket (paper or digital) with these prompts:\n\n1. **Drawing Prompt:** \"Draw your bottle garden and label three things your plant needs to survive.\"\n\n2. **Written Response (teacher scribes for non-readers):**\n   - \"What is the most important thing in your bottle garden for keeping the plant alive? Explain why.\"\n   - \"If you moved your bottle to a dark closet, what would happen to your plant?\"\n\n3. **Sentence Frame:**\n   - \"A good habitat for a plant has _____________, _____________, and _____________.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies 3 survival needs (soil, water, light).\n- ✓ Student explains a logical consequence of removing one need (e.g., no water = plant wilts and dies).\n- ✓ Student understands that habitat quality affects survival.\n- ✓ Student can label their bottle garden drawing with survival needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify at least 2 plant survival needs.\n- 70% of students can explain how changing one environmental factor (water, light) affects plant survival.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that habitats vary but must meet organism needs.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use picture cards alongside words. Use phrase frames: \"A plant needs _____ to _____.\"\n   \n2. **Guided Predictions:** Before Explore, show labeled photos of a healthy plant and a dying plant. Ask: \"What's different? Which one got enough water?\" This pre-teaches concepts before hands-on work.\n\n3. **Sentence Starters for Exit Ticket:** Provide written frames such as:\n   - \"My plant needs water because _____.\"\n   - \"If my plant doesn't get sunlight, it will _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Habitat Design Project:** \"Design a bottle habitat for a different organism (snail, insect, moss). What survival needs does it have? Draw and label your design.\"\n\n2. **Life Cycle Sequencing:** Provide pictures of a plant's life cycle (seed → sprout → seedling → flowering → seed production). Ask students to arrange in order and write a sentence for each stage explaining what's happening.\n\n3. **Observation & Data Collection:** Have students measure and record plant height weekly, graph growth over 4 weeks, and predict final height based on trend.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bottle Garden Care Log (Homework/Ongoing):**\n   Students take home a care log to water and observe their bottle garden for 2 weeks. They record observations twice weekly: plant height, color, number of leaves. Return logs for class discussion about growth patterns and which plants thrived best.\n\n2. **Recycled Materials Habitat Hunt:**\n   Take students on a classroom/hallway \"materials walk.\" Collect recyclables (bottles, containers, jars, egg cartons, paper cups). Discuss: \"Could each of these become a plant habitat? Why or why not?\" Sort by \"Good Habitat\" vs. \"Needs Modification.\"\n\n3. **Life Cycle Story Creation:**\n   Students draw and write a 4-6 panel comic strip showing a plant's life cycle from seed to adult plant, with speech bubbles showing what the plant \"needs\" at each stage. Display in hallway as a gallery.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Preparation:** Pre-cut plastic bottles 1–2 days before the lesson to ensure safety. Use 2-liter bottles for clear visibility of soil and roots.\n- **Sustainability Connection:** Emphasize the environmental benefit of reusing bottles—connect to Earth stewardship standards (optional cross-curricular tie).\n- **Real-World Example:** Show a photo of a community garden using recycled containers, or mention vertical gardens in cities. Ask: \"Why might people grow plants in bottles in cities?\"\n- **Watering Management:** Designate one \"Plant Keeper\" per week to check bottle moisture classroom-wide, preventing over/under-watering.\n- **Follow-up Observation:** Plan brief 5-minute check-ins weekly for 3–4 weeks to observe growth and update life cycle understanding.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson actively engages Third Grade students with a concrete, observable phenomenon while building understanding of plant life cycles, habitat requirements, and how organisms adapt to environmental changes.**",
