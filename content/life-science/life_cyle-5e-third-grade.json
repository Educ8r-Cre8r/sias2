ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of seedlings emerging from soil with eggshells and decomposing plant material.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed via projector, document camera, or printed copies)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small potted plant or seed packet to show students\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Give them 1-2 minutes of silent looking time to observe what they notice.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What different things are happening at the same time?\"\n   - \"Where did these baby plants come from? What helped them get started?\"\n   - \"What is that brown, crushed material around the plants? Why do you think it's there?\"\n   - \"If we watched this spot for a whole year, what do you think might happen to these plants?\"\n\n3. **Invite students to share observations.** Record their ideas on chart paper without correcting them. Listen for any mention of: seeds, soil, water, sunlight, plants growing, plants dying, or changes over time.\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to show you something that starts as one thing and changes into many different things over time. It's called a **life cycle**. What do you predict will happen to these baby plants next? Turn and talk to a neighbor.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become plant scientists and discover the whole story of how plants are born, grow, make new seeds, and eventually return to the soil. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant life cycles through hands-on observation and modeling activities.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bean seeds (dried)\n- Clear cups or small clear containers (one per pair of students)\n- Soil or potting mix\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Paper towels\n- Markers\n- Picture cards or drawings showing plant life cycle stages (optional reference)\n- Magnifying glasses\n- Student observation sheets (see directions below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Plant Observation Setup (8-10 minutes):**\n   - Distribute clear cups, soil, bean seeds, and water to student pairs.\n   - Give clear directions: \"Fill your cup about 2/3 full with soil. Push one bean seed down into the soil about 1 inch deep. Gently spray the soil with water until it's damp but not soaking. We'll watch this cup every day this week.\"\n   - Explain: \"You're starting a plant's life cycle right now. We're going to watch all the stages happen.\"\n\n2. **Document the Starting Point (5 minutes):**\n   - Have students draw or write what they see right now: \"Day 1 of our seed's life.\"\n   - Ask: \"What do you think is happening to the seed underground right now that we can't see?\"\n\n3. **Examine Real-Life Examples (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Show students actual examples of different life cycle stages if available:\n     - A sprouted seed with a root and stem visible\n     - A seedling with leaves\n     - A flowering plant or plant with seed pods\n     - Dried plant material or dead leaves\n   - Let students use magnifying glasses to examine these closely.\n   - For each stage, ask: \"What changed from the stage before this?\"\n\n4. **Life Cycle Sequencing Activity (optional second phase):**\n   - Provide picture cards or have students arrange drawings showing: seed → sprouting → seedling → flowering plant → seed production → death/decomposition.\n   - Ask: \"Put these in order. What comes first? What comes after? Can you explain why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What's different now?\" \"What might happen next?\" \"How does the soil help the plant?\"\n- Do NOT explain the stages yourself; let students observe and wonder.\n- Encourage careful observation: \"Look closely—what tiny details do you notice?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students plant their own seed and make a baseline observation/drawing.\n- Students arrange life cycle stages in logical order.\n- Students make predictions about what will happen to their seed in the coming days.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (16-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and organize student discoveries into the concept of a \"life cycle.\"\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Poster showing the plant life cycle (teacher-made or purchased)\n- Photograph from the lesson introduction\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Picture cards from Explore phase (now labeled)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out from Explore (5-6 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 student pairs to describe what they observed when they examined different plant stages.\n   - Ask: \"What changes did you see? How do we know the plant is alive and growing?\"\n   - Record their observations on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce the Four Stages of a Plant Life Cycle (8-10 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again and point to each visible stage.\n   - Teach vocabulary using a simple, large poster or chart:\n\n   **Stage 1 - Birth/Germination:** \"The seed absorbs water and begins to sprout. A tiny root grows down into the soil to find water.\"\n   \n   **Stage 2 - Growth:** \"The seed sends up a stem and green leaves. The plant grows bigger as it gets sunlight, water, and nutrients from soil.\"\n   \n   **Stage 3 - Reproduction:** \"When the plant is big enough, it makes flowers. The flowers make seeds. These seeds can grow into new plants.\"\n   \n   **Stage 4 - Death/Decomposition:** \"Eventually, the plant becomes old and dies. It breaks down in the soil, and the nutrients return to the earth to help new plants grow.\"\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Point to the eggshells: \"These are like seeds—they're protecting something new inside.\"\n   - Point to seedlings: \"These are in the growth stage. They need soil, water, and sunlight.\"\n   - Point to decaying material: \"This is stage 4. Old plants return to the soil.\"\n   - Say: \"Every living thing goes through a life cycle. All life cycles have the same four things in common: birth, growth, reproduction, and death.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Thumbs up if you can name all four stages of a plant's life cycle.\"\n   - Ask: \"Show me with your fingers: How many main stages are in a plant's life cycle?\"\n   - Ask one pair: \"Can you tell me what stage your seed is in right now?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Life Cycle** | The series of changes an organism goes through from birth to death. |\n| **Germination** | When a seed starts to grow and sprout after absorbing water. |\n| **Growth** | The stage when a plant gets bigger and develops leaves, stems, and roots. |\n| **Reproduction** | When a plant makes flowers and seeds to create new plants. |\n| **Decomposition** | When dead plants break down in the soil and turn into nutrients that help new plants grow. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and describe the four main stages of a plant's life cycle.\n- Students understand that all plants go through the same basic cycle.\n- Students can connect their observations from Explore to formal vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (16-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of plant life cycles by investigating how environmental factors influence growth and by making predictions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student bean cups from Explore phase\n- Water spray bottles\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Chart or graph template for recording observations\n- Optional: beans that have already sprouted (1-2 weeks ahead) at different stages\n- Pictures of plants in different environments (desert plant, rainforest plant, etc.)\n- Student prediction sheets\n\n**Activity Option 1: Growth Investigation Over Time (Ongoing, summarized in this phase)**\n\n1. **Continue Daily Observations (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Show students their bean cups from the Explore phase.\n   - Ask: \"What changes do you notice since we planted these seeds? Look at your original drawing—how is it different now?\"\n   - Have students measure their seedling's height (if sprouted) and record on a simple chart.\n\n2. **Test How Environment Affects Growth (7-10 minutes):**\n   - Explain: \"Plants need certain things to grow. Let's see what happens when we change one thing.\"\n   - Set up a simple comparison:\n     - **Cup A (Control):** Keep in sunny spot with regular watering.\n     - **Cup B (Variable):** Place in a dim corner, same watering.\n     - **Cup C (Variable):** Place in sunlight but give it NO water (for 2-3 days only—IMPORTANT: Check in daily; don't let it dry out completely).\n   - Ask: \"What do you predict will happen to Cup B? What about Cup C? Why?\"\n   - Have students record predictions and check growth over 3-5 days.\n\n3. **Discuss Results (5-8 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Which plant grew the best? Which one struggled? Why do you think that happened?\"\n   - Reinforce: \"Plants can't change where they live, so they need the RIGHT environment to survive. Light, water, and soil are all important.\"\n\n**Activity Option 2: Life Cycle Modeling**\n\n1. **Create a Life Cycle Wheel or Timeline (10-15 minutes):**\n   - Have students draw or assemble a visual model showing all four stages of the plant's life cycle.\n   - Options:\n     - **Life Cycle Wheel:** Draw a circle divided into 4 sections, one for each stage. Draw/label the stage and explain what's happening.\n     - **Timeline:** Draw a line from left to right showing: seed → sprout → growing plant → flowering plant → seeds → death/compost.\n     - **Sentence Strip Sequence:** Write one sentence about each stage and arrange in order.\n   \n   - Include labels and simple drawings or pictures.\n   - Students should explain what the plant looks like and what's happening at each stage.\n\n2. **Share Models (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Have 2-3 students show their models and explain their thinking.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate observations without leading to conclusions. Ask: \"What do you notice about the plants in different locations?\"\n- Help students measure and record data accurately.\n- Encourage scientific thinking: \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe real changes in their planted seeds and record growth over time.\n- Students make evidence-based predictions about how light and water affect plant growth.\n- Students create an accurate visual model of the plant life cycle with all four stages labeled and explained.\n- Students recognize that environmental factors (soil, water, light) influence how plants grow—connecting to 3-LS3-2.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant life cycles and how environment influences growth.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- **Observation:** Watch students during Explore. Can they identify different life cycle stages? Do they make logical predictions?\n- **Questioning:** During Explain and Elaborate, listen to student responses. Can they name the four stages? Can they explain why each stage matters?\n- **Work Samples:** Review student drawings, observation sheets, and life cycle models for accuracy and understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide students with one of these assessment options (choose based on your class level):\n\n**Option A (Drawing + Sentence):**\nStudents draw a plant at two different life cycle stages and complete these sentences:\n- \"This plant is in the _____________ stage because ________________.\"\n- \"The plant needs _____________ to grow.\"\n\n**Option B (Response to Scenario):**\nShow a picture of a young seedling and ask:\n- \"This plant's life will go through four stages. Name them in order: 1._________ 2._________ 3._________ 4._________\"\n- \"If this plant had no sunlight, what would happen? Why?\"\n\n**Option C (Explanation Question):**\n- \"Explain what happens to a plant after it dies. Why is this important for new plants?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding when they can:\n✓ Identify and name all four stages of a plant's life cycle (birth/germination, growth, reproduction, death/decomposition).\n\n✓ Explain what is happening to the plant at each stage using evidence from observations or the photograph.\n\n✓ Describe how at least one environmental factor (water, sunlight, soil) affects plant growth.\n\n✓ Sequence the stages correctly and understand that all plants go through this cycle.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can accurately label and describe all four life cycle stages.\n- Students can explain in their own words why environmental factors matter for plant growth.\n- Students recognize that decomposition allows nutrients to return to soil, supporting the cycle.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Life Cycle Poster:** Provide a pre-made poster or chart showing the four stages with pictures and simple labels. Students point to and name stages rather than creating their own models initially.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames for Explanations:** Offer sentence starters such as:\n   - \"The seed is in the _____________ stage.\"\n   - \"This plant needs _____________ to grow.\"\n   - \"When the plant dies, it _____________.\"\n\n3. **Partner Observation:** Pair struggling learners with stronger partners during the plant observation activity. Assign roles (one draws, one describes; one measures, one records).\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Multiple Plant Species:** Have advanced students plant seeds from different types of plants (bean, pea, lettuce, sunflower) and compare their life cycles. Ask: \"Do all plants have the same four stages? What's the same? What's different?\"\n\n2. **Environmental Factor Testing:** Design a more complex investigation where students test multiple variables simultaneously (e.g., sunlight + water amount + soil type). Have them create graphs showing how each variable affects growth rate.\n\n3. **Decomposition Deep Dive:** Provide advanced students with a small compost bin or jar containing decomposing plant material, soil, and organisms. Have them observe and document how dead plant material breaks down over weeks. Connect this to nutrient cycling and food webs.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Plant a Class Garden (Outdoors or in a Container):**\n   - Plant vegetables or flowers with the class. Track the life cycle of the entire garden from planting through harvest/flowering and eventual decline. Create a photo timeline and display it in the classroom. Discuss: \"How does our garden change with the seasons?\"\n\n2. **Life Cycle of Other Organisms:**\n   - Extend the concept by exploring life cycles of other living things (butterflies, frogs, chickens). Create compare/contrast charts: \"What do all life cycles have in common? What's different?\" Tie to 3-LS1-1.\n\n3. **Seed Dispersal Investigation:**\n   - Provide various seeds (maple helicopters, dandelion seeds, burrs, beans) and have students investigate how seeds travel from the parent plant to grow in new places. Create models of different dispersal methods. Connect to how plants survive and spread in nature.\n\n---",
