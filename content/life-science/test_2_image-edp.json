  "content": "# NGSS Engineering Design Process Challenge: Insect Habitat & Movement\n\n---\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n- A large dragonfly (blue-bodied with dark wings) perched on dried grasses and green plant stems\n- Mixed vegetation: green leaves, dried brown stems, and decomposing plant material\n- Natural outdoor habitat with dense plant growth at various stages (living and dead)\n- The dragonfly's wings are clearly visible and positioned at an angle\n- Uneven, cluttered ground-level environment with overlapping plant structures\n\n---\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n1. **From the dragonfly's body and wings**: This insect needs a habitat with plants sturdy enough to perch on and open spaces for flight and hunting.\n2. **From the mixed vegetation (living and dead)**: Insects like dragonflies thrive in habitats where plants provide both shelter and access to water sources (dragonflies lay eggs in water and hunt flying insects).\n3. **From the dense plant structure**: The overlapping stems and leaves create a microhabitat that protects small creatures from wind and predators while allowing movement.\n\n---\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2 Version:**\n**Build a Home for a Dragonfly**\n\nYour job: Create a safe landing spot and hiding place for a dragonfly using sticks, grass, and leaves. Your dragonfly home must:\n- Have a sturdy branch or stick for the dragonfly to land on\n- Have hiding spots made from dried grass or leaves tucked around it\n- Be able to stand up on a table or ground without falling over\n\nTest it: Gently tap the table. Does your home stay standing? Can you hide a toy dragonfly inside?\n\n---\n\n**3-5 Version:**\n**Design a Microhabitat Shelter for Dragonflies**\n\nYour challenge: Engineer a small outdoor shelter (12 inches tall, fitting in a shoebox-sized footprint) that provides:\n1. **Perching structure**: At least two branches or sturdy stems at different heights for landing and resting\n2. **Protection**: Dense plant material (dried grass, leaves, or twigs) that shields from wind but allows entry/exit for flying\n3. **Stability**: Must withstand light wind (test by blowing gently from 1 foot away) without tipping or collapsing\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Structure remains upright after wind test\n- Perches can support a 1-ounce weight (marble or small stick)\n- At least 3 hiding spots visible in the design\n- Materials come entirely from natural outdoor sources or recycled plant matter\n\n---\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis phase fits best because the photo shows a *real organism in its natural habitat*. Students first need to observe and ask: \"What does a dragonfly actually need to survive here? What problems does this insect face in nature?\" This observation-to-question approach naturally leads to defining the engineering problem (how to provide shelter and perching space) rather than jumping straight to building.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Materials\n1. Dry twigs and branches (various thicknesses, 6–12 inches long)\n2. Dried grasses, straw, or hay\n3. Fallen leaves or plant clippings\n4. Small pebbles or sand (for stability/base)\n5. String or twist-ties (optional, for securing structure)\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Time\n- **K-2**: 30–40 minutes (observation + building + testing)\n- **3-5**: 50–70 minutes (observation + planning sketch + building + wind test + redesign/refinement)\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly supports **NGSS ETS1.A** (defining engineering problems by identifying criteria and constraints from observations of the natural world) by grounding design in real insect biology and habitat requirements rather than abstract challenges.",
