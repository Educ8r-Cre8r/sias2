Identify and describe physical adaptations that help snakes survive in their habitats.\n2. Explain how an animal's body structure helps it find food and avoid danger in its environment.\n3. Describe the role of different organisms (plants, animals, decomposers) in an ecosystem by observing a habitat photograph.\n4. Create a model showing how a snake's adaptation helps it interact with its environment.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about animal adaptations and camouflage using the photograph as a mystery.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image or printed photograph of the snake in leaf litter (large format for all to see)\n- Whiteboard or chart paper\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or document camera without immediately identifying the snake. Show it for 10-15 seconds in silence.\n\n2. **Ask students:** \"What do you see in this picture? What's unusual about it? Can you spot anything that doesn't belong here?\"\n   - Allow 2-3 minutes of observation and partner turn-and-talk time.\n\n3. **Pose these discussion questions:**\n   - \"Why might an animal want to blend in with dried leaves and wood?\"\n   - \"What do you think this animal is hunting for? Why would hiding be helpful?\"\n   - \"How do you think this animal's skin color and pattern help it survive?\"\n   - \"If you were a predator, would you see this animal easily? Why or why not?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder why some animals are colored and patterned to look like their surroundings. Let's investigate how animals use their body features to survive.\"\n\n5. **Chart student predictions** on paper: \"What adaptations help animals survive?\" Revisit this at the end of the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to explore animal adaptations up close by investigating how camouflage works in nature.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover how color and pattern help animals hide through a hands-on camouflage investigation.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 printed or laminated photograph of the snake habitat (or display image)\n- 30-40 colored paper cutouts (pre-cut small shapes in these colors: tan, brown, green, black, white, bright red, bright blue) — about 8-10 of each color\n- 1 paper plate or shallow cardboard box\n- Dried leaves, twigs, and soil/sand (or recreate with printed images glued to a base)\n- 1 \"Camouflage Investigation Sheet\" (simple observation form) per student\n- Pencils\n\n**Activity – \"Hidden Animals\" Investigation:**\n\n**Step 1: Prepare the Habitat** (5 minutes)\n- Distribute the \"habitat\" (plate/box with leaves, twigs, soil) to each group.\n- Explain: \"This represents a forest floor where small animals live and hide.\"\n\n**Step 2: Predict** (3 minutes)\n- Show students the colored paper shapes. Ask: \"Which colors would be easiest to hide in this habitat? Which would be hardest to see? Why?\"\n- Students record predictions on their investigation sheet.\n\n**Step 3: Test Camouflage** (10 minutes)\n- One student in each group is the \"predator\"—they leave the room or look away.\n- Other students place 5-6 paper shapes of the same color around the habitat, partially hidden in the leaves and debris.\n- Predator returns and hunts for the shapes for 30 seconds, circling any they find.\n- **Repeat with 2-3 different colors.**\n- Record which colors were found most/least often.\n\n**Step 4: Observe the Real Snake** (4 minutes)\n- Redirect students to the original photograph.\n- Ask: \"Which colors from our investigation does the snake have? Why might those colors help it survive?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Why do you think that color is harder to find?\" and \"What does the snake blend in with?\"\n- Do NOT give answers—let students make their own connections.\n- Encourage group discussion: \"Talk with your team about what you're discovering.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that colors matching the environment are harder to spot.\n- Students recognize that the snake's brown, tan, and gray coloring matches its habitat.\n- Students record data showing which colors were \"caught\" most frequently.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize the concept of adaptation through teacher-led discussion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Picture cards of different snakes and habitats (optional, for visual reference)\n- Vocabulary anchor chart (handwritten or pre-made)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out** (5 minutes)\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their camouflage findings: \"Which color was easiest to hide? Why?\"\n   - Record findings on chart paper showing color and number of shapes found.\n   - Ask: \"How does this help us understand why the snake looks the way it does?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (7 minutes) — Write each term and definition on a chart for reference:\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---------------------------|\n   | **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. |\n   | **Camouflage** | Colors and patterns that help an animal blend in with its surroundings so predators can't see it easily. |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. |\n   | **Predator** | An animal that hunts other animals for food. |\n   | **Prey** | An animal that is hunted by other animals. |\n\n3. **Make Connections** (5 minutes)\n   - Point to the snake in the photograph: \"This snake has brown and gray camouflage. This is an adaptation. It helps the snake hide so it can sneak up on prey like mice and frogs.\"\n   - Ask: \"What is the snake's habitat?\" (leaf litter, decomposing plants, cool forest floor)\n   - Ask: \"Why would a predator like a hawk or raccoon have trouble seeing this snake here?\" (Colors match the dead leaves and wood)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Quick verbal checks: \"Can someone use the word 'camouflage' in a sentence about the snake?\" \n   - Thumbs up/sideways/down: \"Do you think this snake's coloring is an adaptation? Show me.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that adaptations are features that help animals survive.\n- Students can name and define camouflage.\n- Students connect the snake's appearance to its habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply adaptation concepts to new scenarios and deepen understanding of ecosystem relationships.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large drawing paper (1 per group)\n- Colored pencils, markers, crayons\n- Optional: Picture cards of 3-4 different animals (deer, frog, polar bear, owl) and habitats\n- Pre-printed scenario cards (see below)\n\n**Activity – \"Design an Adaptation\" Task:**\n\n1. **Scenario-Based Challenge** (assign one per group or pair):\n\n   - **Scenario A:** \"A small frog lives on green lily pads. What adaptations would help it hide from snakes and birds?\"\n   - **Scenario B:** \"A mouse lives in a wheat field. What colors and patterns would help it survive?\"\n   - **Scenario C:** \"A rabbit lives in a snowy forest. What adaptations would protect it from foxes?\"\n\n2. **Student Task** (12 minutes):\n   - Groups draw and color their animal with adaptations suited to its habitat.\n   - Write 2-3 sentences explaining: \"Why does this animal have these colors/patterns? How do they help it survive?\"\n   - Label the habitat and the adaptation.\n\n3. **Gallery Walk or Share-Out** (3-5 minutes):\n   - Groups present their design to the class, explaining their choices.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why did you choose those colors?\" \"Where in its habitat would this animal hide?\"\n- Affirm connections to camouflage and habitat.\n- Guide without directing: \"What does the animal need to hide from?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply adaptation concepts to a new animal and habitat.\n- Students demonstrate understanding of camouflage as an adaptation strategy.\n- Students explain cause-and-effect relationships between habitat features and animal survival.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of adaptations and camouflage.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Can students identify which colors hide better?\n- Discussion responses during Explain: Can students use vocabulary correctly?\n- Check for Understanding question: \"Can someone use the word 'adaptation' in a sentence?\"\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket** (administer at end of lesson):\n\nProvide each student a simple sheet with 2-3 questions:\n\n1. **Look at this picture of a green caterpillar on a green leaf.** Is the caterpillar's green color an adaptation? Why or why not?\n\n2. **What is camouflage? Give an example from what you learned today.**\n\n3. **The snake in our lesson has brown and tan colors. Explain how this adaptation helps it survive.**\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students correctly identify that the caterpillar's color is an adaptation for camouflage.\n- Students define camouflage using their own words with accuracy.\n- Students explain that the snake's colors match its environment (leaves/wood) and help it hide from predators or sneak up on prey.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Objectives:**\n- Review exit tickets: Look for correct vocabulary use and logical explanations.\n- Check Elaborate task drawings: Did students show understanding of habitat-adaptation matching?\n- Listen to group presentations: Did students explain cause-and-effect?\n- If 80%+ of students answer 2 of 3 exit ticket questions correctly, move forward. If not, revisit camouflage with photographs or videos.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Guided Vocabulary Support:** Pair struggling students with a vocabulary anchor chart during all phases. Allow them to point to and repeat terms rather than recall independently.\n\n2. **Simplified Explore Task:** Instead of testing multiple colors, have these students focus on comparing just two colors (e.g., brown vs. bright blue) to make the discovery clearer.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Elaboration:** Provide sentence starters: \"This animal is _____ colored because _____.\" \"This adaptation helps the animal _____ so it can _____.\" Reduce written output; allow drawing + oral explanation.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Ecosystem Connections:** Ask advanced students to explain how the snake's camouflage connects to the movement of matter in the ecosystem. \"If the snake catches a mouse, where does the energy and matter go?\" Introduce food webs and energy transfer concepts.\n\n2. **Multiple Adaptations Investigation:** Have students research and present on a second adaptation the snake uses beyond camouflage (e.g., heat sensing, behavior like ambush hunting, body shape for slithering). Provide access to age-appropriate online resources or books.\n\n3. **Design Challenge:** \"Design a new animal for a habitat no one has seen before (a volcanic island, a dense jungle). What adaptations would it need? Draw and justify your design scientifically.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Spot the Adaptation\" Habitat Walk:** Take students outside or to a school garden. Challenge them to find real animals (insects, birds, etc.) and identify one adaptation each animal has for surviving in that habitat. Create a class poster: \"Adaptations We Found Outside.\"\n\n2. **Snake Research Project:** Have students research a specific snake species and create a fact card or poster showing: its habitat, its camouflage colors, what it eats, and predators. Tie this to 5-LS2-1 by mapping out the snake's role in a food web.\n\n3. **Camouflage Art Activity:** Students create their own camouflage pattern on paper and hide small objects (beads, paper shapes) in it, then trade with a partner to see if the partner can find all hidden objects. Discuss why some patterns work better than others.\n\n4. **Video Connection:** Show a 5-7 minute nature documentary clip of a snake hunting or hiding in its natural habitat (search \"snake camouflage in nature\" on educational platforms). Pause to discuss observed adaptations.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** If using live snakes, check school policies and ensure proper handling and documentation. This lesson is designed to work equally well with photographs only.\n- **Vocabulary Retention:** Revisit the anchor chart frequently. Use vocabulary in context during other science lessons to reinforce long-term learning.\n- **Connection to 5-LS2-1:** This lesson lays groundwork for food webs and energy flow. In follow-up lessons, use the snake-prey-decomposer relationships visible in the photograph to develop matter movement models.\n- **Misconception Alert:** Students may think camouflage is the only adaptation. Emphasize that snakes have many adaptations (flexible spine, heat pits, fangs, behavior).\n\n---\n\nThis lesson transforms a single photograph into a rich, investigative experience that builds Fifth Grade students' understanding of how animals are structured and function within their environments—core life science ideas aligned with NGSS performance expectations.",
