Identify and name at least three external body parts of an insect and describe what each part helps the insect do.\n2. Explain how an insect's body parts help it survive and get what it needs from flowers.\n3. Describe one way that insects and flowers help each other (pollination/food relationship).\n4. Use materials to design a simple tool or model that shows how an insect's body part helps it do a job.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by observing the photograph of an insect on a flower.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the insect on the daisy flower\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** where all students can see it clearly. Do not explain what they're looking at yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to look carefully** and turn to a partner to share what they notice. Listen to their observations without correcting them.\n\n3. **Use these specific discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? What is it doing?\" (Students identify the insect and its action of being on/visiting the flower.)\n   - \"Look at the insect's body. What parts do you see? Can you point to the legs, the antennae, the body?\" (Students begin identifying external structures.)\n   - \"Why do you think this bug is on the flower? What might the bug want from the flower?\" (Students make predictions about the insect seeking food or shelter.)\n   - \"Do you think the flower wants the bug there? Why or why not?\" (Students begin thinking about relationships between living things.)\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper. Write questions like: \"Why do bugs visit flowers?\" \"What do bugs do on flowers?\" \"Does the flower help the bug?\"\n\n5. **Show enthusiasm:** \"Great questions! Today we're going to be bug detectives and discover how insects use their special body parts and how they help flowers!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's explore and find out more about how bugs and flowers work together.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate insect body parts and their functions through hands-on observation and design activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images or drawings of insects (ant, butterfly, beetle, ladybug) for reference\n- Craft materials: straws, pipe cleaners, yarn, tape, scissors, paper cups or small containers\n- Magnifying glasses (optional)\n- Pictures or real plants/flowers (real or plastic)\n- Student observation sheets (simple picture with labels)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Body Part Discovery (10 minutes):**\n   - Show students 3-4 different insect images (ant, butterfly, beetle, dragonfly).\n   - Ask: \"What body parts do these insects have that are the same? What's different?\"\n   - Students should notice: legs, antennae, body segments, wings, mouth.\n   - Explain that each part helps the insect do something important to survive.\n   - Use the photograph to point out: the long legs help the bug stand on the flower, the antennae help sense food, the mouth helps it drink.\n\n2. **Design a Bug Tool (10-15 minutes):**\n   - Introduce the challenge: \"Insects have special body parts that help them get food and move around. Let's design a tool that works like a bug's body part!\"\n   - Demonstrate: \"If I want to reach flowers like a long-legged bug, I could use a straw as a long leg, or pipe cleaners as antennae.\"\n   - Provide students with craft materials and ask them to design one insect body part tool:\n     - **For legs:** Use straws or pipe cleaners to make a \"reaching tool\" that can touch a flower in the middle of the room.\n     - **For antennae:** Use yarn or pipe cleaners to make sensors that can \"feel\" around.\n     - **For a mouth/proboscis:** Use a straw to simulate how a bug drinks from a flower.\n   - Students should test their tool: Does it help them reach the flower? Can they use it to pick up pollen (glitter or sand)?\n   - Students draw or write labels showing what insect part their tool copies.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask questions: \"What insect part does your tool look like?\" \"How is it helping you?\" \"Can you show me how a real bug uses this part?\"\n- Encourage testing and trying again without correcting designs.\n- Guide with questions rather than answers: \"What if you made it longer? What if you made it wiggle?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a simple tool/model that mimics an insect body part.\n- Students can demonstrate how their tool works.\n- Students begin to understand that body parts have functions that help insects survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration discoveries to concept of adaptation and symbiosis (at an age-appropriate level).\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with body part labels and functions\n- Photograph of insect on flower (displayed again)\n- Picture cards or drawn examples of insect-flower relationships\n- Student vocabulary page with pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask students to share their bug tools with a partner or small group.\n   - Invite 2-3 volunteers to explain their tool to the whole class.\n   - Ask the class: \"How is this tool like a real bug's body part?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n   Create a simple anchor chart showing each term with a picture:\n\n   - **External parts (or body parts):** The parts on the outside of an animal's body that you can see—like legs, antennae, wings, and mouths. These help the animal do important things.\n   \n   - **Adapt or Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. (Show the insect's long legs: \"These long legs are an adaptation that helps the bug reach flowers.\")\n   \n   - **Pollination:** When an insect visits a flower to drink food (nectar), pollen sticks to the insect's body. When the insect visits another flower, the pollen rubs off and helps make new plants. It's a way the insect and flower help each other.\n   \n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy. Animals need food, water, and shelter to survive.\n   \n   - **Nectar:** A sweet juice inside flowers that insects drink for food and energy.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the original photograph again.\n   - Point to and name the body parts: \"See the insect's long legs? That's an external part that helps it stand on the flower. See the thin mouth? That helps it drink nectar from the flower's center.\"\n   - Explain the relationship: \"The insect comes to the flower for food (nectar). As the insect moves to different flowers, pollen sticks to its body and gets shared. This helps new flowers grow! Both the insect and the flower need each other.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can you point to the insect's legs in the picture? What do they help the insect do?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why does the insect visit the flower?\" (For food/nectar)\n   - Ask: \"How do you think the flower helps the insect?\" (Gives it food) \"How does the insect help the flower?\" (Spreads pollen)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **External parts:** The body pieces on the outside of an animal that you can see (legs, antennae, wings, mouth).\n- **Adaptation:** A body part or thing an animal does that helps it stay alive in its home.\n- **Pollination:** When an insect carries pollen from one flower to another, helping plants make new plants.\n- **Nectar:** Sweet juice inside flowers that insects and other animals drink for energy.\n- **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least two insect body parts and say what they do.\n- Students understand that insects visit flowers for food.\n- Students have a basic understanding that insects and flowers help each other.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new scenario and think about how different insect body parts solve different problems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards showing different insects (bee, butterfly, ant, grasshopper, ladybug)\n- Picture cards showing different flowers (tall flowers, flowers with small openings, ground flowers, flowers with landing spots)\n- Chart paper labeled \"Bug Detectives: Match the Bug to the Flower\"\n- Real or artificial flowers and insects (optional, for hands-on matching)\n- Drawing paper and crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option 1: Bug-to-Flower Matching Investigation**\n\n1. Show students pictures of 4-5 different insects and 4-5 different flowers.\n\n2. Ask: \"Different bugs have different body parts. Do you think every bug can visit every flower? Let's find out!\"\n\n3. Guide students to think about:\n   - A butterfly has a long, thin mouth. It needs flowers with deep centers.\n   - An ant is small and crawls. It can visit ground flowers.\n   - A bee has short legs and is round. It lands on flat flowers.\n\n4. Have students work in pairs or small groups to match insects to flowers based on body parts and flower shape.\n\n5. Ask them to explain: \"Why do you think this bug goes to that flower? What body parts does the bug use?\"\n\n**Option 2: Design Your Own Bug**\n\n1. Show students the challenge: \"We're going to design a brand-new bug! What special body parts would YOUR bug need to visit a flower and get food?\"\n\n2. Students draw or build (with craft materials) their own imaginary insect.\n\n3. Have them label at least three body parts and write or tell what each part helps the bug do.\n\n4. Students share their bug and explain how it would visit and help a flower.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What does your bug's body part do?\" \"How is it like a real bug?\" \"Would this bug be able to reach a tall flower? Why or why not?\"\n- Validate creative thinking while connecting back to real animal adaptations.\n- Encourage students to test their ideas: \"Could your bug land on this flower?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different insects have different body structures suited to different flowers.\n- Students apply the concept of adaptation to new scenarios.\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding by explaining the relationship between insect body parts and plant features.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of insect body parts, their functions, and the relationship between insects and flowers.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n- Observe student explanations during the Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Listen to student responses to questions: Can they name body parts? Can they explain what the parts do? Can they describe how insects help flowers?\n- Review student drawings and tools created during exploration for evidence of understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with a simple worksheet or conduct a quick individual interview using these prompts:\n\n1. **\"Look at this picture of a bug on a flower. Point to one part of the bug's body and tell me what it helps the bug do.\"** (Students point and explain; you record their answer.)\n\n2. **\"Why do you think the bug is visiting this flower? What does the bug need from the flower?\"** (Students should mention food or nectar; accept answers like \"to eat,\" \"to drink,\" \"it's hungry.\")\n\n3. **\"How does the flower help the bug? How does the bug help the flower?\"** (Students should mention: flower gives food/nectar to bug; bug helps spread pollen to make new flowers. Accept simplified answers.)\n\n4. **Draw Challenge:** \"Draw an insect and label one body part that helps it survive. Tell me what that part does.\" (Students draw and label; you can scribe their explanation.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Students can identify and name at least two external body parts of an insect.\n\n✓ Students can explain how at least one body part helps the insect (e.g., \"legs help it stand,\" \"mouth helps it drink\").\n\n✓ Students understand that insects visit flowers for food.\n\n✓ Students make a simple connection between insects and flowers helping each other.\n\n✓ Students can describe a body part's function when prompted with a picture or model.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will demonstrate foundational understanding of insect body parts and basic survival needs.\n- Students will show emerging understanding of how insects and flowers interact.\n- Advanced students will make more sophisticated connections about adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for students who need additional scaffolding):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visuals:** Use only the most essential terms (legs, antennae, mouth, flower, food, help). Pair each word with a large, clear picture. Allow students to point instead of saying words aloud initially.\n\n2. **Hands-on body part identification:** Provide students with a large laminated insect image and let them place sticky notes or point out body parts one at a time. Work one-on-one to connect each part to a simple function (\"These legs help the bug climb\").\n\n3. **Guided exploration:** During the design phase, provide a pre-made template or starting point. Instead of designing from scratch, students modify an existing tool. Example: provide a straw and ask them to add pipe cleaners to make it more like an insect.\n\n4. **Scripted responses:** Offer sentence frames for explanations:\n   - \"This is a _____ (insect body part). It helps the bug _____.\"\n   - \"The bug visits the flower to _____.\"\n   - \"The flower helps the bug because _____.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Compare and contrast insect adaptations:** Provide images of multiple insects (bee, butterfly, dragonfly, ant, grasshopper) and ask: \"Which bug would be best at visiting a tall flower? Which would be best at visiting a ground flower? Why?\" Have students sort by adaptation and explain their reasoning in writing or verbally.\n\n2. **Research and report:** Introduce students to a specific insect-flower relationship (e.g., bees and clover, butterflies and milkweed). Have students find pictures, draw, and write/tell what they learn about how the insect and flower help each other.\n\n3. **Design a solution:** Pose a problem: \"A flower is hard for insects to reach. Design a body part for an insect that would help it visit this flower.\" Students design, build, test, and refine their model, explaining their thinking.\n\n4. **Parent-offspring comparison:** Connect to 1-LS3-1 by asking: \"Do you think a baby insect has the same body parts as a grown-up insect? Why or why not?\" Show pictures of insect larvae and adults to prompt discussion about how animals change as they grow.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bug Hunt and Flower Hunt:** Take students on a nature walk to observe real insects visiting flowers (if in season) or photos of insects in nature. Have them collect observations: What bugs did they see? What flowers were the bugs on? What body parts did they notice? Create a class chart of their findings.\n\n2. **Life Cycle of a Pollinator:** Extend learning to 1-LS1-2 by reading a picture book about the life cycle of a bee or butterfly (e.g., *From Flower to Bee* or *The Very Hungry Caterpillar*). Discuss how baby insects grow and change, and how their behaviors help them survive and pollinate plants.\n\n3. **Interactive Pollination Game:** Play a hands-on game where students are \"insects\" and move around a room visiting \"flowers\" (stations with paper flowers). As they visit, they collect pollen (glitter, stickers, or yarn) and deliver it to the next flower. Afterward, discuss what happened and connect it back to real pollination.\n\n---",
