ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity about the relationship between insects and flowers using the photograph.\n\n#### Materials\n- Large, printed copy of the photograph (or displayed digitally on a screen/projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display the Photograph:**\nShow the image prominently where all students can see. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n**Guided Discovery Questions (ask these one at a time, allowing think-pair-share time):**\n\n1. **\"What do you see in this picture? Tell your neighbor one thing you notice.\"** \n   *(Students observe the flower, insect, and colors.)*\n\n2. **\"Look at the bug on the flower. What parts of the bug can you see? Can you find its legs? Its long, thin antennae?\"**\n   *(Draw attention to external body parts.)*\n\n3. **\"Why do you think this bug came to visit this flower? What might the bug want from the flower?\"**\n   *(Activate prior knowledge about insects and food.)*\n\n4. **\"What parts of the flower do you notice? What color is the center? Why might those bright colors help the flower?\"**\n   *(Guide students to think about attraction.)*\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n\"Today we're going to discover how bugs and flowers need each other. Let's find out what this bug is doing and why it came to this flower!\"\n\n#### Transition\nNow that we're curious about bugs and flowers, let's explore how insects actually use their body parts to visit flowers!\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate how insect body parts function and how insects interact with flowers through hands-on exploration.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Per student or pair:**\n  - Pipe cleaners (6–8 per student)\n  - Small foam ball or crumpled paper ball (to represent the flower's center)\n  - Small paper cup or flower cutout shape\n  - Tape\n  - Optional: illustrations of insects with labeled body parts (antennae, legs)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Station Setup: Build-an-Insect Model**\n\n**Teacher Directions:**\nSet up 2–3 exploration stations, each with materials listed above. Rotate students in small groups (4–5 students per station, about 5–7 minutes each).\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions (keep them simple and verbal):**\n\n1. **\"Take 2 pipe cleaners and twist them to make the insect's antennae. Stand them up.\"**\n2. **\"Take 4 more pipe cleaners. Bend them into legs—2 on the left, 2 on the right of your body (foam ball or crumpled paper).\"** \n   *(Teacher demonstrates; students copy.)*\n3. **\"Now tape your body and legs together.\"**\n4. **\"Place your paper cup or flower cutout in front of you. Can your insect reach the 'flower center' (small foam ball) with its long antennae?\"**\n5. **\"Walk your insect around the flower. Can it use its legs to climb? Can it feel the flower with its antennae?\"**\n\n**Connection to the Photograph:**\n\"Look at the bug in our picture. It has long antennae like your model. The bug uses these to find flowers and feel around. Insects also have many legs to help them climb and balance on flowers—just like your model.\"\n\n**What Students Should Record/Document:**\n- Drawings of their model insect next to a flower drawing\n- A sentence dictated to the teacher or parent volunteer: *\"My insect has _____ legs and _____ antennae to help it visit flowers.\"*\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate to each station; listen to student thinking.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"What is your insect using to find the flower?\"* or *\"Which body parts help your bug climb?\"*\n- Do NOT tell students the answer; let them discover through manipulation.\n- Offer tape, help with twisting pipe cleaners, but let students direct the building.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students will create a simple insect model with recognizable legs and antennae.\n- Students will verbalize that antennae and legs are useful for finding and visiting flowers.\n- Students will show curiosity about how the model insect interacts with the flower prop.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nFormalize vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration; connect findings back to the original photograph.\n\n#### Materials\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary (pre-written or written during discussion)\n- Pictures of 2–3 common insects (ant, bee, ladybug) visiting flowers (can be simple clip art)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share & Discussion:**\n\nGather students in a circle or on the carpet.\n\n1. **Review the Explore Phase (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: *\"What did your insect model have? Can you show me with your fingers how many legs?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"What did your antennae help your insect do?\"*\n   - Record student responses on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary with Visuals (5 minutes):**\n\n   Display the original photograph alongside your student-created definitions.\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n\n   - **Antennae** (pronounced an-TEN-ee): Long, thin feelers on an insect's head that help it find food and smell flowers. *(Point to the insect's antennae in the photo.)*\n   \n   - **Legs:** Body parts insects use to walk, climb, and balance on flowers. *(Count the legs visible in the photo—most insects have 6.)*\n   \n   - **Body Parts:** The different pieces of an insect or flower that help it survive and do its job.\n   \n   - **Habitat:** A place where plants and animals live and find food and water. *(Point to the flower and garden in the photo.)*\n   \n   - **Pollination** (optional for First Grade, but simple): When an insect visits a flower and carries yellow powder (pollen) that helps the flower make seeds. *(Show the yellow pollen visible on the insect in the photo.)*\n\n3. **Connection Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   \n   Display the original image again.\n   \n   - *\"Look closely. Can you see the long, thin antennae on this bug? Yes! Just like your models.\"*\n   - *\"How many legs do you see? Let's count together.\"*\n   - *\"The bug is using its legs to hold on to the flower. Its antennae help it find the yellow center where it can eat sweet nectar.\"*\n   - *\"The flower is bright yellow and white. Why do you think the flower is so colorful?\" (To attract insects.)*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   \n   Ask quick yes/no and simple-answer questions:\n   - *\"Do antennae help insects find flowers? Yes!\"*\n   - *\"What do legs help insects do?\" (Walk, climb, balance.)*\n   - *\"Why does this bug visit flowers?\" (To find food.)*\n\n#### Vocabulary\n- **Antennae:** Long, thin feelers on an insect's head that help it find food and sense its world.\n- **Legs:** Body parts that help insects walk, climb, and balance.\n- **Flower:** A plant part that is colorful and makes seeds; insects visit flowers for food.\n- **Habitat:** The place where a plant or animal lives and finds what it needs.\n- **Nectar:** Sweet juice inside flowers that insects drink for energy (food).\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students can name 2–3 body parts of insects and explain what each does.\n- Students understand that insects visit flowers to find food.\n- Students can describe the connection between the insect's body parts and its ability to visit flowers.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply their understanding by creating and designing a scenario showing insects and flowers working together.\n\n#### Materials\n- Large paper or cardstock (one per student or pair)\n- Colored pencils, crayons, markers\n- Magazines or printed pictures of insects and flowers (optional)\n- Glue sticks and scissors\n- Real flower pictures or pressed flowers (if available, optional)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Design a Garden: Insect-Flower Match-Up**\n\n**Teacher Directions:**\n\nExplain: *\"You're going to be a garden designer! You'll show how insects and flowers help each other in a garden.\"*\n\n**Student Task (choice-based):**\n\n**Option A (Drawing):**\n- Draw a simple flower with bright colors and a visible center.\n- Draw an insect near or on the flower with antennae and legs clearly shown.\n- Label or dictate: *\"The [insect name] uses its [body part] to visit the [flower name].\"*\n\n**Option B (Collage):**\n- Cut out pictures of flowers and insects from magazines or printed handouts.\n- Glue them onto paper to show an insect visiting a flower.\n- Dictate or write: *\"This bug helps the flower by...\"* (Teacher fills in or student dictates.)\n\n**Option C (Story/Narrative):**\n- Draw a 3-panel comic strip:\n  - Panel 1: An insect looking for food.\n  - Panel 2: The insect finding a flower.\n  - Panel 3: The insect on the flower eating nectar.\n- Dictate a sentence for each panel to the teacher or a parent volunteer.\n\n**Connection to Learning Objectives:**\nStudents are demonstrating how insects use their external parts (legs, antennae) to find and visit flowers, and how this interaction helps both organisms.\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate and ask prompting questions: *\"What body parts is your insect using to stay on the flower?\"* or *\"Why did you choose a bright color for your flower?\"*\n- Scribe dictated sentences for students who are pre-writers.\n- Celebrate choices and reasoning: *\"You made the flower bright yellow! That's smart—insects can see bright colors!\"*\n- No \"correct\" answer; focus on reasoning and evidence.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students create a visual representation showing an insect interacting with a flower.\n- Students explain (verbally or through dictation) how the insect's body parts help it visit the flower.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that the interaction benefits both organisms (the insect gets food; the flower gets pollinated).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of insect body parts, plant-insect interaction, and how organisms use external features to survive.\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Listen to student explanations during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Observe how students describe the insect's body parts and their functions.\n- Note whether students make the connection between insect body parts and visiting flowers.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (choose one):**\n\n**Option A: Observation & Questioning (5 minutes)**\n\nShow students the original photograph one more time. Ask:\n\n1. *\"Point to the insect's antennae. Tell me what they help the bug do.\"* \n   - **Success:** Student points correctly and says something like, \"They help it find the flower\" or \"They feel stuff.\"\n\n2. *\"Why do you think the insect came to this flower?\"*\n   - **Success:** Student says, \"To find food,\" \"To eat,\" or \"The flower is pretty.\"\n\n3. *\"Show me with your hands how many legs you see on this bug.\"*\n   - **Success:** Student shows 4–6 fingers (bugs have 6, but approximation is acceptable for First Grade).\n\n**Option B: Simple Drawn Response (5 minutes)**\n\nGive each student a paper with a blank flower drawn.\n\n- **Prompt:** *\"Draw an insect on this flower. Show its legs and antennae. Then tell me: Why did the insect visit the flower?\"*\n- **Success Criteria:**\n  - Insect drawing includes visible legs (at least 3–4).\n  - Insect drawing includes antennae.\n  - Student verbally explains insect is finding food, OR student dictates a sentence like, \"The bug came to eat.\"\n\n**Option C: Sorting Activity (5 minutes)**\n\nPrepare index cards with pictures or words (body parts of insects vs. parts of flowers).\n\n- **Insect body parts:** Legs, antennae, body\n- **Flower parts:** Petals, center, stem\n\nStudents sort cards into two piles. Then ask: *\"Which of these help the insect visit the flower?\"* (Legs and antennae.)\n\n- **Success Criteria:** Student correctly sorts most cards and explains connection to visiting flowers.\n\n#### Success Criteria\n- **Met:** Student can name and point to 2 insect body parts, explain what they do, and state that insects visit flowers for food.\n- **Approaching:** Student can name 1 body part and needs prompting to explain its function.\n- **Not Yet:** Student needs significant support naming body parts or understanding the insect-flower relationship.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- **Most students** will identify legs and antennae, and explain that insects use these to visit flowers for food.\n- **Some students** will provide more detailed reasoning about how bright colors attract insects.\n- **All students** will demonstrate awareness that insects and flowers interact and that body parts are important for survival.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Provide a labeled diagram:**\n   - Offer a pre-made picture of an insect with antennae and legs already labeled.\n   - Student task: Circle the body parts or match their model to the labeled diagram.\n   - *Why:* Reduces the cognitive load; student focuses on identifying parts, not naming them.\n\n2. **Use scripted sentence frames:**\n   - Provide fill-in-the-blank cards:\n     - *\"The insect has _____ legs to _____.\"*\n     - *\"The flower is _____ to attract insects.\"*\n   - Student picks from word bank (walk, climb, bright, yellow, red).\n   - *Why:* Scaffolds language production; student builds confidence with supported structures.\n\n3. **Shorten the Explore activity:**\n   - Instead of building a full model, provide a pre-made pipe cleaner insect.\n   - Student task: Place it on/around the flower cup and predict/observe what happens.\n   - *Why:* Maintains engagement while reducing fine motor demand.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Introduce pollination explicitly:**\n   - Show students the yellow pollen visible on the insect in the photograph.\n   - **Advanced task:** *\"When the insect visits flowers, it carries yellow pollen. This helps flowers make seeds. Why is this important? Draw a picture showing how pollen moves from flower to flower.\"*\n   - *Why:* Extends thinking to ecosystem service and mutualism concepts.\n\n2. **Research and compare:**\n   - Provide pictures of 2–3 different insects (bee, butterfly, ladybug) and flowers.\n   - **Advanced task:** *\"Which insect do you think visits which flower? Explain your thinking using what you know about body parts.\"*\n   - *Why:* Encourages comparison and evidence-based reasoning; begins concept of adaptation.\n\n3. **Design a flower for a specific insect:**\n   - Students read or listen to a short description of a specific insect (e.g., long-tongued butterfly).\n   - **Advanced task:** *\"Design a flower that this insect would love. What color would it be? How would it be shaped? Why?\"*\n   - *Why:* Applies understanding to creative problem-solving; promotes systems thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Insect Spy\" Observation Notebook:**\n   - Over 1–2 weeks, students observe the school garden, window flower box, or yard during recess.\n   - They draw or dictate: Which insects did they see? What were they doing? What plants were they near?\n   - Create a class chart: *\"Insects We Spotted and Where They Were.\"*\n   - *Connection:* Deepens understanding of real-world insect-plant interactions; practices observation skills.\n\n2. **Flower Dissection & Exploration:**\n   - Bring in fresh, large flowers (sunflowers, tulips, or daisies work well).\n   - Students carefully pull apart petals and observe the flower center, stamens, and pollen.\n   - They discuss: *\"Where would an insect go on this flower? Why do you think?\"*\n   - Examine pollen on a magnifying glass if available.\n   - *Connection:* Engages tactile learners; provides concrete evidence of flower structure and pollen.\n\n3. **Insect & Flower Matching Game:**\n   - Create a memory-style card game with pictures of insects on one set of cards and their favorite flowers on another.\n   - Students play: Match insects to flowers that attract them.\n   - Include cards like: Bee–Sunflower, Butterfly–Milkweed, Ant–any flower, Ladybug–Yarrow.\n   - Discuss why certain insects prefer certain flowers.\n   - *Connection:* Reinforces adaptation and preference; fun, low-stress review.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** No live insects are necessary. Use photos, illustrations, and models.\n- **Inclusion:** Pair students with different abilities during Explore; use sentence frames for English learners.\n- **Real-World Connection:** If possible, take students outside to observe flowers and insects. Point out visitors without capturing or harming them.\n- **Prior Knowledge Check:** Ask at the start: *\"Who has seen a bug on a flower? What was it doing?\"* This activates prior experience and builds confidence.\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Use the same pictures and repeated exposure to terms throughout the week; post vocabulary words with images in the classroom.\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Summary\n\n| NGSS Standard | How This Lesson Addresses It |\n|---|---|\n| **1-LS1-1** | Students design an insect model using external parts (legs, antennae) and explain how those parts help the insect visit flowers and survive. |\n| **1-LS1-2** | Students observe and discuss patterns: Insects visit flowers repeatedly to find food; they use body parts to do this. |\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is ready to deliver. Print, adapt to your classroom context, and enjoy exploring the wonderful world of insects and flowers with your first graders!",
