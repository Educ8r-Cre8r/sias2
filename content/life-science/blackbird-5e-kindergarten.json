ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the blackbird (displayed on screen or printed and held up large enough for all to see)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small toy bird or bird figurine\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph.** Show the image to all students and let them look at it silently for 15 seconds. Say: \"Look carefully. What do you see?\"\n\n2. **Ask discovery questions** (pause 5-8 seconds for responses after each):\n   - \"What animal is this? Have you ever seen a bird like this?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this bird is? What do you see around it?\" (Guide them to notice the grass.)\n   - \"What do you notice about the bird's body? What parts can you see?\" (Point gently if needed: head, legs, wings, tail.)\n   - \"What do you think this bird might be doing right now? Why?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Say, \"I wonder what this bird needs to live. What do you think? Does it need food? Does it need a safe place to sleep? Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper. Write simple words with quick pictures. This becomes your anchor chart for later phases.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to explore what animals need to live by going on a nature hunt and creating our own bird!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small bags or containers (one per student or pair)\n- Outdoor space: grass area, playground, or garden (or use a \"nature corner\" in the classroom)\n- Items students will collect: grass, twigs, small leaves, pebbles, feathers (if available)\n- Paper or cardboard squares (4\" × 4\", one per student)\n- Glue sticks\n- Markers or crayons\n- Chart labeled \"What Birds Need\" with drawings of: food (grain/seeds), home (nest), water, safety\n- Optional: binoculars\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Nature Hunt (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Explain the hunt:** \"We're going to look for things that birds might use to live. Birds need a place to live, food to eat, and ways to stay safe. Let's find things the bird might need.\"\n\n2. **Take students outside (or to nature corner).** Give each child a bag.\n\n3. **Guide the hunt with questions:**\n   - \"Can you find something soft like feathers? What could a bird do with this?\" (Build a nest)\n   - \"Can you find something hard, like a stick or twig?\" (Build a nest, hold food)\n   - \"Can you find grass or leaves?\" (Hide from danger, make a nest)\n   - \"Do you see any seeds or bugs?\" (Food for the bird)\n\n4. **Collect 4-5 items per student.** Bring items back to classroom.\n\n**Part B: Build a Bird Nest (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Each student receives:** paper square, glue stick, collected items, markers.\n\n2. **Directions for students:**\n   - \"Glue your soft things (grass, leaves) onto your square. Make a little home for the bird—a nest!\"\n   - \"You can add twigs or sticks around the edges.\"\n   - \"Draw a bird in your nest, or glue a feather if you found one.\"\n\n3. **As students work, ask guiding questions:**\n   - \"Why did you choose these materials? How will they help the bird?\"\n   - \"What will the bird do in this nest?\" (Sleep, lay eggs, stay warm, hide from danger)\n   - \"What else does your bird need? Food? Water?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions rather than giving answers.\n- Help students who struggle with glue or fine motor tasks, but let them direct placement.\n- Listen for student reasoning about *why* they're choosing materials.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each child creates a nest using collected natural materials.\n- Students can explain (in simple words) why they chose certain materials.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that birds need a safe place to live.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student nests from Explore phase\n- Anchor chart from Engage phase\n- Photograph of the blackbird (displayed again)\n- Chart paper labeled \"A Bird's Body Parts Help It Survive\"\n- Simple drawings or cut-outs of bird body parts (beak, legs, wings, feathers)\n- \"What Birds Need\" poster with pictures (food, water, shelter, safety)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out (6 minutes):** \n   - Ask 3-4 volunteers to show their nest and explain one thing they included and why.\n   - After each share: \"That's right! The bird needs a safe place to sleep.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again and point to each part as you introduce it.\n   \n   **Vocabulary with definitions:**\n   - **Beak:** The hard pointy part on a bird's face. It helps the bird pick up food.\n   - **Legs:** The bird uses its legs to walk on the ground and stand on branches. It walks to find food!\n   - **Wings:** These help the bird fly from place to place to find food and stay safe.\n   - **Feathers:** Special covering on the bird's body. Feathers keep the bird warm and help it hide (camouflage).\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. This bird's habitat is a grassy area!\n\n3. **Connect to Explore Activity (3 minutes):**\n   - \"You found grass and twigs—just like the bird needs! The bird needs a home (shelter), just like you. It also needs to find food, drink water, and stay warm. That's why it has feathers!\"\n   - Point to chart: \"Birds need these things to survive (live).\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your fingers: If a bird uses its beak to find food, point to your mouth like a beak!\"\n   - \"If the bird walks to look for food, walk in place!\"\n   - \"If feathers keep the bird warm, hug yourself!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name 3-4 bird body parts.\n- Students understand that body parts help birds survive.\n- Students can identify at least 2 things birds need to live (food, shelter, warmth).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of different habitats (forest, desert, city park, pond, grassland—use simple Google Image prints or drawings)\n- Chart labeled \"Where Do Birds Live?\"\n- Student drawing paper\n- Crayons and markers\n- Optional: \"Bird Survival\" scenario cards with simple pictures and words\n- Photograph of the blackbird\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Habitat Match (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display different habitat pictures one at a time.** Ask:\n   - \"Would our blackbird (point to photograph) live here? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What does our bird need? Does this place have grass? Food? Safe places to hide?\"\n\n2. **Guide students to understand:** \"Our blackbird likes grassy places where it can walk and find food. It needs places with grass, bushes, and open space.\"\n\n3. **Discuss:** \"Different birds live in different homes. Some birds live in trees, some in water, some in grass. Each bird's body and habits match its home!\"\n\n**Part B: Draw Your Own Bird Home (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Assign or let students choose a habitat** (grassland, forest, or another simple option).\n\n2. **Directions:** \"Draw a picture of a bird living in your habitat. Include:\n   - The bird (use the body parts you learned)\n   - Things the bird needs (food, water, shelter)\n   - Things that help the bird survive in that place\"\n\n3. **As students draw, ask:**\n   - \"Why did you put the bird there?\"\n   - \"What does your bird eat in this place?\"\n   - \"How does your bird stay safe here?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Listen to student explanations.\n- Ask follow-up questions that connect body parts to survival needs.\n- Encourage students to label or describe their drawings.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a drawing of a bird and its habitat.\n- Students can explain one way their bird's body parts help it survive in that habitat.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that different animals need different things to survive.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of bird body parts and survival needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore: Are they selecting materials with reasoning? Can they explain why?\n- Listen during Share-Out: Do students mention survival needs (shelter, food, warmth)?\n- Observe during Elaborate: Can students connect habitat to survival?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes):**\n\nUse one of these options based on your class:\n\n**Option 1: Observation & Questions**\n- Show the photograph again.\n- Ask individually or in small groups:\n  1. \"Point to the bird's beak. What does it use its beak for?\" *(Student should say something like: find food, pick things up)*\n  2. \"Why do you think this bird is in the grass?\" *(Student should mention: finding food, safe place, looking for things)*\n  3. \"What does this bird need to live?\" *(Student should name: food, shelter/home, warmth, water)*\n\n**Option 2: Picture Sort**\n- Provide 4 simple pictures: (a) a bird's nest, (b) seeds/food, (c) feathers, (d) a predator/danger\n- Ask: \"Point to things a bird needs to survive.\"\n- Success: Student identifies at least 3 correctly.\n\n**Option 3: \"Tell Me About Birds\" Drawing**\n- Provide a simple bird outline.\n- Ask: \"Draw or point to the parts a bird needs to survive. Tell me one way each part helps the bird.\"\n- Success: Student labels or describes 2-3 body parts with their functions.\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student can name at least 2 bird body parts (beak, legs, wings, feathers).\n- ✓ Student can explain that at least one body part helps the bird survive.\n- ✓ Student can name at least 2 things a bird needs to live (food, shelter, warmth, water).\n- ✓ Student understands that animals live in places that provide what they need.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify 2-3 bird body parts.\n- 75% of students will explain that a bird needs a home and food to survive.\n- Most students will demonstrate the connection between body parts and survival needs through drawings, descriptions, or hands-on work.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide a word bank with pictures:** Use simple picture cards for bird body parts and survival needs. Students can point to or match pictures instead of generating words. (\"Show me the beak.\" \"Which picture shows food?\")\n\n2. **Reduce complexity in Explore:** Pair students with a buddy. Have them collect just 3 items together instead of 4-5. Provide pre-made nest bases so they only add materials, reducing fine motor demand.\n\n3. **Use hand-over-hand assistance:** When building the nest, gently guide hand placement. Ask: \"Where should the soft grass go? Yes, in the middle!\" This provides tactile support while maintaining student agency.\n\n4. **Simplify vocabulary:** Use only 2-3 key terms (beak, legs, feathers). Repeat them consistently and pair each with an action (point to beak, walk with legs, wiggle feathers).\n\n5. **One-on-one check-in during Explain:** Ask \"What does the bird need?\" with only 2 picture choices (food or home). Reduce options as confidence grows.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Compare body parts across bird species:** Show photos of 2-3 different birds (crow, robin, woodpecker, swan). Ask: \"How are their beaks different? Why? What do you think they eat?\" Students discover that beak shape matches diet and habitat.\n\n2. **Extend the habitat investigation:** Challenge students to design an ideal habitat for the blackbird using materials. \"What would you add to make this habitat perfect for the bird? Why?\" This requires deeper application of needs to environment.\n\n3. **\"Bird Survival Challenge\" scenario thinking:** Present simple scenarios: \"A bird's feathers get wet. What happens? How does the bird stay warm?\" Or \"A bird is very hungry. Where might it go? What might it find?\" Students apply concepts to predict and problem-solve.\n\n4. **Create a bird \"needs poster\":** Advanced students can draw and label a bird showing what it needs (arrows pointing to: food source, shelter, water, warm place). They explain their poster to peers.\n\n5. **Compare to human needs:** Ask: \"What do you need to live? What does a bird need? How are they the same? How are they different?\" This requires higher-order comparison and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bird Watching Walk:** Take students on a brief outdoor walk to observe real birds (or watch a short bird video if outdoor access is limited). Ask: \"Can you see the bird's legs? Is it hopping or walking? What might it be looking for?\" Document observations with drawings or simple tallies (we saw ___ birds).\n\n2. **Feather Exploration Station:** Provide clean feathers (craft feathers or collected ones) for students to examine with magnifying glasses. Ask: \"What does a feather feel like? Why is it soft? Why might soft feathers keep a bird warm?\" Students draw and label what they discover about feathers.\n\n3. **Bird Food Tasting (optional):** With parent permission, provide bird-safe seeds (sunflower seeds for humans, millet, cracked corn) for students to taste and compare. Ask: \"Would you eat this? Would a bird? What else might a bird eat?\" Connect to beak shape and diet (e.g., small beaks = small seeds).\n\n4. **Story Time: \"A Day in the Life of a Bird\":** Read a simple picture book about birds (e.g., *Birdie's Day* by Charley Farley or similar). Pause and ask: \"What does the bird need right now? How does its body help it?\" Students draw their own \"Bird's Day\" storyboard (3-4 pictures showing: waking up, finding food, hiding safely, sleeping).\n\n5. **Home-School Connection:** Send home a simple \"Bird Hunt\" checklist for families. \"Can you spot a bird at home or on a walk? Draw it. What body parts do you see? What do you think it needs?\" Students share findings in next class.\n\n6. **Sensory Bin: \"Bird Habitat Building\":** Create a table with sand, grass clippings, twigs, pebbles, and water in a shallow bin. Students build a bird habitat using these materials, reinforcing that birds need multiple elements (shelter, food, water, safe spaces).\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Timing flexibility:** Sessions can be shortened to 25-30 minutes total if needed by combining Engage + Explore on Day 1 and Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2.\n- **Safety reminder:** Collect natural materials from areas free of pesticides. Inspect for insects before classroom use. Use child-safe glue.\n- **Inclusivity:** Provide alternative ways to express learning (drawing, pointing, verbally describing) to support diverse learners.\n- **Connection to real world:** Remind students that they see birds in their own neighborhoods. This lesson helps them understand what birds need and why protecting natural spaces (parks, gardens, green spaces) matters.",
