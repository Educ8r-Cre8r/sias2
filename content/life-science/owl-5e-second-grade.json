Identify camouflage as an adaptation that helps animals survive by blending in with their environment\n2. Observe how the owl's feather colors and patterns match its habitat\n3. Explain why certain animal colors and patterns help them hide from danger\n4. Apply camouflage concepts by creating or finding a camouflaged animal in a given setting\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about how animals hide and blend into their surroundings.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of the owl on light-colored background (at least 8.5\" × 11\", or displayed on a screen/projector)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording predictions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** where all students can see it clearly. Do not say \"This is an owl\" yet.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discovery questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What animals do you notice?\" (Students may take a moment to spot it—that's the point!)\n   - \"Why do you think the owl's feathers look like the wall behind it?\"\n   - \"If you were a small mouse, would you see this owl easily? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What would happen to the owl if its feathers were bright red instead of gray and brown?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what special trick this owl uses to hide from animals that might want to eat it... or to sneak up on animals it wants to hunt. What do you think?\"\n\n4. **Record 2-3 student predictions** on chart paper for revisiting later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become animal detectives and do an experiment to discover how animals hide!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover the concept of camouflage through hands-on investigation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheet of light-colored construction paper or poster board (white, cream, or light gray)\n- Large sheet of dark-colored construction paper or poster board (dark brown, black, or navy)\n- Collection of 10-15 small paper animal shapes in various colors (pre-cut or use die-cut shapes): some gray/brown, some bright red, some yellow, some blue, some with spotted patterns\n- Small paper bags or boxes (opaque)\n- Chart paper for recording observations\n\n**Activity: \"Where Does the Animal Hide?\" Investigation**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **Divide the class into pairs or small groups of 3.**\n\n2. **Give each group a light-colored background paper and a dark-colored background paper, plus a set of mixed-color animal shapes.**\n\n3. **Instruct students:**\n   - \"Look at your light-colored paper. Place each animal shape on it, one at a time. Ask yourself: Is this animal easy to see or hard to see? Which animals blend in? Which ones stand out?\"\n   - \"Record your observations on a simple chart (teacher provides template with two columns: \"Easy to See\" and \"Hard to See\").\"\n   - \"Now repeat this with your dark-colored paper. Do the same animals hide well, or do different ones hide better?\"\n\n4. **Have students move around the room** to examine other groups' findings and compare results.\n\n5. **Exit this phase with a group question:** \"Did you notice that some animal colors hid better on light backgrounds and others hid better on dark backgrounds?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions without giving answers: \"Tell me which animals you had trouble spotting. What color is that background? Why do you think that animal was hard to see?\"\n- Help students articulate observations orally; record key student phrases on chart paper\n- Facilitate the comparison discussion: \"What did Group A notice that's the same or different from Group B?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that animals matching the background color are harder to see\n- Students begin to notice patterns: gray/brown animals hide on light and brown surfaces; bright colors stand out on any background\n- Students record or draw which animals \"disappear\" best on which backgrounds\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize the concept of camouflage with vocabulary and make explicit connections to the owl photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with predictions from Engage phase\n- The original owl photograph (displayed again)\n- Picture cards of 3-4 other animals with camouflage (e.g., tree frog on bark, deer in forest, white rabbit in snow) — can be printed or drawn\n- Vocabulary anchor chart (to remain posted)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Revisit the Explore findings:** \"Let's talk about what you discovered. Which animals were hardest to hide on light backgrounds? Which were easiest?\" Record patterns on a new chart.\n\n2. **Introduce the word \"camouflage\"** (pronounced ka-moo-FLAHJ):\n   - \"The special trick animals use to hide by looking like their surroundings is called **camouflage**.\"\n   - Write the word and a simple picture/symbol on an anchor chart.\n\n3. **Return to the owl photograph:**\n   - \"Remember this owl? Look at its feathers. What colors do you see?\" (Gray, brown, white, spotted patterns)\n   - \"What colors do you see on the wall behind it?\" (Light gray, white, brown shadows)\n   - \"Why is the owl so hard to spot? Yes! Its feathers match the colors and patterns of the wall. That's camouflage!\"\n\n4. **Show 2-3 additional camouflage examples** briefly (a tree frog matching bark, a white hare in snow, a butterfly on a leaf):\n   - \"Animals that live in different habitats have different camouflage. A polar bear is white because it lives in snowy places. What color would a polar bear be if it lived in a dark forest? It would be easier to spot!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to your neighbor and tell them: What is camouflage? Why do animals need it?\"\n   - Listen to 2-3 pairs share back; correct gently and affirm understanding.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Camouflage** | A special hiding trick where an animal's color or pattern looks like its surroundings so it's hard to see |\n| **Adaptation** | A body part or color that helps an animal survive in its home |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives (like a forest, desert, or rocky cliff) |\n| **Pattern** | Shapes and marks repeated on an animal's skin or feathers |\n| **Blend in** | To look like the things around you so you're hard to spot |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define camouflage in their own words\n- Students can identify the owl as an animal with camouflage\n- Students understand that camouflage helps animals survive (hide from danger or sneak up on food)\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply camouflage concepts to a new scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4-5 large background scene posters or pictures (forest floor, sandy desert, snowy field, tree bark, garden with flowers) — can be drawn, printed, or photographed\n- Pre-made or die-cut animal shapes in various colors (or colored paper for students to draw animals)\n- Glue sticks and tape\n- Optional: colored markers or pencils\n\n**Activity: \"Design a Camouflaged Animal for a Habitat\"**\n\n1. **Set up the scenario:** \"Now you are animal designers! Your job is to design an animal that hides really well in a specific habitat.\"\n\n2. **Assign or let students choose a habitat poster** (forest, desert, snow, tree bark, garden).\n\n3. **Instruct students:**\n   - \"Look carefully at your habitat. What colors and patterns do you see?\"\n   - \"Now create an animal that would hide really well there. You can pick an animal shape and color it to match, OR draw your own animal using colors and patterns that blend in.\"\n   - \"Write or tell me: Why will this animal be hard to spot in this habitat?\"\n\n4. **Display all habitats and animals** around the room. Have students do a gallery walk and try to spot each camouflaged animal.\n\n5. **Discuss:** \"Was it easy or hard to find these animals? Which habitat had the best camouflage? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask students to justify their color/pattern choices: \"Why did you pick brown for your desert animal?\" rather than accepting answers passively\n- Push thinking: \"Would a bright purple animal hide well anywhere? Where might that actually work?\"\n- Affirm creative thinking while keeping focus on the scientific concept\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding by matching animal colors to habitats\n- Students explain the connection between habitat colors and camouflage effectiveness\n- Students recognize that camouflage is an adaptation that changes depending on where an animal lives\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student mastery of camouflage and adaptation concepts.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Are students able to identify which animals hide on which backgrounds? Do their reasons make sense?\n- Pair-share during Explain: Can students define camouflage and explain why owls need it?\n- Elaborate activity: Do students choose habitat-appropriate colors and explain their reasoning?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment** (administer at end of lesson or next day):\n\nProvide each student with a simple assessment sheet with 2-3 of these formats:\n\n**Option 1: Draw and Explain**\n- \"Draw an animal hiding in a tree. Use colors and patterns that will help it hide. Tell or write why your animal is hard to see.\"\n\n**Option 2: Multiple Choice**\n- \"Why does the owl have gray and brown feathers?\" \n  - A) Because it likes those colors\n  - B) Because they help it hide against light-colored rocks and trees\n  - C) Because all owls are gray and brown\n- *(Correct answer: B)*\n\n**Option 3: Matching**\n- Draw 3 habitats (snowy field, sandy desert, green forest) and 3 animals (white rabbit, yellow lizard, brown deer). Ask students to match animals to habitats where they'd hide best and explain one choice.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies camouflage as a way animals hide\n- ✓ Student matches animal colors to appropriate habitats\n- ✓ Student explains (orally or in writing) one reason camouflage helps animals survive\n- ✓ Student applies learning to a new scenario (designing an animal OR matching habitats)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 75-80% of students meet all success criteria by the end of the lesson\n- Students can point to the owl and explain its camouflage\n- Students can give one example of another camouflaged animal and its habitat\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use \"hide\" and \"blend in\" instead of \"camouflage\" initially; introduce formal term after mastery\n2. **Hands-on preview:** Before Explore, let students physically place colored paper shapes on background papers with guided teacher questioning: \"Can you see the blue one? Why not?\"\n3. **Paired investigation:** Pair struggling readers/writers with a fluent student during Explore; provide a picture-based recording chart instead of writing (draw checkmarks in \"Easy to See\" or \"Hard to See\" columns)\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Use pictures only—\"Which animal hides on this background?\" with A/B answer choices rather than open-ended questions\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Multi-layer habitat design:** \"Design TWO different animals for the same habitat that hide in different ways (one by color, one by pattern). Explain how each one survives.\"\n2. **Real-world research:** Assign 2-3 advanced students to find and share photos of an additional camouflaged animal (polar bear, chameleon, stick insect) and present to the class: \"Where does it live? What does it hide from?\"\n3. **Comparative thinking:** \"Can an animal's camouflage help it hide from one animal but NOT from another? Give an example and explain.\" (E.g., a mouse sees colors differently than an owl; a rabbit's brown fur hides from eagles but not from foxes on the ground)\n4. **Design challenge:** \"Your camouflaged animal needs to hide AND hunt. Design an animal that can do both in your habitat. Explain the challenge.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Owl Hunt Game (Outdoor/Hallway Version)**\n   - Hide 5-7 pictures or paper owl cutouts around the classroom or hallway that match their surroundings (gray owl on gray paper, brown owl on brown bulletin board, etc.)\n   - Students search for \"hidden owls\" during indoor recess or as a brain break\n   - Students record how long each owl took them to find and why\n   - Discuss: \"Did camouflage really help the owls hide?\"\n\n2. **Camouflage Art Project: Hiding Place Diorama**\n   - Students create a small shoebox or paper-bag diorama of a habitat and place a small animal cutout inside that's camouflaged to the scene\n   - Students swap dioramas and try to spot each other's animals\n   - Assessment: Can classmates find the animal? How long does it take?\n   - Display with labels: \"What habitat is this? What animal is hiding here? Why is it hard to see?\"\n\n3. **Read-Aloud & Comparative Discussion: \"The Mitten\" or \"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?\"**\n   - Read a picture book featuring animals or color/pattern recognition\n   - After reading, ask: \"Were any of these animals camouflaged? Where would they hide best?\"\n   - Connect back to the owl: \"The owl we studied is like this _____ because both hide using _____.\"\n   - Create a class \"Camouflage or Colorful?\" chart comparing animals from the book and the owl photo\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson works best if the owl photograph is printed in color and displays well; if using a projector, ensure the image is large and clear\n- Students may take 1-2 minutes to actually *see* the owl in the initial photograph—this is intentional and drives home the camouflage concept\n- The 2-LS4-1 standard asks students to observe animals in different habitats and notice diversity; this lesson explicitly connects the owl's features to its habitat (rocky/light surroundings) and invites comparison to other habitats through the Elaborate phase\n- Revisit the lesson vocabulary anchor chart throughout the week (during other science time, read-alouds, or transitions) to reinforce retention",
