ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about decomposition and activate prior knowledge about where plants get their materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of eggshells, soil, and plant material (color copies for each student or group)\n- Projector/document camera to display the image\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image of decomposing eggshells, wood chips, soil, and green plant stems on the board. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Guiding Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the different materials you notice?\"\n   - \"Why do you think there are broken eggshells in the soil next to green plants?\"\n   - \"Do you think the eggshells and dead wood are useful to the living plant? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"If a plant's roots are in soil with eggshells and decaying wood, how might those dead materials help the plant grow?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Turn to a partner and predict: Where does a plant get the 'stuff' it needs to grow? Does it come only from air and water, or could dead materials in the soil help too? Draw or write your prediction.\"\n\n4. **Share Out:** Invite 2-3 pairs to share predictions. Record ideas on chart paper without confirming or correcting—these will be revisited in the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great predictions! Today we're going to investigate how dead things actually help living plants grow. Let's explore how this works.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposition and nutrient cycling through hands-on observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials (per student group—groups of 3-4):**\n- One clear plastic cup or small jar\n- Potting soil (about 2 cups)\n- Water (spray bottle)\n- One raw eggshell (crushed into small pieces)\n- One small piece of decomposing wood or bark (about 1-2 inches)\n- A few dead leaves or grass clippings\n- Fast-growing plant seeds (bean or pea seeds) or small seedlings\n- Tape and markers for labeling\n- Observation sheets (provided below)\n- Optional: magnifying glass\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup Phase:** Guide students through building their own \"decomposition-nutrient cycle\" model:\n   - Layer 1: Pour 1 inch of soil into the cup.\n   - Layer 2: Add crushed eggshell pieces, the wood piece, and dead leaves on top of the soil.\n   - Layer 3: Add 1 more inch of soil to cover the organic material.\n   - Gently mist the soil until moist (not wet).\n   - Plant 2-3 seeds about 1 inch deep, or place a small seedling gently in the soil.\n   - Label the cup with the group's name and date.\n\n2. **Observation Instructions:**\n   - For the next 2-3 weeks, students water the cup gently 2-3 times per week.\n   - Every 2-3 days, students record observations on their sheet:\n     - Plant height (measure with a ruler or use \"seed-lengths\")\n     - Plant color (healthy green, yellow, brown?)\n     - Visible changes in the eggshell or wood (Are they breaking apart? Harder to see?)\n     - Soil texture (Is it darker? Looser? Do they see tiny organisms?)\n   - Optional: Use a magnifying glass to observe soil and look for decomposers (tiny bugs, worms).\n\n3. **Investigation Question:** \"As the eggshell and wood break down in the soil, what do you think is happening to them? Where is that material going?\"\n\n4. **Student Documentation:**\n   - Provide an **Observation Sheet** with columns for:\n     - Date\n     - Plant Height (in cm or seed-lengths)\n     - Plant Color\n     - Visible Decomposition (Is the organic matter still visible or disappearing?)\n     - Soil Changes\n     - Sketches of the plant and surrounding soil\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking probing questions: \"What do you notice changing? Do you see the eggshell in the same place as before? Why might it be harder to see?\" \n- Avoid explaining—guide observation with questions.\n- Help troubleshoot watering (not too much).\n- Remind students that decomposition takes time; changes may be subtle week-to-week but obvious over time.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that the plant grows taller and greener over 2-3 weeks.\n- Students notice that eggshell pieces, wood, and dead leaves gradually become harder to see or break apart.\n- Students record detailed observations showing correlation between decomposition and plant growth.\n- Students begin to infer that breaking-down material supports plant growth.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and ecological concepts; connect observations to the nutrient cycle and plant material needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary\n- Diagram of the nutrient cycle (see below—can be hand-drawn or printed)\n- The photograph from Engage\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Ask 2-3 groups to briefly share one key observation from their cups. Example: \"We noticed our plant is 8 cm tall and the eggshell is breaking into smaller pieces.\" Record observations on a visible chart.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (post on chart paper with illustrations):\n   - **Decomposition:** The process where dead plants, animals, and waste materials break down into smaller and smaller pieces in soil.\n   - **Decomposers:** Tiny living things (bacteria, fungi) and small animals (earthworms, millipedes) that break down dead material and return nutrients to soil.\n   - **Nutrients:** Materials that living things need to grow and stay healthy (like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium found in soil and dead matter).\n   - **Nutrient Cycle:** The way materials move from the environment → plants and animals → back to the environment when they die and decompose.\n   - **Matter:** Anything that takes up space and has weight (plants, soil, water, eggshells, leaves, wood).\n\n3. **Build the Model:** Display or draw a simple nutrient cycle diagram on the board:\n   - **Start:** A plant grows in soil, using water, air, and nutrients from the soil.\n   - **Middle:** An animal eats the plant (or the plant dies naturally).\n   - **Decomposition:** When the plant or animal dies, decomposers break it down into pieces and simple materials.\n   - **Return:** Those nutrients go back into the soil.\n   - **Cycle Continues:** The soil is now richer, so new plants can grow and use those nutrients.\n\n4. **Connect to the Photograph:** Point back to the original image: \"See the eggshell and wood in the soil? Those are being decomposed. Decomposers—bacteria and tiny soil organisms you can't see without a microscope—are breaking them down right now. As they break down, they release nutrients. The green plant's roots are absorbing those nutrients, along with water and minerals from the soil. That's how the plant gets the materials it needs to grow!\"\n\n5. **Revisit Initial Predictions:** Return to the chart from Engage. \"We predicted where plants get materials. What do we now know? Plants get water and air—yes! But they also get nutrients from the soil. Where do those soil nutrients come from? Decomposing dead material! The nutrient cycle connects everything.\"\n\n6. **Check for Understanding Strategy:**\n   - Ask students: \"Show me with a thumbs up, sideways thumb, or thumbs down: Do you understand that decomposers break down dead material and help plants by returning nutrients to soil?\"\n   - Ask: \"Turn to your partner and explain: Why is an eggshell in soil a gift to a plant?\"\n   - Quick-write or draw: \"Draw the nutrient cycle. Show a plant, something dead, decomposers, and soil. Use arrows to show how material moves.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Decomposition:** The breaking down of dead plants, animals, and waste into simpler materials.\n- **Decomposers:** Living organisms (bacteria, fungi, earthworms) that break down dead material.\n- **Nutrients:** Substances plants and animals need to grow and live (found in soil and dead matter).\n- **Nutrient Cycle:** The movement of materials from the environment into organisms and back to the environment.\n- **Matter:** Anything that has weight and takes up space.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and explain the roles of decomposers and nutrients.\n- Students understand that decomposition returns materials to soil for plant use.\n- Students can draw or describe a simple nutrient cycle.\n- Students connect their Explore observations (decomposing eggshells + healthy plant growth) to the concept of nutrient cycling.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply nutrient cycle concepts to a real-world scenario and deepen understanding through prediction and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Image of a landfill or trash dump, and image of a healthy garden/forest\n- Two paper cups or clear containers per group\n- Potting soil, water, bean seeds\n- Labels: \"Garden Soil (with compost)\" and \"Landfill Soil (no decomposition allowed)\"\n- Optional: Compost scraps (fruit peels, leaves), plastic wrap, or barriers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario:** \"Imagine a town has two pieces of land. One is a healthy community garden where people add compost (decomposed plant scraps) to the soil each year. The other is near a landfill where trash is buried and decomposition is very slow because of how it's packaged. Which place would you predict would grow better plants? Why?\"\n\n**Investigation Design (students work in pairs or small groups):**\n\n1. **Set Up Two Cups:**\n   - **Cup A (Garden with Nutrients):** Fill with potting soil mixed with a small amount of compost or finely shredded dead leaves.\n   - **Cup B (Limited Nutrients):** Fill with plain potting soil only (no added compost).\n\n2. **Plant and Grow:** Plant 2-3 bean seeds in each cup. Water equally every 2-3 days.\n\n3. **Observe for 2-3 weeks:** Students record plant height, color, and overall health using the same observation sheet from Explore.\n\n4. **Compare and Analyze:**\n   - Which cup's plant grew taller?\n   - Which plant is greener and healthier?\n   - Why do you think there's a difference?\n   - What does this tell us about the importance of decomposition and nutrients in soil?\n\n5. **Extend the Thinking:** \"What if a landfill prevented decomposition by covering trash with plastic? How might that affect the ability to grow food on that land in the future?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group discussions without giving answers.\n- Prompt: \"Which cup looks more like soil with active decomposition? How can you tell?\"\n- Ask students to predict before opening the cups: \"Predict which plant will be healthier in 2 weeks.\"\n- Have students present findings and explain using nutrient cycle vocabulary.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and record that plants in Cup A (with compost/nutrients) grow larger and healthier than plants in Cup B.\n- Students explain the difference using decomposition and nutrient cycle concepts.\n- Students recognize that decomposition is essential for sustainable soil health and plant growth.\n- Students make real-world connections (landfills, gardens, composting) to the nutrient cycle.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of nutrient cycling, plant material needs, and the role of decomposition.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observation of Explore investigations: Are students recording detailed observations? Do they connect decomposition to plant growth in their notes?\n- Thumbs up/sideways/down check during Explain.\n- Partner explanations of the nutrient cycle.\n- Quality of drawings or models created during Explain.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide students with the following scenario and questions on an index card or digital form:\n\n---\n\n**Exit Ticket: Decomposition Detective**\n\n**Scenario:** A farmer wants to grow healthy vegetables. She collects fallen leaves, grass clippings, and food scraps in a compost bin. After a few months, the material turns dark and crumbly. She mixes this compost into her garden soil. Her vegetable plants grow tall and green.\n\n**Answer the following:**\n\n1. **Name it:** What process turned the leaves, grass, and food scraps into dark, crumbly material? (What do we call this process?)\n\n2. **Explain it:** Why did the compost help the vegetable plants grow better? Use the word \"nutrients\" in your answer.\n\n3. **Draw it:** Sketch a simple nutrient cycle showing:\n   - A plant\n   - Dead material (leaves/food scraps)\n   - Decomposers (draw them as tiny creatures or label them)\n   - Soil\n   - Use arrows to show how materials move.\n\n4. **Support an argument:** The farmer says, \"Decomposition is important for farming.\" Do you agree? Why or why not? Use evidence from what you observed in your cup experiment.\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Emerging:** Student identifies decomposition; explains that decomposers help, but language is vague or incomplete.\n- **Developing:** Student correctly names decomposition and nutrients; explanation shows understanding but lacks detail; drawing is incomplete or unclear.\n- **Proficient:** Student clearly explains decomposition, correctly uses \"nutrients,\" and shows understanding that decomposers return materials to soil for plant use. Drawing is clear and includes all labeled parts with arrows.\n- **Advanced:** Student uses precise vocabulary (decomposition, decomposers, nutrient cycle, matter); explains the process with specific examples; drawing is accurate and detailed; argument is supported with evidence from their observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that plants get materials from decomposing matter in soil (in addition to air and water).\n- Students can explain and model the nutrient cycle.\n- Students recognize the role of decomposers.\n- Students connect lab observations to real-world applications.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a visual chart with pictures for each vocabulary term (decomposition, decomposers, nutrients, nutrient cycle). Students can point to or reference the chart during discussions and written responses.\n\n2. **Structured Observation Sheet:** Provide a pre-made sheet with sentence starters:\n   - \"The plant is growing because _____________.\"\n   - \"The eggshell is decomposing because _____________.\"\n   - \"Decomposers help by _____________.\"\n   - Students complete the sentences rather than writing from scratch.\n\n3. **Guided Nutrient Cycle Drawing:** Provide an outline drawing with numbered circles (plant, dead material, decomposers, soil, back to plant). Students label each part and draw or trace arrows to show the cycle. Teacher reviews and co-constructs the cycle with the student.\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Decomposer Research Project:** Have advanced students research a specific decomposer (earthworm, millipede, fungi, bacteria) and create a short informational poster or digital slide explaining how that organism breaks down dead material and why it's important to the nutrient cycle. Students present to the class.\n\n2. **Variables in Decomposition:** Ask students to design an experiment exploring how **variables affect decomposition rate** (e.g., moisture level, temperature, size of material pieces). Provide them with additional cups and materials. Students hypothesize, test, and analyze results using scientific method vocabulary.\n\n3. **Nutrient Cycle Extension—Food Chains:** Challenge students to create a detailed nutrient cycle diagram that includes a **food chain** (e.g., plant → rabbit → fox → dies → decomposers → soil → plant). Students label and explain how nutrients cycle through the food chain and back to soil. This bridges to ecosystem thinking and shows matter moving through organisms over time.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Create a Classroom Compost Bin (Optional but Recommended):**\n   - Set up a small compost container in the classroom (a 5-gallon bucket with holes drilled in the bottom works well).\n   - Collect plant scraps (fruit/vegetable peels, coffee grounds, shredded leaves, paper towels).\n   - Students observe decomposition over weeks/months, observe organisms in the compost, and discuss how nutrients are being recycled.\n   - At the end, use the finished compost to plant a classroom herb garden or donate it to the school garden.\n\n2. **Nutrient Cycle Poster or Video Project:**\n   - Students create a large poster or short animated video (using free tools like Canva or Animaker) showing the nutrient cycle.\n   - Include images, labels, arrows, and descriptions of what happens at each stage (living plant → organism eats it → death → decomposition → nutrients return to soil).\n   - Display posters in the hallway or share videos with other classrooms.\n\n3. **Guest Speaker or Field Trip:**\n   - Invite a local gardener, soil scientist, or compost facility manager to speak about soil health, decomposition, and nutrient cycling in real-world agriculture or waste management.\n   - Alternatively, arrange a field trip to a community garden, compost facility, or forest to observe decomposition in nature.\n   - Students prepare questions beforehand and reflect afterward on what they learned about how decomposition supports ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n## Assessment Summary\n\nThis lesson uses **multiple forms of assessment** aligned to 5-LS1-1 and 5-LS2-1:\n\n- **Observation sheets** (Explore): Evidence of noticing correlations between decomposition and plant growth\n- **Drawings and models** (Explain, Elaborate): Visual representation of nutrient cycles and understanding of matter movement\n- **Discussions and explanations:** Use of vocabulary and reasoning about decomposers' role\n- **Exit ticket** (Evaluate): Direct measurement of learning objectives through a scenario-based assessment\n- **Experiment comparisons** (Elaborate): Evidence of applying concepts to new contexts\n\nAll assessments are designed to show student progress toward supporting arguments about plant materials (5-LS1-1) and modeling matter movement among organisms and the environment (5-LS2-1).",
