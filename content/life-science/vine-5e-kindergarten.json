A Climb Toward Discovery**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 30-minute sessions (can be split across two days or combined into one 60-minute block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** K-LS1-1 (Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Observe and name what plants need to grow (water, sunlight, and soil)\n- Describe how the vine in the photograph uses the fence to help it grow upward\n- Identify one thing a plant needs to survive by pointing to or naming it\n- Explain (in simple words) why plants need sunlight by connecting to what they see in the photo\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about the vine by examining the photograph and connecting it to students' prior knowledge about plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color print or digital display of the vine photograph\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: small potted plant to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Avoid telling them what it shows yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** one at a time, allowing 10-15 seconds of thinking time before calling on students:\n   - \"What do you notice growing on this fence? What color is it?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this plant is growing up the fence instead of staying down on the ground?\"\n   - \"What do you think this plant needs to stay alive and healthy?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a plant growing on something like a fence or a wall? Tell us about it.\"\n\n3. **Create a class \"wondering list\"** on chart paper. Write down student questions such as: \"Why does the vine climb?\" \"Does it need water?\" \"What does it eat?\" Keep this visible for the entire lesson.\n\n4. **Pass around the small potted plant** (if available) so students can touch the leaves, feel the soil, and observe it closely while you ask: \"What does this plant feel like? What does it need to stay green and healthy?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be plant detectives. We'll explore what plants really need to survive and grow — just like that climbing vine on the fence!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant needs through hands-on observation and a simple sorting activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large poster board divided into 4 sections (labeled with pictures: water droplet, sun, soil, air)\n- Picture cards or magazine cutouts showing: rain/water, sunshine, dirt/soil, wind, roots, leaves, stems, green color\n- Glue sticks and tape\n- The vine photograph (displayed or printed copies for groups)\n- Observation recording sheets with simple drawings (sun, water, soil) for students to circle or point to\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Observation Exploration (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Display the photograph again and ask: \"What can we see that this vine needs to grow?\"\n\n2. Guide students to observe and name specific things:\n   - \"Point to the sunlight in the picture. The vine is growing toward it!\"\n   - \"This vine needs water to drink. Where do you think the water comes from?\" (Rain, garden hose, soil)\n   - \"The vine is growing in dirt—that's the soil. The soil helps keep the plant healthy.\"\n   - \"The vine is climbing on the fence. Does the fence give it something?\" (Support to grow upward)\n\n3. Have students point to or touch each element on a printed photo: **light, water source, soil, and the support structure**.\n\n**Part 2: Sorting and Categorizing (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. Place picture cards in the center of student tables or on the floor for a whole-class activity.\n\n2. Hold up the **4-section poster board** labeled with pictures of water, sun, soil, and air.\n\n3. One by one, hold up a picture card (e.g., a raindrop, a plant leaf, dark soil, a bright sun). Ask: \"Does this vine need this to survive? Where should we put it?\"\n\n4. Students point or raise hands, then place/tape the card onto the appropriate section of the poster.\n\n5. **Accept all reasonable answers** and affirm thinking: \"You're right! Rain gives the vine water, and water is something every plant needs!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate thinking by asking \"Why?\" questions: \"Why would the vine need sunlight?\" \"What does water do for a plant?\"\n- Accept emerging explanations without correcting or overcomplicating answers\n- Use the vine photograph as a reference point repeatedly: \"Look at the photo—do you see water? Do you see sunlight?\"\n- Encourage all students to participate by offering alternatives: \"Can you point to it?\" \"Do you agree with your friend?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students verbally identify at least 2 things plants need (water, sunlight, soil)\n- Students recognize that the vine uses its structure (stems, tendrils, leaves) to climb\n- Students understand that plants need external support and resources to survive\n- Observation recording sheets show students have circled or pointed to representations of basic plant needs\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and concepts by connecting observations to simple, grade-appropriate explanations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers (multiple colors)\n- The vine photograph (still displayed)\n- Picture cards of a plant with labels (root, stem, leaf, flower)\n- A real plant or illustration showing roots underground and leaves above\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a circle** or on the carpet where everyone can see the photograph clearly.\n\n2. **Facilitate a group share-out:**\n   - \"What did we discover that plants need?\" Call on students to share. Record their answers on chart paper.\n   - \"What parts of this vine did we see?\" Point to specific parts in the photograph and name them together.\n\n3. **Introduce and define key vocabulary** (use simple, observable language):\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Sunlight** | The light from the sun that plants need to grow and make their food. Plants need sunlight to stay green and healthy. |\n| **Water** | A liquid that plants drink through their roots. Water helps plants grow big and strong. |\n| **Soil** | The dirt where plants live and get food and water from. Roots go into the soil. |\n| **Vine** | A long, thin plant with leaves that grows and can climb on things like fences, walls, or trellises. |\n| **Leaves** | The green parts of a plant that catch sunlight and help the plant make food. |\n\n4. **Connect vocabulary to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the vine's leaves: \"See these green parts? Those are leaves. They catch the sunlight!\"\n   - Point to where the vine touches the fence: \"The fence holds up the vine so it can grow up toward the sun.\"\n   - Explain: \"Even though we can't see the roots in this picture, they're underground drinking water and getting food from the soil.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding** using these strategies:\n   - \"Show me with your thumbs: Do plants need water? Sunlight? Soil?\" (Thumbs up/down/sideways)\n   - \"Point to the leaves in the photograph.\"\n   - \"Can you name one thing every plant needs to survive?\"\n   - Ask individual students: \"Why is the vine green?\" \"What does the fence do for the vine?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Sunlight:** The light from the sun that helps plants grow\n- **Water:** A liquid plants need to drink and stay healthy\n- **Soil:** The dirt where plants grow and get food\n- **Vine:** A plant with a long, bendy stem that can climb\n- **Leaves:** The green parts of plants that catch sunlight\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least 2-3 things plants need to survive\n- Students can identify leaves and other plant parts in the photograph\n- Students understand that plants need sunlight, water, and soil\n- Students recognize that vines grow toward light and use structures for support\n- Most students can respond to simple \"why\" questions about plant needs using emerging vocabulary\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Deepen understanding by applying concepts to a real-world plant care scenario and connecting to students' own experiences.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small paper cups or pots\n- Potting soil\n- Fast-growing seeds (bean seeds, sunflower seeds) or seedlings\n- Watering can with water\n- Chart showing \"Plant Care Checklist\" with pictures: sun (window), water (droplet), soil (dirt)\n- Optional: Images of vines and climbing plants in different environments (gardens, parks, homes)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option 1: Planting and Care (Recommended for Spring/Summer)**\n\n1. **Introduce a class plant project:** \"We're going to grow our own vine or climbing plant! Let's give it what it needs to grow just like the vine in the fence photo.\"\n\n2. **Walk through each plant need:**\n   - Show the soil: \"First, we put soil in the pot. That's the plant's home and food.\"\n   - Show the seed: \"We plant the seed in the soil. The roots will grow down into the soil.\"\n   - Explain watering: \"We give it water every few days. The plant will drink the water through its roots.\"\n   - Point to the classroom window: \"We'll put our plant by the window so it gets sunlight. The sun helps it grow!\"\n\n3. **Have students help plant seeds** (one per student or small group). They:\n   - Fill a cup with soil\n   - Place a seed in the soil\n   - Pat the soil gently\n   - Water it lightly\n   - Label it with their name\n\n4. **Create a class \"Plant Care Chart\"** with pictures and simple words:\n   - 🌞 Sunlight (put by window)\n   - 💧 Water (water every ___ days)\n   - 🌱 Soil (keep it moist)\n\n5. **Track growth** over the next 1-2 weeks with simple drawings or photos. Ask: \"Does our plant look like the vine in the photo? Is it growing? What does it need?\"\n\n**Option 2: Exploration Walk and Comparison (If Planting Not Possible)**\n\n1. **Take students on an outdoor walk** (or show a photo walk) around the school/neighborhood to find plants.\n\n2. **Ask:** \"Can you find any vines? Any plants climbing? What do they need?\"\n\n3. **Collect observations** and compare to the fence vine:\n   - Does this plant have leaves?\n   - Can you see sunlight reaching it?\n   - Is there soil around it?\n   - Is it growing toward the light?\n\n4. **Return and create a comparison chart:** \"Our fence vine and the (plant name) both need ___.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate hands-on activity without controlling outcomes\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What will the seed need to grow?\" \"Why did we put the pot by the window?\"\n- Celebrate student observations and predictions\n- Invite students to make predictions: \"Do you think it will grow this week? Why?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain (in simple terms) at least two steps to help a plant grow\n- Students begin to apply the concept of plant needs to their own plant care\n- Students make predictions about what their plant needs\n- Students develop responsibility for observing and caring for a living thing\n- Growth observations over time reinforce understanding that plants need ongoing care\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant needs through observation and conversation.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist:** Note which students can identify plant needs when shown the photograph. Can they point to leaves? Name sunlight or water?\n- **Questioning:** Listen to student responses during Explain and Elaborate phases. Do they mention at least 2-3 plant needs? Do they use or understand vocabulary?\n- **Participation:** Track who participates in group activities, plant sorting, and discussions.\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n\n**Administer one or more of these based on student level:**\n\n**Option 1: Picture Sorting (All Students)**\nShow three pictures: a watering can (water), a window with sun (sunlight), and a pile of soil. Ask individually or in small groups:\n- \"Which one does a plant need to grow?\" (All three!)\n- \"Point to water. Point to sunlight. Point to soil.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student correctly identifies or points to at least 2 of the 3 plant needs.\n\n**Option 2: Observation Question (Whole Group or Individual)**\nReturn to the vine photograph. Ask:\n- \"What does this vine need to stay healthy and green?\"\n- \"Why is this vine climbing up the fence?\"\n- \"What do you think will happen if the vine doesn't get water?\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student gives at least one correct answer that shows understanding that plants need resources like water, sunlight, or soil.\n\n**Option 3: Drawing/Writing Prompt (Individual or Small Group)**\nGive students a blank paper and ask:\n- \"Draw a plant. Show me one thing it needs to grow.\"\n- Students draw and/or dictate what the plant needs\n- **Success Criteria:** Student's drawing or dictation reflects understanding of at least one plant need (water, sun, soil)\n\n**Option 4: \"Caring for Our Vine\" Scenario (Small Group Discussion)**\nAsk: \"If we brought that fence vine inside, what would it need? What would we have to do to keep it alive?\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student suggests at least 2 things a plant needs (water, light, soil support)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- **All students** can identify at least **2 things plants need** to survive (from the set: water, sunlight, soil)\n- **Most students** can use emerging vocabulary (leaf, water, sun, plant) when discussing the photograph\n- **All students** demonstrate observable patterns in plant needs through sorting, pointing, or naming activities\n- **Most students** can predict or explain (simply) what would happen if a plant didn't get water or sunlight\n- Evidence of learning is visible through participation in Explore activities, responses to prompts, and drawings/recordings\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Concrete, tangible comparisons:** Pair struggling students with a buddy during sorting and observation activities. Have them hold real leaves, touch real soil, and feel the warmth of sunlight while observing the photograph. This multi-sensory approach strengthens understanding.\n\n2. **Simplified vocabulary and yes/no questions:** Rephrase open-ended questions as yes/no or binary choices:\n   - Instead of: \"Why does the vine need water?\"\n   - Try: \"Does the vine need water? Yes or no? Show me with your thumbs.\"\n   - Repeat new vocabulary in the same sentence multiple times: \"The **leaves**—these green **leaves**—catch the **sunlight**.\"\n\n3. **Visual supports and picture cards:** Create or use simple, labeled picture cards showing each plant need (sun = yellow circle, water = blue droplet, soil = brown square). Use these consistently throughout the lesson. Have students point to or match cards to the photograph.\n\n4. **Reduced task complexity:** During planting activities, assign one focused role per student (e.g., \"You add the soil,\" \"You plant the seed,\" \"You water it\") rather than having them complete all steps. This prevents overwhelm and ensures participation.\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended prediction and cause-effect thinking:** Ask advanced students deeper \"what if\" questions:\n   - \"What would happen if the vine didn't have the fence to climb on?\"\n   - \"Where do you think the vine gets its water from?\" (Guide them to consider the soil, ground, or rain)\n   - \"Why do you think the leaves are on the outside of the vine instead of hidden inside?\"\n   - Challenge them to predict what will happen to the vine in winter or if it doesn't get enough water.\n\n2. **Research and vocabulary expansion:** Invite advanced students to:\n   - Use classroom books or photos to find and name different **types** of vines (ivy, pea vines, bean vines, pumpkin vines)\n   - Explore how different plants' structures help them survive (some climb, some grow wide, some grow tall)\n   - Create a \"Vine Scavenger Hunt\" checklist to observe outdoor vines and document their features\n\n3. **Application to home/family plants:** Encourage advanced students to interview family members or observe plants at home and report back:\n   - \"Is there a climbing plant at your home? What does it need?\"\n   - \"Design a care plan for a classroom plant\" (drawing or dictating steps)\n   - \"Explain to a younger student why plants need sunlight\" (peer teaching)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Plant Detective\" Nature Walk Journal (30 minutes)**\n   Students take a guided walk around the school grounds or neighborhood with a simple observation clipboard. They look for climbing plants, vines, and any plant receiving sunlight or water. They draw or mark pictures of what they find and bring them back to class. Create a class chart: \"Plants We Found and What They Need.\" Discuss similarities and differences between the fence vine and plants they discovered.\n\n2. **\"Build a Plant Trellis\" Design Challenge (45 minutes across 2 days)**\n   Show students pictures of plant trellises, fences, and stakes that support climbing plants. Provide craft sticks, straws, string, and connectors. Challenge small groups to design and build a simple \"trellis\" structure from craft materials. Discuss: \"Why would we build this? What plant would climb on it? What does the plant still need besides the trellis?\" Drawings or photos of student-built trellises strengthen understanding of how structures support plant growth.\n\n3. **\"Plant Needs Story Time and Role-Play\" (20-30 minutes)**\n   Read a picture book about plants (e.g., *Planting a Rainbow* by Lois Ehlert or *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle). After reading, ask students to act out being a seed that grows into a plant. They mime drinking water, reaching toward the sun, and growing roots into the soil. Ask: \"What did our plant need at each stage?\" This kinesthetic and narrative approach reinforces the concepts in a memorable, playful way.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
