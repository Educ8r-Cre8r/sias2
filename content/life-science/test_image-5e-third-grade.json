Exploring Habitats and Animal Homes**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 3-LS2-1: Construct an argument that some animals form groups that help members survive.\n  - 3-LS4-3: Construct an argument with evidence that in a particular habitat some organisms can survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify at least three different organisms (plants and animals) that live in or near a pond habitat and describe what they need to survive.\n2. Explain why certain animals and plants can survive in a pond while others cannot.\n3. Describe at least two ways that animals in a habitat depend on their environment to find food, water, or shelter.\n4. Construct a simple argument using evidence (from the photograph or their own observations) about how organisms are suited to their habitat.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about habitats and organisms using the backyard pond photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital display of the pond photograph (or show on projector)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image large so all students can see clearly. Say: \"This is someone's backyard. Look very carefully. What do you see living or growing here?\"\n\n2. **Think-Pair-Share:** Give students 30 seconds to look silently. Then have them turn to a partner and share one thing they notice that is alive.\n\n3. **Guided Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What animals do you see in this backyard? What do you notice about them?\" (Guide them to spot the orange/red fish in the water and the turtle figurine; discuss real fish that might live there)\n   - \"Why do you think there's a pond here? What do you think lives in the water?\" (Accept all ideas; validate curiosity)\n   - \"What else is alive in this picture besides the pond? Can you point to plants, flowers, or other living things?\"\n   - \"If you were a fish or a bug, would you want to live here? Why or why not?\" (This activates thinking about habitat needs)\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** Write on the chart: \"I wonder...\" and have students complete the sentence: \"I wonder what animals really live in this pond...\" Collect 3-4 student wonderings and display them.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be habitat detectives! We'll explore what different animals need to survive and figure out why some animals can live in a pond and others cannot.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate habitat features and match organisms to their survival needs through a hands-on sorting and observation activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of 8-10 different organisms (prepare before lesson):\n  - Fish, frog, turtle, duck, water beetle, dragonfly, water lily, cattail plant, earthworm, ladybug\n  - (You can print from Google Images or use drawn pictures)\n- Picture cards of habitat features (prepare before lesson):\n  - Water, mud/soil, rocks, plants/leaves, sunlight, insects (as food), seeds (as food)\n- Large piece of chart paper divided into two columns: \"Lives in the Pond\" and \"Lives Near the Pond (on land)\"\n- Tape or sticky tack\n- Clipboards and observation recording sheets (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup:** Display the two-column chart where all students can see. Spread out organism picture cards on a table or floor space where students can gather around.\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Look at each picture card. This is an organism that might live in or near a backyard pond like the one in our photograph.\"\n   - \"For each organism, decide: Does this animal or plant live mostly IN the water (pond) or NEAR the water (on land in the garden)?\"\n   - \"Work in small groups of 3-4. Take turns picking a card and moving it to the correct column. Be ready to explain why you think it belongs there.\"\n   - \"As you sort, fill in your observation sheet by drawing or writing the name of the organism and checking which habitat it lives in.\"\n\n3. **Recording Sheet** (simple, 3rd grade-appropriate):\n   ```\n   Organism Name: ________________\n   This organism lives:  ☐ In water   ☐ On land   ☐ Both\n   \n   Why? It needs: ________________ (water, soil, sunlight, etc.)\n   ```\n\n4. **Connection to Photograph:** As students work, point to the photograph and ask: \"Can you find this organism in our photograph? Where do you see it?\"\n\n5. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate and listen to student reasoning without correcting immediately.\n   - Ask probing questions: \"Why did you choose that? What does a fish need? Can a fish live on dry land?\"\n   - Note misconceptions for the Explain phase.\n   - Help students who struggle by asking: \"Does this animal need to swim? Does it need soil?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students physically sort organisms into habitat categories.\n- Students discuss and justify their thinking aloud.\n- Students record observations on their sheets.\n- Students begin to understand that different organisms have different habitat needs.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and clarify concepts after hands-on exploration. Solidify understanding of habitats and organism diversity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with Key Vocabulary (prepared ahead)\n- The original pond photograph\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Index cards with vocabulary terms (for visual learners)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 groups to explain one organism they sorted and WHY they placed it in that location.\n   - Validate correct thinking: \"Yes, dragonflies need water to lay their eggs, but they fly through the air too!\"\n   - Gently correct misconceptions: \"Good thinking! Turtles do go on land, but they need water to live. They're comfortable in BOTH places.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   - Write each term on chart paper with a simple definition and sketch.\n   \n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal or plant lives. It has everything that organism needs to survive (like water, food, air, and shelter).\n   - **Organism:** Any living thing—a plant, animal, or tiny creature.\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive by getting the things you need (food, water, air, shelter).\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an organism survive in its habitat (like fins on a fish for swimming).\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to the water in the pond. \"This is a habitat for fish. It has water for drinking and swimming, food for eating, and places to hide.\"\n   - Point to the flowers and plants. \"This is a habitat for bees and butterflies. They can find flowers for food and sunlight.\"\n   - \"Can a fish live in the rocks? Why not?\" (Guide: It needs water to breathe.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Hold up organism picture cards one at a time. Ask: \"Is this organism adapted to live in water or on land? What body part helps it survive?\" \n   - Students answer with thumbs up (aquatic), thumbs sideways (both), or thumbs down (land only). Discuss answers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define habitat using their own words.\n- Students understand that organisms have adaptations suited to their habitat.\n- Students recognize that different organisms need different things to survive.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by designing a habitat for a chosen organism and defending why that organism would survive there.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Drawing paper (8.5\" x 11\" or larger)\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Magazines and scissors (optional, for collage)\n- Glue stick\n- Habitat Planning Worksheet (provided below)\n- Sample: A simple labeled drawing of a completed habitat\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the Challenge:**\n   - \"You are a habitat designer! Pick one organism from our photograph or from our sorting activity (fish, frog, turtle, duck, water lily, etc.).\"\n   - \"Your job is to draw or create a habitat where this organism could survive. You must show everything it needs: water, food, shelter, sunlight—whatever YOUR organism needs.\"\n   - \"Then, you'll explain why this habitat is perfect for your organism.\"\n\n2. **Planning Sheet** (students complete before drawing):\n   ```\n   My Organism: ________________________\n   \n   This organism needs (check all that apply):\n   ☐ Water      ☐ Soil      ☐ Sunlight      ☐ Plants      ☐ Insects/Food      ☐ Shelter/Hiding Places\n   \n   I will draw a habitat that includes:\n   1. _________________________\n   2. _________________________\n   3. _________________________\n   ```\n\n3. **Drawing/Creating (10 minutes):**\n   - Students sketch or collage their habitat on paper.\n   - They label at least 3 features (water, food source, shelter, etc.).\n   - Circulate and ask: \"Why did you include that? How does that help your organism survive?\"\n\n4. **Gallery Walk or Peer Share (5 minutes):**\n   - Post all habitats around the room OR have students pair-share.\n   - Students explain their habitat in 1-2 sentences: \"This is a habitat for a ____. It has ____ and ____ so the organism can ____.\"\n\n5. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Provide the planning sheet to scaffold thinking.\n   - Ask clarifying questions that push deeper: \"Where will your fish find food?\" \"Why does it need plants?\"\n   - Praise reasoning: \"I like how you included both water AND rocks—frogs need both!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation of a functional habitat.\n- Students label features and explain their thinking.\n- Students demonstrate that they understand organism-habitat relationships.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitats, organism diversity, and survival needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Can students sort organisms correctly and explain reasoning?\n- Check-for-Understanding questions during Explain: Do students understand vocabulary?\n- Circulating questions during Elaborate: Can students articulate why an organism needs specific habitat features?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nAdminister as students leave or at the start of Session 2. Use ONE of the following formats based on your class needs:\n\n**Option A (Drawing + Sentence):**\n   ```\n   Draw a pond habitat. Show 2 animals and 2 plants that live there.\n   \n   Write one sentence: Why can a fish live in water but a squirrel cannot?\n   ```\n\n**Option B (Multiple Choice + Explanation):**\n   ```\n   1. A frog lives in a pond. What does a frog need to survive? (circle all that apply)\n      a) Water        b) Air        c) Grass        d) Sand\n   \n   2. Why can't a fish live on dry land? Explain in your own words.\n      _________________________________________________\n   ```\n\n**Option C (Argument with Evidence):**\n   ```\n   Some organisms can survive in a pond, and some cannot.\n   \n   Claim: _________________________________ can survive in a pond.\n   \n   Evidence (Why?): _________________________________\n   ```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students correctly identify at least 2 organisms suited to a pond habitat.\n- Students explain at least one reason why an organism is suited to its habitat (e.g., \"Fish have gills to breathe underwater\").\n- Students recognize that different organisms have different habitat needs.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Review exit tickets for correct identification and reasoning.\n- Refer to Explore observation notes: Did students successfully categorize organisms?\n- Check Elaborate habitat drawings: Are features labeled and appropriate for the organism chosen?\n- Anecdotal notes from teacher observations of student language and thinking throughout the lesson.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Reduce Sorting Complexity:** Provide only 4-5 organism cards instead of 8-10. Start with obvious contrasts (fish vs. butterfly).\n\n2. **Provide a Word Bank:** During Elaborate, give students pre-written labels or sentence frames:\n   - \"This organism needs ________ to survive.\"\n   - \"It can hide in ________.\"\n   - \"It eats ________.\"\n\n3. **Use the Photograph as Reference:** Keep the original pond photo visible during all phases. Point to it frequently and ask: \"Can you show me where this organism lives in our photograph?\"\n\n4. **Pair with a Peer:** Assign a stronger reader/writer to work with during sorting and elaborate activities. Let them scribe while the student dictates ideas.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Add a Second Organism:** \"Now pick another organism. Design a habitat where BOTH organisms could live together. How would they share space? Would they help each other or compete?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Food Chains:** \"What does your organism eat? What eats your organism? Draw the food chain in your habitat.\"\n\n3. **Environmental Change Scenario:** \"What would happen to your organism if the pond dried up? How would it survive? Where would it go?\" (Connects to 3-LS4-4)\n\n4. **Research Extension:** Provide books or tablets. \"Find one real fact about your organism's habitat in the wild. Does a real pond have the same features as your drawing?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Backyard Habitat Hunt (Real or Virtual):**\n   - If possible, take students to a real pond, garden, or outdoor space to observe organisms in their actual habitats.\n   - Use binoculars, nets (catch-and-release), and hand lenses to observe insects, plants, and animals.\n   - Have students record observations: Where did you find it? What was it doing? What habitat features were nearby?\n   - Alternatively, use virtual field trips or nature documentary clips (NatGeo Kids, PBS Learning Media).\n\n2. **Create a Classroom Habitat Model:**\n   - In a large clear container or aquarium, build a small ecosystem: water, soil, rocks, plants, and carefully selected aquatic organisms (like water snails or plants).\n   - Observe and document changes over 2-4 weeks.\n   - Students journal: \"What do we need to do to help these organisms survive?\"\n\n3. **\"Habitat Survivor\" Decision-Making Game:**\n   - Present scenarios: \"It's winter and the pond is frozen. Can a frog survive? What would it do?\"\n   - \"A builder fills in the pond. Where can the fish go? Can it survive in a bucket? Why or why not?\"\n   - Use these discussions to deepen thinking about habitat requirements and organism interdependence.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Preparation:** Print or draw the organism and habitat feature cards ahead of time. Laminate if possible for reuse.\n- **Vocabulary Differentiation:** Some students may need the word \"adaptation\" explained simply as \"a special body part that helps an animal survive.\" You can use simpler language if needed.\n- **Inclusive Language:** When discussing organisms, emphasize that all living things are important and have a role in the habitat—avoid hierarchical language like \"good\" or \"bad\" animals.\n- **Connection to Real Experiences:** If students have visited ponds, beaches, or gardens, reference their experiences: \"Remember when you saw a crab at the beach? That's a habitat too!\"\n- **Assessment Flexibility:** Exit tickets can be oral (for non-writers), drawn (for visual learners), or written. Adjust based on student needs.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly connects to the photograph's visible ecosystem—a functional habitat where multiple organisms coexist—and builds student understanding of how organisms depend on specific environmental features to survive.**",
