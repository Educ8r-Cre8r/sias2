Identify and name at least three external structures of a flower and explain the function of each part.\n2. Construct an argument using evidence that flower structures help plants reproduce and survive.\n3. Explain how the color and shape of flower petals relate to attracting pollinators for reproduction.\n4. Compare the structures of two different flowers and describe how their differences help them survive in their environments.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph while introducing the concept of flower structures and their purpose.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the pink zinnia flower (displayed on a large screen or printed poster)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: real flowers in a vase (various types if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph prominently** without any introduction. Allow students 30-45 seconds of silent observation. Ask them to notice details without speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (allowing think-pair-share before whole-group responses):\n   - \"What parts of this flower do you see? Point to them.\" (Expect: petals, yellow center, stem, leaves)\n   - \"Why do you think flowers are so colorful? What do you think the bright pink and yellow colors are for?\"\n   - \"If you were a bee or butterfly, what would attract you to this flower? Why?\"\n   - \"Do you think flowers are important just because they look pretty, or do they do something important for the plant?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to tell you that this flower's only job is to help make new flowers. Look at the picture again. What parts do you think help the flower make seeds or new plants?\" Record student predictions on chart paper.\n\n4. **Wonder statement:** \"Let's investigate the inside of a flower to see what's really happening in there!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become flower scientists and take apart real flowers to see how their structures help plants make seeds and survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate flower structures hands-on and discover the relationship between external structures and reproductive function.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- Fresh flowers (carnations, zinnias, or daisies work best—avoid roses due to thorns)\n- Small dissection trays or shallow containers\n- Toothpicks or tweezers\n- Hand lenses (1 per student)\n- Paper plates or white paper\n- Colored pencils\n- Data sheet (provided below)\n- Paper towels\n- Optional: magnifying glasses\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **Observe the whole flower** with your hand lens. Draw the outside of your flower on your data sheet. Label: petals, stem, leaves, sepals (the small green parts under the petals).\n\n2. **Count and measure the petals.** How many petals does your flower have? Measure the length of one petal. Record this information.\n\n3. **Carefully remove the petals** one at a time and place them on a paper plate. Observe what's under the petals. What do you see?\n\n4. **Examine the yellow center** closely with your hand lens. This is called the stamen. Gently touch it. What does it feel like? Does anything rub off on your finger? (Yellow powder = pollen—this is important!) Record: \"The yellow powder is called pollen.\"\n\n5. **Look deeper into the center.** Use a toothpick very gently to explore the middle of the flower. Can you feel a small structure? This is the pistil. Draw what you see.\n\n6. **Sketch your findings** on your data sheet. Label: petals, sepals, stamen (with pollen), and pistil.\n\n7. **Answer the reflection questions** on your data sheet:\n   - Why do you think the petals are so colorful?\n   - What do you think happens to the yellow pollen?\n   - How do these flower parts help make new plants?\n\n**How this connects to the photograph:**\nStudents observe the same colorful petals, bright yellow stamens, and central structures visible in the photograph. They discover through hands-on exploration why these structures are arranged the way they are.\n\n**What students should record:**\n- Labeled drawings of external and visible internal structures\n- Measurements of petals\n- Observations about pollen\n- Answers to reflection questions\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nCirculate between groups. Ask guiding questions:\n- \"What do you notice about the pollen? Where else might that powder go?\"\n- \"Why are the petals on the outside?\"\n- \"If an insect landed on this flower, what would happen?\"\n- Do not explain; guide students toward discovery.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents will identify petals, stamens, pistils, and sepals; recognize pollen as a yellowish powder in the stamen; and begin connecting structures to the function of reproduction.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts, connecting student discoveries to plant reproduction.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Labeled diagram of flower parts (teacher-created or from textbook)\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Photographs of different flowers\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their drawings and describe what they found.\n   - Display drawings side by side and compare the structures.\n   - Ask: \"Were all the flowers the same? What was different?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Using the shared student observations and the flower diagram, teach these terms with brief definitions:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Petals:** Colorful outer leaves that attract pollinators (insects and other animals) to the flower.\n   - **Stamen:** The male part of the flower that produces pollen (yellow powder) needed for reproduction.\n   - **Pistil:** The female part of the flower that receives pollen and eventually develops into seeds.\n   - **Pollen:** Tiny grains produced by the stamen that carry genetic information needed to make seeds.\n   - **Pollination:** The process where pollen moves from the stamen of one flower to the pistil of another, allowing reproduction.\n\n3. **Make connections to the photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Display the original photograph again.\n   - Point to the bright pink petals: \"These pink petals attracted this flower to pollinators. That's why they're so bright!\"\n   - Point to the yellow center: \"That yellow you see is pollen. It's the most important part for making seeds.\"\n   - Explain: \"This flower's structures work together so bees and butterflies will visit, pick up pollen, and carry it to other flowers. That's how new flowers grow!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (3 minutes):**\n   Use a quick hand-raise quiz:\n   - \"If I point to a part, you tell me its job. Ready?\"\n   - Point to each structure and have students respond.\n   - Alternative: \"Thumbs up if you can explain what pollen does. Thumbs sideways if you're not sure yet.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents understand the structures and vocabulary; they can connect flower parts to reproductive function and explain why certain structures look and function the way they do.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by investigating how different flower structures help plants survive in different environments and by constructing an argument.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photographs of 3-4 different flowers (e.g., sunflower, orchid, tulip, wildflower) printed or on screen\n- Comparison chart template (provided below)\n- Colored pencils\n- Markers\n- Chart paper for class argument\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the investigation (2 minutes):**\n   \"Plants live in different places. Some live where there are lots of bees. Some live where wind carries pollen. Some live where birds visit. Let's look at different flowers and see how their structures help them survive in different places.\"\n\n2. **Flower comparison activity (10 minutes):**\n   - Display photographs of 3-4 different flowers.\n   - Provide each student or pair with a comparison chart template.\n   - Students observe and complete the chart:\n     - \"How many petals does it have?\"\n     - \"What color is it?\"\n     - \"What do you think attracts pollinators to this flower?\"\n     - \"How is this flower different from the zinnia we took apart?\"\n     - \"Why do you think it looks this way?\"\n\n3. **Build a class argument (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask students: \"Based on what we've learned, can you explain why flower structures are the way they are?\"\n   - Record student statements on chart paper.\n   - Help them form a claim: \"Flower structures help plants survive and reproduce because they attract the right pollinators for that plant.\"\n   - Ask for evidence: \"What evidence do we have for this?\" (Point to observations: color, petal arrangement, pollen, etc.)\n\n4. **Real-world connection (3 minutes):**\n   \"Next time you see a flower, remember—it's not just pretty! Every color, every shape, every part is there to help that plant make seeds and survive.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nGuide the comparison by asking: \"What do you notice about this flower's petals?\" and \"Who do you think visits this flower?\" Facilitate discussion without providing direct answers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents can compare flower structures, explain differences based on function, and construct an evidence-based argument connecting structures to survival and reproduction.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of flower structures and their role in plant reproduction and survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- Observation checklist during Explore: Did students identify and label major flower parts correctly?\n- Hand-raise checks during Explain: Can students name structures and basic functions?\n- Comparison chart responses during Elaborate: Do answers show understanding of structure-function relationships?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nProvide each student with a simple drawing of a flower and ask them to complete the following:\n\n1. **Label at least 4 parts** of the flower: petals, stamen, pistil, sepals.\n\n2. **Choose one structure** and write 1-2 sentences explaining: \"Why is this part important? How does it help the plant survive?\"\n\n3. **Answer this question:** \"Why do you think bees and butterflies are attracted to colorful flowers? Use what you learned today.\"\n\n**Alternative exit ticket for struggling learners:**\nProvide a word bank: (petals, pollen, pistil, stamen, reproduction, attract, survive)\n- \"Flower petals are colorful to ___________  pollinators.\"\n- \"The yellow powder inside the flower is called ___________.\"\n- \"Flowers help plants ___________ by making seeds.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students correctly label at least 4 flower parts.\n- Explanations show understanding that structures serve reproductive or survival functions.\n- Responses reference color, attraction, or pollination.\n- Students can articulate one reason structures are important.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents demonstrate mastery if they can:\n- Identify external flower structures by name\n- Explain at least one function of two different structures\n- Connect structure to plant survival or reproduction\n- Show understanding that flower traits (like color) serve a purpose\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified data sheet with visuals:** Provide a pre-drawn flower outline with blanks for labels instead of asking students to draw from scratch. Include small pictures next to vocabulary terms.\n\n2. **Peer partnerships:** Pair struggling students with strong partners during Explore. The partner can help with observation skills and recording, while the struggling student focuses on hands-on exploration and verbal explanation.\n\n3. **Pre-teaching vocabulary:** Before the lesson, introduce flower part names using real flowers or a model. Use repetition and multi-sensory approaches (point to real examples, say the word, have students repeat).\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deep investigation of pollination:** Provide a diagram showing how pollen travels from stamen to pistil and leads to seed formation. Ask: \"If a flower's pollen never reaches another flower's pistil, what would happen to that plant species? Draw or explain.\"\n\n2. **Comparative anatomy project:** Ask students to research and present on how flower structures differ based on pollinator type. Provide guiding questions: \"What kinds of flowers do hummingbirds visit? How are those flowers different from flowers that attract bees?\" Have them present findings to the class.\n\n3. **Design challenge:** \"If you were a flower designer creating a new flower to attract a specific pollinator (butterfly, bat, wind, etc.), what structures would you give it? Draw your flower and explain your design choices using scientific vocabulary.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Pollinator observation walk:** Take students on a garden or outdoor nature walk to observe real flowers and insects visiting them. Have them sketch what they see and note which flowers attract which pollinators. Create a class chart of findings to display.\n\n2. **Flower dissection journal (multiple days):** Provide students with different types of fresh flowers to dissect over several days (carnation, daisy, tulip, sunflower). Have them compare structures across species and record observations in a science journal. Create a visual poster showing flower diversity.\n\n3. **Seed growing experiment:** After the lesson, save seeds from the dissected flowers or plant seeds in small cups with soil and water. Have students care for them over several weeks, recording growth with drawings and measurements. When plants flower, revisit the original learning: \"Look! New flowers with the same structures we learned about!\"\n\n---",
