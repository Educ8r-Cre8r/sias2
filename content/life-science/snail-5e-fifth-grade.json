Identify and describe three adaptations that help snails survive in their environment.\n2. Explain how snails fit into a simple food chain as consumers of plants.\n3. Create a model or diagram showing how matter (food and nutrients) moves between plants, snails, and their environment.\n4. Make evidence-based predictions about why snails are found near plants and moist environments.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the snail on lichen (or printed 8.5\" × 11\" copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Initial Observation:**\n   - Project the snail photograph on the board or distribute printed copies to small groups.\n   - Ask students to spend 30 seconds observing silently, then turn to a partner and describe what they see without naming the animal yet.\n\n2. **Guided Discovery Questions:**\n   - \"What parts of this animal can you identify? What do you notice about its body?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this animal is carrying a hard shell on its back? What job might that shell do?\"\n   - \"This animal is on a plant (lichen). What might it be doing there? Is it eating? Hiding? Resting?\"\n   - \"Where do you think you might find an animal like this in your own garden or yard? What would it need to survive?\"\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n   - Invite students to predict: *\"If this snail eats plants, what eats the snail? Who might be this snail's predators?\"*\n   - Write 3–4 predictions on chart paper and keep visible for the entire lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \n\"Great observations! Today, we're going to become snail detectives. We'll investigate how snails survive, what they eat, and how they fit into the food chain—just like a puzzle where each piece connects.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Live snails (3–4 in a clear terrarium or container with soil, leaves, and moist conditions) *OR* high-quality photographs/video of snails in their habitat\n- Plain white paper or observation sheets (one per student)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Hand lenses (one per pair)\n- Plant samples: lettuce leaf, grass, lichen-covered twig (optional)\n- Shallow water dish\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Part A: Snail Habitat Observation (10 minutes)**\n   - Divide the class into small groups (3–4 students).\n   - If using live snails, allow each group 5 minutes with the terrarium to observe snail behavior using hand lenses. Assign a note-taker, an observer, and a recorder.\n   - Observation prompts for the worksheet:\n     - Where is the snail positioned? (On soil? On plants? Near water?)\n     - What body parts do you see? (Tentacles, foot, shell, body)\n     - Is the snail moving? Describe how it moves.\n     - Do you see the snail touching the plants? What might it be doing?\n\n2. **Part B: Food Investigation (10 minutes)**\n   - Place different plant materials in front of the snail(s) (lettuce, grass, lichen-covered twig).\n   - Ask students to observe and record: *Which plant does the snail approach first? Does the snail eat one type of plant more than another?*\n   - Have students sketch or write what they notice.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: *\"What do you think that tentacle is doing? Why might the snail need to feel around before eating?\"* Do **not** provide answers—encourage inference from observation.\n- If using photos/video instead of live snails, pause the video and ask students to predict what will happen next before continuing.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that snails are plant eaters (herbivores).\n- Students notice the snail's specific adaptations: shell (protection), muscular foot (movement), tentacles (sensing).\n- Students document observations on their worksheets with drawings or written descriptions.\n- Students begin to understand that snails have specific body parts that help them survive.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or digital slide with vocabulary and definitions\n- Visual anchor chart showing a simple food chain (snail edition)\n- Images of snails, plants, and predators (birds, beetles, etc.)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2–3 groups to share one observation from their snail investigation.\n   - Write observations on the board and group them by theme (e.g., *movement, eating, adaptation*).\n\n2. **Formal Concept Introduction:**\n   - Introduce the concept of **adaptation** using the snail's shell as the primary example.\n   - Create a simple two-column chart:\n     - Left: *Body Part of Snail*\n     - Right: *What It Helps the Snail Do*\n   - Fill in together:\n     - Shell → Protects from predators and keeps snail moist\n     - Tentacles → Sense the environment (smell and touch)\n     - Muscular foot → Helps snail move slowly but steadily\n     - Mouth → Eats plants (herbivore)\n\n3. **Food Chain Connection:**\n   - Draw a simple linear food chain on chart paper: **Plant → Snail → Bird**\n   - Explain: *\"The snail eats the plant, so energy and matter move from the plant into the snail. Then, when a bird eats the snail, that energy moves into the bird. This is how matter moves through food chains!\"*\n   - Ask: *\"Where does the plant get its food?\" (Sun, water, air)* Connect back to 5-LS1-1 concept lightly.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: *\"Is a snail a producer or a consumer? Why?\"* (Consumer—it eats plants.)\n   - *\"What does a snail's shell do for it?\"* (Protects it.)\n   - *\"If a snail eats a leaf, is that matter moving from the plant to the snail?\"* (Yes.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment.\n- **Herbivore:** An animal that eats only plants.\n- **Consumer:** A living thing that eats plants or other animals to get energy.\n- **Food Chain:** A way to show how energy and matter move from one living thing to another (sun → plant → animal).\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal or plant lives and has everything it needs to survive.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least two snail adaptations and explain what each does.\n- Students understand that snails are herbivores and consumers in a food chain.\n- Students can draw or describe a simple food chain that includes a snail.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster paper (one per group)\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Pre-printed images of garden organisms (snails, birds, beetles, plants, soil, decomposer icons) *or* allow students to draw\n- Glue sticks or tape\n- Optional: digital tools (e.g., Canva, Google Drawing) for tech-forward classes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Food Web/Habitat Model (For Most Students)**\n\n1. Challenge each group to create an expanded food chain or simple food web that includes:\n   - A plant that snails eat (lettuce, clover, lichen)\n   - The snail\n   - At least two animals that eat snails (bird, ground beetle, hedgehog)\n   - Arrows showing the movement of matter\n\n2. Groups should also add:\n   - The sun (as energy source)\n   - Soil or decomposer (to show where dead matter goes)\n   - A label: *\"How is the snail connected to everything in this garden?\"*\n\n3. Provide a sentence frame: *\"Matter moves from the _____ to the _____ because _____.\"*\n\n**Option B: Adaptation Specification Activity (For Advanced Learners)**\n\n- Challenge students to identify a **second** animal that lives in the same habitat as snails (e.g., beetle, earthworm, spider).\n- Ask: *\"What adaptations does THIS animal have? How are its adaptations different from the snail's? Why might those adaptations help it survive?\"*\n- Have students compare and contrast in a Venn diagram or short paragraph.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: *\"Why did you put that arrow there? What does it show about how matter moves?\"*\n- Support students in making connections: *\"Remember, the snail ate the plant. Now show me what eats the snail.\"*\n- Ask clarifying questions but allow students to revise their thinking based on evidence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual model showing the snail's role in a food chain/web.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that matter (food) moves from plants to snails to predators.\n- Students identify and describe at least three adaptations across the organisms in their model.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during the Explain phase vocabulary check-in.\n- Listen for accurate use of terms *adaptation*, *consumer*, and *food chain* during group discussions.\n- Review Explore phase observation sheets for evidence of careful observation and inference.\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (digital or paper) with the following questions. Students respond individually:\n\n1. **Drawing + Label:** Draw a snail and label three body parts. Next to each part, write one sentence explaining what that part helps the snail do. *(5 points)*\n\n2. **Vocabulary Application:** Fill in the blank: \n   - \"A snail is a _____________ because it eats plants.\" \n   - (Answer: consumer or herbivore)\n   *(2 points)*\n\n3. **Food Chain:** Draw or write a food chain that shows how matter moves from a plant to a snail to an animal that eats snails. Use arrows. *(5 points)*\n\n4. **Reflection:** In one or two sentences, explain why snails are usually found near plants and in damp places. *(3 points)*\n\n**Total: 15 points**\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ Student accurately labels snail body parts and connects each to a survival function.\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies snail as a consumer/herbivore.\n- ✓ Student creates a food chain with arrows pointing in the correct direction (showing matter movement from plant → snail → predator).\n- ✓ Student uses evidence from observations to explain snail habitat preferences.\n- ✓ Student uses at least two key vocabulary terms correctly (adaptation, consumer, food chain, herbivore).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Sentence Frames for All Writing:**\n   - Provide structured sentence starters: *\"The snail uses its _____ to _____.\"* and *\"A snail eats _____, so it is a _____ in the food chain.\"*\n\n2. **Simplified Food Chain Template:**\n   - Give students a pre-made three-box template with pictures (Sun → Plant → Snail → Animal) and ask them to draw arrows and add labels rather than create from scratch.\n\n3. **Paired Observation:**\n   - Assign struggling learners to work with a strong partner during the Explore phase; pair them with a student who can help record observations and ask guiding questions.\n\n4. **Vocabulary Word Wall:**\n   - Display key vocabulary with pictures in the classroom throughout the lesson. Allow students to reference it during written tasks.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-Level Food Web:**\n   - Challenge advanced students to create a food web (not just a linear chain) that includes 5+ organisms, decomposers, and shows multiple feeding relationships.\n   - Ask: *\"What would happen to the snail population if all the birds disappeared? Why?\"*\n\n2. **Habitat Comparison:**\n   - Have students research and compare snail adaptations to a different mollusk (e.g., slug, clam) and present findings in a comparison chart. Why are their adaptations different?\n\n3. **Energy and Matter Calculation:**\n   - Introduce the idea that when a bird eats a snail, not all the snail's matter becomes bird matter—some is used for energy and respiration. Have students hypothesize: *\"What percentage of the snail's matter do you think becomes part of the bird?\"*\n\n4. **Field Study Design:**\n   - Have advanced students design a simple plan to survey their schoolyard or a local garden for snails: *\"Where would you look? How many would you expect to find? What would tell you the habitat is healthy for snails?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Snail Racing Lab (15–20 minutes)**\n   - Provide each group with a snail (in a safe, contained space) and a starting line. Measure how far the snail travels in 2 minutes. Graph results on a class chart. Discuss: *\"Why might some snails be faster than others? Does speed help snails survive?\"*\n   - **Connection:** Introduces variation and adaptation within species.\n\n2. **Garden Detective: Real-World Snail Hunt (Homework or Field Trip)**\n   - Challenge students to find snails or evidence of snails in a garden, yard, or park (look for shells, slime trails, chewed leaves).\n   - Have them document findings with a drawing, photograph, or simple written description of the snail's location and habitat.\n   - Bring findings back to share with the class: *\"Where did you find your snail? What was nearby? Why do you think it was there?\"*\n   - **Connection:** Deepens understanding of snail habitat and ecological role.\n\n3. **Food Chain Game: \"Who Eats Whom?\" (20–25 minutes)**\n   - Print or create cards with pictures of garden organisms (plant, snail, bird, fox, decomposer, sun, soil).\n   - Students stand in a circle, each holding a card. Call out: *\"Move if you're a consumer!\"* or *\"Move if you eat the snail!\"*\n   - Have students link arms to form a food chain or web based on your prompts.\n   - **Connection:** Kinesthetic review of food chains and adaptations; reinforces that all organisms are connected.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Live Snails:** If using live snails, source them from a biological supply company or local garden center 1–2 weeks before the lesson. Keep them in a terrarium with moist soil, leaves, and a covered area for shade. Feed them lettuce or leafy greens. Snails are hardy and require minimal care.\n- **Alternatives:** If live snails are unavailable, use high-quality photographs (provided in the lesson image) or short video clips (search \"snail eating lichen\" or \"snail moving\" on YouTube).\n- **Safety:** Remind students to handle snails gently and wash hands after observation.\n- **Cultural Note:** In some cultures, snails are considered pests; in others, they are a food source. Keep discussions factual and science-focused.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson fully embeds the photograph of the snail on lichen as the central focus, building student understanding of adaptations, food chains, and matter movement through concrete observation and age-appropriate modeling. Students move from wonder to evidence-based understanding—the hallmark of strong 5E instruction.",
