Two smaller turtles are in the water on the left, while a larger turtle sits on a log on the right. The turtles' shells have beautiful patterns - some with yellow and dark markings. You can see their heads stretched out and their legs visible. Behind them is muddy ground and some green vegetation. The turtles look very peaceful as they soak up the sun!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates thermoregulation behavior in reptiles. Turtles are ectothermic (cold-blooded), which means they cannot generate their own body heat like mammals do. Basking in sunlight is essential for turtles to warm their bodies to the right temperature for digestion, movement, and immune system function. When they get too warm, they'll slip back into the cool water. This is why you often see turtles lined up on logs - they're all doing the same thing: adjusting their body temperature! Basking also helps kill harmful bacteria and parasites on their shells. Notice how they position themselves to get maximum sun exposure on their dark shells, which absorb heat efficiently.\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Ectothermic/Cold-blooded**: Animals that rely on external heat sources (like the sun) to regulate their body temperature.\n\n2. **Basking Behavior**: Reptiles positioning themselves in sunlight to absorb heat and raise their body temperature.\n\n3. **Thermoregulation**: The process of maintaining body temperature within certain boundaries, even when the surrounding temperature is different.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate a \"Temperature Detective\" experiment! Place three identical thermometers in different locations: one in direct sunlight, one in shade, and one in a cup of water. Check temperatures every 5 minutes for 20 minutes and graph the results. Discuss: Which location warmed up fastest? Where would a turtle go to warm up? To cool down? This concrete experiment helps students understand why turtles constantly move between sun and water. Extension: Have students act out being turtles - when you say \"cold,\" they bask in the \"sun\"; when you say \"hot,\" they jump into the \"water\"!\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n- **Temperature Comparison**: Use actual thermometers to measure sun vs. shade temperatures\n- **Movement Activity**: Have students act out turtle basking and cooling behaviors\n- **Video Documentation**: Show time-lapse footage of turtles basking throughout the day\n- **Shell Investigation**: Examine real turtle shells or models to understand their structure\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS1.A]]: Structure and Function\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.C]]: Adaptation\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS2.C]]: Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Energy]]: Understanding how animals get energy from their environment\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1.
