Identify the different organisms in an aquatic ecosystem and describe their roles in the food web.\n2. Trace the movement of energy and matter from plants through consumers to decomposers.\n3. Create a visual model showing how matter cycles through an ecosystem.\n4. Explain how the alligator, as a predator, is connected to other organisms in the food web.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate prior knowledge about food chains and ecosystems, and spark curiosity about predator-prey relationships and energy flow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copies or digital display of the alligator photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Whiteboard or projector\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this image? Describe everything you notice.\"\n   - \"Why do you think the alligator is in this shallow water with all these plants? What might it be doing?\"\n   - \"What do you think the alligator eats? Where do you think those animals get their energy?\"\n   - \"If we removed all the plants from this wetland, what would happen to the alligator?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder how all the living things in this wetland depend on each other to survive. Let's investigate how energy moves from one organism to the next.\"\n\n4. **Record student responses** on chart paper to revisit during the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become ecosystem detectives. We'll trace the path of energy and matter through this wetland food web, starting with the sun and plants, all the way to top predators like the alligator.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate energy and matter flow through an ecosystem by creating a food web model and tracing pathways.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards (3×5 inches) — about 30-40 cards total\n- Markers (assorted colors)\n- String or yarn (multiple lengths)\n- Tape\n- Large poster board or butcher paper (one per group)\n- Reference sheet listing typical wetland organisms (see Teacher Role section)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Organism Card Creation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide students into groups of 4.\n\n2. Distribute 8-10 index cards per group and a reference sheet listing organisms found in wetlands:\n   - *Producers:* Algae, aquatic plants, water lilies\n   - *Primary Consumers:* Small fish, aquatic insects, tadpoles, zooplankton\n   - *Secondary Consumers:* Larger fish, dragonflies, frogs\n   - *Tertiary Consumers:* Alligator, wading birds\n   - *Decomposers:* Bacteria, fungi\n\n3. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Choose 8 organisms from the reference list that you think live in the wetland shown in the photograph.\"\n   - \"Write the name of one organism on each index card.\"\n   - \"Draw or describe a simple picture of the organism on the card.\"\n   - \"Color-code your cards: Green for producers, yellow for primary consumers, orange for secondary consumers, red for tertiary consumers, brown for decomposers.\"\n\n**Part B: Food Web Connection (12-15 minutes)**\n\n4. Once cards are complete, students lay them out on the poster board.\n\n5. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Use string or yarn to connect organisms that have a feeding relationship.\"\n   - \"Draw an arrow from the organism being eaten to the organism eating it.\"\n   - \"Start with producers (plants/algae) and trace the pathways of energy upward.\"\n   - \"Make sure your alligator card is connected to at least 3 other organisms.\"\n\n6. **What students should record:** Photos of their completed food webs and a written list of 3-4 feeding relationships they traced (e.g., \"Aquatic plants → small fish → alligator\").\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions:\n  - \"What does this organism eat? Where would you find that organism in your web?\"\n  - \"Can you trace a pathway from the sun's energy all the way to the alligator?\"\n  - \"What would happen if all the plants disappeared?\"\n  \n- Do NOT provide direct answers; instead, direct students to observations from the photograph and their reference sheet.\n\n- Help students understand that arrows point in the direction energy flows (from food source to consumer).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Groups produce a visual food web model with 8-10 organisms correctly connected by feeding relationships.\n- Students can verbally explain 2-3 pathways of energy flow.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that producers are the foundation of the web and energy flows upward through consumers.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and concepts of energy flow, matter cycling, and ecological roles; connect findings to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart paper\n- Markers\n- Student food web models from Explore phase\n- Diagram of a food web (for reference)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (7-8 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to display and explain their food webs to the class.\n   - Ask the class: \"What do you notice about the food webs? Are they similar? What patterns do you see?\"\n   - Highlight that all webs include producers, consumers, and decomposers, and that energy flows from the sun through plants to animals.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7-8 minutes):**\n   - Create an anchor chart with these terms and definitions:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Producer:** An organism that makes its own food using sunlight and water (like plants and algae). Producers capture the sun's energy and store it as food.\n- **Consumer:** An organism that eats other organisms to get energy. Primary consumers eat plants; secondary consumers eat primary consumers; tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers.\n- **Predator:** A consumer that hunts and eats other animals (like the alligator in our photo).\n- **Decomposer:** An organism that breaks down dead plants and animals, returning nutrients back to the soil and water so producers can use them again.\n- **Food Web:** A diagram showing all the feeding relationships in an ecosystem, showing how energy and matter move from one organism to another.\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Point back to the alligator image: \"The alligator is a tertiary consumer — a top predator. It eats smaller animals, which ate even smaller animals, which all depended on plants to start the energy flow. Without the green algae and aquatic plants in this water, there would be no food chain, and the alligator couldn't survive.\"\n   - Emphasize: \"Matter — the nutrients in food — moves through this ecosystem. When the alligator eats a fish, it takes in energy and matter. When the alligator dies, decomposers break it down, and those nutrients go back into the water and soil for plants to use again.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Point to the producer in our photograph food web.\" (Students point to plant cards.)\n   - \"Who eats the producer?\" (Students trace the connection.)\n   - \"Where does the alligator get its energy?\" (Students trace a pathway backward from the alligator.)\n   - \"What do decomposers do?\" (Students explain the role of breaking down dead matter and recycling nutrients.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can define and identify producers, consumers, predators, and decomposers.\n- Students understand that energy flows from the sun → plants → consumers, and matter cycles through decomposers.\n- Students can trace a complete pathway from the sun's energy to the alligator.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of food webs and energy flow to a new scenario and deepen comprehension of ecosystem interdependence.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed scenario cards (one per group)\n- Blank food web diagram template\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- Ruler\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Challenge:**\n\n1. Present this scenario: \"A harmful algae bloom covers the wetland, blocking sunlight from reaching the water plants. The aquatic plants begin to die. What do you predict will happen to the other organisms in this ecosystem?\"\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Using your food web from the Explore phase as a reference, predict what will happen to each organism if the plants disappear.\"\n   - \"Redraw your food web showing which organisms will be affected first, second, and third.\"\n   - \"Write a 3-4 sentence explanation of how removing one organism (the plants) affects the whole ecosystem.\"\n\n3. **Extension Challenge (for advanced learners):** \"Now imagine that humans drain the wetland to build a parking lot. Design a new ecosystem that could exist there. What producers and consumers would you include? Draw and label your new food web.\"\n\n4. **Whole-class discussion:**\n   - Share predictions and explanations.\n   - Highlight that ecosystems are interconnected: removing or changing one part affects everything else.\n   - Emphasize: \"This is why protecting habitats like wetlands is important—they support entire communities of organisms that depend on each other.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate discussions without correcting misconceptions outright; instead, pose questions that guide thinking: \"What do you think happens to the alligator if its primary food source disappears?\"\n- Encourage students to revisit their models and trace pathways carefully.\n- Affirm reasoning and evidence-based predictions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students demonstrate understanding of ecosystem interdependence by predicting cascading effects of environmental change.\n- Students produce a modified food web or written explanation showing cause-and-effect relationships.\n- Students articulate why biodiversity and healthy habitats matter.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of matter movement through ecosystems and food web structures.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student participation during Engage discussion.\n- Review food web models for accuracy of organism placement and connections.\n- Listen to student explanations during group shares in the Explain phase.\n- Note student responses to \"Check for Understanding\" questions.\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (End of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a blank exit ticket containing these prompts:\n\n1. **Draw a simple food web** with at least 5 organisms from the wetland. Include the alligator.\n\n2. **Label and identify:**\n   - One producer\n   - One primary consumer\n   - One secondary consumer\n   - The alligator's role\n\n3. **Answer this question in 2-3 sentences:**\n   \"Explain how energy from the sun reaches the alligator through the food web. What role do plants play?\"\n\n4. **Bonus Challenge:**\n   \"If decomposers disappeared from this ecosystem, what would happen? Explain why decomposers are important.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n\n- ✓ Students correctly identify and label at least 3 different organisms and their roles in the food web.\n- ✓ Students draw arrows showing the direction of energy flow (from food source to consumer).\n- ✓ Students can trace a pathway from the sun through producers to the alligator.\n- ✓ Students explain that decomposers recycle nutrients back into the environment.\n- ✓ Students recognize that the alligator is connected to and dependent on other organisms in the ecosystem.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- 80% of students successfully create a food web with correct feeding relationships.\n- 85% of students can identify the role of at least one organism in the ecosystem.\n- 75% of students can trace energy flow from producers to the alligator.\n- Most students recognize the interconnectedness of the ecosystem and the importance of each organism.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support for Struggling Learners:**\n\n1. **Simplified Organism List:** Provide a pre-selected list of 6-8 organisms instead of asking students to choose from a larger set. Include a visual guide (small pictures) to help students recognize organisms.\n\n2. **Guided Food Web Template:** Give students a partially completed food web with some connections already drawn. Students fill in missing arrows and organisms, reducing cognitive load while still requiring active engagement.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Explanations:** Provide sentence starters such as:\n   - \"Energy from the sun goes to _____, then to _____, then to the alligator.\"\n   - \"If the plants died, the _____ would have nothing to eat.\"\n   - \"Decomposers are important because they _____.\"\n\n**Challenge for Advanced Learners:**\n\n1. **Multi-Level Food Web:** Ask students to create a more complex web including multiple pathways, alternative prey items, and organisms with more flexible diets (e.g., an omnivorous fish that eats both plants and smaller animals). Challenge them to identify and label energy levels (trophic levels).\n\n2. **Energy Loss Calculation:** Introduce the concept that energy is lost at each level (only ~10% of energy transfers from one level to the next). Have students calculate or illustrate how much energy is available at each level of the food chain. Example: \"If plants capture 1,000 units of energy from the sun, about how much energy reaches the alligator?\"\n\n3. **Ecosystem Impact Analysis:** Present a real-world scenario (e.g., invasive species introduction, pollution, wetland restoration) and ask students to research and predict how the food web would change. Have them present findings to the class.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Wetland Field Study or Virtual Tour:** If possible, take students to a local wetland to observe organisms and habitats. If not, use a virtual tour or high-quality video of a wetland ecosystem. Have students create a photographic or sketched inventory of organisms they observe and then build a food web based on their findings. This connects learning to real-world ecosystems.\n\n2. **Decomposition Investigation:** Set up a decomposition experiment where students observe how organic matter (leaves, fruit scraps, plant material) breaks down over 2-3 weeks in a sealed container with soil and water. Students document changes, identify the role of decomposers, and connect findings to the matter cycling concept from the lesson. This provides tangible evidence of nutrient recycling.\n\n3. **Design a Balanced Ecosystem:** Challenge students to design their own closed ecosystem (e.g., in a jar with plants, soil, water, and small aquatic organisms if available). Students must include producers, consumers, and decomposers and predict whether their ecosystem will be sustainable. Over time, students observe what happens and adjust. This extends understanding of ecosystem balance and interdependence to a hands-on, experimental context.\n\n---",
