ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about an unusual plant-growing situation and activate prior knowledge about plant structures and needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image (the photograph of the plant growing from the plastic bottle)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or document camera so all students can see it clearly. Do not explain it yet.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (allow 1-2 minutes of think-time before calling on students):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is growing here, and where is it growing?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a plant grow in a bottle before? Why might someone grow a plant this way?\"\n   - \"What do you think this plant needs to survive and keep growing? Where might it get those things?\"\n   - \"Look at the plant's leaves—they're bright green. What does that tell you about whether this plant is healthy and getting what it needs?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations** on chart paper without correcting misconceptions. Emphasize curiosity: \"These are great observations! Let's investigate further.\"\n\n4. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if we were to grow our own plants in bottles like this one, what would we need to do to keep them healthy? What might happen if we forgot to water them? What if we put them in a dark closet?\" Write a few predictions on the chart.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become plant scientists. We'll investigate what plants really need to grow and survive by growing our own plants in bottles, just like the one in this picture!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students conduct a hands-on investigation to discover what plants need to survive and what structures help them grow, using their own plant-in-a-bottle experiments.\n\n**Materials (per pair of students):**\n- 1 clear plastic bottle (500 mL or 20 oz), cut in half horizontally by the teacher before the lesson\n- Potting soil (enough to fill bottle halfway)\n- 1-2 fast-growing seeds (bean seeds or radish seeds work well) OR 1 young seedling already sprouted\n- Spray bottle filled with water\n- Ruler\n- Magnifying glass (optional but helpful)\n- Observation sheet (provided below) or notebook for drawing/recording\n\n**Activity: Step-by-Step Student Directions**\n\n1. **Prepare your bottle setup:** Place soil in the bottom half of your plastic bottle, filling it about 2 inches from the top.\n\n2. **Plant your seed** (or place your seedling) in the soil. If planting seeds, push them about 1 inch into the soil. Gently press soil around the seed.\n\n3. **Water your plant carefully:** Use the spray bottle to mist the soil until it's damp (not soaking). Count your spritzes: ____ times.\n\n4. **Observe the bottle bottle's structure:** Look at the clear plastic. Why do you think a clear bottle might be better than an opaque one for growing plants?\n\n5. **Over the next week (or 2-3 days if using pre-sprouted seedlings):**\n   - **Every other day:** Water lightly with the spray bottle (2-3 spritzes).\n   - **Every day:** Use a ruler to measure the height of the stem from soil to the highest leaf. Record the measurement.\n   - **Sketch what you see:** Draw the plant each day in your observation sheet. Label any structures you can identify (roots, stem, leaves).\n   - **Use magnifying glass:** Look closely at the leaves and stem. What textures or details can you see?\n\n6. **Record observations:** Students should note:\n   - Date and time of observation\n   - Height of plant\n   - Color of leaves\n   - New structures appearing (new leaves, visible roots against the clear bottle)\n   - Anything unusual or surprising\n\n**Connection to the photograph:** \"The plant in the photograph grew in a bottle just like yours. It stayed green and healthy because someone gave it water and light. Your investigation will show us exactly what made that happen.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among student pairs, asking guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the roots? Are they visible through the clear bottle? Why might the leaves be growing toward the window?\"\n- Do NOT tell students why plants need light or water; let them observe and wonder.\n- Prompt with observation questions: \"What changed since yesterday? What stayed the same?\"\n- Help students accurately measure and record (scaffold if needed).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe visible root growth against the clear bottle walls.\n- Students will document measurable stem/leaf growth.\n- Students will notice that watered plants thrive while (if you set up a control) unwatered or low-light plants slow or stop growing.\n- Students will produce a series of daily sketches and measurements showing growth patterns.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to plant structure-function relationships using evidence from the Explore phase.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart paper or digital slide\n- Colored markers\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: a dissected plant or diagram showing internal root structure\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 student pairs to share one observation or measurement from their plant.\n   - Display some observation drawings on the board.\n   - Ask: \"What structures did we see growing? What does each one do?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Plant Structures and Their Functions (8-10 minutes):**\n   \n   Create an anchor chart with labeled diagrams. Use student-friendly language:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n\n   - **Roots** – The parts of the plant that grow underground (or visible in your bottle). Roots soak up water and nutrients from the soil that the plant needs to survive and grow. Roots also anchor the plant so it doesn't fall over.\n   \n   - **Stem** – The main stalk that grows up from the soil. The stem carries water and nutrients from the roots up to the leaves. It also holds the leaves up toward the light so they can grow big and healthy.\n   \n   - **Leaves** – The flat, green parts attached to the stem. Leaves use sunlight to make food for the plant (this process is called photosynthesis, but you can simply say \"leaves catch sunlight to make energy\"). The color green means the plant is healthy and getting what it needs.\n   \n   - **Chlorophyll** – The stuff in leaves that makes them green and helps them catch sunlight to make energy for the plant. (Fourth graders can understand this as \"the green color that helps plants eat sunlight.\")\n   \n   - **Photosynthesis** – *Optional, advanced terminology:* The way plants use sunlight, water, and air to make food. (Simplify to: \"How plants turn sunlight into energy.\")\n\n3. **Connect Back to Evidence (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to student observation drawings: \"You sketched roots growing down into the soil. Why do you think roots need to go into soil instead of staying above ground?\"\n   - Show the original photograph: \"Look at the leaves on this plant in the bottle. They're bright green, just like the ones you're growing. What does that tell us about whether this plant got water, light, and nutrients?\"\n   - Ask: \"Which structures are external—on the outside—that we can see? (Leaves, stem) Which are mostly internal or hidden? (Roots) Why might it be hard to see roots in regular soil but easy in this clear bottle?\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Quick think-pair-share: \"Tell your partner: If a plant's leaves turned yellow, what might that mean about whether it's getting what it needs?\"\n   - Ask 2-3 students to share aloud.\n   - Clarify: \"Yellow leaves might mean the plant isn't getting enough water, light, or nutrients. The structures of the plant—roots, stem, leaves—only work well when the plant gets these things.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and label roots, stem, and leaves on a plant diagram or their own plant.\n- Students understand that each structure has a job (function) that helps the plant survive.\n- Students can explain why the green color of leaves indicates a healthy plant getting the resources it needs.\n- Students recognize the connection between the structures they observed growing in their bottles and the structures visible on the plant in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding of plant structures and survival needs to predict outcomes and solve problems in new scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Scenario cards (printed or written on chart paper) — see below\n- 4-5 small potted plants or plant images\n- Optional: markers, paper for students to draw or write predictions\n\n**Activity: Plant Survival Challenge**\n\nPresent students with 3-4 real-world scenarios. Students work in small groups (3-4 students) and use what they learned to make predictions and argue why plants would survive or struggle.\n\n**Scenario Cards (read aloud or display):**\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"Maria planted a seed in her window sill and watered it every day. But then winter came and her window got very dark. The plant's leaves started to turn yellow. Why is this happening, and what should Maria do?\"\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"Jacob grew a plant in a bottle with soil, just like you did. But he forgot to water it for two weeks. When he looked at it, the soil was very dry and the leaves were droopy. Will the roots still be able to take up water if Jacob waters it now? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Scenario 3:** \"You're designing a bottle garden for a classroom. You want the plant to stay healthy all year. Where in the classroom would you put it—near a sunny window or in a dark corner? Use what you know about leaves and photosynthesis to explain your choice.\"\n\n**Group Process (10-12 minutes):**\n1. Assign each group one scenario.\n2. Groups discuss: \"What structures of the plant are affected? What does the plant need? What should happen next?\"\n3. Groups record their thinking: either as a drawing with labels or as 2-3 sentences explaining their prediction.\n4. Groups present their scenario solution to the class (30 seconds each).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Listen for student use of vocabulary: roots, stem, leaves, water, light, nutrients.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"How do the roots help the plant even though we can't see them in this scenario?\"\n- Affirm reasoning: \"You're thinking like scientists—you used what you observed in your bottles to make a prediction about a new situation!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply knowledge of plant structures to real-world problems.\n- Students construct simple arguments: \"The plant leaves turned yellow because _____ (lack of light, no water), so we should _____ (move it to a window, water it).\"\n- Students demonstrate understanding that each plant structure has a function related to survival.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant structures, functions, and survival needs through formative and summative methods.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Circulate and note which students correctly identify structures and can explain why they're watering and placing plants in light.\n- **Listen-in during group discussions:** Do students use vocabulary accurately? Can they explain cause-and-effect (if no water → roots can't absorb it → plant dies)?\n- **Review observation sheets:** Check that students are recording measurements, drawing structures, and showing growth over time.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes, end of lesson or next day):**\n\nGive students one of these assessments (choose based on your class level):\n\n**Option A: Draw and Label (Best for all learners)**\n\"Draw a plant growing in a bottle. Label the roots, stem, and leaves. Write one sentence for each part explaining what it does to help the plant survive.\"\n\n**Expected response:** \n- Accurate drawing with roots, stem, leaves labeled\n- Roots take in water; stem holds plant and moves water; leaves catch light for energy\n- Legible writing\n\n**Option B: Short Answer (For students ready for written explanation)**\n\"Look at the plant in the photograph from the beginning of the lesson. Explain why this plant is healthy and green. Use the words: water, light, roots, leaves, and nutrients in your answer.\"\n\n**Expected response:**\n- Mentions roots taking in water/nutrients from soil\n- Mentions leaves catching light\n- Concludes plant is healthy because it received what it needed\n- Uses 3-4 of the required vocabulary words\n\n**Option C: Picture + Oral (For students needing oral support)**\nShow a plant image. Ask: \"Point to where the roots are. Why does the plant need roots? Now point to the leaves. Why are the leaves green and important?\"\n\n**Expected response:**\n- Points to correct parts\n- \"Roots get water and nutrients from soil\"\n- \"Leaves are green because they catch light and make food\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student can identify at least 2 plant structures and explain their function.\n- Student connects at least one structure to plant survival (water, light, or nutrients).\n- Student uses science vocabulary accurately (roots, stem, leaves, water, light, nutrients, or chlorophyll).\n\n**How to Determine if Learning Objectives Were Met:**\n1. **Learning Objective 1** (Identify structures & functions): Check exit ticket—student labels roots, stem, leaves and explains each one's job.\n2. **Learning Objective 2** (Describe plant needs): Review observations from Explore—does student's data show they understood watering and light's role?\n3. **Learning Objective 3** (Compare/contrast): Listen for student comparisons between typical soil and bottle growing during group discussions.\n4. **Learning Objective 4** (Construct argument): Exit ticket or scenario response should show student making a claim and using evidence (e.g., \"The plant is healthy because it has water from misting, light from the window, and soil with nutrients\").\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified observation sheets:** Provide a pre-drawn plant outline with labeled blanks and a daily checklist instead of open-ended recording. Students mark what they see: □ Roots grown □ Stem taller □ New leaves □ Green color.\n\n2. **Vocabulary cards with pictures:** Create illustrated flashcards (roots, stem, leaves, water, light, soil) that students can match or sort. Use these during Explain phase for repeated reference.\n\n3. **Paired reading of scenarios:** During Elaborate, pair struggling readers with strong readers, or read Scenario Cards aloud twice and ask students to draw the answer instead of writing.\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Use Option A (draw and label) with a word bank of structure names provided.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-variable investigation:** Ask advanced students to design their own experiment: \"What if we grow one plant with water but no light, and another with light but no water? Make a prediction about what will happen.\" Have them set up control and test bottles and monitor for 1-2 weeks, recording more detailed observations.\n\n2. **Research photosynthesis in depth:** Introduce the term \"photosynthesis\" and provide a simple diagram showing how leaves use sunlight + water + air to make energy. Ask students to explain in their own words why leaves MUST be green and in sunlight.\n\n3. **Design a bottle garden for a specific space:** Challenge students to plan a classroom bottle garden that will stay healthy in a location with limited sunlight (near a dark wall, in a corner). They must argue which structures of the plant they'd need to monitor most carefully and explain why.\n\n4. **Compare plant structures to animal structures:** Advanced students can compare roots (absorb nutrients) to a stomach, or leaves (make energy) to muscles. This bridges to the next unit on animal structures.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Long-Term Bottle Garden Observation (2-4 weeks):**\n   - Have students continue measuring and sketching their plants weekly. Plot the growth data on a line graph (introduces graphing skills). Discuss: \"Why did growth slow down after two weeks? Could the bottle be too small? Would transplanting help?\" This leads to questions about adaptation and growth constraints.\n\n2. **Seed Dissection Investigation:**\n   - Soak large seeds (beans, sunflower seeds) overnight, then let students carefully open them and identify the baby plant parts inside (seed coat, cotyledon, embryo root, embryo shoot). Connect to the idea that structures exist even before the plant grows—they're pre-built! This deepens understanding of inherited structures.\n\n3. **Create a Bottle Garden Poster or Digital Presentation:**\n   - Students compile their observation drawings and measurements into a \"growth story\" with captions explaining what the plant did each day and why. Present to another class or create a classroom display. This reinforces vocabulary and reasoning.\n\n4. **Plant Needs Sorting Game:**\n   - Create cards with images or words (water, sunlight, soil, nutrients, space, temperature). Students sort them into categories: \"Things roots need,\" \"Things leaves need,\" \"Things all parts of the plant need.\" Play as a station rotation or whole-group game to reinforce the Explain phase vocabulary.\n\n5. **Visit a School Garden or Greenhouse (if available):**\n   - Observe real plants in various growing conditions. Ask students to identify structures and predict which plants are healthiest and why based on light, water, and soil observations. Connect to the photograph and bottle garden experiment.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Timing:** If you don't have access to germinated seedlings, start seeds 3-5 days before the lesson so they have visible roots and shoots during Explore. Alternatively, use fast-growing plants like bean sprouts, which can show significant growth in 5-7 days.\n- **Photography:** Encourage students to take photos of their plants each day using tablets or phones if available. This creates a digital time-lapse record and engages visual learners.\n- **Safety reminder:** Supervise soil handling (wash hands after). Ensure bottles are cut smoothly with no sharp edges.\n- **Connection to photograph:** Return to the original photo frequently to anchor learning. Ask: \"How is your plant like or different from the one in this picture?\"",
