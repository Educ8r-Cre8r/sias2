ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity and activate prior knowledge about how animals hide and stay safe.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph (camouflage.jpg)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or hold it up. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds WITHOUT talking.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions:**\n   - \"Can you spot the animal in this picture? Where is it hiding?\"\n   - \"What color is the animal? What color is the place it's hiding?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this animal looks like that?\"\n   - \"If you were a big hungry animal looking for this one, would you be able to find it? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Record student responses** on chart paper as they share. Use their exact words when possible.\n\n4. **Wonder aloud:** \"I wonder why this animal has colors and marks that look so much like the wood and leaves around it. What do YOU think?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an activity where we become animals looking for hiding spots, and you'll discover why camouflage helps animals survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate camouflage through hands-on discovery and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Session 1:** Colored paper (tan, brown, green, gray), markers, scissors, glue sticks, magazines or printed animal pictures\n- **Session 2:** Prepared \"habitat boxes\" (see setup below) with leaves, twigs, bark, and paper animals in various colors\n- Chart paper for recording observations\n- Clipboards and paper for student sketches\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Session 1 — Camouflage Design:**\n\n1. **Explain the task simply:** \"We're going to make a paper animal and hide it in a place where it matches.\"\n\n2. **Provide each student with:**\n   - Colored paper (let them choose the color)\n   - Scissors (pre-cut simple animal shapes if fine motor skills are a concern)\n   - Markers to add details\n   - A \"habitat\" made from construction paper (a forest scene, desert, or snowy place)\n\n3. **Student directions (delivered verbally and modeled):**\n   - \"Pick a color that matches a place you want your animal to hide.\"\n   - \"Draw or cut out a simple animal shape.\"\n   - \"Add spots, stripes, or patterns if you want.\"\n   - \"Glue your animal onto your habitat picture.\"\n   - \"Can your friends find your animal? Can YOU see it easily?\"\n\n4. **Teacher role:** Circulate, ask questions:\n   - \"Why did you pick that color?\"\n   - \"Does your animal blend in? Why or why not?\"\n   - Model thinking aloud: \"I see a brown animal on brown paper. It's hard to see! That's camouflage!\"\n\n5. **What students record/document:**\n   - Their completed habitat with camouflaged animal\n   - Draw a simple picture of their animal on their \"I Spy\" recording sheet\n   - Circle or point out where they hid it\n\n**Session 2 — Finding Hidden Animals:**\n\n1. **Set up habitat boxes:** Small boxes or shoe boxes filled with natural materials (dried leaves, twigs, bark pieces, moss). Hide small paper animals in matching colors inside each box.\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Look inside your box. Can you find the hidden animal?\"\n   - \"Look VERY carefully. The animal's colors match the things around it.\"\n   - \"Once you find it, gently take it out and show a friend.\"\n   - \"Describe what the animal looked like and why it was hard to find.\"\n\n3. **Teacher role:** Ask guiding questions:\n   - \"What color is the animal? What color is the space around it?\"\n   - \"Why was it tricky to spot?\"\n   - \"Does this animal need to hide? From what?\"\n\n4. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students find hidden animals in at least 2-3 boxes\n   - Students verbally describe that the animal's color \"matches\" or \"looks like\" the habitat\n   - Students begin connecting hiding to survival\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize the concept of camouflage as a survival need.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary and simple pictures\n- The original photograph (camouflage.jpg) displayed again\n- Real objects (twigs, leaves, bark) and the paper animal from Session 2\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a meeting space** with the photograph visible.\n\n2. **Facilitator shares findings:**\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover in your boxes? What did you notice about the animals you found?\"\n   - Accept all responses: \"They were hard to see,\" \"They looked like the leaves,\" \"They matched the brown stuff.\"\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary with CONCRETE visuals:**\n\n   | Vocabulary | Student-Friendly Definition | Visual |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Camouflage** | An animal's color or pattern that helps it hide and look like the place it lives. It keeps the animal safe. | Show the paper animal next to leaves. \"See? It looks like the leaves. This is camouflage.\" |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives—like a forest, desert, or swamp. It has trees, rocks, water, or dirt. | Point to the box with leaves and twigs. \"This is a habitat.\" |\n   | **Survive** | To stay alive and stay safe. Animals need to survive. | \"This animal uses camouflage to survive. It hides so other animals can't catch it.\" |\n   | **Hide/Blend In** | To look like something else so nobody can see you easily. | \"Look at the real leaf and the paper leaf. Can you tell them apart? They blend in!\" |\n   | **Pattern** | Shapes, colors, or marks that repeat again and again. | Show stripes or spots on the animal. \"This pattern helps it hide.\" |\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Remember the animal in the first picture? It was hard to find because of camouflage!\"\n   - Point to specific features: \"See the patterns on the animal? They match the wood. See the colors? Brown, tan, gray—just like the bark and leaves.\"\n   - \"This camouflage helps the animal SURVIVE. It stays safe from animals that might want to eat it.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Who can point to the animal in this picture?\" (Students indicate location.)\n   - Ask: \"Why is it hard to see?\" (Accept: \"It matches,\" \"Same color,\" \"Looks like the wood.\")\n   - Ask: \"How does this help the animal stay alive?\" (Accept: \"Stays hidden,\" \"Can't be found,\" \"Stays safe.\")\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use or understand the word \"camouflage\" in context\n- Students recognize that an animal's appearance helps it survive\n- Students describe at least one example of how color or pattern helps an animal hide\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by exploring camouflage in a new context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Nature hunt walk (or indoor scavenger hunt if weather doesn't permit)\n- Clipboards, pencils, paper\n- Simple picture cards showing different animals in different habitats (optional—use if outdoor walk isn't feasible)\n- Digital camera or tablet to document findings\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A — Real Nature Hunt (Outdoor or Indoor Classroom Spaces):**\n\n1. **Prepare students:** \"We're going to hunt for things in nature that are camouflaged. That means they hide because they match their place.\"\n\n2. **Student task:**\n   - Walk around outdoor area or classroom space\n   - \"Find something that hides because it matches what's around it.\"\n   - Examples: A stick that looks like a branch, a tan rock on tan dirt, a green leaf on green plants\n   - Use clipboards to sketch or point out what they found\n\n3. **Guiding questions during hunt:**\n   - \"Does this thing blend in? Why?\"\n   - \"What color is it? What color is the place around it?\"\n   - \"If an animal was hiding here, would it be safe?\"\n\n**Option B — Picture Scavenger Hunt (Classroom-Based):**\n\n1. **Provide picture cards** showing different animals in their habitats (butterfly on flowers, frog on leaves, bird on branch, etc.)\n\n2. **Student task:**\n   - \"Can you find the hidden animal on each card?\"\n   - Circle or point to the animal\n   - Explain why it's hard to see\n\n3. **Extend the thinking:**\n   - \"Which animal do YOU think is best at hiding? Why?\"\n   - \"If this animal lived in a different place, would it still be camouflaged? Why not?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without giving away hiding spots immediately\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you see? What matches? Where does the animal blend in?\"\n- Celebrate discoveries with enthusiasm\n- Record observations: \"You found a camouflaged ___! It hides by ___.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 1-3 examples of camouflage in new contexts\n- Students explain that color and pattern help animals hide and survive\n- Students make predictions: \"If the animal moved to a different place, it wouldn't hide as well\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of camouflage and survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During All Phases):**\n- **Observation:** Watch for students who can locate the hidden animal in the photograph and explain WHY it's hidden (color match, pattern match).\n- **Questioning:** Use think-aloud responses to gauge comprehension. Listen for language like \"matches,\" \"hides,\" \"same color,\" \"hard to see.\"\n- **Behavior in Explore:** Can students design a camouflaged animal or find one in a box? Do they make connections to the photograph?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n\n**Administer ONE of these (choose based on your students' communication levels):**\n\n**Option 1 — Picture-Based Response:**\n- Show the original camouflage photograph again\n- Ask: \"Where is the animal hiding?\" (Student points or circles)\n- Ask: \"Why can't we see it easily?\" (Student responds verbally or points to color/pattern)\n- Record their answer\n\n**Option 2 — Simple Sketch and Tell:**\n- Give student blank paper\n- Prompt: \"Draw an animal hiding. Make it the same color as where it lives.\"\n- Ask: \"Tell me why your animal is camouflaged.\"\n\n**Option 3 — Matching Assessment:**\n- Show 3 pictures: (1) red bird on green tree, (2) brown bird on brown bark, (3) white bird on white snow\n- Ask: \"Which bird is hiding? Which one is easy to see? Why?\"\n- Student points and explains\n\n**Success Criteria — Students Meet Learning Objectives When They:**\n1. ✓ Can locate or identify a camouflaged animal in at least one image/box\n2. ✓ Describe the animal's color or pattern as \"matching\" or \"the same as\" its habitat\n3. ✓ Make a connection between camouflage and staying safe (even if the language is simple: \"It hides so it doesn't get caught\")\n4. ✓ Show curiosity about how other animals hide\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most kindergarteners will successfully identify camouflaged animals in visual contexts\n- Most will describe the color match as a reason for hiding\n- Some may explicitly connect this to survival; others may need reinforcement\n- All students will engage with the concrete, visual nature of the lesson\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**SUPPORT (Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"hide,\" \"match,\" and \"same color\" — hold off on \"camouflage\" and \"habitat\" until students grasp the concept. After mastery, introduce the official terms.\n\n2. **Pre-located hidden animals:** In Explore (Session 2), mark or slightly reveal where the animal is hiding in one box before students search independently. This builds confidence and shows them what to look for.\n\n3. **Concrete pairing:** Pair struggling students with a successful peer during nature hunts or picture searches. Peer modeling is powerful at this age. Provide sentence stems: \"I found ___ hiding because it's ___.\"\n\n4. **One-on-one questioning:** After activities, use simpler questions: \"Can you see the animal?\" \"What color is it?\" rather than \"Why is it camouflaged?\" Build to the \"why\" gradually.\n\n**CHALLENGE (Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-habitat camouflage exploration:** Provide pictures of the SAME animal in different habitats and ask: \"Would this animal hide well here? Why or why not? Where would it hide better?\" This pushes causal thinking and prediction.\n\n2. **Design a new habitat:** Give students a picture of an animal (e.g., a blue butterfly) and ask: \"Where in nature COULD this animal live so it would be camouflaged? Draw or describe a place where this animal could hide.\"\n\n3. **Animal-habitat matching challenge:** Provide picture cards of various animals and various habitats (mixed up). Ask students to match the animal to the habitat where it can best hide using camouflage. Have them explain their reasoning.\n\n4. **Story extension:** \"Imagine this camouflaged animal was NOT that color. Tell me what might happen to it. Who might catch it? How would its life be different?\" This develops reasoning about cause and effect in survival.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Camouflage Fashion\" Art Project:** \n   - Students design an outfit for themselves or a stuffed animal using camouflage patterns and colors\n   - They choose a place they want to \"hide\" (classroom corner, playground, forest, etc.)\n   - Display creations with labels: \"This animal hides in a ___ because ___\"\n   - This connects camouflage to real-world design and creativity\n\n2. **Habitat Diorama Building:**\n   - Provide small boxes, natural materials (twigs, leaves, bark, dirt), and small plastic or paper animals\n   - Students create a mini-habitat and hide the animal using camouflage\n   - Partner activity: One student hides the animal, the other searches and explains why it's hard to find\n   - Take photos for a class \"Hide and Seek\" gallery walk\n\n3. **Read-Aloud Connection & Discussion:**\n   - Read age-appropriate books about camouflage: *Is It Camouflage?* by Britta Teckentrup or *The Mixed-Up Chameleon* by Eric Carle\n   - After reading, ask: \"How did the animal in the story use camouflage? What happened when it couldn't hide?\"\n   - Connect story events to the survival concept: camouflage keeps animals safe\n\n---\n\nThis lesson uses the concrete, visual learning style of kindergarteners while building understanding of a key survival concept. The repeated exposure to camouflage through multiple modalities—photographs, hands-on creation, real-world searching, and stories—ensures deeper learning and retention.",
