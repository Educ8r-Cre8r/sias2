Identify and describe the seeds inside a pepper fruit.\n2. Explain that seeds grow inside fruits to make new plants.\n3. Demonstrate how animals and people help spread seeds to new places.\n4. Compare the structure of different seeds and discuss why this helps plants survive.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the cut pepper (or printed copies, 8.5\" × 11\")\n- Chart paper and marker\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around printed copies. Give students 30 seconds of quiet \"look time\" before speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause 5-10 seconds after each to allow thinking):\n   - \"What do you see inside this pepper? What are those bumpy, cream-colored things?\"\n   - \"Have you ever eaten a pepper? What was inside when someone cut it open?\"\n   - \"Why do you think these little things (seeds) are inside the pepper instead of outside?\"\n   - \"How do you think new pepper plants grow? Where do they start?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today we're going to be detectives! I want you to think: *If this pepper has babies inside it, how do those babies get to the ground to grow into new plants?* Turn and whisper your idea to a partner.\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper with simple drawings. Don't correct misconceptions—these will be refined during Explain.\n\n**Transition:** \"You have great ideas! Let's open up our own peppers and investigate what's really inside. Then we'll figure out how seeds travel!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 fresh green or red bell pepper (room temperature, washed)\n- 1 plastic cutting board\n- 1 plastic knife (dull edge is fine)\n- 1 small paper plate\n- 1 magnifying glass (optional but recommended)\n- Paper towels\n- 1 small ziplock bag for seeds (optional, for later planting)\n- **Teacher prep:** Pre-cut 1-2 peppers beforehand so students see what to expect\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (written on board or chart paper):**\n\n1. \"Wash your hands. Get your pepper and place it on the cutting board.\"\n2. \"Carefully push your plastic knife into the top of the pepper, just below where the green part is. Ask a friend to help if you need it.\"\n3. \"Gently cut the pepper in half. Peek inside! What do you see?\"\n4. \"Use your fingers to gently scoop out the seeds and bumpy parts inside. Put them on your plate.\"\n5. \"Look closely with the magnifying glass. Draw or describe what the seeds look like. Are they all the same size? What color are they?\"\n6. \"Try to count: How many seeds are in your pepper half? Write the number on your paper.\"\n7. \"Feel a seed. Is it hard or soft? Smooth or bumpy?\"\n8. **If time allows:** \"If we planted one of these seeds in soil with water and sunlight, what do you think would happen?\"\n\n**Connection to Photograph:**\nPoint out: \"The bumpy, cream-colored things you see in the photo are exactly what you're holding in your hands right now. These are seeds!\"\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Quick sketch or labeled drawing of the inside of the pepper\n- Number of seeds counted\n- 2-3 words describing how seeds feel and look (e.g., \"hard,\" \"tiny,\" \"smooth,\" \"cream-colored\")\n- One prediction: \"If I plant this seed, it will...\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups with prompting questions: *\"What are you noticing? How many can you count? Does it feel bumpy or smooth?\"*\n- Help with cutting if needed—the goal is observation, not independence with knives.\n- Do NOT explain the function of seeds yet. Encourage curiosity: *\"What do you think these are for?\"*\n- Ensure hands are washed after handling.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe 20-40+ seeds per pepper half\n- They will notice seeds are small, hard, pale/tan or whitish, and relatively uniform in size\n- They will recognize that peppers contain many seeds in a protected space\n- They will begin wondering about seed growth and dispersal\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers (multiple colors)\n- The photograph (displayed again)\n- Real pepper halves or seeds from Explore (for reference)\n- Optional: Picture cards of other seeds (apple seeds, watermelon seeds, beans, acorns) for comparison\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 volunteers to share one thing they discovered: *\"What was surprising about the seeds you found?\"*\n   - Record their observations on chart paper.\n   - Affirm all observations: *\"You're all scientists! You noticed real things!\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   Teach these terms using the pepper and real seeds as visual references:\n\n   - **Seed:** A tiny baby plant and food wrapped up together inside a hard shell. When given water, soil, and sunlight, a seed grows into a new plant.\n   - **Fruit:** The part of a plant that holds and protects seeds inside. (Point to the pepper.) A pepper is a fruit, just like an apple or orange!\n   - **Germinate (or \"grow\"):** When a seed wakes up and starts to grow roots and a stem. This happens when the seed gets water, warmth, and air.\n   - **Disperse:** A fancy word that means \"scatter\" or \"spread.\" Seeds disperse when they travel from one place to another—animals and people help move them!\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph and Explore Activity (3-4 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember the bumpy things inside the pepper in our picture? Those are seeds!\"\n   - \"Inside each seed is a teensy, tiny plant waiting to grow.\"\n   - \"The pepper keeps the seeds safe until they're ready to go live somewhere else.\"\n   - \"The pepper is like a protective house for baby plants!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (formative assessment):**\n   - Ask: *\"Which of these is a seed's job: to make the pepper taste good, or to grow into a new plant?\"* (Listen for: \"grow into a new plant\")\n   - Gesture to the pepper halves: *\"Is this bump-bumpy thing inside the pepper a seed or a vegetable?\"* (Some will say \"vegetable\" because we eat peppers—affirm that peppers are fruits and are food, AND that they also contain seeds.)\n\n**Vocabulary Chart (display for reference):**\n\n| Word | What It Means |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Seed** | A tiny baby plant inside a hard shell with food for growing |\n| **Fruit** | Holds and protects seeds inside (peppers, apples, watermelons) |\n| **Germinate** | When a seed gets water and starts to grow |\n| **Disperse** | To scatter or spread seeds to new places |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the word \"seed\" correctly to identify the structures inside the pepper.\n- Students will understand that peppers are fruits containing seeds.\n- Students will recognize that seeds need conditions to grow (water, soil, warmth, light).\n- Students will begin to understand that seeds travel to new places.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and colored markers\n- Magazines or picture printouts showing animals (birds eating berries, squirrels with acorns, ants carrying seeds, etc.)\n- Paper and crayons/colored pencils\n- Optional: a few different types of seeds (sunflower, bean, small stones for comparison)\n\n**Activity: \"Seed Travel Story\"**\n\n1. **Introduce a scenario (2 minutes):**\n   - \"We have hundreds of pepper seeds. They're inside the pepper now, nice and safe. But what if we want new pepper plants to grow in a different place—maybe your backyard or the park?\"\n   - \"Seeds need to travel! Let's think about who or what can help scatter seeds.\"\n\n2. **Brainstorm with students (3 minutes):**\n   - *\"What animals eat fruits with seeds in them?\"* (Birds, squirrels, ants, insects, even people!)\n   - *\"When a bird eats a berry, what happens to the seeds inside?\"* (They pass through the bird's body and drop on the ground far away!)\n   - *\"What else moves seeds?\"* (Wind, water, people, walking animals)\n   - Record ideas on chart paper with simple drawings.\n\n3. **Create a Seed Dispersal Model (8-10 minutes):**\n   - **Option A (Hands-on):** Distribute one seed to each student. Place a piece of paper on the floor and have students \"act like\" different things:\n     - *\"Be a bird. Where would you fly and drop this seed?\"* (Students walk and place seeds around the room.)\n     - *\"Be wind. Blow your seed gently.\"* (Students toss seeds lightly.)\n     - *\"Be water. Wash this seed downstream.\"* (Students place seeds in a line to show water travel.)\n     - Observe the different paths seeds traveled.\n   \n   - **Option B (Drawing):** Students draw a simple comic strip (3-4 boxes) showing: Seed → Animal Eats Fruit → Animal Poops/Drops Seed → New Plant Grows. Use very simple, student-friendly language.\n\n4. **Share and discuss (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 students to show their model or drawing.\n   - *\"How does this help pepper plants survive?\"* (Seeds grow in new places with fresh soil and space.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Validate all ideas, even silly ones (like \"aliens taking seeds to space\").\n- Use humor and enthusiasm: *\"Wow, so a bird is like a seed taxi!\"*\n- Guide students gently toward realistic examples if needed.\n- Ask follow-up questions: *\"What would happen if all the seeds just fell straight down next to the mother plant?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that seeds move to new locations.\n- Students will identify at least 2-3 ways seeds travel (animals, wind, water, people).\n- Students will recognize this helps plants survive and grow in new places.\n- They will show this understanding through a model, drawing, or physical demonstration.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of learning objectives.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Observe students cutting and examining peppers. Ask: *\"What do you see? How many? What do they feel like?\"* Listen for curiosity and accurate descriptions.\n- **During Explain:** Listen to vocabulary use during share-out. Do students call seeds \"seeds\"? Do they connect to the photograph?\n- **During Elaborate:** Watch the seed dispersal activity. Can students explain how seeds move?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (choose one for end of lesson or next session):**\n\n**Option 1: Picture Sort (most accessible for second grade)**\n- Show students 4-6 pictures: a seed, a fruit with seeds, an animal, a flower, a plant with roots, etc.\n- Ask: *\"Which ones help make new plants?\"* or *\"Circle the things that have seeds inside.\"*\n- Success: Students correctly identify seeds and fruits.\n\n**Option 2: Three-Question Exit Ticket (oral or written)**\n1. *\"What's inside this pepper?\"* (Expected: \"Seeds\")\n2. *\"Why does a pepper have seeds inside it?\"* (Expected: \"To make new plants\" or \"Baby plants\")\n3. *\"Name one animal that can help a seed travel to a new place.\"* (Expected: Any animal—bird, squirrel, ant, person, etc.)\n\n**Option 3: Drawing with Labels (for students who need to show, not tell)**\n- Provide a simple outline of a pepper cut in half.\n- Students label: \"seed,\" \"fruit,\" and draw an arrow showing where a seed goes after a bird eats it.\n- Success: Accurate labels and logical arrow showing seed dispersal.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies seeds correctly as the structures inside the pepper.\n- ✓ Student explains seeds grow into new plants (in own words).\n- ✓ Student describes at least one way seeds move to new places.\n- ✓ Student uses or understands the word \"seed,\" \"fruit,\" or \"disperse\" in context.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students will correctly identify seeds inside the pepper.\n- 70%+ of students will explain that seeds grow into new plants or are \"babies\" that need soil and water.\n- 75%+ of students will describe at least one realistic dispersal method.\n- Students will show growth from initial predictions to scientific understanding by end of lesson.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Pre-cut peppers:** Have 2-3 peppers already cut in half before the lesson. Some students may struggle with knife work or need a visual anchor before doing their own investigation.\n\n2. **Vocabulary cards with pictures:** Create a reference sheet with pictures of seed, fruit, animal, plant. Students can point instead of speaking or writing. Pair with a stronger reader/buddy during Explain.\n\n3. **Simplified exit ticket:** Ask just one question orally with a visual aid: *\"Point to the seed. Point to the fruit.\"* No written response required.\n\n4. **Small group re-teach:** During Elaborate, work with a small group using only real pepper seeds and one animal (e.g., just discuss birds). Let them physically place seeds to show dispersal while you narrate: *\"Here comes a bird. It eats the pepper. The seed comes out. Now it's on the ground. A new plant grows!\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Research extension:** Provide 2-3 non-fiction picture books about seeds or ask: *\"Can you find three different types of seeds in our classroom or outside? How are they different? Which animal might eat each one?\"* Students can create a chart comparing seeds.\n\n2. **Prediction and observation cycle:** Plant one pepper seed in soil with water and light during the lesson. Students predict what will happen weekly and draw observations over 2-3 weeks. Discuss conditions that help seeds germinate.\n\n3. **Design challenge:** *\"If you were a seed inside a pepper, what would be the BEST way for you to travel far away—by wind, water, or animal? Why? Design your own special seed that floats on water or catches wind.\"* (They can draw or build with craft materials.)\n\n4. **Vocabulary deepening:** Introduce \"germination\" and have advanced learners use it in sentences or create an illustrated \"life cycle\" poster: Seed → Germinate → Seedling → Plant → Flower → Fruit → Seeds.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Pepper Plant Growth Journal (1-2 weeks follow-up)**\n   - Plant 3-5 pepper seeds from the lesson in small pots with soil and water.\n   - Place on a sunny windowsill.\n   - Students draw and predict: *\"When will the seed crack open? When will I see a green sprout?\"*\n   - Weekly observations: Measure the sprout height, draw growth, discuss what the plant needs (water, light, warm temperature).\n   - Connect to 2-LS2-1: Students test if plants need water and sunlight by keeping one plant in a dark cupboard and one in sunlight (teacher monitors).\n\n2. **Seed Scavenger Hunt & Collection (outdoor or hallway activity)**\n   - Take students outside or to a garden area to find real seeds: acorns, pinecones, seed pods, etc.\n   - Collect samples safely (remind: don't eat).\n   - Back in class, create a \"Seed Museum\" display with labels: *\"This seed is from a maple tree. This seed is from a sunflower.\"*\n   - Compare to pepper seeds: *\"Which seeds are biggest? Smallest? Which have wings for flying?\"*\n   - Connects to 2-LS4-1: comparing diversity of plant structures in different habitats.\n\n3. **Picture Sort & Habitat Match (paper activity or digital)**\n   - Provide pictures of animals (bird, squirrel, ant, person, fish, wind, water).\n   - Give students pictures of seeds or fruits.\n   - Challenge: *\"Match the animal to the seed it would eat. Match the seed to how it travels.\"*\n   - Create a class chart: \"Birds eat berries → Seeds disperse through poop\" etc.\n   - Reinforces 2-LS2-2: modeling animal functions in seed dispersal.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Pepper prep:** Buy peppers a day or two before the lesson so they're firm and easier for second graders to handle. Avoid very soft peppers.\n- **Seed viability:** If you plan to plant seeds after, use fresh, unwashed peppers if possible (store-bought is fine). Seeds may not all germinate, but about 50% typically do.\n- **Cutting safety:** Practice the hand-over-hand technique with one student as a model before independent work. Some teachers prefer to pre-cut half the peppers and let students cut the other half.\n- **Allergies:** Check for any pepper or seed allergies; some students may have latex sensitivity from fresh produce touching their skin. Provide gloves or assign observation roles if needed.\n- **Diverse examples:** If your class has families from different cultures, invite students to share other fruits with seeds they eat (mango, papaya, tomato, watermelon). This celebrates diversity and broadens understanding of \"fruits.\"\n\n---\n\n**Total Lesson Time: 60-90 minutes across two sessions, with optional extension over 2-3 weeks for germination observation.**\n\nThis lesson directly answers the question from the photograph: *\"What are those bumpy things inside the pepper, and why are they there?\"* while meeting NGSS standards for seed dispersal and plant diversity.",
