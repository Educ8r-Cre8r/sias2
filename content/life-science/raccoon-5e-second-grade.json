Exploring Animal Habitats**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90–110 minutes (best delivered across two 45-55 minute sessions: Session 1 = Engage + Explore; Session 2 = Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-LS4-1: Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Identify and describe the basic needs of animals (food, water, shelter, and space).\n2. Explain why certain animals live in specific habitats by observing habitat features.\n3. Compare and contrast two different animal habitats using observations.\n4. Describe how a raccoon's body features help it survive in its habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about where animals live and why raccoons choose watery, wooded places.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the raccoon (large enough for whole class to see clearly)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small stuffed raccoon toy to hold up\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Hook:** Project or display the photograph large on the board or screen. Hold it up silently for 10 seconds and let students look without talking.\n\n2. **Think-Pair-Share:** Say: \"Turn to a partner and whisper: What do you notice about where this raccoon is? What's around it?\"\n   - Circulate and listen to student ideas (they may mention water, plants, logs, green things, dark places).\n\n3. **Discuss with Guided Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture besides the raccoon?\" (water, plants, a log, trees)\n   - \"Why do you think the raccoon is here? What might it be looking for?\" (food, water, a place to hide)\n   - \"Do you think raccoons like dry places or wet places? How can you tell from this picture?\"\n   - \"What does this raccoon need to survive? Where can it find those things here?\" (guide them to notice water for drinking, plants/logs for food, logs for shelter)\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder why raccoons don't live in deserts or on snowy mountains. What do you think they need that they can find here?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore animal habitats—the special homes where animals like raccoons live. Let's discover what makes a good home for different animals.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate habitat features by creating a model environment and observing what a raccoon would need.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large plastic storage containers or shallow bins (1 per pair or small group, 4–5 total)\n- Soil or sand\n- Water (spray bottle or small container)\n- Twigs, bark, fallen leaves\n- Rocks\n- Plant cuttings (or artificial plants from dollar store—non-toxic)\n- Small toy raccoon or figure (1 per bin)\n- Observation sheets (printed with simple pictures and lines to write/draw)\n- Pencils and crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Introduce the Challenge (2 minutes)**\nSay: \"We're going to build a habitat that a raccoon would love to live in. Think about what you saw in the picture. What do you need to add to make a good home for a raccoon?\"\n\n**Step 2: Build (10–12 minutes)**\n- Assign pairs or small groups to a bin.\n- Give each group the materials listed above.\n- **Student Directions (read aloud, then post on chart):**\n  1. Put soil and water in your bin to make a wetland (like in the picture).\n  2. Add rocks, twigs, and leaves to create hiding places and shelter.\n  3. Add plants to make it look like a real habitat.\n  4. Place your toy raccoon in the habitat.\n  5. Ask yourselves: \"Does the raccoon have water? Does it have food nearby? Does it have a place to hide?\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:** Circulate and prompt with questions:\n  - \"What part of your habitat is the water? Why did you put water there?\"\n  - \"Where might the raccoon find food in a real habitat like this?\"\n  - \"What could these twigs and rocks be for?\"\n  - Avoid giving answers; instead, guide them to observe and think.\n\n**Step 3: Document (3–5 minutes)**\nStudents draw or write on observation sheets:\n- Draw your raccoon habitat.\n- Write or circle: \"My raccoon has water / food / shelter / a hiding place\" (circle yes or no).\n- Write one thing your raccoon needs that you added.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create wetland habitats with water, vegetation, and shelter.\n- Students begin to recognize that specific features (water, plants, logs) meet animal needs.\n- Simple written/visual documentation shows their thinking about habitat requirements.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal understanding of habitats and adaptations using the photograph and student-created habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph (for reference)\n- Word cards with pictures (habitat, shelter, adapt, survival)\n- Student habitats from Explore phase (visible for discussion)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Group Share-Out (5 minutes)**\n- Ask 2–3 groups to quickly show their habitat and explain one thing the raccoon needs that they included.\n- Ask the class: \"What did everyone add to their habitats?\" (water, plants, logs, etc.)\n- Create a list on chart paper: \"Things Raccoons Need\" (water, food, shelter/hiding place, space to explore).\n\n**Step 2: Introduce Vocabulary (8–10 minutes)**\nCreate a visual anchor chart as you introduce each term. Draw simple pictures next to each word.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|--------------------------|\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives that has everything it needs to survive (water, food, shelter). |\n| **Shelter** | A safe, protected place where an animal can rest, hide, and stay safe from danger. |\n| **Adapt (or Adaptation)** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. |\n| **Wetland** | A habitat that is wet and muddy with lots of water, plants, and animals. |\n| **Survival** | Staying alive and healthy by getting what you need. |\n\n- **Connection Back to Photo:** Point to the photograph and say:\n  - \"This is a **wetland habitat**. See the water? The plants? The **shelter** under the log?\"\n  - \"Raccoons have special **adaptations**—see those little hands? Those help it catch food in the water. Its dark mask helps it see in the dark. These features help it **survive** in wetland habitats.\"\n\n**Step 3: Check for Understanding (2–3 minutes)**\nAsk quick, targeted questions:\n- \"Show me with your hands: What's a habitat?\" (students mime a house/shelter).\n- \"Where do you live? What's your habitat?\" (home, neighborhood).\n- \"Why do you think a raccoon couldn't live in a desert?\" (no water, no wet plants for food).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that habitats are homes with specific features animals need.\n- Students can name at least 2–3 things raccoons need in their habitat.\n- Students recognize that raccoons have special features that match their wetland home.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by comparing raccoon habitats to other animal habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of raccoon (reference)\n- Picture cards or printed photos of 3 other habitats/animals (e.g., desert with lizard, forest with squirrel, ocean/beach with seagull) — use Google Images, lesson resources, or magazine cutouts\n- Venn diagram or comparison chart (printed or drawn on paper)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Introduce Comparison (2 minutes)**\nSay: \"We learned about raccoon habitats. But did you know different animals live in different habitats? A lizard doesn't live in a wetland like a raccoon. Let's compare!\"\n\n**Step 2: Show Other Habitats (3 minutes)**\nDisplay pictures of 2–3 other animals/habitats one at a time:\n- **Desert (lizard):** dry, sandy, hot, very little water\n- **Forest (squirrel):** trees, acorns, cooler, lots of shelter\n- **Beach/Ocean (seagull):** water, sand, fish, windy\n\nAsk quick questions for each:\n- \"Does this look like the raccoon's wetland home?\"\n- \"What does this animal need that might be different?\"\n\n**Step 3: Guided Comparison (8–10 minutes)**\nWorking as a class or in small groups, complete a **Habitat Comparison Chart** on chart paper. Use simple pictures and words:\n\n| Feature | Raccoon Wetland | Desert | Forest |\n|---------|-----------------|--------|--------|\n| **Wet or Dry?** | Wet | Dry | Medium |\n| **What animals drink** | Water everywhere | Little water | Water in streams |\n| **Food** | Fish, insects, plants | Seeds, insects | Acorns, berries |\n| **Shelter** | Logs, mud banks | Burrows | Tree holes |\n\n- **Teacher Role:** Ask guiding questions as you fill it in:\n  - \"How is a desert different from a wetland?\"\n  - \"Why would a raccoon be sad in a desert?\" (no water!)\n  - \"What does a squirrel find in the forest that a raccoon wouldn't?\"\n\n**Step 4: Student Application (5 minutes)**\nGive each student a **\"Build a Habitat\" task card:**\n- Draw or write: \"If I were a _____ (desert lizard / forest squirrel), I would need _____ and _____ to survive in my habitat.\"\n- Students complete the card based on what they learned.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different habitats have different features.\n- Students understand that animals are adapted to their specific habitats.\n- Students explain why a raccoon lives in a wetland and not in a desert or forest (or vice versa).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitats, animal needs, and basic adaptation concepts.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Did students include water, shelter, and food sources in their habitats?\n- Discussion during Explain: Could students name 2+ things raccoons need?\n- Responses during Elaborate: Can students explain why different animals live in different habitats?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5–8 minutes, end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple **Habitat Understanding Exit Ticket** (can be oral or written depending on student level):\n\n**Exit Ticket Prompts (choose 2–3 based on class needs):**\n\n1. **Draw and Label:** \"Draw a raccoon habitat. Label the water, shelter, and food.\"\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student includes at least water and shelter; labels are clear.\n\n2. **Fill-in-the-Blank:** \"A raccoon lives in a _____ habitat because it needs _____.\"\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student writes or says \"wetland\" and names at least one need (water, food, shelter).\n\n3. **Compare:** \"Why can't a raccoon live in a desert? Explain why.\"\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student explains that raccoons need water/wet areas and deserts are dry.\n\n4. **Observation Question:** \"Look at the photograph again. Point to something the raccoon uses for shelter. Why do you think it's important?\"\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student identifies log or vegetation and connects it to protection/safety.\n\n**Scoring Guide:**\n- **Mastery (3 pts):** Student clearly explains or shows understanding of habitat features and why raccoons need them.\n- **Proficient (2 pts):** Student identifies habitat features and at least one raccoon need.\n- **Developing (1 pt):** Student identifies habitat or one need but lacks clear connection.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify at least 2 things raccoons need in their habitat.\n- 75% of students will explain why raccoons live in wet habitats (not deserts or mountains).\n- 70% of students will recognize that different animals live in different habitats due to their specific needs.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Habitat Model:** Provide pre-made habitat bins with most materials already in place. Student's role is to identify what's there and explain why.\n\n2. **Picture-Based Responses:** Offer exit tickets with picture choices instead of writing:\n   - \"Does a raccoon need water?\" (Show picture of water + check mark / no water + X mark)\n   - Student circles or points to correct answer.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Visual Anchor Chart:** Keep word cards with pictures posted permanently during the lesson. Point to chart when asking questions; students can reference it.\n\n4. **Peer Support:** Pair struggling students with proficient students during Explore and Elaborate phases. Provide sentence stems:\n   - \"This habitat has _____ because the raccoon needs _____.\"\n   - \"A _____ lives in a _____ habitat.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-Habitat Comparison:** Have advanced students research and compare 3+ habitats (wetland, forest, desert, prairie, mountain). Create a detailed comparison chart with drawings and labels.\n\n2. **Adaptation Deep Dive:** Ask: \"How are raccoon's hands, eyes, and nose adapted to help it survive in a wetland?\" Have students draw and label a raccoon, noting each adaptation and its purpose.\n\n3. **Habitat Design Challenge:** \"Design a new habitat that would be perfect for a raccoon AND a desert lizard. Is that possible? Why or why not? Explain your thinking in writing or a poster.\"\n\n4. **Research Project:** Advanced students choose an animal and research its habitat. Create a labeled poster or book page titled \"[Animal] Lives in a [Habitat] Because...\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom Habitat Observation Walk:** If your school has outdoor grounds, take students on a 15-minute nature walk to observe local habitats (garden, shaded area, wet spot, etc.). Have students predict what animals might live there and why. Document findings with sketches or photos.\n\n2. **Habitat Role-Play / Dramatization:** Students take on roles as different animals (raccoon, squirrel, lizard, bird) and act out their day in their habitat. Encourage them to show what they eat, where they sleep, and how they hide from danger. Discuss how behaviors match habitats.\n\n3. **Create a Habitat Field Guide:** Students work in small groups to create a simple illustrated \"field guide\" for one animal's habitat. Include:\n   - Name of animal\n   - Picture of habitat\n   - List of 3–5 things the animal needs\n   - Why that animal lives there (not somewhere else)\n   - Illustrations of adaptations\n   \n   Bind pages together and place in class library. Students can read each other's guides.\n\n4. **\"If You Were a Raccoon\" Creative Writing:** Students complete the prompt: \"If I were a raccoon, I would _____. I would live in a wetland because _____. I need _____ to stay alive.\" Share responses aloud and celebrate varied ideas.\n\n5. **Habitat Video or Photo Documentary:** Show a 5–10 minute nature video clip of raccoons in wetland habitats (search \"raccoon wetland habitat\" on YouTube; preview for safety/age-appropriateness). Pause and discuss observations: \"What is the raccoon doing? What does it find to eat? Where does it hide?\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing:** If you need to condense, Engage + Explore can fit in one 45-minute session; Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate in another. Alternatively, run this across three shorter sessions.\n- **Materials Sourcing:** Dollar stores carry artificial plants cheaply. Collect twigs and leaves from outside. Water can be a spray bottle for safety (avoids spilling). Toy animals from dollar stores or ask families to loan small figures.\n- **Motivation:** Second graders are curious about animals. Use their natural interest! Let them touch and explore materials.\n- **Safety:** Supervise water use; check that all plants/materials are non-toxic.\n- **Inclusive Language:** Refer to the raccoon with \"it\" or \"the raccoon,\" not \"he/she,\" unless discussing gender in a separate context.\n- **Photograph Use:** Return to the photograph frequently. It's your concrete reference point. Point to it when explaining vocabulary or comparing habitats.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson honors the 5E model fully: students engage with genuine curiosity, explore through hands-on habitat building, explain their thinking with teacher support and vocabulary, elaborate by comparing multiple habitats, and demonstrate understanding through varied assessment.
