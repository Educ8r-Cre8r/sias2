ENGAGE (15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about plant growth and introduce the idea of reusing materials to help plants survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the bottle garden (printed or displayed on screen)\n- Real recycled plastic bottle with young plant (if available; otherwise use the photo)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it. Allow students to look silently for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture?\" (Encourage responses: a bottle, a plant, water, dirt, leaves)\n   - \"Where is this plant growing? Is it in soil in the ground?\" (Guide them to notice it's in a bottle)\n   - \"Why do you think someone put a plant in a bottle? What does the plant need to grow?\" (Elicit: water, sunlight, support)\n   - \"Have you ever grown a plant? What did you do to help it stay alive?\" (Connect to prior knowledge)\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"If we put a plant in a recycled bottle with water, what do you think will happen to it over the next two weeks? Will it grow? Will the leaves stay green? Will we see roots?\"\n\n4. **Record predictions** on chart paper in words and simple drawings.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become plant scientists and create our own bottle gardens, just like this one. We'll use things we can recycle and give a plant what it needs to survive and grow.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (25-30 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students design and build their own bottle gardens, discovering how plants can grow in water and recycled materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic 2-liter bottles (1 per student or pair; already cut horizontally by teacher beforehand, with edges made safe)\n- Small pothos or coleus plants (or bean seedlings with roots visible), 1 per bottle\n- Water (room temperature, in pitchers for easy pouring)\n- Stones, gravel, or marbles (for bottom of bottle)\n- Optional: soil, sand, moss\n- Observation journals or paper for drawings\n- Pencils and crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **Examine your plant before it goes in the bottle.** Look at the roots, stem, and leaves. Draw or point to each part on a diagram provided by the teacher.\n\n2. **Build your bottle garden:**\n   - Place stones or gravel at the bottom of your bottle to support the plant's roots.\n   - Carefully place your plant into the bottle so the roots touch the bottom or rest on the gravel.\n   - Gently pour water into the bottle until it reaches about 1-2 inches from the bottom. The roots should be able to reach the water.\n\n3. **Observe your bottle garden.** What do you see? Draw the plant in your journal, labeling the parts: roots, stem, and leaves. Write or tell what color the leaves are.\n\n4. **Place your bottle in a spot with sunlight** (teacher designates a sunny windowsill or shelf).\n\n5. **Make a prediction in your journal:** \"What will my plant look like in one week? In two weeks?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"Tell me about the roots. What do you think they do?\" \"Why do we need water?\" \"Where should we put this so the plant gets light?\"\n- Model observing the plant carefully without giving answers about growth.\n- Help students safely handle materials but allow them to direct the assembly.\n- Scaffold struggling learners by providing a diagram of plant parts to label during observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully create a functioning bottle garden with water and a plant.\n- Students document their starting observation with a drawing and labels.\n- Students express predictions about future growth.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect observations to plant survival and growth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with a labeled plant diagram\n- Photographs or real examples of plant roots, stems, and leaves\n- Student observation journals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask volunteers to describe what they observed in their bottle gardens. What did they see? What parts of the plant did they notice?\n\n2. **Introduce and define key vocabulary:**\n\n   - **Roots:** The parts of a plant that grow down into the water or soil. Roots drink water and nutrients to help the plant grow. Roots also hold the plant in place.\n   - **Stem:** The green part of the plant that holds up the leaves. The stem carries water from the roots up to the leaves.\n   - **Leaves:** The flat, green parts of the plant. Leaves use sunlight to make food for the plant.\n   - **Growth:** When something gets bigger and stronger over time.\n   - **Recycle:** To reuse something old to make something new.\n\n3. **Make connections:**\n   - Point to the photograph. \"The bottle in this picture is recycled. That means someone used it before, but now we're using it again to help a plant grow. We're solving a problem—the plant needed water, and the bottle holds water. Clever, right?\"\n   - \"Just like in the photo, your plant has roots that will drink the water in the bottle. The roots will stay healthy because they have water. The stem will carry that water to the leaves. The leaves will use sunlight to keep your plant alive.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Show me with your finger where the roots are on your bottle garden. What job do the roots do?\"\n   - \"Can you point to the stem? Why do we need the stem?\"\n   - \"Which part of the plant needs sunlight? Why?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Roots:** Parts of the plant that grow downward, absorb water, and keep the plant steady.\n- **Stem:** The main green part that holds up the leaves and moves water from roots to leaves.\n- **Leaves:** Green parts that catch sunlight and help the plant make food.\n- **Growth:** Getting bigger and changing over time.\n- **Recycle:** Using something old in a new way.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name the three main external parts of a plant.\n- Students understand that plants need water and sunlight to survive and grow.\n- Students recognize that recycled materials can help solve real problems (providing a home for a plant).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by making observations over time and comparing their plant to the one in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student bottle gardens (from Explore phase)\n- Observation journals or data sheets with drawings of the plant over time\n- Rulers (optional, for measuring stem or leaf length)\n- Camera or phone (teacher use, to document growth)\n- Comparison images or printed photo of the original bottle garden\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Establish an observation routine:**\n   - Students will observe and draw their bottle gardens every 2-3 days over a 2-3 week period.\n   - On each observation date, students sketch their plant and note any changes: Are the leaves the same color? Is the stem taller? Do you see new leaves? Is the water level the same?\n\n2. **Create a class growth chart:**\n   - Make a large class poster divided into sections: \"Week 1,\" \"Week 2,\" \"Week 3.\"\n   - Each student draws or contributes one observation per week to show how plants change.\n   - This mirrors the bottle garden in the photo—students witness the transformation over time, just as the plant in the photo must have grown from a tiny cutting to what we see.\n\n3. **Compare and contrast:**\n   - Show the original photograph again. \"This plant started as a small cutting with just a few leaves, like yours did. Now look at it—the stem is strong, the roots are in the water, and the leaves are green and healthy. Your plant will change too!\"\n   - Ask: \"Is your plant the same as the one in the photo? How? Is it different? What might be different in a few more weeks?\"\n\n4. **Real-world connection:**\n   - Explain: \"People all over the world recycle bottles and grow plants in them to save water, save money, and help the Earth. You're doing real science just like plant scientists and gardeners do!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate observation sessions; ask guiding questions: \"What changed since last time?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Take photos weekly to create a visual timeline for the classroom.\n- Support students in tracking changes accurately in their journals.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and document growth over time with increasing accuracy.\n- Students compare their plant's growth to the plant in the photo.\n- Students understand that young plants change and grow when given what they need (water, sunlight, and proper support).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant needs, plant parts, and growth over time.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing):**\n- Observe students during the Explore phase: Can they identify plant parts? Do they handle materials safely? Are they making predictions?\n- During observations: Do students notice changes? Can they describe them using the vocabulary (roots, stem, leaves)?\n- Ask questions during all phases: \"What does the stem do?\" \"Why do we give plants water?\" \"How has your plant changed?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple assessment sheet. Students can respond with drawings, words, or a combination (dictate to an adult if needed):\n\n1. **Draw your plant and label the parts:** roots, stem, and leaves.\n2. **Why do you think your plant is growing in water?** (Acceptable answers: roots need water; plants need water to survive; water helps the plant grow)\n3. **How did your plant change from the first day to today?** (Look for evidence of observation: stem got taller, more leaves, roots are longer, etc.)\n4. **What could we do to help your plant grow even more?** (Acceptable answers: more sunlight, warmer water, bigger bottle, etc.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies all three plant parts on their drawing.\n- ✓ Student explains that water is important for plant survival or growth.\n- ✓ Student provides at least one specific observation of change (using evidence from their journal or memory).\n- ✓ Student suggests a reasonable way to support further plant growth.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- First graders can identify external plant parts and their functions.\n- Students understand that plants change and grow over time when their needs (water, sunlight) are met.\n- Students recognize that recycled materials can be repurposed to help plants survive.\n- Students have documented evidence (drawings, observations) of plant growth aligned to 1-LS1-1, 1-LS1-2, and 1-LS3-1.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support:**\n- **Simplified observation sheet:** Provide a template with picture prompts (e.g., \"Circle what grew: roots / stem / leaves?\") for students who struggle with independent recording.\n- **Buddy observation:** Pair a student who finds writing/drawing challenging with a peer or adult who can help them draw and label plant parts together.\n- **Real object handling:** Provide an extra example bottle garden or a loose plant with visible roots so struggling learners can repeatedly touch and observe the parts before and during the lesson to build confidence with vocabulary.\n\n**Challenge:**\n- **Measurement and graphing:** Provide rulers so advanced students can measure the height of the stem each week and create a simple bar graph showing growth over time.\n- **Research extension:** Have students investigate and report on other ways people recycle bottles or grow plants in water (aquaponics, hydroponics). Provide age-appropriate picture books or websites (teacher-screened) for research.\n- **Prediction refinement:** Ask advanced students to write or dictate more detailed predictions: \"My plant will grow because ____. I think the stem will grow ___ because ____.\" This pushes deeper causal thinking.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bottle Garden Science Fair Display:** Have students create a decorated display board showing before, during, and after photos of their bottle garden growth. Students can present their findings to another class or during a family science night, explaining what their plant needed and how it changed.\n\n2. **Plant Parent Interview:** Students interview a family member or community member who gardens. They ask: \"What does your plant need? How do you know when your plant is healthy?\" Students draw or write the answers and share with the class, making real-world connections to their own bottle gardens.\n\n3. **Recycled Garden Classroom Installation:** Collect all student bottle gardens and create a classroom \"bottle garden wall\" or shelf display near a window. Maintain the plants as a class, assigning weekly \"plant care teams\" to water, observe, and report on growth. This extends responsibility and observation skills over many weeks and connects to environmental stewardship.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
