ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph while establishing wonder about plant growth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph (or display on smartboard/tablet)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Small potted plant or real seedling (optional, for comparison)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Display and Introduction (2-3 minutes):**\nShow students the photograph large enough for all to see. Say: *\"Look carefully at this picture. Someone brought something special into their classroom. What do you see?\"* Allow 15-20 seconds of silent looking before discussion.\n\n**Guided Discussion (7-10 minutes) – Ask these specific questions in order:**\n\n1. **\"What is the green thing growing in the bottle? How do you know it's alive?\"**\n   - *Listen for:* \"It's a plant,\" \"It has leaves,\" \"It's green\"\n   - *Teacher prompt:* \"Yes! This is a young plant, a baby plant. What parts can we see?\"\n\n2. **\"What do you notice about this young plant compared to the big plants outside the window? What's different?\"**\n   - *Listen for:* \"It's smaller,\" \"It's shorter,\" \"It has fewer leaves\"\n   - *Teacher prompt:* \"Great noticing! The baby plant is much smaller than the grown-up plants.\"\n\n3. **\"Why do you think someone put a plant in a bottle? What does the bottle do?\"**\n   - *Listen for:* \"It holds the plant,\" \"It keeps water in,\" \"It protects it\"\n   - *Teacher prompt:* \"The bottle holds water and soil—things the plant needs!\"\n\n4. **\"What do you think the plant needs to grow big and strong like the ones outside?\"**\n   - *Listen for:* \"Water,\" \"Sunlight,\" \"Food,\" \"Dirt/soil\"\n   - *Teacher prompt:* \"You're thinking like scientists! Plants do need water, light, and soil.\"\n\n**Wonder Prompt (2 minutes):**\nSay: *\"Today, we're going to become plant scientists! We're going to create our own bottle gardens and watch our baby plants grow. I wonder... what will happen to our plants if we water them and give them light? Let's find out!\"*\n\nRecord student wonderings on chart paper. Save this for Elaborate phase.\n\n**Transition:** \n*\"In a moment, each of you will make your own bottle garden, just like the one in this picture. Let's go to the exploration station!\"*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant growth by constructing their own bottle gardens and observing what plants need to survive.\n\n**Materials (per student or small group of 2-3):**\n- 1 clear plastic bottle (cleaned 2-liter bottles work well; labels removed)\n- Potting soil or garden soil (damp, about 2 cups per bottle)\n- 1 small seedling or seed (bean seeds, radish seeds, or pre-germinated seedlings work best for quick results)\n- Water in a small cup or spray bottle\n- Gravel or small pebbles (optional, for drainage layer)\n- Ruler\n- Observation sheet (with space for drawings and date)\n- Pencil or crayon\n\n**Setup (Teacher prepares before lesson):**\n- Pre-cut bottles horizontally about 2 inches from the base (make clean cuts; or use bottles with clear bases already visible)\n- OR provide whole bottles; students can observe roots growing along the outside as the plant grows\n- Have soil damp but not soaked\n- Have small seedlings or pre-soaked seeds ready\n\n**Step-by-Step Activity Directions for Students:**\n\n**Step 1: Prepare Your Bottle (3 minutes)**\n- Show students the bottle. Say: *\"Your bottle will be your plant's home. We can see through it, so we can watch what happens!\"*\n- If using pre-cut bottles, help students carefully place a small layer of gravel at the base.\n- Pour damp soil into the bottle until it's about ¾ full. Students should do this themselves with teacher guidance.\n\n**Step 2: Plant Your Seed or Seedling (4 minutes)**\n- Demonstrate first on a larger \"class bottle\" where all can see.\n- Say: *\"Make a small hole in the soil with your finger—not too deep!\"*\n- Place the seed or seedling into the hole.\n- Gently cover with soil.\n- Press lightly (do not pack hard).\n\n**Step 3: Water Your Plant (2 minutes)**\n- Add a small amount of water so soil is moist (not waterlogged).\n- Say: *\"Plants drink water, just like you do. But they don't need a lot at once!\"*\n\n**Step 4: Observe and Record (6 minutes)**\n- Have students draw what their plant looks like RIGHT NOW on their observation sheet.\n- Label the parts they can see: *leaves, stem, soil*.\n- Write or tell the teacher one thing they notice: *\"My plant is green,\" \"I can see the soil,\" \"The stem is thin.\"*\n- Teacher writes student observations on their sheet or takes photos.\n- Record the date on the observation sheet.\n\n**How This Connects to the Photograph:**\n- Say: *\"The plant in the bottle in the picture looks like yours right now. That baby plant grew from a tiny seed, and someone watered it and gave it light, just like you're doing!\"*\n\n**What Students Should Record/Document:**\n- Initial drawing of their bottle garden (labeled with plant parts)\n- Date started\n- One observation about their plant in words or pictures\n- Prediction: *\"I think my plant will...\"* (teacher scribes or students draw)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among students; provide hand-over-hand support as needed for soil handling and planting.\n- Ask probing questions: *\"Where do you think water goes in the plant?\"* *\"Why do plants need light?\"* (Don't answer—just plant curiosity for Explain phase.)\n- Ensure each student touches soil, water, and their plant; this multisensory engagement deepens learning.\n- Prevent overwatering; use this as a teachable moment: *\"Plants can get too much water too. We're looking for 'just right' water!\"*\n- Take photos of each student's bottle garden for documentation and display.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each student creates a functional bottle garden with a planted seed/seedling.\n- Students make observational drawings showing the plant and soil.\n- Students generate at least one prediction or observation about what plants need.\n- Increased comfort and familiarity with handling soil and plant materials.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts based on student observations; connect to the photograph and Explore activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Printed/projected photograph (from Engage)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n- Real plant (potted or from garden) with visible roots, if possible\n- Simple diagram or poster labeling plant parts (leaf, stem, root, soil)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n- Gather students in a circle with their bottle gardens visible.\n- Ask: *\"Who wants to tell us one thing you discovered about your plant?\"*\n- Invite 3-4 students to share their observations: *\"My plant is getting water,\" \"I can see brown soil,\" \"The leaf is green.\"*\n- Affirm all observations: *\"Great science noticing!\"*\n- Display student drawings on a bulletin board or learning wall.\n\n**Teacher-Led Instruction with Vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n\nSay: *\"Today we observed that plants have special parts. Let me show you what each part does!\"*\n\n**Using the photograph and real plants, teach these vocabulary words:**\n\n1. **Leaf (or Leaves)**\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* \"The green parts of a plant that drink in sunlight and make food for the plant.\"\n   - *Show it:* Point to leaves in the photograph and on real plants.\n   - *Gesture:* Have students hold their hands open like leaves catching sunlight.\n   - *Why it matters:* \"Leaves are like the plant's food makers!\"\n\n2. **Stem**\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* \"The part of the plant that holds up the leaves and carries water from the roots to the leaves.\"\n   - *Show it:* Point to the thin green stem in the bottle photograph.\n   - *Gesture:* Have students stand tall like a stem, holding their arms up.\n   - *Why it matters:* \"The stem is like the plant's backbone!\"\n\n3. **Root**\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* \"The part of the plant that grows down into the soil and drinks up water.\"\n   - *Show it:* If possible, gently expose the roots of a real seedling; show the fine root hairs.\n   - *Say:* \"We planted our seeds. The roots are growing down into the soil right now, even though we can't see them yet! In a few days, if we look at the side of the bottle, we might see them.\"\n   - *Why it matters:* \"Roots are like the plant's drinking straw!\"\n\n4. **Soil**\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* \"The dirt and nutrients (food) that plants grow in. Roots get water and food from soil.\"\n   - *Show it:* Point to the brown soil in the bottle.\n   - *Feeling:* Let students touch damp soil (optional but powerful).\n   - *Why it matters:* \"Soil is the plant's home and food source!\"\n\n**Connections Back to Photo and Activity (2-3 minutes):**\n- Return to the original photograph.\n- Say: *\"Look at the baby plant in the bottle. Can you find the leaf? The stem? The soil?\"* (Point them out together.)\n- Say: *\"This plant is like your plant right now. It's small because it's a baby plant. But if we give it water, light, and soil, it will grow bigger and bigger—just like the big plants outside the window!\"*\n\n**Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n\nAsk these yes/no and pointing questions:\n1. *\"Do roots grow down into the soil?\"* (Thumbs up/down)\n2. *\"Show me with your finger—which part drinks up the water?\"* (Students point to roots or soil area.)\n3. *\"Why do we put soil in the bottle?\"* (Wait for responses; accept: \"The plant needs it,\" \"It's the plant's home,\" \"The plant drinks from it.\")\n\nIf students struggle, show the parts again on the photograph or a real plant.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (display on chart):**\nCreate a visual anchor chart showing:\n\n| PLANT PART | WHAT IT DOES |\n|---|---|\n| **Leaf** | Catches sunlight and makes food |\n| **Stem** | Holds up leaves and carries water |\n| **Root** | Drinks water from soil |\n| **Soil** | Gives the plant water and food |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name the four plant parts (leaf, stem, root, soil).\n- Students understand that each part has a job that helps the plant survive.\n- Students connect the vocabulary to their own bottle gardens and the photograph.\n- Students recognize that young plants have the same parts as big plants, just smaller.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by observing growth over time, comparing young and mature plants, and making predictions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student observation sheets and pencils/crayons\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Large plant (mature) and small plant (seedling) for comparison\n- Chart paper: \"How Are Baby Plants and Big Plants Alike and Different?\"\n- Camera or smartphone (optional, for documentation)\n- \"Plant Growth Prediction\" worksheet or chart\n- Real pictures of mature vs. seedling plants (optional resource)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Compare Young and Mature Plants (7-8 minutes)**\n\nGather students where they can see both a mature plant (from the photo or classroom) and their small bottle gardens.\n\nSay: *\"We're going to be comparison scientists! Let's look at the baby plants you made and the big plants we see. What's the same? What's different?\"*\n\nAsk students to tell you observations:\n- *\"The big plant is taller. The baby plant is small.\"*\n- *\"They both have green leaves.\"*\n- *\"The big plant has more leaves.\"*\n\nRecord on a two-column chart:\n\n| BABY PLANTS (LIKE YOURS) | BIG PLANTS (LIKE OUTSIDE) |\n|---|---|\n| Small | Tall |\n| Few leaves | Many leaves |\n| Thin stem | Thick stem |\n| Green | Green |\n| Needs water | Needs water |\n\nSay: *\"Great noticing! Baby plants are like their parent plants, but smaller and not fully grown yet. Babies plants WILL grow to be big plants if we take care of them!\"*\n\n**Part B: Make a Growth Prediction (5-6 minutes)**\n\nGive each student (or pair) a \"Plant Growth Prediction\" sheet. This can be simple:\n\n---\n\n**My Plant Growth Prediction**\n\n*Draw or write what your plant will look like in 2 weeks.*\n\n*My plant will be:*\n- ☐ Taller\n- ☐ Have more leaves\n- ☐ Have thicker stem\n- ☐ ________________\n\n*Here's my picture:*\n\n[SPACE FOR DRAWING]\n\n---\n\nHave students draw or tell you their prediction.\n- *\"I think my plant will grow bigger!\"*\n- *\"My plant will have more leaves!\"*\n- *\"My plant will be this tall!\"* (show with hands)\n\nTeacher records predictions on a class chart or takes photos of student prediction sheets.\n\nSay: *\"We're going to watch our plants grow and check our predictions. We'll look at them every few days. Science means we observe, predict, and check our ideas!\"*\n\n**Part C: Observation Routine Setup (2-3 minutes)**\n\nEstablish an observation schedule:\n- Explain: *\"Every two days, we'll look at our plants and draw what we see. We'll use a ruler to measure how tall they are. We're keeping records—just like real scientists!\"*\n- Show where bottle gardens will live (a sunny windowsill or under a grow light).\n- Demonstrate how to water lightly without overdoing it.\n- Assign \"Plant Care Captains\" (rotating student roles) to check plants and report to the class daily.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the comparison discussion; ask questions but let students generate ideas.\n- Model how to use a ruler to measure plant height.\n- Write or take photos of student predictions.\n- Set up a daily or twice-weekly observation routine where one student reports on plant changes.\n- Keep a class graph of plant height over the 2-4 week growing period (simple bar graph or picture graph).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students articulate similarities and differences between young and mature plants, showing they understand that young plants are smaller versions of parent plants.\n- Students make a reasonable prediction about plant growth based on observations.\n- Students engage in ongoing observation and record-keeping, building foundational scientific practice.\n- Students take ownership of plant care, reinforcing understanding of what plants need to survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant parts, functions, and growth throughout the lesson and beyond.\n\n**Assessment Activities:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n\n1. **Observation Checklists (Ongoing):**\n   During Explore and Elaborate, use this simple checklist to track student understanding:\n\n   **Student Name:** ________________\n   \n   | Indicator | Yes | Somewhat | Not Yet |\n   |---|---|---|---|\n   | Identifies and names plant parts (leaf, stem, root, soil) | | | |\n   | Explains why each part is important | | | |\n   | Observes and records plant characteristics | | | |\n   | Makes a prediction about plant growth | | | |\n   | Participates in comparison (baby vs. big plant) | | | |\n\n2. **Questioning During Explain Phase:**\n   - *\"Point to the root. What does the root do?\"*\n   - *\"Why does your plant need water?\"*\n   - *\"Is your baby plant the same as or different from the big plants?\"*\n   - *Success criterion:* Student correctly identifies 3 of 4 plant parts and explains at least 2 functions.\n\n3. **Observation Sheet Documentation:**\n   - Review student drawings from Explore and predictions from Elaborate.\n   - *Success criterion:* Drawing includes labeled plant parts and a reasonable prediction.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (End of Session 2, 5 minutes)**\n\nChoose ONE format based on your class:\n\n**Option A: Draw and Tell (for emerging writers)**\n*Show me a picture:*\n- Draw a baby plant in a bottle.\n- Label: leaf, stem, root, soil.\n- Tell me (or I'll write): What does the root do? What does the leaf do?\n\n**Success Criterion:**\n- Identifies at least 3 plant parts correctly.\n- States the function of at least 1 part (root drinks water, leaf catches light, etc.).\n\n**Option B: Question Response (for more developed learners)**\n1. *\"If you didn't give your plant water, what would happen?\"*\n   - Acceptable responses: \"It would die,\" \"It would get dry,\" \"It would need water.\"\n   - *Success criterion:* Student recognizes water is essential.\n\n2. *\"Why is a baby plant smaller than a big plant?\"*\n   - Acceptable responses: \"It's younger,\" \"It hasn't grown yet,\" \"It's still a baby.\"\n   - *Success criterion:* Student understands that young plants grow over time.\n\n3. *\"Show me with your hands: Is a root as tall as a leaf, or does a root grow down?\"*\n   - *Success criterion:* Student demonstrates or states that roots grow downward.\n\n**Option C: Picture Sorting (kinesthetic learner option)**\nShow 3-4 pictures:\n- A: Young seedling in soil\n- B: Mature flowering plant\n- C: Just a seed\n- D: Plant without water (wilted)\n\nAsk: *\"Which picture shows a baby plant? Which shows a grown-up plant? Which plant looks sick? Why?\"*\n\n*Success criterion:* Student correctly identifies baby vs. mature and explains that water is needed.\n\n---\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes (Understanding Demonstrated by):**\n\n- ✓ Student labels plant parts correctly on drawing or diagram.\n- ✓ Student explains that roots drink water, leaves catch light, stems hold up leaves, soil provides nutrients.\n- ✓ Student identifies similarities (both green, both have leaves) and differences (baby is smaller, has fewer leaves) between young and mature plants.\n- ✓ Student makes a prediction about plant growth and revisits it after 2 weeks.\n- ✓ Student demonstrates care behaviors (watering appropriately, providing light, observing regularly).\n\n**Meeting NGSS Standards:**\n\n- **1-LS1-1 (Plant Parts):** Students design bottle gardens using containers and soil, mimicking how plants use roots to absorb water and leaves to capture light for survival.\n- **1-LS3-1 (Similarities/Differences):** Students make observations comparing young plants (their seedlings) and mature plants (classroom or window plants), identifying both similarities (structure, color) and differences (size, number of leaves).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:**\n   - Use only 2-3 plant parts initially (leaf, root, soil). Introduce stem later.\n   - Use concrete gestures consistently: *\"Roots go down, down, down. Leaves go up, up, up!\"* with hand motions.\n   - Repeat key phrases throughout the lesson: *\"Plants need water. Plants need light.\"*\n\n2. **Hands-On Support:**\n   - Pair student with a peer or aide for Explore activity.\n   - Pre-fill bottles with soil halfway so students focus on planting, not measuring soil.\n   - Provide a photo card showing what \"correct\" moisture looks like (damp, not wet) to guide watering.\n\n3. **Observation Adaptations:**\n   - Instead of detailed drawings, students create simpler labeled diagrams (teacher provides outline with blank labels).\n   - Use photo matching: Show pictures of plant parts; student points to matching part in their bottle garden.\n   - Scribe observations: Student dictates to teacher; teacher writes on observation sheet.\n\n**Challenge (for Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Deepen Inquiry:**\n   - *\"What if we gave one plant more water than another? What would happen? Let's test it!\"* (Introduce variable testing.)\n   - Have students predict and measure: *\"How tall do you think your plant will be in 4 weeks?\"* (Introduce measurement and graphing of growth data.)\n   - *\"If a plant doesn't get light, what might happen?\"* (Set up a control: bottle in a dark closet vs. bottle in light. Observe differences.)\n\n2. **Research and Connection:**\n   - Provide picture books or websites about plant life cycles. Have student trace seed → seedling → mature plant → flowers → seeds again.\n   - Ask: *\"How are plants and animals the same? How are they different?\"* (Extend to 1-LS3-1 comparison thinking.)\n   - Interview a gardener or watch a short video about how farmers grow crops. Discuss: *\"Why is understanding plant parts important?\"*\n\n3. **Communication:**\n   - Students create a \"Plant Care Guide\" poster: *\"How to Help Your Baby Plant Grow!\"* with labeled diagrams and instructions.\n   - Write a simple narrative: *\"The Life of My Plant\"* tracking changes over 3-4 weeks with drawings and captions.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n**For Early Finishers or Homework:**\n\n1. **Observation Journal Over Time (Weeks 2-4)**\n   - Students sketch their bottle garden every 2-3 days and measure plant height.\n   - Create a simple line graph showing growth (height vs. days).\n   - Write one observation sentence each time: *\"My plant grew 2 inches. It has 5 leaves now.\"*\n   - **Learning goal:** Reinforce that plants grow over time and that observation/measurement are scientific practices.\n   - **Parent involvement option:** Send home observation sheet; family helps measure and sketch at home.\n\n2. **Plant Part Hunt (Indoor or Outdoor)**\n   - Students search the classroom or schoolyard for examples of leaves, stems, roots (dig carefully), and soil.\n   - Collect or photograph examples.\n   - Create a poster: *\"We Found Leaves! We Found Stems!\"* with real items or pictures.\n   - Discuss: *\"What was the same about all the leaves? What was different?\"*\n   - **Learning goal:** Generalize plant part learning to diverse plants.\n\n3. **Grow Different Seeds**\n   - After success with the first bottle garden, students plant a different seed type (bean, radish, sunflower, basil).\n   - Compare growth rates and structures: *\"Which seed grows faster? Which has bigger leaves?\"*\n   - Create a comparison chart: **Fast Grower vs. Slow Grower.**\n   - **Learning goal:** Deepen understanding that different plants have different characteristics and growth rates; introduce variation within species.\n\n4. **\"Plant Parent\" Family Project**\n   - Send home a small seedling or seeds with a care instruction sheet and observation log.\n   - Family documents the plant's growth for 4 weeks with drawings and observations.\n   - Student brings back journal and shares findings with class.\n   - Create a class graph: *\"Whose plant grew the tallest?\"*\n   - **Learning goal:** Extend learning beyond classroom; involve families; build real-world connection.\n\n5. **Read-Aloud Connection**\n   - Partner with a picture book like *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle or *Planting a Rainbow* by Lois Ehlert.\n   - Students listen for plant life cycle concepts and identify plant parts mentioned in the story.\n   - Act out the book: Students mime being seeds, sprouting, growing leaves, reaching for sun.\n   - **Learning goal:** Integrate literacy; reinforce vocabulary in context.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis lesson uses the photograph of a bottle garden to authentically engage students in observing, planting, and caring for their own young plants. By working through all five phases, First Graders develop foundational understanding of plant structures (roots, stems, leaves, soil), their functions, and how young plants compare to mature plants. The hands-on investigation, paired with careful vocabulary instruction and ongoing observation, directly addresses NGSS standards 1-LS1-1 and 1-LS3-1 while fostering scientific curiosity and plant stewardship.\n\nThe 2-session structure allows time for processing between days, and the extended observation period (2-4 weeks) naturally embeds the 5E model into classroom routines, making learning sustainable and developmentally appropriate for First Grade learners.",
