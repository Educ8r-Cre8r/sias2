  "content": "# NGSS Engineering Design Challenge\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n\n- A ground-nesting bird (appears to be a plover or similar species) with gray and white feathers, resting on bare ground\n- Scattered twigs, dried plant material, and small pebbles covering the ground surface\n- Small purple/pink flowering plants visible in the background\n- The bird's dark eye and beak clearly visible, showing it is alert\n- Minimal shelter or protective structures around the nesting area\n\n---\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n\n- **From ground nesting behavior + sparse surroundings**: This bird likely relies on camouflage and ground-level nest construction rather than tree shelters. The bird's neutral coloring suggests it blends with its rocky/dirt habitat for protection.\n- **From scattered natural materials**: Birds must gather and arrange available materials (twigs, grass, pebbles) to create nests that protect eggs from predators and harsh weather.\n- **From open terrain**: Nests in such exposed areas face challenges from wind, rain, and temperature changes—the structure must be designed to withstand environmental stresses.\n\n---\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2: Build a Cozy Ground Nest**\n\nImagine you are a bird that makes a nest on the ground using twigs, leaves, and pebbles. Your nest needs to:\n- Keep eggs safe from rolling away\n- Keep rain from getting inside\n- Be hidden enough so predators don't find it\n\nUse sticks, dried leaves, and small rocks to build a nest on a tray or table. Test it by gently rolling a ball across your work area—does your nest catch the ball? Does water stay out when you sprinkle a tiny bit of water on it?\n\n---\n\n**3-5: Design a Protected Ground Nest**\n\nGround-nesting birds must build shelters that protect eggs from predators, weather, and rolling downhill. Your challenge:\n\n**Design and build a nest structure that:**\n1. Prevents three marbles (representing eggs) from rolling away when the ground is tilted at a 20° angle\n2. Keeps the interior dry when water is sprinkled on top for 10 seconds\n3. Uses only natural materials (twigs, leaves, pebbles, moss, or bark)\n4. Fits within a 12-inch diameter circle (the ground footprint available)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- All three marbles remain inside the nest after tilting\n- The interior area stays dry (marked with paper inside)\n- Structure is built entirely from natural materials\n- Can withstand gentle disturbance (simulating wind)\n\n---\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis phase fits best because the photo shows a real-world survival challenge: a vulnerable ground-nesting bird in an exposed habitat. Students are not yet given a solution direction—they must first identify what problems a ground nest must solve (predation, weather, rolling, exposure) before designing. The task naturally starts with observing nature and asking *\"What problems does this bird face, and how can we help it?\"*\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Materials\n\n1. **Small twigs and branches** (collected from outdoors or from craft supply)\n2. **Dried leaves, straw, or raffia** (for soft interior lining)\n3. **Small pebbles or gravel** (for structure and drainage)\n4. **Marbles or clay balls** (to represent eggs for testing, K-2) or small water bottles/spray bottles (for rain simulation, 3-5)\n5. **Shallow trays or circular cardboard bases** (to contain the nest and allow tilting for testing)\n6. **Water in a spray bottle** (to test weatherproofing)\n7. **Rulers or cardboard wedges** (to tilt the nest during testing)\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Time\n\n**K-2:** 40–50 minutes  \n(15 min observation/discussion + 20–25 min building + 10–15 min testing/sharing)\n\n**3-5:** 60–90 minutes (two 30–45 minute sessions)  \n*(Session 1: 15 min observation + 20–25 min planning/sketching + 20 min initial build; Session 2: 20–30 min refinement + 15 min testing + 10 min reflection)*\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task addresses **NGSS ETS1.A** (*defining and delimiting engineering problems*) and **ETS1.B** (*developing possible solutions*) by having students identify real constraints a ground-nesting bird faces and iterate designs that balance multiple competing needs—protection, camouflage, stability, and weather resistance.",
