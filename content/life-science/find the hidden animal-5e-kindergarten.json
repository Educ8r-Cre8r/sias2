Observe and identify a hidden animal in a natural environment photograph.\n2. Describe how an animal's colors and patterns help it stay safe in its home.\n3. Explain that animals need to hide or blend in to survive.\n4. Find and identify a camouflaged animal in a classroom habitat or picture hunt.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about hidden animals and activate prior knowledge about where animals live.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (or projected on screen/interactive board)\n- Pointer stick or laser pointer (optional)\n- Magnifying glasses (if available—one per student or pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph**\n   - Project or display the rocky ground photograph on the board or hold it up. Do NOT tell students an animal is hidden in the image yet.\n   - Say: \"I have a special picture to show you. Look very carefully!\"\n\n2. **Guiding Discussion Questions** (pose one at a time, allow think-pair-share time):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about all the things you notice.\" *(Listen for: rocks, dirt, soil, stones, colors like brown and tan.)*\n   - \"Do you think any animals live here? What animals might like this rocky, dusty place?\" *(Expected answers: lizards, bugs, snakes, beetles, ants.)*\n   - \"If an animal lived here, would it be easy or hard to see? Why?\" *(Guide them to think: The rocks and dirt are brown, so a brown animal would be hard to spot!)*\n   - \"I have a secret—there IS an animal hiding in this picture right now. Can you find it?\" *(Let students search for 1–2 minutes. This builds anticipation.)*\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:**\n   - \"Why do you think this animal is so hard to see? What color is the animal? What color is where it's hiding?\" *(Let students make predictions.)*\n\n**Transition:** \n\"Great guessing! Now let's become animal detectives. We're going to explore how animals use their colors and patterns to hide. Then we'll find the hidden animal together!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate camouflage through hands-on discovery with natural materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small plastic animals (or pictures of animals): lizards, beetles, snakes, toads—one per pair or small group\n- Shoe boxes or shallow trays (one per pair)\n- Collected natural materials: pebbles, sand, soil, leaves, sticks, grass, bark pieces\n- Magnifying glasses (one per pair)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station Setup & Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Divide the class into pairs or small groups.** Assign each pair a small animal figure and a shoe box \"habitat.\"\n\n2. **Give these explicit directions:**\n   - \"Look at your animal. What color is it?\" *(Students observe.)*\n   - \"Now, use the rocks, sand, leaves, and dirt to make a home for your animal that looks like the picture we saw—a rocky place.\"\n   - \"Hide your animal in the rocks and dirt so it's hard to see. Make sure it matches the colors around it.\"\n   - \"When you're done hiding your animal, swap boxes with another pair. Can they find your hidden animal? How long does it take?\"\n\n3. **Teacher Circulates:**\n   - Ask guiding questions: \"Why did you hide your animal there? What color does it match?\"\n   - Do NOT tell students where to place animals; let them discover placement through trial.\n   - Notice which students hide animals in matching colors vs. non-matching places.\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Have students draw a picture of their habitat and color their animal to match the hiding place. Label with: \"My animal hides because ___.\"\n   - Or take photos of each hidden animal for later discussion.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that animals hidden in matching-colored environments are harder to find.\n- Students make the connection between animal color and survival.\n- Evidence of understanding shown through placement choices and drawings.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to the original photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original photograph (printed or projected)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Word cards with pictures: \"Camouflage,\" \"Habitat,\" \"Hide,\" \"Survive,\" \"Pattern\"\n- Optional: picture book excerpt about animal camouflage (e.g., *Hide and Seek* by John Schindel, or similar)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out** (5 minutes)\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover about hiding animals?\"\n   - \"Which animals were the hardest to find? Why?\"\n   - \"What color was your animal? What color was it hiding in?\"\n   - Chart student responses on paper with pictures (e.g., \"Brown animal + brown rocks = Hard to find!\").\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (using a visual anchor chart):\n   - **Camouflage (KAM-uh-flahj):** When an animal's colors or patterns look like the place where it lives, so it's hard to see.\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives—like rocks, trees, grass, or dirt.\n   - **Hide:** To stay out of sight so no one can see you.\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and safe.\n   - **Pattern:** Shapes or colors that repeat on an animal's body.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph** (5–7 minutes)\n   - Show the original rocky photograph again.\n   - \"Let's look at the photo together. There IS an animal hiding here. It uses camouflage just like the animals you hid.\"\n   - Point out (or help students find) the lizard(s) in the photograph. Use a pointer to trace the outline if needed.\n   - Ask: \"What color is the lizard? What does it look like around it? How does the camouflage help the lizard survive?\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"Can you point to the lizard? Why is it hard to see?\"\n   - Use thumbs up/sideways/down: \"Thumbs up if you think camouflage helps animals stay safe. Why?\"\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart** (displayed throughout the unit):\n| Word | Picture | Meaning |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| **Camouflage** | Drawing of brown lizard on brown rocks | When an animal's color matches its home so it's hard to see |\n| **Habitat** | Drawing of rocks, soil, leaves | The place where an animal lives |\n| **Hide** | Drawing of animal partially covered | To stay out of sight |\n| **Survive** | Drawing of animal safe and alive | To stay alive and healthy |\n| **Pattern** | Drawing of stripes or spots | Colors and shapes on an animal's body |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary (even if imperfectly) to describe camouflage.\n- Students identify the hidden animal in the photograph.\n- Students explain (in simple terms) that camouflage helps animals survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply camouflage concepts to new contexts and deepen understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture Hunt sheets (printed): 5–6 images of camouflaged animals in their habitats (e.g., moth on tree bark, frog on leaves, snow hare in snow, butterfly on flowers, caterpillar on a branch, gecko on tree)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Clipboards (if available)\n- Optional: live terrarium or outdoor habitat observation area\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Camouflage Picture Hunt** (works indoors, all-weather)\n1. Distribute picture hunt sheets with the camouflaged animals already circled/highlighted with a light marker (so students know what to look for).\n2. Say: \"These are real animals hiding in nature. Can you find them? Circle or color the animal you find.\"\n3. For each animal found, ask: \"What color is it? What is it hiding in? How does camouflage help it survive?\"\n4. Have students color-match the animal to its habitat with crayons (e.g., color a moth gray to match tree bark).\n\n**Option B: Outdoor Habitat Hunt** (if weather/location permits)\n1. Take students outside to a natural area (garden, playground, park).\n2. Give each pair a clipboard and ask: \"Can you find a hiding animal? Look under rocks, on bark, in grass.\"\n3. When an animal is spotted, observe without touching. Ask: \"What color is it? Why is it hard to see here?\"\n4. Take photos or draw quick sketches.\n\n**Option C: Camouflage Craft** (if time permits)\n1. Provide paper, markers, and stickers of animals.\n2. Ask: \"Design a new home for an animal so it can hide. What colors will you use to match your animal?\"\n3. Students glue/draw an animal onto a background they design to match it.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate picture hunt or outdoor exploration with guiding questions.\n- Redirect: \"Look at the colors. Does the animal match?\"\n- Affirm discoveries: \"You found it! You're a great camouflage detective!\"\n- Push thinking: \"Why did the artist put a brown animal on a brown background?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify multiple camouflaged animals in different habitats.\n- Students verbalize the connection between animal color, habitat, and survival.\n- Students demonstrate understanding through drawings or craft products.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of camouflage and animal survival needs.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist** (use during Explore and Elaborate phases):\n  - Does the student hide the animal in a matching-colored location?\n  - Can the student explain why camouflage helps animals?\n  - Does the student use vocabulary (camouflage, hide, habitat, survive)?\n  - Can the student find a camouflaged animal in a picture or photograph?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment** (choose one based on time and student readiness):\n\n**Option A: Picture Response** (non-reader friendly; 3–5 minutes)\n- Show the original rocky photograph again.\n- Ask: \"Point to the animal that is hiding. Tell me: What color is it? What does it match?\"\n- Listen for: Student identifies the animal AND makes a color-matching connection.\n- **Success Criteria:** Student points to the animal and says something like, \"Brown lizard. Brown rocks.\"\n\n**Option B: Verbal Interview** (1-on-1; 2–3 minutes per student)\n- Ask three questions:\n  1. \"What does an animal need to do to stay safe?\" *(Expected: Hide, blend in, hide from danger.)*\n  2. \"Show me an animal hiding in this picture. Why is it hiding there?\" *(Expected: Color match; safety.)*\n  3. \"What word do we use for when an animal's color matches where it lives?\" *(Expected: Camouflage.)*\n- **Success Criteria:** Student answers 2 out of 3 questions with evidence of understanding camouflage.\n\n**Option C: Observation Recording** (most time-efficient)\n- During Explore phase, photograph or quickly sketch student habitats and note observations:\n  - \"Placed brown animal on brown rocks—understands color matching.\"\n  - \"Placed animal in exposed location—still developing concept; may need review.\"\n- Use photos as evidence of learning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- **Proficient:** Student identifies a hidden animal in a photograph, explains it matches its habitat, and uses the word \"camouflage\" or \"hide\" to describe it.\n- **Developing:** Student identifies a hidden animal but needs prompting to explain the color match.\n- **Emerging:** Student enjoys the activity but does not yet connect color to camouflage; benefits from review and re-exploration.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce Variables in Explore Phase:**\n   - Provide only 2–3 habitat materials (e.g., just brown rocks and sand; no leaves or sticks).\n   - Use a large, clearly visible animal figure that is obviously the wrong color first (e.g., bright red animal). Ask: \"Is this animal hiding well? Why not?\" Then provide a brown version and repeat.\n   - Pair with a peer buddy or TA for hands-on guidance.\n\n2. **Use High-Contrast Picture Hunts:**\n   - Begin with obviously visible animals in the habitat (slightly mismatched colors).\n   - Progress to subtly camouflaged animals after success.\n   - Use a pointer or circle the area where the animal is hiding before asking students to find it.\n\n3. **Simplify Language:**\n   - Use only 2 key terms: \"Hide\" and \"Match\" (instead of camouflage, habitat, survive).\n   - Ask yes/no questions: \"Does this animal match the rocks? Yes or no?\"\n   - Provide sentence frames: \"The animal is ___. It hides in ___.\"\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Introduce Predator-Prey Concept:**\n   - Discuss: \"Who might be trying to catch this animal? Why does it need to hide?\"\n   - Introduce the word **predator** (animal that hunts) and **prey** (animal being hunted).\n   - Ask: \"What animals hunt lizards? How does camouflage help the lizard escape?\"\n\n2. **Design a Camouflaged Animal:**\n   - Provide blank animal body templates (fish, bird, caterpillar).\n   - Give habitat pictures (rainforest, desert, Arctic, ocean).\n   - Ask: \"Design an animal that could hide in this habitat. What colors and patterns would it need?\"\n   - Have students explain their design to a peer using vocabulary.\n\n3. **Research Extension:**\n   - Assign a specific camouflaged animal (stick insect, snow hare, leaf-tailed gecko, peppered moth, seahorse).\n   - Ask: \"Find a picture of this animal. Where does it live? How does it hide?\"\n   - Create a one-page poster with picture and 2–3 sentences about camouflage.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Sensory Hunt with Blindfolds:**\n   - Hide a small animal figure under rocks or leaves in the classroom sensory table.\n   - Students wear blindfolds and feel around to find it by touch alone (no peeking).\n   - Debrief: \"Was it easier to find by touch or by sight? Why is camouflage about hiding from eyes?\"\n   - **Connection:** Reinforces that camouflage is visual (hiding from sight).\n\n2. **Camouflage Photo Collection:**\n   - Send home a note asking families to find and photograph one camouflaged animal (in yard, park, or nature walk).\n   - Compile into a class book: \"Our Camouflage Animals.\"\n   - Read during circle time; discuss where each animal hides and why.\n   - **Connection:** Brings real-world, family-based learning into classroom.\n\n3. **Seasonal Camouflage Observation:**\n   - Over the school year, revisit the original photograph or a similar outdoor habitat in different seasons (fall leaves, winter snow, spring growth).\n   - Predict: \"Will the animal be easier or harder to see in winter? Why?\"\n   - Observe actual changes in camouflage effectiveness as the environment changes.\n   - **Connection:** Develops understanding of how habitats and survival needs change seasonally.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Pacing:** If time is limited, combine Engage + Explore in one session and Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate in a second session.\n- **Outdoor Connection:** This lesson pairs beautifully with a nature walk. Students will be primed to spot camouflaged animals.\n- **Vocabulary Scaffolding:** Use the anchor chart consistently throughout the unit so Kindergarteners internalize terms through repetition.\n- **Photo Identification:** The lizard(s) in the original photograph are most visible in the center-left and lower-left portions; be ready to help if students struggle, but allow 1–2 minutes of independent searching first.\n- **Safety Reminder:** If students observe live animals outdoors, remind them: \"Look, don't touch. Animals need space.\"\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly addresses K-LS1-1** by having students observe animals and describe patterns in their appearance (color, pattern) that match their habitats—a key pattern for animal survival. Through hands-on exploration, students develop foundational understanding that animals have needs (hiding/safety) that are met through their physical adaptations.",
