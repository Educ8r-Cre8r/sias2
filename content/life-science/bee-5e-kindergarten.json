ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the bee-and-flower photograph (8\" × 10\" or larger, or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small toy bee and plastic flower for handling\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** where all students can see it clearly. Show it without speaking for 10–15 seconds and observe student reactions.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you point to it?\"\n   - \"What is the yellow and brown thing? What is the green thing?\" (Let students identify the bee and flower without you naming them yet.)\n   - \"Why do you think the bee is visiting the flower? What might it be doing there?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a bee outside? What was it doing?\"\n\n3. **Make a Wonder Chart:** Write student observations and questions on chart paper. Accept all responses (even \"I don't know\" answers). Example responses: \"The bee has fuzzy hair!\" \"It's drinking!\" \"The flower smells good!\" \"The bee is walking on the flower.\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder... if we took away all the flowers, what would happen to the bees? Let's find out by exploring!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be bee and flower scientists! We'll explore what bees and flowers need to stay alive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real flowers (daisies, sunflowers, or any non-toxic variety with visible pollen/nectar)—1–2 flowers for demonstration; OR printed pictures of flowers\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per pair of students)\n- Sticky notes or small paper squares\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Optional: hand lens, bee specimens (dead, in sealed containers labeled \"DO NOT TOUCH\" for observation only)\n- Paper plates or trays to contain materials\n- Wet wipes for hand-washing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station 1: Flower Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into two groups.** Group 1 starts at the flower station; Group 2 starts at the bee drawing station (see below).\n\n2. **Provide each pair with a real flower (if possible) or large flower picture** placed on a paper plate.\n\n3. **Guide students with these directions:**\n   - \"Look very closely at your flower with the magnifying glass. Touch gently—don't pull it apart.\"\n   - \"Can you see the yellow dusty stuff? (Pollen) That's what bees like to collect!\"\n   - \"Can you find the part that makes sweet juice? (Nectar—usually in the center) That's bee food!\"\n   - \"Draw or color what you see on your sticky note. Label the parts you found: petals, pollen, nectar.\"\n\n4. **Teacher circulates:** Ask open-ended questions: \"What does the pollen feel like?\" \"Why do you think the bee needs to visit this flower?\" \"What colors do you see?\"\n\n**Station 2: Bee Body Exploration (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show students the bee photograph again** on a large screen or printed sheet.\n\n2. **Provide these directions:**\n   - \"Look at the bee's body parts. What do you see? Draw or color what the bee looks like.\"\n   - \"Label the parts: wings (to fly), legs (to hold on), eyes (to see), and the long straw-like part (proboscis—to drink nectar).\"\n   - \"Think: What does a bee need those body parts for? Why does a bee need them?\"\n\n3. **Teacher circulates:** Point out specific features: \"See these hairy parts? They help collect pollen. See those wings? How many wings do you count?\"\n\n**Stations rotate** after 12 minutes.\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Drawings/sketches of flower parts and bee body parts\n- Labels or teacher-scribed words\n- Pictures showing what they observed\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without giving direct answers—use questioning to guide discovery\n- Ask: \"What do you notice?\" \"Why might that be?\" \"What happens if...?\"\n- Redirect unsafe behavior (e.g., not yanking flower petals)\n- Ensure inclusive participation; pair students who need support with peer helpers\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe and draw flower parts (petals, pollen, nectar center)\n- Students will identify bee body parts and sketch them\n- Students will begin connecting bee body parts to how they help the bee get food from flowers\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with drawings of a bee and a flower (pre-drawn or created during lesson)\n- Markers in multiple colors\n- Photograph of bee-and-flower from the lesson\n- Picture cards with simple drawings: bee, flower, nectar, pollen, sun, water\n- Small plastic models or stuffed animals (optional bee and flower)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out (5 minutes):** \n   - Invite 3–4 student pairs to show their drawings and describe what they found.\n   - Use their observations to validate learning: \"Yes! You found the pollen—that's the yellow stuff bees collect!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   Create a visual anchor chart with pictures and simple words:\n\n   | **Word** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Picture** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|-----------|\n   | **Bee** | A small animal with wings, fuzzy hair, and six legs that flies from flower to flower. |  |\n   | **Flower** | A plant with colorful petals that makes sweet juice called nectar and yellow powder called pollen. |  |\n   | **Nectar** | Sweet juice inside flowers that bees drink as food. |  |\n   | **Pollen** | Yellow powder from flowers that bees collect and carry to other flowers. |  |\n   | **Needs** | Things a living thing must have to stay alive and healthy (food, water, sunlight, home). |  |\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the bee in the original photograph: \"This bee is visiting the flower to get food (nectar). See how its legs are on the flower? It's collecting pollen, too!\"\n   - Point to the flower: \"The flower has the sweet nectar the bee needs. And when the bee visits, it helps the flower spread its pollen to make new seeds!\"\n   - Emphasize: \"The bee needs the flower for food. The flower needs the bee to help make new flowers. They help each other!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - **Thumbs Up/Middle/Down:** Ask, \"Do bees visit flowers to find food?\" Have students show thumbs (up = yes, middle = not sure, down = no).\n   - **Echo Reading:** Say vocabulary words together; students repeat.\n   - **Simple Question Check:** \"What's the yellow powder on the flower called?\" (Pollen) \"What does the bee drink from the flower?\" (Nectar)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Bee:** A small animal with wings, fuzzy hair, and six legs that visits flowers.\n- **Flower:** A plant part with colorful petals that holds nectar and pollen.\n- **Nectar:** Sweet juice in flowers that bees eat.\n- **Pollen:** Yellow powder from flowers that sticks to bees.\n- **Needs:** Things plants and animals must have to live (food, water, sunlight, shelter).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize and use vocabulary words with 80% accuracy (demonstrated through repetition and responses)\n- Students explain that bees get food from flowers\n- Students understand that bees and flowers help each other\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large white paper (8.5\" × 11\" or larger) for each student\n- Crayons, colored pencils, or markers\n- Pre-cut paper shapes: bee shapes (1 per student), flower shapes (2–3 per student), small leaf cutouts\n- Glue sticks\n- Optional: real flower petals or leaves for sensory addition\n- Photo of bee-and-flower for reference\n\n**Activity: \"Bee and Flower Friends\" Collage/Drawing**\n\n1. **Prompt:** \"Make a picture showing a bee visiting a flower. Draw or glue the bee on the flower. Show what the bee is doing there. Remember: the bee is getting food!\"\n\n2. **Step-by-step directions for students:**\n   - \"Choose your flower color and glue it in the center of your paper.\"\n   - \"Glue or draw your bee on or near the flower.\"\n   - \"Draw the sun (because flowers need sunlight) and water drops or rain (because flowers need water).\"\n   - \"Draw anything else you want—more flowers, grass, clouds.\"\n   - \"Tell your teacher one thing your bee needs to stay healthy.\" (Teacher scribes on the back.)\n\n3. **Extension prompt for deeper thinking:**\n   - \"What would happen if there were no bees? What would happen to the flowers?\"\n   - \"What does your bee need to eat? Where does it find food?\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate and engage students in conversation about their creations\n   - Ask: \"Tell me about your picture. Why is the bee visiting that flower?\" \"What do bees need to live?\"\n   - Scribe student responses on their artwork for documentation\n   - Encourage all students to include a bee and flower; adjust complexity as needed (e.g., provide pre-glued flowers for students with fine motor challenges)\n\n5. **Optional: Act It Out (5 minutes)**\n   - Have volunteers mime being a bee visiting a flower: \"Show me how a bee flies. Now show me how it lands on a flower and drinks nectar!\"\n   - Discuss: \"What body parts help the bee do these things?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create artwork showing a bee visiting a flower\n- Students articulate why bees visit flowers (to find food)\n- Students explain at least one thing bees or flowers need to survive\n- Work demonstrates understanding of the bee-flower relationship\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of concepts and learning objectives.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** During Explore and Elaborate phases, note:\n  - Can student identify bee body parts? (Yes / Partially / Not Yet)\n  - Can student identify flower parts? (Yes / Partially / Not Yet)\n  - Does student understand that bees visit flowers for food? (Yes / Partially / Not Yet)\n  - Does student recognize that bee and flower help each other? (Yes / Partially / Not Yet)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5–7 minutes):**\n\nConduct a brief one-on-one or small group check using **visual and verbal prompts** (appropriate for Kindergarten):\n\n1. **Show the photograph again.** Ask:\n   - \"What animal do you see?\" (Bee)\n   - \"What plant do you see?\" (Flower)\n   - \"Why is the bee on the flower?\" (To find food / get nectar / drink)\n   - \"What does the bee need to live?\" (Food, water, home, sunlight—accept any reasonable answer)\n\n2. **Show a new flower picture (not from the lesson).** Ask:\n   - \"Do you think a bee would visit this flower? Why?\"\n\n3. **Accept responses:**\n   - Correct/complete answers (full sentences or simple phrases): Student met objective ✓\n   - Partial/emerging answers (single words, with prompting): Student is progressing toward objective\n   - No response or inaccurate: Student needs more support\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- Student can name bee and flower ✓\n- Student explains that bees visit flowers to find food ✓\n- Student identifies at least 2 things bees or flowers need to survive ✓\n- Student demonstrates the concept through drawing, acting, or verbal explanation ✓\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify why a bee visits a flower (food/nectar)\n- 75% of students will name at least one need of bees or flowers\n- All students will show evidence of understanding through their artwork and responses (even if understanding is emerging)\n- Teacher notes document which students need additional support with vocabulary or concepts\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only \"bee,\" \"flower,\" and \"food\" initially; introduce other terms later after mastery. \n   - Instead of \"nectar,\" say \"sweet juice that bees drink.\"\n   - Instead of \"pollen,\" say \"yellow powder bees carry.\"\n\n2. **Paired Exploration:** Partner students who need support with confident peers during Explore phase. Provide sentence starters: \"I see a ___.\" \"The bee needs ___.\" \"The flower has ___.\"\n\n3. **Pre-drawn templates:** For Elaborate phase, provide partially drawn bee and flower outlines that students color and label—reduces cognitive load while maintaining participation.\n\n4. **Visual supports:** Use actual photographs and real objects (real flowers, toy bee) throughout rather than abstract drawings.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper Question Exploration:** Ask: \"What other animals visit flowers? What do they need?\" \"If bees didn't visit flowers, what would happen? How would new flowers grow?\" Encourage prediction and reasoning.\n\n2. **Extension: Life Cycle Connection:** Introduce the idea that flowers make seeds (after bees help with pollen). Ask: \"How does a flower become a new flower? What does the baby flower need?\" (Preview for future lessons on growth and life cycles.)\n\n3. **Documentation Challenge:** Have students write or dictate 2–3 complete sentences about what they learned: \"Bees visit flowers because ___. Bees need ___ to stay alive. Flowers need ___ to stay alive.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n**Option 1: Bee and Flower Sorting Game (10–15 minutes)**\n- Create picture cards showing various objects: bee, flower, car, tree, rock, butterfly, etc.\n- Students sort into \"Living Things\" and \"Not Living.\" \n- Focus on how living things (bees, flowers) need food, water, and homes; non-living things do not.\n- **Connects to:** K-LS1-1 (describing what living things need to survive)\n\n**Option 2: Classroom Flower Garden Observation (ongoing)**\n- Plant fast-growing flowers (marigolds, sunflowers, zinnias) in pots or a classroom window garden.\n- Over 2–3 weeks, observe and sketch growth.\n- Document: \"What does the flower need to grow?\" (soil, water, sunlight)\n- If outdoor access available, take students to observe real bees on flowers; photograph for classroom collage.\n- **Connects to:** K-LS1-1 (observing patterns of plant and animal needs)\n\n**Option 3: \"What Do Bees Need?\" Sensory Exploration (10 minutes)**\n- Create a sensory station with safe items: flower petals (non-toxic), cotton balls (to feel the \"fuzzy\" bee texture), yellow glitter or pom-poms (pollen), water drops in a shallow dish.\n- Students explore each item and describe: \"Does this feel like a bee?\" \"Is this pollen?\" \"This is nectar—sweet water bees drink.\"\n- Discuss: \"What do all these things tell us about what bees need?\" (Bees need flowers, pollen for food, and sweet nectar.)\n- **Connects to:** K-LS1-1 (using observations to understand survival needs)\n\n---\n\n### Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Safety Reminder:** If using real flowers or insects, ensure no students have allergies. Keep any insect specimens sealed and labeled \"Observe Only—Do Not Touch.\" Wash hands after activities.\n- **Real-World Connection:** Before or after this lesson, take students outside to look for bees on flowers (if in season). Use this as a springboard discussion: \"Remember our lesson? That bee is looking for food in those flowers!\"\n- **Family Engagement:** Send home a simple take-home activity: \"Draw a picture of a bee visiting a flower. Tell one thing a bee needs to stay alive. Bring it back to share!\"\n- **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Display the vocabulary chart in the classroom for reference throughout the unit.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson builds directly from the photograph's visible elements—the bee's body parts, the flower structure, and their interaction—while maintaining age-appropriate rigor and accessibility for Kindergarten learners.",
