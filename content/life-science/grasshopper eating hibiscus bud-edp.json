  "content": "# Engineering Design Challenge: Grasshopper & Plant Protection\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n- A green grasshopper with long hind legs, antennae, and textured body positioned on a plant stem\n- A dark red/maroon flower bud (appears to be hibiscus) partially enclosed in green sepals\n- Green leaves and stems supporting both the insect and flower\n- The grasshopper's mouth oriented toward the bud, suggesting active feeding\n- Thin, curled tendrils extending from the stem structure\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n- **From the grasshopper's positioning and bud:** The insect is actively feeding on or damaging the developing flower, suggesting that plants need protection from insect herbivores to produce flowers and seeds.\n- **From the bud structure:** The layered green sepals already provide some barrier; this hints that natural structures can offer partial defense but may need reinforcement.\n- **From the plant stem's delicate appearance:** Thin-stemmed plants are vulnerable to both feeding damage and the weight of climbing insects, implying support and protection mechanisms are necessary.\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2:**\nDesign a cozy cage or cover for a flower bud that keeps grasshoppers away but still lets sunshine and rain reach the flower. What materials can you stack, wrap, or weave to make a bug-proof shield?\n\n**3-5:**\nDesign a protective barrier for a flowering plant bud that must:\n- Keep grasshoppers unable to reach the flower for at least 10 days\n- Allow at least 70% of sunlight to pass through\n- Not damage or squeeze the tender bud\n- Be built from natural or recyclable materials at minimal cost\n\nTest your design by placing it near an actual plant or simulating insect contact. Measure sunlight penetration and document any wear after 5 days.\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis photo shows a clear real-world challenge: plants are being damaged by herbivores. Students begin by asking *Why does this plant need protection?* and *What would happen without it?* before moving to solutions. The visible problem drives curiosity and makes the design task relevant.\n\n### Suggested Materials\n- Cheesecloth or netting scraps\n- Toilet paper tubes or paper towel tubes\n- Dried grass, straw, or raffia\n- Small plastic cups or clear containers (yogurt cups)\n- Twist ties, twine, or fabric strips\n\n### Estimated Time\n- **K-2:** 45–60 minutes (design + simple construction + observation)\n- **3-5:** Two 40-minute sessions (design planning + build + test + redesign iteration)\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS K.ETS1.1 / 3-5.ETS1.1** (*Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change*) by anchoring design in a visible biological need—pest damage—that students can observe, measure, and solve through prototyping.",
