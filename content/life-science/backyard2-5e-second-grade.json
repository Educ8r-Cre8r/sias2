ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph while generating curiosity about gardens as living spaces.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the backyard garden (large enough for all students to see clearly)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the screen or hold it up prominently. Ask students to look carefully for 20 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - *\"What do you see growing in this garden? Can you name some of the plants?\"* (Students point out flowers, grass, shrubs, succulents, decorative grasses.)\n   - *\"Do you think this is a good place for plants to live? Why or why not?\"* (Encourage observations: \"I see sun,\" \"There's water,\" \"There's dirt.\")\n   - *\"What animals do you think might live in or visit this garden?\"* (Bees, butterflies, birds, bugs—draw out their thinking without confirming yet.)\n   - *\"What do you think these plants need to stay healthy and keep growing?\"* (Record student ideas on chart paper—expect: water, sun, dirt/soil, air.)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** *\"I wonder... if we took away the water (or the sun), what would happen to these pretty flowers? Would they still grow? Let's find out together!\"*\n\n**Transition:** Now we're going to explore what plants really need to grow by doing our own investigation with real plants.\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant needs through a hands-on observation activity that parallels the photograph's garden.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 3 small potted bean or marigold seedlings (pre-planted 1-2 weeks before lesson; or purchase already-sprouted)\n- 3 clear plastic cups or small containers\n- Water (in watering cans)\n- Labels: \"Sunlight,\" \"Water,\" \"Control\"\n- Sunny windowsill and dark area (closet or covered corner)\n- Chart for recording observations (1 per student or pair)\n- Pencils or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. *\"We're going to set up three plants that will help us understand what the garden plants need. Each plant will have a different condition—just like different spots in a real garden have different conditions.\"*\n\n2. **Divide class into three groups** (or do as a whole class with student helpers rotating roles):\n   - **Group 1 (Sunlight plant):** Place one seedling on a sunny windowsill. Students water it with the same amount of water as the others, 2-3 times per week. This plant gets LOTS of sun.\n   - **Group 2 (Water plant):** Place one seedling in a partially shaded spot. Water it generously every day (more than normal). This plant gets EXTRA water.\n   - **Group 3 (Control plant):** Place one seedling in a normal shaded indoor location. Water it normally (2-3 times weekly with measured amounts). This plant gets normal conditions.\n\n3. **Student observation task:** Each student (or pair) receives an observation chart with spaces to draw or write about each plant **every 2-3 days for 2 weeks** (or observe daily if using pre-grown plants already showing differences). They record:\n   - How tall is the plant?\n   - What color are the leaves?\n   - How many new leaves do you see?\n   - How does the soil feel (wet, dry, medium)?\n   - Any changes from last time?\n\n4. **Connection to photograph:** *\"Just like in the garden we looked at, each of our plants gets different amounts of sunlight and water. We're going to see which plant grows best!\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group setup; ensure consistent watering schedules (use a chart on the wall to track).\n- Ask guiding questions without revealing answers: *\"What do you notice about the leaves on that plant? Are they the same color as before?\"* \n- Prompt comparisons: *\"Which plant looks the healthiest today? Why do you think that?\"*\n- Do not tell students \"this plant needs more water\"—let them discover it through observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and record changes in plant appearance, leaf color, height, and growth over time.\n- They notice that the plant with adequate sunlight and water grows most robustly; the one in darkness may weaken; the one with too much water may show wilting or mold.\n- Students generate hypotheses about what made certain plants grow better.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration, connecting observations to garden habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- The three seedlings (at various observation stages)\n- The original photograph\n- Index cards with plant pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share out from Explore phase** (5-7 minutes):\n   - Ask 2-3 student groups: *\"What did you notice about your plant? Did it grow? How could you tell?\"*\n   - Record responses on chart paper, grouping them by \"Sunlight,\" \"Water,\" and \"Healthy Growth.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (define using student-friendly language; point to examples in the photo and the actual plants):\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Habitat** | A place where plants and animals live. It has everything they need to survive, like food, water, and shelter. (Point to the garden photo: \"This backyard is a habitat for flowers and bugs.\") |\n   | **Sunlight** | Light and energy from the sun that plants need to make food and grow. (Point to the sunny areas in the photo and on the windowsill.) |\n   | **Water** | A liquid that plants drink through their roots. Without water, plants get dry and weak. (Show the pond/water feature in the photo.) |\n   | **Soil** | Dark, crumbly material in the ground that holds water and nutrients plants need. It's like food for plants. (Point to the dark earth in the garden photo.) |\n   | **Growing** | Getting bigger and stronger. We can see growing when plants get taller, grow more leaves, or change color. |\n\n3. **Make connections** (5-7 minutes):\n   - *\"Remember the beautiful garden in our photo? The plants there grow because they have what they need: sunlight from the sky, water from the sprinkler or rain, and rich soil to live in. That backyard is a great habitat!\"*\n   - *\"Our three plants taught us something important: plants need all three things—sun, water, AND soil—to grow their best. When one thing was missing or too much, the plant didn't grow as well.\"*\n   - Show the actual seedlings side by side: *\"Look—this one [pointing to the healthy one] had just the right amount of sun and water. See how it's greener and taller? This one [pointing to a struggling one] didn't have enough of something, so it's not as healthy.\"*\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Hold up index card with a picture of a plant. Ask: *\"This plant looks sad and droopy. What do you think it needs? Turn to a partner and say one thing it might need.\"*\n   - Listen for: sunlight, water, or soil. Affirm correct responses: *\"Yes! Plants need those things just like we need food and water!\"*\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (posted on board):**\n- **Habitat:** Where plants and animals live\n- **Sunlight:** Energy from the sun that plants need\n- **Water:** Liquid plants drink through roots\n- **Soil:** Food-like material plants grow in\n- **Growing:** Getting bigger and stronger\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and define the three basic plant needs using examples from the lesson.\n- They can explain why the garden in the photo is a good habitat using correct vocabulary.\n- They understand that multiple needs (not just one) help plants survive.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by designing their own ideal habitat for plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or poster board (1 per pair or group)\n- Colored pencils, crayons, or markers\n- Plant pictures (printed or drawn), soil samples, water cup (empty, for demonstration)\n- Optional: real small plants, twigs, gravel for a sensory display\n- \"Habitat Design\" planning sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario prompt:**\n*\"Imagine you're a garden designer! You get to create the PERFECT habitat for a garden. You need to show where the sunlight comes from, where the water comes from, and where the soil is. You can draw flowers, trees, grass, or any plants you want. Remember: plants need sun, water, AND soil to grow their best!\"*\n\n**Student task:**\n\n1. **In pairs or small groups,** students receive a large sheet of paper labeled *\"Our Perfect Garden Habitat.\"*\n\n2. **Students design and draw** a garden that includes:\n   - At least 3 different types of plants (they can label them: flowers, grass, shrub, cactus, etc.)\n   - A **sun** (or arrows showing where sunlight comes)\n   - A **water source** (rain, sprinkler, pond, hose—like in the photograph)\n   - **Soil** (they can draw it, glue down a soil sample, or color it brown)\n   - Optional: Animals or insects that might live there (bees, butterflies, birds)\n\n3. **Label their drawing** with at least two of the vocabulary words: habitat, sunlight, water, or soil.\n\n4. **Present their garden:** Each group shows their design and explains *\"This is a good habitat because...\"* (teacher prompts: \"What does the sun do? Where does the water come from? What do plants eat?\")\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: *\"Why did you put that flower in the sunny spot?\"* *\"What would happen if you moved the water away?\"*\n- Encourage students to reference the photograph: *\"Does your garden look like the one in our picture? What's the same? What's different?\"*\n- Record evidence of understanding (students explaining why their design works).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding of plant needs by creating a habitat that includes all three essential elements.\n- They explain their thinking using vocabulary learned in the Explain phase.\n- They make connections between their design and the real garden in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant needs and habitats using multiple strategies.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observations during Explore: Do students notice differences in plant growth? Can they describe what they observe?\n- Listen-in during discussions: Can students use vocabulary correctly? Do they connect observations to plant needs?\n- Circulate during Elaborate: Do students include all three plant needs in their habitat design?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment** (Administer at the end of the lesson; 5-10 minutes):\n\nProvide each student with an **exit ticket** (half-sheet of paper or digital form) with these prompts. Students can draw or write:\n\n1. **Draw a plant.** Label or point to one thing it needs to grow. (Accept: sun, water, or soil)\n\n2. **True or False:** *Plants need water to grow.* ☐ True ☐ False  \n   (If False, ask: *What do plants need instead?*)\n\n3. **Look at this picture** [show a simple drawing of a sad plant in a dark closet with no water]:  \n   *What's wrong with this plant's habitat? What does it need?* (Students write or draw)\n\n4. **Bonus question:** *Where is a good habitat for plants in your home or school? Why is it good?* (Students explain using vocabulary.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ **Emerging:** Student identifies ONE plant need (sunlight, water, or soil) but cannot explain its importance.\n- ✓ **Developing:** Student identifies TWO plant needs and explains why plants need them.\n- ✓ **Proficient:** Student identifies all THREE plant needs, explains why each is important, and connects to the garden habitat in the photograph or their own design.\n- ✓ **Advanced:** Student predicts what happens when a plant need is missing and explains using vocabulary (habitat, growth, etc.).\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n1. **LO 1 (Identify plant diversity):** Review Elaborate garden designs. Do students include 3+ different plant types with different features? ✓\n2. **LO 2 (Explain plant needs):** Check exit tickets. Can students name water, sunlight, and soil as needs? ✓\n3. **LO 3 (Describe garden as habitat):** Listen to Elaborate presentations. Do students explain how their design is \"a good habitat\" using correct reasoning? ✓\n4. **LO 4 (Predict consequences):** On exit ticket #3, did students explain what happens when plants lack a need? ✓\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Sentence frames for discussions:** Provide sentence starters during Engage and Explain:\n   - *\"This plant needs _______ to grow.\"*\n   - *\"A habitat has _______, _______, and _______.\"*\n   - *\"I noticed the plant in the sun is _______ than the plant in the dark.\"*\n\n2. **Simplified observation chart:** Reduce the Explore recording sheet to 2-3 simple questions with picture options or checkboxes instead of writing:\n   - Is the plant tall or short? ☐ Tall ☐ Short\n   - Are the leaves green or yellow? ☐ Green ☐ Yellow\n   - Is the soil wet or dry? ☐ Wet ☐ Dry\n\n3. **Paired/buddy system:** Assign struggling learners a peer buddy during Explore observations and Elaborate habitat design. The buddy helps describe what they see and scribe their ideas.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Predict variables:** Ask advanced students: *\"What if we had a plant with EXTRA sunlight (a grow light) AND normal water? Would it grow even bigger? Let's design an experiment to test this!\"* Guide them to set up a fourth plant variation.\n\n2. **Research animals in habitats:** Have advanced students research and present: *\"What animals live in gardens? What do they eat? How do they help plants?\"* (Connect to pollination and seed dispersal, pre-teaching for later grades.)\n\n3. **Design a complex habitat:** Challenge students to create a larger, multi-story garden design (underground roots with soil, ground level with plants, above with sun and animals) labeled with vocabulary and explanations of why each level is important.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Backyard Scavenger Hunt:** Take the class on a school ground or outdoor walk with clipboards. Students find and sketch 3-5 different plants and mark whether each one is in a sunny or shady spot. Discuss: *\"Why did the gardener plant some things in sun and others in shade?\"* (Real-world application of plant habitat needs.)\n\n2. **Classroom Plant Care Journal:** Assign small groups to be \"plant caretakers\" for one of the three experimental plants. They continue observing and recording growth weekly for 4-6 weeks (extending into next unit). Create a class graph: *Which plant grew tallest? Which had the most leaves?* Conclude: *\"What did this plant have that the others didn't?\"*\n\n3. **My Perfect Garden at Home:** Send home a drawing worksheet: *\"Design a garden you'd like to grow at home (or in a pot on a windowsill). What plants would you choose? Where would you put them? Why is that a good spot?\"* Students return it, share, and discuss the choices as a class. This bridges school and home learning while reinforcing habitat design thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Timing flexibility:** If the 2-week observation period is too long, consider using pre-sprouted seeds that already show visible differences, or take photos of the same plants over 3-4 days and show time-lapse sequences.\n- **Photograph connection:** Refer to the backyard garden photo **at least 3 times** per lesson to anchor learning in a real, relatable habitat.\n- **Vocabulary anchor chart:** Keep the habitat vocabulary chart posted throughout subsequent lessons as a reference.\n- **Safety reminder:** If using a dark closet for the \"no sunlight\" plant, ensure it's safe and checked regularly. Alternatively, use a covered box or a spot behind a cabinet.",
