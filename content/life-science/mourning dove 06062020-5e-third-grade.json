ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of the mourning dove in the garden (or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Teacher pointer or laser pointer\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen without any context. Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. A real animal is hiding here. Can you spot it?\"\n\n2. **Allow 1-2 minutes for students to search** and point out where they see the bird. This creates engagement and focuses attention on the garden habitat.\n\n3. **Ask these discovery questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice the bird is doing in this garden?\"\n   - \"What things in the garden might help this bird survive? (Think about food, water, and places to hide.)\"\n   - \"Why do you think this bird chose to spend time in this garden instead of somewhere else?\"\n   - \"What color is the bird, and why might that be helpful for hiding in a garden?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"If we put this bird in a place with no plants or soil—just a big open parking lot—do you think it could survive? Why or why not? Turn and talk to a partner about your idea.\"\n\n5. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper: \"What we wonder about animals and habitats.\" Post this where it will be visible throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great predictions! Now let's become garden detectives and find out what plants and animals really need to survive in a habitat like this garden.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small containers or ziplock bags (one per student or pair)\n- Soil samples or potting soil\n- Real plant samples (seeds, grass, leaves, twigs—can be collected beforehand or provided)\n- Small toy animals or animal picture cards (birds, beetles, worms, butterflies, lizards—variety of creatures)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Notebooks or recording sheets\n- Pencils and colored pencils\n- Image chart: \"What Do Animals Need to Survive?\" (blank, with sections for food, water, shelter, space)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Habitat Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute small containers** with soil and plant samples to each student or pair. Say: \"You have a miniature garden habitat in your container. This is similar to the garden where the mourning dove lives.\"\n\n2. **Direct student investigation:**\n   - \"Use your hand lens to look closely at the soil. What do you see? Draw or write what's there.\"\n   - \"Look at the plants. What kinds of things might eat these plants or live on them?\"\n   - \"Can you find signs of water or moisture in the soil? (It might feel damp.)\"\n   - \"Is there space for animals to hide? Where?\"\n\n3. **Ask guiding questions** as students observe:\n   - \"What living things might come to eat the plants?\"\n   - \"Where would a small animal find water?\"\n   - \"What part of this habitat would be a safe hiding place?\"\n\n**Part B: Matching Animals to Habitats (10-15 minutes)**\n\n4. **Show animal picture cards** one at a time (mourning dove, earthworm, beetle, butterfly, ant, bird, etc.). Students don't need to know all the names—focus on the animals' features.\n\n5. **For each animal, ask:**\n   - \"Could this animal live in our garden habitat? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What does this animal need from the habitat? (Point to soil, plants, water, space.)\"\n   - \"What special body parts does this animal have that help it survive here?\"\n\n6. **Students place animal cards or drawings** next to the habitat, explaining their thinking. Encourage debate: \"Why do you think a fish couldn't live in this garden?\" (Guide toward understanding: fish need water, not soil.)\n\n7. **Record on chart:** As students share, create a class list of \"What This Habitat Provides\" (food, water, shelter, soil, darkness, space, plants).\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Facilitate thinking without giving answers. Use questions like \"What makes you say that?\" and \"Where in the habitat would that work?\"\n- Listen for misconceptions (e.g., \"All birds can live anywhere\") and gently challenge with follow-up questions.\n- Guide students to notice that the bird in the photo is on the GROUND, not in trees—connecting to why this habitat works for it.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify multiple features of the habitat (soil, plants, shelter, moisture).\n- Students recognize that different animals need different things to survive.\n- Students begin to see connections between an animal's body/behavior and what it needs.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Completed \"What This Habitat Provides\" chart from Explore\n- The original photograph (projected or printed)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n- Chart paper for Key Vocabulary\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore:** Invite 2-3 pairs/students to show their miniature habitat and explain one thing they discovered. Ask the class: \"Do you agree? What else did you notice that they didn't mention?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** using student-friendly language and visuals:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. It has everything the animal needs: food, water, shelter, and space. (Point to the garden photo: \"This garden is a habitat for the mourning dove.\")\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. (Example: The dove's brown color helps it blend in with the garden soil and plants—that's a color adaptation!)\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy in a place. Animals survive when they find food, water, and a safe place to rest.\n   - **Shelter:** A safe place where an animal can hide from danger and rest. (In the garden: plants, soil, rocks.)\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Remember our mourning dove? This garden is its habitat. The plants give it food (seeds). The soil keeps it moist and cool. The plants and rocks give it shelter to hide from danger. Do you see why this bird chose this place?\"\n   - Trace with finger: \"See how the dove's brown feathers look like the brown soil? That's an adaptation—it helps the bird hide. If the dove were bright blue, predators would see it right away!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding** using these prompts:\n   - \"Show me with thumbs up/middle/down: Do you think this bird could survive in a snow-covered forest? Why?\"\n   - \"Tell a partner: What would happen if all the plants in this garden died?\"\n   - \"If we had a different animal—say, a fish—could it survive in this same garden habitat? Why not?\"\n\n5. **Return to the \"What We Wonder\" chart** from Engage. Address 2-3 of the wonderings using what students now know.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary: habitat, adaptation, survive, shelter.\n- Students explain that animals need specific things in their habitat to survive.\n- Students recognize that an animal's body features help it fit its habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Habitat Design Challenge\" worksheet or activity card (see below)\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Blank paper or pre-drawn habitat outlines (large, for drawing)\n- Optional: Building materials (blocks, natural items) for 3D habitat creation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Habitat Design Challenge:**\n\nPose the problem: \"A local animal rescue has a mourning dove that needs a new habitat to live in. They're asking YOUR class to design a safe, comfortable habitat where this bird can survive. What would you include?\"\n\n**Student Task:**\n\n1. **Plan a habitat** for a mourning dove. Students can choose to:\n   - **Draw and label** a habitat on paper, or\n   - **Build a model** using blocks, natural items, etc.\n\n2. **Include these elements** (provide a checklist):\n   - [ ] Food sources (seeds, plants, berries)\n   - [ ] Water (a shallow dish or pond)\n   - [ ] Shelter (bushes, rocks, or tall grass)\n   - [ ] Open space on the ground (so the bird can walk and find food)\n   - [ ] Safety features (hiding places from predators)\n\n3. **Write or tell why** you chose each feature. Example sentence frames:\n   - \"I included ___ because the mourning dove needs it to ___.\"\n   - \"This helps the bird survive because ___.\"\n\n4. **Compare to the photograph:** \"How is your habitat like the garden in our photo? What's different?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Why did you choose that? Could the bird survive without it?\"\n- Challenge advanced thinkers: \"What animal might threaten this dove? What features would protect it?\"\n- Support struggling students by offering a checklist or a habitat template to fill in.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply habitat vocabulary to a new scenario.\n- Students justify design choices based on animal needs and adaptations.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that habitats must provide multiple resources.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity & Assessment Strategy:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Do students identify multiple habitat features? Do they make logical connections between animals and their needs?\n- **Questioning during Explain:** Listen for correct use of vocabulary and reasoning about survival.\n- **Habitat Design work:** Does the design include required elements? Are justifications logical?\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket):**\n\nStudents complete one of the following (choose based on class needs):\n\n**Option A: Drawing + Sentence (More Support)**\n- Draw a mourning dove in its garden habitat.\n- Write or dictate: \"This bird can survive here because ___.\"\n\n**Option B: Three-Question Exit Ticket (Standard)**\n\n1. **\"What is one thing a mourning dove needs to survive in a garden habitat?\"** (Answer should name: food, water, shelter, or space.)\n\n2. **\"How does the dove's brown color help it survive?\"** (Expected: It helps hide from danger, or it blends in with the soil/plants.)\n\n3. **\"If someone removed all the plants from the garden, could the dove survive there? Why or why not?\"** (Expected reasoning: No, because it needs plants for food and shelter.)\n\n**Option C: Explanation (Challenge)**\n- \"Explain why a mourning dove could survive in a garden but a polar bear could not. Use the word 'adaptation' in your answer.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least 2 habitat needs (food, water, shelter, space).\n- ✓ Student makes a logical connection between a body feature/behavior and survival.\n- ✓ Student explains why a specific animal fits (or doesn't fit) a habitat.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students can name 2+ habitat features and explain basic survival needs.\n- Students use vocabulary (habitat, adaptation, survive) with some accuracy.\n- Students show reasoning about animal-habitat fit (even if not perfectly articulated).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Visual Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a large, illustrated chart showing \"What Animals Need to Survive\" with pictures of food, water, shelter, and space. Reference it frequently. Keep vocabulary to 2-3 key terms instead of 5.\n\n2. **Simplified Habitat Investigation:** Provide students with a pre-made small habitat (jar with soil and one plant). Reduce the number of decisions they must make. Ask yes/no questions: \"Does this habitat have food? Does it have water?\" instead of open-ended inquiries.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Exit Ticket:** Provide prompts like:\n   - \"The dove needs ___ to survive.\"\n   - \"Its ___ helps it hide from danger.\"\n   - \"A polar bear could NOT live here because ___.\"\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Comparative Habitat Study:** \"Design TWO different habitats for two different birds (a mourning dove AND a penguin, or a dove AND an owl). Explain how each habitat is different and why.\" This pushes students to think about adaptations and diversity.\n\n2. **Food Web Extension:** \"In the garden, the mourning dove eats seeds from plants. What eats the plant? What eats the dove? Draw a food chain or web showing these connections.\"\n\n3. **Adaptation Investigation:** \"Find a picture of a different animal (provided or from books). Identify 3 body features or behaviors that help it survive in its habitat. Explain how each one helps.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom Garden or Windowsill Habitat Project:** \n   - Set up a small potted garden on the classroom windowsill with diverse plants. Over several weeks, observe and document what insects, birds, or other small animals visit it. Keep a journal with drawings and notes. This connects to real-world habitat creation and long-term observation.\n\n2. **Habitat Diorama or Model Showcase:**\n   - Students create 3D habitat models (using a shoebox, craft materials, natural items) for an assigned animal. Display all models in the classroom or hallway with labels explaining the habitat features. Classmates visit and write sticky-note observations.\n\n3. **\"If This Then That\" Scenario Cards:**\n   - Create cards with habitat scenarios (e.g., \"If all the water dried up in the garden...,\" \"If a big predator moved to the garden...,\" \"If someone planted a fence around the garden...\"). Students discuss and predict what would happen to the mourning dove. Extends thinking about habitat change and survival.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Photograph Connection:** Return to the mourning dove photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. Each phase should reference it: \"Remember the dove in our photo? It chose THIS garden because...\"\n- **Real-World Link:** If possible, take students outside to observe a real garden, schoolyard, or natural area. Have them identify habitats and use vocabulary in context.\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Send a short vocabulary list home with picture cards so families can reinforce at home.\n- **Assessment Data:** Use exit tickets to inform your next lesson—if students struggle with adaptations, plan a follow-up mini-lesson or activity before moving to 3-LS4-4 (habitat change).",
