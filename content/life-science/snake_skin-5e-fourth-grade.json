ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how animal body structures help them survive by examining a real snake in its natural habitat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the snake photograph (8.5\" × 11\" or larger) OR digital display on smartboard/projector\n- Optional: Snake field guide or book with snake images\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around a printed copy. Ask students to look carefully at the entire image—not just the snake.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (write them on chart paper as you ask):\n   - \"What do you notice about the snake's colors and patterns? Why might the snake look that way?\"\n   - \"Where is the snake in this picture? What is around it?\" (Guide them to notice the leaf litter, twigs, wood debris.)\n   - \"If you were a small mouse or frog in this habitat, would you easily see this snake? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What body parts can you see on the snake? What do you think each part helps the snake do?\"\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n   - \"Turn to a partner and discuss: How do you think the snake's body helps it survive in this leafy, woody place? What would be hard for a snake without these body parts?\" \n   - Invite 3–4 pairs to share their ideas aloud.\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper under the heading \"Our Predictions About Snake Bodies.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become snake scientists and explore how snake bodies are specially designed to help them survive. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover how snake body structures function through hands-on investigation and sensory comparison activities.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Station 1 (Camouflage):** \n  - Printouts of the snake photograph (1 per pair)\n  - Colored pencils or markers\n  - Plain white paper\n- **Station 2 (Body Movement):**\n  - 2–3 jump ropes or long fabric strips\n  - Open floor space or hallway\n  - Obstacle course made from cones, chairs, or tape lines\n- **Station 3 (Sensory Exploration):**\n  - Closed boxes or paper bags with small objects inside (crackers, a bell, a damp cloth, a pencil)\n  - Blindfolds (optional; students can close eyes)\n  - Recording sheet (see below)\n- **Station 4 (Scale Observation):**\n  - Texture samples: sandpaper, smooth tile, felt, bumpy rubber, pinecone\n  - Hand lenses (magnifiers)\n  - Snake scale photos or actual shed snake skin (if available from a pet store or naturalist)\n  - Observation sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\nStudents rotate through **four exploration stations** (5–6 minutes per station). Provide clear, written instructions at each station.\n\n---\n\n**Station 1: Camouflage Hunt**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. Look at the snake photograph.\n2. Using colored pencils, try to draw a \"hidden snake\" on the white paper that matches the leaf litter and wood in the photograph.\n3. Trade papers with another pair. Can they find your hidden snake?\n4. Talk about: \"What colors and patterns help a snake hide? Why?\"\n\n**What to Record:**\n- Sketch of camouflaged snake\n- One sentence: \"The snake's colors help it _____.\"\n\n---\n\n**Station 2: Body Movement Investigation**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. Use the jump rope or fabric strip to make an \"S\" shape on the ground (like a snake's body).\n2. Practice moving your body like a snake—wiggling and curving from side to side.\n3. Now try to move through the obstacle course by wiggling like a snake.\n4. Discuss: \"How does a long, bendy body help a snake move through tight spaces?\"\n\n**What to Record:**\n- Draw or describe: \"A snake's long, curvy body helps it _____.\"\n\n---\n\n**Station 3: Sensory Investigation**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. Work with a partner. One person closes their eyes (or wears a blindfold).\n2. The other person opens one of the boxes/bags.\n3. Without looking, the blindfolded partner uses their senses (smell, hearing, touch) to guess what's inside.\n4. Switch roles. Try at least two boxes.\n5. Talk together: \"What body parts (senses) helped you figure out what was in the box? A snake uses senses too!\"\n\n**What to Record:**\n- Recording sheet with three rows:\n  - **What I sensed:** (smell, sound, touch)\n  - **How I knew:** (describe what helped you guess)\n  - **How a snake might use this sense:** (write or draw)\n\n---\n\n**Station 4: Scale and Texture Study**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. Use a hand lens to look at texture samples. Feel each one.\n2. Look at the snake scale photos or shed skin (if available).\n3. Which texture sample is MOST like snake scales? Which is LEAST like scales?\n4. Discuss: \"Why would scales be better than smooth skin for a snake? What do scales protect?\"\n\n**What to Record:**\n- **Textures ranking (most like scales to least like scales):** _____, _____, _____, _____\n- **One sentence:** \"Scales help snakes by _____.\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among stations, observing without giving direct answers.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What are you noticing? Why do you think that happens? How does this relate to the snake in the picture?\"\n- Ensure all students record observations (drawings, words, or a combination).\n- Keep time and give 2-minute and 1-minute warnings before rotations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce sketches, written observations, or recorded answers showing understanding that snake structures (colors, body shape, scales, senses) help them survive.\n- Students articulate (verbally and in writing) connections between structure and function.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and synthesize discoveries into scientific explanations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Printed vocabulary cards (one set per student or pair)\n- Photograph of snake displayed on board\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5–7 minutes):**\n   - Invite 1–2 students from each station to share their discoveries aloud.\n   - Record key ideas on chart paper using bullet points.\n   - Ask: \"What structures helped the snake survive? How?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7–10 minutes):**\n   \n   Display each term, say it aloud, and give a student-friendly definition. Have students repeat the term.\n\n   - **Scales:** Thin, hard, overlapping plates that cover a snake's skin. Scales protect the snake and help it move smoothly.\n   - **Camouflage:** Colors and patterns on an animal's body that help it blend in with its surroundings so predators or prey cannot easily see it.\n   - **Adaptation:** A body structure or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat.\n   - **Senses:** The ways animals get information about their world—through sight (eyes), hearing (ears), smell (nose), touch (skin), and taste (tongue).\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives, including the plants, soil, water, and other animals there.\n\n3. **Explain Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Point back to the photograph. Recount what was observed:\n     - \"The snake has scales that overlap like shingles on a roof. This protects its body and helps it slide through the leaves without getting hurt.\"\n     - \"The snake's colors are brown and tan—the SAME colors as the dead leaves and wood around it. This is camouflage. Prey animals can't see the snake, and bigger predators might not see it either.\"\n     - \"The snake has eyes to see, nostrils to smell, and a forked tongue to sense chemicals in the air. These senses help it find food and know what's happening around it.\"\n     - \"The snake's long, bendy body lets it squeeze into small spaces to hide and to move through the leaf litter where it hunts.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Show the photograph again. Ask:\n     - \"Point to the part of the snake's body that protects it.\" (Scales)\n     - \"Why is this snake hard to see in this picture?\" (Camouflage/colors blend in)\n     - \"What body parts does this snake use to sense danger or find food?\" (Eyes, nostrils, tongue)\n   - Listen for student use of new vocabulary.\n\n**Vocabulary (Student-Friendly Definitions):**\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|------|-----------|\n| **Scales** | Hard, smooth plates that cover and protect a snake's body |\n| **Camouflage** | Colors and patterns that help an animal hide by blending in with its surroundings |\n| **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal live in its habitat |\n| **Senses** | The ways an animal learns about its world (seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, tasting) |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and everything in it |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use new vocabulary to explain how snake structures support survival.\n- Students can point to or name at least two snake body structures and explain their function.\n- Students understand that adaptations help animals live in their habitats.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply snake body-structure knowledge to new scenarios and deepen understanding of adaptation and habitat fit.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper (chart paper or 11\" × 14\" construction paper)\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Optional: pictures of different snake habitats (desert, forest, water, grassland) from library books or printed images\n- Optional: Fact cards about different snakes (see materials prep below)\n\n**Activity: \"Design a Snake for a New Habitat\"**\n\n1. **Set the Context (2 minutes):**\n   - \"We've learned that the snake in our photograph has a brown and tan body, scales, and senses that help it survive in a leafy, woody habitat. But what if a snake lived somewhere ELSE? Would it need different adaptations?\"\n\n2. **Present Scenario (1 minute):**\n   - Divide the class into small groups (3–4 students).\n   - Assign each group a different habitat:\n     - **Group 1:** Desert (hot, sandy, few plants)\n     - **Group 2:** Swamp or wetland (wet, muddy, lots of water)\n     - **Group 3:** Grassland (open, golden grass, few trees)\n     - **Group 4:** Rocky mountain (cold, rocky, sparse vegetation)\n\n3. **Student Task (10–12 minutes):**\n   - Each group discusses and plans a \"snake adaptation\" for their habitat.\n   - Guide with questions written on the board:\n     - \"What colors would help your snake hide in this habitat?\"\n     - \"What special body features might your snake need?\"\n     - \"What senses would be most important?\"\n     - \"What dangers or challenges would your snake face?\"\n   - Groups sketch and label their adapted snake on large paper.\n   - They write 3–4 sentences explaining why they designed it that way.\n\n4. **Gallery Walk & Share (3–5 minutes):**\n   - Post all snake designs around the room.\n   - Students walk to look at other groups' designs.\n   - Each group presents their snake (1 minute per group).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"Why did you choose that color? How will this body part help your snake survive?\"\n- Encourage use of vocabulary: habitat, adaptation, camouflage, senses.\n- Ensure all students contribute ideas and participate in the drawing/planning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design a snake with adaptations that fit a specific habitat.\n- Students explain connections between habitat features and snake body structures.\n- Students articulate reasons for their design choices using scientific vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how animal body structures support survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation checklist during Explore stations: ✓ Student identifies structure, ✓ Student explains function, ✓ Student uses vocabulary\n- Listen-in during group discussions in Elaborate phase\n- Anecdotal notes on student explanations during Explain phase\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket. Students complete ONE of the following (offer a choice to differentiate):\n\n**Option A (Written/Drawing):**\n   - \"Look at this picture of a snake. Circle two body parts. For each one, write or draw how it helps the snake survive.\"\n\n**Option B (Short Answer – Sentences):**\n   - \"Name one structure a snake has. Explain how it helps the snake live in its habitat. Use a vocabulary word in your answer.\"\n\n**Option C (Multiple Choice + Explanation – for students needing more support):**\n   - \"Which body part helps a snake hide in leaf litter? A) Scales B) Eyes C) Camouflage D) Habitat\n   - Explain your answer in one sentence.\"\n\n**Assessment Questions (Choose 1–2 for Exit Ticket or Formal Assessment):**\n\n1. **Structure & Function:** \"A snake's scales are hard and overlapping. How do scales help a snake survive?\" (Listen for: protection, movement, waterproofing, or flexibility.)\n\n2. **Camouflage:** \"Why is the brown and tan snake in the photograph hard to see? What is this called?\" (Listen for: camouflage, blending in, same color as surroundings.)\n\n3. **Application:** \"If a snake lived in a bright green jungle instead of a brown forest, what color might its camouflage be? Why?\" (Listen for: green, to blend in, to hide from predators or prey.)\n\n4. **Senses & Response:** \"A snake smells a mouse nearby. How does the snake use its senses to find the mouse? What does the snake do?\" (Listen for: uses nose/senses to detect, brain processes info, responds by hunting/moving toward mouse. Connection to 4-LS1-2.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least **two snake body structures** (scales, color, eyes, nostrils, body shape, tongue).\n- ✓ Student **explains how at least one structure helps survival** (protection, hiding, movement, sensing).\n- ✓ Student uses **at least one vocabulary word correctly** (scales, camouflage, adaptation, habitat, or senses).\n- ✓ Student **makes a connection between structure and habitat** (snake's body fits its environment).\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Review exit tickets and observation notes.\n- Students meeting all four criteria have achieved the lesson objectives.\n- Students meeting 3/4 criteria are approaching mastery; provide small-group re-teaching on the missing concept.\n- Use data to inform the Differentiation strategies below.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for Students Struggling with Concepts)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Cards:**\n   - Provide picture cards with vocabulary terms (e.g., photo of scales, a picture showing camouflage).\n   - Students match pictures to words and sort them into \"protects the snake\" and \"hides the snake.\"\n   - Reduces language demand while building conceptual understanding.\n\n2. **Guided Station Practice:**\n   - Assign a teacher aide or advanced peer to Station 1 and Station 4 to provide one-on-one guiding questions.\n   - Use question stems: \"What do you notice? How is this like the snake in the picture? What does this help the snake do?\"\n   - Reduce the number of stations a student completes (complete 2–3 instead of all 4).\n\n3. **Structured Exit Ticket:**\n   - Provide a sentence frame: \"The snake's _____________ helps it _____________ because _____________.\"\n   - Allow drawing instead of writing.\n   - Provide word bank: (scales, eyes, colors, body, hide, move, find food, hunt).\n\n### Challenge (for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Habitat Research:**\n   - Provide field guides or websites (with teacher pre-screening) about real snake species.\n   - Challenge students to research a specific snake (e.g., king cobra, rattlesnake, green tree python) and present how its adaptations match its habitat.\n   - Require use of 3+ vocabulary terms in a short written explanation or poster.\n\n2. **Complex Scenario Problem-Solving:**\n   - Pose this challenge: \"A snake loses its ability to sense heat (through heat pits). How would this change its behavior? What would be difficult? What other senses could it rely on?\"\n   - Require students to write or present a 2–3 minute explanation using evidence from their learning.\n   - This connects to 4-LS1-2 (senses → brain → response).\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis:**\n   - Ask: \"How are a snake's adaptations similar to or different from a lizard's or another animal's? Create a Venn diagram.\"\n   - Challenge them to explain why two animals in the SAME habitat might have different body structures.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Snake Life Cycle & Growth:**\n   - Research and create a poster showing how a baby snake grows into an adult.\n   - Focus question: \"How do a snake's structures help it change as it grows? (Shedding skin/scales as it gets bigger.)\"\n   - Connection: 4-LS1-1 (structures support growth).\n\n2. **Sensory Simulation: Snake vs. Human Senses:**\n   - Create a comparison chart or presentation: \"How are human senses different from snake senses?\"\n   - Students test their own senses (close eyes and touch, smell only, hear only) and compare to facts about snake senses.\n   - Discussion: \"What can a snake do that humans can't? Why?\"\n\n3. **Local Habitat Hunt:**\n   - Take a classroom nature walk or outdoor exploration.\n   - Students observe a local habitat (garden, wooded area, field) and identify places where a camouflaged animal might hide.\n   - Discuss: \"If a snake lived here, what would its camouflage look like? What other adaptations would it need?\"\n   - Connection: Real-world application of habitat and adaptation concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Preparation Notes\n\n- **Obtain resources before the lesson:** Printed snake photos, texture samples, optional field guides.\n- **Test the stations:** Walk through each activity yourself to anticipate questions and timing.\n- **Prepare vocabulary cards:** Print on cardstock and laminate if possible for reuse.\n- **Optional enhancement:** If possible, arrange a virtual or in-person visit from a local naturalist or herpetologist to show a live non-venomous snake (e.g., ball python, corn snake). Students can observe real scales, shedding behavior, and movement. This brings the lesson to life and deepens engagement.\n- **Safety reminder:** If using a live animal, establish clear handling rules and supervise closely.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson plan follows the 5E model by building from curiosity (Engage) through hands-on discovery (Explore), formal explanation (Explain), real-world application (Elaborate), and rigorous assessment (Evaluate). All activities are grounded in the photograph and aligned to Fourth Grade NGSS standards.",
