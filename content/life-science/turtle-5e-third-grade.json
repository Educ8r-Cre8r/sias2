Exploring Animal Homes and Habitats**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 3-LS4-3: Construct an argument with evidence that in a particular habitat some organisms can survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all.\n  - 3-LS3-2: Use evidence to support the explanation that traits can be influenced by the environment.\n  - 3-LS4-2: Use evidence to construct an explanation for how the variations in characteristics among individuals of the same species may provide advantages in surviving, finding mates, and reproducing.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Identify key features of a turtle's habitat by observing and describing the photograph.\n2. Explain how a turtle's shell and body features help it survive in its environment.\n3. Construct an argument using evidence that certain organisms are well-suited to survive in specific habitats.\n4. Compare how different animal habitats must have certain features to help animals survive.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or projected image of the turtle photograph (8.5\" × 11\" minimum)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or as a printed poster where all students can see it clearly. Do not explain it yet.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discovery questions** (pause 5-10 seconds after each to allow thinking time):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me everything you notice.\"\n   - \"Where do you think this turtle is? What clues tell you that?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the turtle might be hiding near the rocks and leaves? What could it be hiding from?\"\n   - \"Do you see any special parts of the turtle's body? What do you think that hard shell on its back does?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations** on chart paper as they respond. Use their exact words when possible.\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm wondering: If we took this turtle away from this place with rocks, water, and leaves, could it survive in the middle of a playground? Why or why not? Turn to a neighbor and discuss your ideas.\"\n\n5. **Gather 3-4 student predictions** and write them on the chart.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Today we're going to become habitat detectives and find out exactly what a turtle needs to survive, and why this turtle's hiding spot is the perfect home for it.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small objects representing habitat features: rocks, leaves, small branches, toy plants, water cup/container, soil samples in ziplock bags\n- Images or photographs of different habitats (desert, rainforest, playground, bedroom) — 5-6 printed sheets\n- Chart or worksheet titled \"Does This Turtle Belong Here?\" (one per pair)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Habitat Investigation (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into pairs.** Distribute one \"Does This Turtle Belong Here?\" chart to each pair.\n\n2. **Display each habitat photograph one at a time** (desert, rainforest, classroom, pond, sandbox, forest with rocks and water).\n\n3. **For each habitat, students discuss and decide:** \n   - \"Would a turtle like the one in our photo survive here? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"Does this habitat have rocks? Plants? Water? Shade? Soft ground to dig in?\"\n\n4. **Students mark yes/no or draw checkmarks** on their chart for each habitat feature and write or draw 1-2 sentences explaining their choice.\n\n5. **Circulate and ask guiding questions without telling answers:**\n   - \"What did you see in the turtle's home in the photo?\"\n   - \"Does this new place have the same things?\"\n   - \"What would happen if it was too hot/dry/bright for a turtle?\"\n\n**Part 2: Create a Turtle Home (10-13 minutes)**\n\n1. **Provide each pair with a small container, rocks, soil, leaves, a small cup of water, and a toy turtle.**\n\n2. **Challenge:** \"Using these materials, create a home where this turtle would feel safe and comfortable. Remember what you saw in the photo!\"\n\n3. **Students arrange materials** to build a habitat, then explain their choices to you or another pair.\n\n4. **Ask:** \"Why did you put the water here?\" \"Why does it need shade?\" \"What does the turtle eat that you should include?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Listen to student reasoning without correcting\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"Tell me more about that choice.\"\n- Encourage peer discussion: \"What does your partner think?\"\n- Note which students understand habitat features and which need support during Explain phase\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should identify that turtles need water, shelter/shade, plants, and soft ground\n- Students should recognize that not all habitats are suitable for turtles\n- Students should begin connecting turtle body parts (shell) to survival needs\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original turtle photograph (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and illustrations\n- Index cards with vocabulary terms (one set for word wall)\n- Student science notebooks or paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on the floor with the photograph visible.**\n\n2. **Share-out from Explore:** Ask 3-4 pairs to show their turtle homes and explain one choice they made. As they share, highlight the habitat features they identified.\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary with illustrations on chart paper:**\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Habitat**: The place where an animal lives that has everything it needs to survive (water, food, shelter, and space). Point to the photo: \"This turtle's habitat is a forest by water with rocks and plants.\"\n\n- **Shelter**: A safe, protected place where an animal can hide from danger or rest. Point to rocks and vegetation: \"This turtle uses rocks and leaves as shelter to hide from bigger animals.\"\n\n- **Adaptation**: A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. Point to the shell: \"The turtle's hard shell is an adaptation that protects it from predators.\"\n\n- **Survival**: Staying alive by having what you need to eat, drink, stay safe, and grow. \"Turtles survive in habitats with water, plants to eat, and places to hide.\"\n\n- **Predator**: An animal that hunts other animals for food. \"Without its shell for protection, a turtle couldn't survive predators.\"\n\n4. **Connect back to photograph:**\n   - \"Why is this turtle in a good habitat? Let's count the ways: It has water nearby for drinking and swimming. It has plants to eat. It has rocks and leaves for shelter. It has soil where it can rest.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn and talk: What would happen if we moved this turtle to the desert? What habitat features would be missing?\" Listen to 2-3 pairs.\n   - Quick write: \"Draw and label one thing in the turtle photo that helps the turtle survive.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should use vocabulary terms when discussing the photograph\n- Students should explain that specific habitats provide what animals need to survive\n- Students should recognize that the turtle's features match its habitat\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Turtle or Not? Habitat Match Game\" cards (prepare 6-8 cards with different animals: fish, cactus, leopard, penguin, snake, eagle, duck, bear)\n- Habitat cards (desert, pond, rainforest, arctic, cave, tree) — 6 copies\n- Chart: \"Which Animals Survive in Similar Habitats?\" on paper\n- Optional: Photos or illustrations of different turtles (box turtle, red-eared slider, sea turtle, painted turtle)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Match Game (for most students)**\n\n1. **Display habitat cards on a table or floor space.**\n\n2. **Show one animal card at a time.** Students discuss in pairs or small groups: \"Does this animal live in the same kind of habitat as our forest turtle?\"\n\n3. **Students move to stand by the habitat card they think matches** (or point to it).\n\n4. **Discuss:** \"Why does this animal survive there? What body parts or behaviors help it? What habitat features does it need?\"\n\n5. **Example analysis:**\n   - **Penguin in arctic**: Has thick feathers (like a shell protects turtle), needs cold water, lives where it's icy and snowy\n   - **Fish in pond**: Needs water like turtle does, but doesn't need rocks or leaves\n   - **Cactus in desert**: Doesn't need shade or water nearby like turtle does\n\n**Option B: Turtle Variety Investigation (optional or simultaneous)**\n\n1. **Show images of different turtle species** (if available: box turtle, painted turtle, sea turtle, softshell turtle).\n\n2. **Compare:** \"These are all turtles, but look at their shells! They're different colors and patterns. Why might different turtles look different if they live in different habitats?\"\n\n3. **Students discuss:** Does a sea turtle need the same things as a forest turtle? What's different about their habitats?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion without providing immediate answers\n- Ask: \"What does that animal need to survive?\"\n- Encourage reasoning: \"How do you know that?\"\n- Prompt comparisons: \"How is that habitat different from the turtle's forest home?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should explain that different animals need different habitats with specific features\n- Students should recognize that body parts (shells, feathers, etc.) match habitat needs\n- Students should begin understanding adaptation to specific environments\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitat, adaptation, and survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student reasoning during Explore: Do they identify water, shelter, plants as habitat needs?\n- Listen to Elaborate discussions: Do they explain \"why\" an animal fits a habitat, not just \"yes\" or \"no\"?\n- Review quick writes and sketches: Can they label habitat features?\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (provide one per student, may be verbal or written):**\n\n*Choose ONE assessment format based on your students' readiness:*\n\n**Option A: Picture and Label (for emerging writers)**\n- Show a simple drawing of a habitat with a turtle, rocks, water, plants, and soil.\n- \"Circle and label three things this turtle needs to survive in its home.\"\n- Success criterion: Student correctly identifies at least 2-3 habitat features.\n\n**Option B: Written/Drawn Response (for developing writers)**\n- **Prompt:** \"A turtle needs a habitat with three things. Draw or write two of them. Then explain why the turtle needs that thing.\"\n- Example answer: \"The turtle needs water because it drinks and swims. The turtle needs rocks because it can hide and stay safe.\"\n- Success criterion: Student identifies 2 habitat features with simple explanations of purpose.\n\n**Option C: Argument with Evidence (for proficient writers)**\n- **Prompt:** \"Can a turtle survive in a cage with only food and no water, rocks, or plants? Tell me yes or no, then explain why using what you learned today.\"\n- Success criterion: Student makes a claim and provides 2-3 pieces of evidence from the lesson (e.g., \"Turtles need water to drink and swim,\" \"They need shelter to hide from predators\").\n\n**Success Criteria for All Options:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least 2 specific habitat features (water, shelter, plants, soil)\n- ✓ Student explains why one habitat feature helps the turtle survive\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary from the lesson (habitat, shelter, survival, or adaptation)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 70% of students should correctly identify 2+ habitat needs for the turtle\n- 60%+ should explain at least one reason why that feature supports survival\n- Students should use or understand lesson vocabulary when prompted\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**SUPPORT (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards with pictures**: Provide icon-based habitat feature cards (water droplet, leaf, rock, sun) so students can match rather than rely on reading/writing. During Explore, let students arrange these icons instead of writing.\n\n2. **Habitat checklist for Explore**: Create a simple yes/no checklist (with pictures) instead of a full comparison chart. \"Does this habitat have water? Yes/No. Does it have plants? Yes/No.\"\n\n3. **Sentence frame for explaining**: Provide oral or written frames: \"This turtle needs _____ because _____.\" or \"This habitat is/is not good for a turtle because it has/doesn't have _____.\"\n\n4. **Pair with a stronger reader/writer** during Elaborate discussions so they can contribute verbally without writing pressure.\n\n**CHALLENGE (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research different turtle species**: Provide images or short texts about box turtles, painted turtles, sea turtles, and softshell turtles. Ask: \"How are their habitats different? How are their shells different? Why might their shells look different if they live in different places?\" This deepens understanding of adaptation.\n\n2. **Design a new habitat**: \"If you created a brand-new habitat for a turtle, what would you include? Draw it and label each part. Explain why each feature helps the turtle survive.\" Challenge them to include 5+ features with scientific explanations.\n\n3. **Predict problem-solving**: \"What if this turtle's habitat dried up and lost all its water? What would happen? How would the turtle need to change to survive?\" This connects to 3-LS4-4 about environmental changes.\n\n4. **Compare multiple animals**: Provide a habitat comparison chart where students identify which animals could share the forest habitat (turtle, frog, salamander, beetle, worm, rabbit) and defend their reasoning with evidence about habitat needs.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Virtual Field Trip and Nature Journal:** Take students on a classroom \"nature walk video\" (available free on YouTube: searches for \"nature habitat for kids\") or use Google Earth to explore different habitats. Have students sketch in a nature journal and note what animals would survive there and why. Follow up with a field trip to a local park, pond, or nature area where they observe real habitats and sketch what they see.\n\n2. **Create a Classroom Terrarium:** Build a simple terrarium in a clear container with soil, rocks, water, and plants. Discuss: \"Could a turtle live here? What would we need to add? What would we need to change?\" Over time, observe changes and record what happens to the plants and ecosystem, connecting to life cycles and habitat maintenance.\n\n3. **Habitat Mystery Game:** Create scenario cards (e.g., \"A turtle's pond dries up in summer.\" \"A new road is built near the turtle's forest.\"). In small groups, students discuss how this change affects the turtle and what the turtle would need to do to survive. Record ideas and create a class problem-solving chart about habitat changes and animal survival.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson works well if you can find a local turtle to observe or show a short video clip of a turtle in its natural habitat (search: \"turtle in forest habitat\" on YouTube, 2-3 minute clips).\n- The photograph is powerful for Third Graders because it shows a real animal in a real place, not a drawing. Reference it frequently to keep discussions concrete.\n- If students have access to outdoor space, let them search for places where small animals might hide and discuss what makes those good habitats.\n- Connect this lesson to any class pets or animals students have at home by asking, \"What habitat does your pet need?\"",
