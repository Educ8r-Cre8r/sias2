ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal body structures using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of the lizard on the leaf (or digital projection)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"I notice, I wonder, I think\" graphic organizer (one per student)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it on the screen. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation before any discussion.\n\n2. **Launch with an intriguing prompt:** \"This animal has some very special body features that help it survive. What clues can you see in the picture that tell you this lizard is built for living in plants and leaves?\"\n\n3. **Pose specific discussion questions calibrated to fourth-grade thinking:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the lizard's feet and claws? How might those help it live on thin plant stems and leaves?\"\n   - \"Look at the lizard's eye and head. What does its position tell you about what the lizard might be doing or paying attention to?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the lizard's belly is lighter colored and its back is darker? Where in nature might this be helpful?\"\n   - \"If this lizard didn't have a long tail, what might happen to it?\"\n\n4. **Individual prediction activity:** Students complete an \"I notice, I wonder, I think\" organizer:\n   - *I notice:* Three observations about the lizard's body parts\n   - *I wonder:* One question about why the lizard looks this way\n   - *I think:* One prediction about how a body part helps the lizard survive\n\n5. **Share 3-4 student predictions aloud** and write key ideas on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become lizard scientists and investigate how each part of a lizard's body is specially designed to help it survive. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate external structures and their functions through hands-on exploration and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Laminated cards with close-up images of different lizard body parts (eyes, feet/claws, tail, skin texture, head shape) — 5-6 sets\n- Real or high-quality plastic model lizard (if available)\n- \"Lizard Body Structure Investigation Sheet\" (worksheet with blanks for structure name, location, and function) — one per student\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Magnifying glasses (one per pair)\n- Reference images of the same lizard species in different environments (on leaves, on rocks, on branches)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide the class into 4-5 small investigation groups** (3-4 students per group).\n\n2. **Station rotation setup:** Assign each group a \"Body Part Station\" where they examine a close-up image or laminated card of one major external structure (e.g., claws, eye, tail, skin pattern, head shape). If a model lizard is available, groups can also handle it carefully.\n\n3. **At each station (5-6 minutes per group), students:**\n   - Observe the body part using magnifying glasses\n   - Record the structure's name, location on the body, and observable details (color, texture, size)\n   - Make inferences: \"How does this structure help the lizard survive? What does it let the lizard do?\"\n   - Sketch the structure on their investigation sheet with labels\n\n4. **Teacher role during exploration:**\n   - Circulate to each station\n   - Ask guiding questions without providing answers: *\"What do you notice about the shape of the claws? Why might a lizard need claws shaped this way?\"* or *\"If you were this lizard, what would these eyes help you see?\"*\n   - Encourage students to use sensory language: rough, smooth, pointed, flexible, alert, etc.\n   - Record student inferences on a notepad for the Explain phase\n\n5. **Group discussion at each station:** Before rotating, ask each group to share one discovery with the class (30 seconds per group).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students complete a lizard body structure investigation sheet with 4-5 structures identified and at least one function noted for each\n- Groups create sketches showing external structures with labels\n- Students generate reasonable inferences about function (e.g., \"Claws help grip leaves,\" \"Big eyes help see predators\")\n- Students verbally connect structure to survival (sensing food, escaping danger, staying on plants)\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large anatomy poster or diagram of a lizard with labeled external structures (teacher-created or printed)\n- Projected images showing the original photograph and reference images\n- \"Lizard Structures and Functions\" vocabulary chart (to be built during this phase)\n- Whiteboard or chart paper for recording vocabulary\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Whole-group share-out:** Invite 1-2 groups to share their investigations with the class. Display their sketches and observations.\n\n2. **Make explicit connections back to the original photograph:** \n   - \"Remember the lizard we started with? Let's look at it again. We now know WHY it has those structures.\"\n   - Show the original photograph and the reference images side by side\n   - Ask: \"Why is the coloring important? (Camouflage — blending with green plants) Why are the claws so sharp? (Gripping thin branches and leaves)\"\n\n3. **Introduce and define key vocabulary** (4-5 terms) by building a class vocabulary chart on chart paper or whiteboard:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **External structure:** A body part on the outside of an animal that you can see and touch (like skin, claws, eyes, or a tail)\n   - **Function:** What a body part does; the job it performs to help the animal survive\n   - **Adaptation:** A special feature or trait that helps an animal live and survive in its environment\n   - **Camouflage:** Coloring or patterns that help an animal blend in with its surroundings so predators don't see it\n   - **Sensory organs:** Body parts that help an animal see, hear, smell, touch, or taste (like eyes, ears, nose, skin)\n\n4. **Model thinking about structure-and-function relationships:**\n   - \"This lizard has four sturdy legs with sharp claws. The function of those claws is to grip plants so the lizard doesn't fall. This is an adaptation because it helps the lizard survive in a place with lots of plants.\"\n   - Repeat this language pattern for 2-3 other structures from student observations.\n\n5. **Check for understanding strategy:**\n   - Display a new image of a different lizard species (on a rock or different habitat)\n   - Ask: \"This lizard has bumpy, rough skin. What might be the function of bumpy skin? How might it be adapted to where it lives?\" (Students respond via hand signals: thumbs up if they can explain, sideways if unsure)\n   - Listen for student use of vocabulary words (structure, function, adaptation, sensory)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least 3 external structures of a lizard\n- Students can explain 2-3 functions using sentence frames: \"The _____ helps the lizard _____ because _____.\"\n- Students use vocabulary terms (external structure, function, adaptation) in oral explanations\n- Students make connections between body structure and habitat survival\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by comparing structures across different animals and habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or printed images of 4-5 different animals in their habitats (e.g., mountain goat on rocky cliff, duck in water, owl in forest, cheetah on grassland, frog on lily pad) — one set per pair\n- \"Structure Comparison Chart\" worksheet (two-column or matrix format comparing lizard to another animal)\n- Colored pencils\n- Optional: live animals or videos of animals in their habitats (30-second clips)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Partner activity — Comparative structure analysis:**\n   - Assign each pair a different animal from the collection\n   - Students compare their animal's external structures to the lizard from the lesson\n   - They complete a comparison chart:\n     - Column 1: Lizard structures and functions (from earlier investigation)\n     - Column 2: Partner animal's similar structures and how they work differently\n     - Example: \"Lizard claws grip plants. Duck feet have webbing to paddle through water.\"\n\n2. **Prompt deeper thinking:**\n   - \"What structures do both animals have? (Eyes, legs, skin) Do they do the same job?\"\n   - \"What structures does your animal have that the lizard doesn't? Why does YOUR animal need those?\"\n   - \"How is each animal's body perfectly designed for where it lives?\"\n\n3. **Gallery walk (5 minutes):** Students post their comparison charts around the room. Everyone does a quick walk to see how different animals have different structures for different habitats.\n\n4. **Whole-group reflection discussion:**\n   - \"What did you notice? Do all animals have the same structures?\" (No)\n   - \"Why do different animals have different body parts?\" (Because they live in different places and need different things to survive)\n   - \"Can an animal's external structures tell us about where it lives?\" (Yes — give examples: webbed feet = water, sharp claws = climbing trees, etc.)\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate to partnerships asking probing questions: *\"How does that structure help your animal survive in its habitat?\"* Encourage students to explain their thinking in complete sentences.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Completed comparison charts showing structure-function relationships for two different animals\n- Oral explanations connecting body structure to habitat and survival\n- Understanding that different animals have different external structures adapted to their specific environments\n- Evidence of transfer thinking: applying the structure-function concept to new animals\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of external structures, functions, and adaptation.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student investigation sheets and sketches during Explore — do they identify structures and attempt to explain function?\n- Listen to group discussions during station rotation — do students use accurate vocabulary and logical reasoning?\n- Monitor think-pair-share responses during Explain — can students explain at least one structure-function relationship?\n- Review comparison charts during Elaborate — does the student thinking show understanding of structure and adaptation?\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (end of Day 2, 5-7 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a picture of an unfamiliar animal in its habitat (e.g., a porcupine, a penguin, a tree frog). Students respond to the following prompt in writing or verbally:\n\n1. **Identify one external structure** on this animal that you can see in the picture.\n2. **Explain the function** of that structure — what does it help the animal do?\n3. **Describe how that structure is an adaptation** — tell how it helps the animal survive in this habitat.\n\n**Success Criteria for demonstrating mastery of 4-LS1-1:**\n- ✓ Student identifies a specific external structure (e.g., \"thick fur,\" \"long beak,\" \"webbed feet\")\n- ✓ Student explains a realistic function connected to survival (e.g., \"The thick fur keeps it warm in cold places,\" \"The beak helps it catch fish\")\n- ✓ Student makes a clear connection between structure and environment/survival\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify an external structure and describe its function\n- 70% of students can explicitly connect structure to habitat survival using language like \"This helps the animal survive because…\"\n- All students show evidence of understanding that external structures serve important survival functions\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Provide a sentence frame bank** during Explore and Explain phases:\n   - \"The _____ is a structure that helps the lizard _____.\"\n   - \"This structure is important for survival because _____.\"\n   - Students can use these frames to organize their thinking orally before writing.\n\n2. **Reduce the number of structures to investigate** — assign struggling learners only 2-3 major structures (claws, eyes, tail) rather than 5-6. This allows deeper focus and reduces cognitive load.\n\n3. **Use labeled diagrams during Explain** — provide pre-made diagrams with structure names already labeled so students can focus on understanding function rather than identifying and naming structures independently.\n\n4. **Pair with a stronger peer** during station rotation and Elaborate activities so the struggling learner benefits from modeling and discussion without pressure.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Introduce the concept of trade-offs in adaptation:**\n   - \"This lizard is very colorful for camouflage in green plants, BUT what if it had to live on a brown rock? How might that be a problem?\"\n   - Task: Draw or describe what this lizard might look like if it lived in a desert instead of a forest. What structures would need to change?\n\n2. **Research and present on specialized lizard adaptations:**\n   - Assign advanced students to investigate a unique lizard species (horned lizard, basilisk, frilled lizard) and create a presentation on one specialized adaptation\n   - They explain how that adaptation increases survival in a specific environment\n\n3. **Design an imaginary animal for a new habitat:**\n   - Give students a scenario: \"Design an animal that must survive in a very cold, icy environment. Draw it and label at least 5 external structures. Explain how each structure helps it survive the cold.\"\n   - This requires transfer and synthesis of the structure-function concept\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"If Animals Could Trade Bodies\" activity:** \n   - Students receive cards with two different animals (e.g., duck + mountain goat)\n   - They write or draw: \"What would happen if a duck had a goat's hooves instead of webbed feet? How would it survive differently?\" \n   - This deepens understanding of how specific structures match specific habitats and that structure mismatch = survival problems\n\n2. **Life cycle extension connecting to structure change:**\n   - Introduce the idea that lizard bodies change as they grow (connecting to shedding/molting visible in the photograph)\n   - Students research: \"How do a baby lizard's external structures compare to an adult lizard's? Are they the same size? Same color?\"\n   - Create a growth diagram showing how the lizard's body changes (links to 3-LS1-1 and growth/development concepts)\n\n3. **Habitat walk and structure hunt:**\n   - Take students on a nature walk around the school grounds (playground, garden, field, etc.)\n   - Challenge them to observe real animals (insects, birds, etc.) and identify external structures they see\n   - Record findings on a \"Real Animal Structures\" sheet: \"I saw a _____ with _____ (structure) that helps it _____ (function)\"\n   - Share findings in a follow-up discussion connecting outdoor observations to the lizard lesson\n\n---",
