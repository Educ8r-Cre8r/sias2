  "content": "# Engineering Design Challenge: Farm Containment & Animal Safety\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n- Large pasture with mixed herd of cattle (white, black, and black-and-white spotted)\n- Wire fencing in foreground (appears to be standard farm fence)\n- Dense tree line forming a natural boundary at rear of field\n- Flat, grassy terrain with good visibility\n- Multiple animals at varying distances, some clustered together\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n- **From fencing visible**: Farmers need barriers to keep livestock contained and prevent escape or entry of predators; fencing must be sturdy enough to withstand animal contact and weather.\n- **From mixed herd composition**: Different breeds/sizes may require different enclosure heights and spacing; farmers must design fences that work for the smallest and largest animals.\n- **From open pasture + tree line**: Animals need both grazing space and shelter/shade options; infrastructure must allow safe movement between zones.\n\n---\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2 Version:**\n*\"Design and build a fence that keeps toy animals inside a play pasture and keeps them safe. Your fence must be at least 6 inches tall, use only string and paper cups or straws, and keep the animals from escaping when you gently shake the table.\"*\n\n**3-5 Version:**\n*\"Design a portable farm fence system that can contain cattle of different sizes (use toy animals ranging from 2–5 inches tall). Your fence must:*\n- *Be at least 8 inches tall*\n- *Use only wood sticks, wire or string, and paper or cardboard*\n- *Withstand a gentle 5-second shake without collapsing*\n- *Cost no more than $5 in materials*\n- *Be movable (able to be relocated in less than 2 minutes)*\n\n*Test your design with different animal sizes and document which animals it successfully contains.\"*\n\n---\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis photo is ideal for starting with problem identification. Students can observe real animals in a real farming context and identify the actual need: *\"How do farmers keep animals safely contained while allowing them to graze and move?\"* The visible fencing and animal behavior make the challenge authentic and tangible—students aren't guessing at an abstract problem; they can see why the solution matters.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Materials\n- Wooden dowels, craft sticks, or thin branches\n- String, yarn, or wire\n- Paper cups, cardboard strips, or poster board\n- Tape (masking, duct, or clear)\n- Toy animals (farm animal figurines, 2–5 inches)\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Time\n- **K-2**: 30–45 minutes (15 min. discussion, 20 min. building, 10 min. testing)\n- **3-5**: 60–90 minutes (15 min. research/sketching, 30 min. building, 15 min. testing, 10 min. redesign if needed)\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly aligns with **NGSS 3-5-ETS1-2** (*Generate and compare multiple possible solutions based on how well they meet the criteria and constraints of a design problem*) by asking students to iterate on a real-world agricultural need and test their designs against measurable criteria.",
