The cicada has large eyes and a thick body, and it's holding onto the bark with its strong legs.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image captures the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of cicada emergence and adult transformation. The cicada has recently molted from its nymph stage, shedding its old exoskeleton to reveal its adult form with fully developed wings. This process is called metamorphosis, specifically incomplete metamorphosis, where the insect goes through three life stages (egg, nymph, adult) rather than four. The cicada's positioning on the tree bark represents its instinctual behavior to find a secure surface for this vulnerable transformation process.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Life Cycles and Metamorphosis**: Cicadas demonstrate incomplete metamorphosis, progressing from egg to nymph to adult without a pupal stage.\n\n2. **Adaptation and Survival**: The cicada's strong claws, protective coloration, and wing structure are adaptations that help it survive in its tree habitat.\n\n3. **Animal Behavior**: Cicadas exhibit instinctual behaviors like climbing trees, molting in safe locations, and eventually producing sounds to attract mates.\n\n4. **Body Structure and Function**: The cicada's body parts (wings for flight, legs for gripping, eyes for seeing) are specifically designed for its survival needs.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"See, Think, Wonder\" thinking routine when introducing this image. Have students first observe what they see, then share what they think is happening, and finally express what they wonder about the cicada.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to explore cicada sounds by playing audio recordings, showing videos, and allowing students to create their own \"cicada sounds\" with instruments or voice. This supports auditory learners and students who benefit from multi-sensory experiences.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In**: At the cellular level, the cicada's exoskeleton is made of chitin, a tough material that provides protection but cannot grow. When the cicada outgrows its shell, special hormones trigger the molting process where the old exoskeleton splits and the cicada emerges with a new, larger one.\n\n2. **Zoom Out**: Cicadas play important roles in forest ecosystems. As nymphs, they aerate soil and recycle nutrients. As adults, they serve as food for birds, spiders, and other predators. Their mass emergence every 13-17 years (for some species) affects the entire food web and forest health.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: \"Cicadas are the same as grasshoppers or crickets.\"\n   **Clarification**: While all are insects, cicadas have different life cycles, body structures, and behaviors. Cicadas spend most of their lives underground as nymphs.\n\n2. **Misconception**: \"The cicada in the photo is sick or dying because it's not moving.\"\n   **Clarification**: Cicadas often remain still during and after molting to let their new exoskeleton harden and their wings dry.\n\n3. **Misconception**: \"All cicadas come out every 17 years.\"\n   **Clarification**: Only some cicada species are periodical. Many species emerge annually during summer months.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation**: 3-LS1-1 - Develop models to describe that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but all have in common birth, growth, reproduction, and death.\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS1.B]] - Growth and Development of Organisms\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] in the natural world can be observed and used as evidence\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1.

The cicada has big eyes and a thick body, and you can see the detailed patterns on its transparent wings. This insect spends most of its life underground and only comes out for a short time to find a mate.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image captures the **emergence phase of a cicada's life cycle** - specifically an adult cicada that has recently molted from its nymph stage. The cicada has climbed up from its underground burrow where it lived for years, shed its old exoskeleton, and is now in its brief adult phase focused on reproduction. The phenomenon demonstrates incomplete metamorphosis, where the insect goes through egg, multiple nymph stages, and adult phases without a pupal stage like butterflies have.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Life Cycles and Metamorphosis**: Cicadas undergo incomplete metamorphosis with three main stages - egg, nymph (with multiple molts), and adult. Unlike complete metamorphosis, there is no pupal stage.\n\n2. **Adaptation and Survival Strategies**: Cicadas have evolved unique timing mechanisms, with some species emerging every 13 or 17 years in massive synchronized events to overwhelm predators and ensure species survival.\n\n3. **Habitat and Ecological Relationships**: Adult cicadas live in trees where they mate and lay eggs, while nymphs live underground feeding on tree root fluids, demonstrating different habitat needs within one life cycle.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use a KWL chart (Know, Want to know, Learned) at the beginning of your cicada lesson to activate prior knowledge and address student misconceptions about \"bugs\" versus insects.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n4. **Structure and Function**: The cicada's large eyes help detect predators and mates, while their strong legs are adapted for gripping tree bark and their specialized mouthparts are designed for drinking plant fluids.\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to explore cicada sounds by playing audio recordings, having students create their own \"cicada calls\" with instruments, and showing vibration demonstrations to support auditory learners and students with hearing differences.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In**: At the cellular level, cicadas produce their famous loud calls through specialized structures called tymbals - ribbed membranes that buckle rapidly when muscles contract, creating sound vibrations that can reach 120 decibels.\n\n2. **Zoom Out**: Cicada emergences play crucial roles in forest ecosystems by providing massive food sources for birds, mammals, and other predators, while their underground nymphs aerate soil and their egg-laying creates pruning effects that stimulate new plant growth.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: \"Cicadas are the same as locusts and they eat crops.\"\n   **Reality**: Cicadas are completely different insects from locusts. Cicadas only drink plant fluids and don't damage crops, while locusts are grasshoppers that can destroy vegetation.\n\n2. **Misconception**: \"All cicadas come out every 17 years.\"\n   **Reality**: Only certain species are periodical cicadas (13 or 17-year cycles). Many cicada species are annual, with some adults emerging every year.\n\n3. **Misconception**: \"Cicadas bite or sting people.\"\n   **Reality**: Cicadas cannot bite or sting humans. They have specialized mouthparts only for drinking plant fluids and are harmless to people.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation**: 3-LS1-1 - Develop models to describe that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but all have in common birth, growth, reproduction, and death.\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS1.B]] - Growth and Development of Organisms\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.B]] - Natural Selection  \n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]]\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. \"What advantages might cicadas gain from spending most of their lives underground?\" (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n2. \"How do you think the cicada's body parts help it survive in its environment?\" (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n3. \"Why might cicadas emerge in huge numbers all at the same time instead of just a few at a time?\" (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. \"What patterns do you notice in the cicada's life cycle compared to other insects we've studied?\" (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Metamorphosis:** The process of changing from one life stage to another as an animal grows up.\n* **Nymph:** A young insect that looks similar to the adult but doesn't have wings yet.\n* **Molt:** When an animal sheds its old outer covering to grow bigger.\n* **Emerge:** To come out from underground or from hiding.\n* **Adaptation:** A special feature that helps an animal survive in its environment.\n* **Life cycle:** All the stages an animal goes through from birth to death.\n\n## 🔗 Cross-Curricular Ideas\n\n1. **Math - Data Collection and Graphing**: Have students collect data about cicada emergence patterns by researching when cicadas emerge in different years.

    "grade5": "## 📸 Photo Description\n\nA large cicada with golden-brown coloring sits on a tree branch surrounded by colorful autumn leaves. The insect has clear, veined wings and large eyes that help it see predators. You can observe the cicada's strong legs that help it grip onto tree bark and branches.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image captures the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of cicada emergence and survival behavior. Cicadas spend most of their lives underground as nymphs, feeding on tree root fluids for 13 or 17 years depending on the species. When soil temperatures reach exactly 64°F, they emerge simultaneously in massive numbers, molt into adults, and climb trees to mate and lay eggs. This synchronized emergence is a survival strategy called \"predator satiation\" - by appearing in huge numbers all at once, most cicadas survive even though predators eat many of them.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Life Cycles and Metamorphosis**: Cicadas undergo incomplete metamorphosis with three stages - egg, nymph, and adult - spending most of their lives in the underground nymph stage.\n\n2. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Synchronized emergence in massive numbers overwhelms predators, ensuring species survival through a strategy called predator satiation.\n\n3. **Physical Adaptations**: Large compound eyes for detecting movement, strong claws for gripping surfaces, and specialized wing structures for producing loud mating calls.\n\n4. **Ecosystem Interactions**: Cicadas serve as both herbivores (feeding on plant roots) and prey species, transferring nutrients from underground root systems to above-ground food webs.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"Think-Pair-Share\" strategy when introducing cicada life cycles. Have students first think individually about what they know about insects that live underground, then pair up to discuss their ideas, and finally share with the whole class. This builds on prior knowledge while introducing new concepts.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to represent their understanding of cicada adaptations - they can draw and label diagrams, create clay models, act out behaviors, or write descriptive paragraphs. This supports different learning preferences and abilities.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In**: At the cellular level, specialized cells in cicada wing muscles contract rapidly to create vibrations that produce their characteristic loud calls. These muscle cells can contract up to 400 times per second, making cicadas some of the loudest insects on Earth.\n\n2. **Zoom Out**: Cicada emergences affect entire forest ecosystems by providing massive amounts of protein to birds, mammals, reptiles, and other insects. Their tunneling activities also aerate soil and their decomposing bodies add nitrogen and other nutrients to forest soils.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: \"Cicadas are the same as locusts and will eat all the plants.\"\n   **Clarification**: Cicadas are not locusts and do not eat leaves or crops. Adult cicadas barely eat at all, only sipping small amounts of tree sap.\n\n2. **Misconception**: \"Cicadas come out every summer like other bugs.\"\n   **Clarification**: Most cicada species have 13 or 17-year life cycles and emerge only during specific years, not annually.\n\n3. **Misconception**: \"The loud buzzing sound means cicadas are angry or dangerous.\"\n   **Clarification**: Male cicadas make loud calls to attract mates for reproduction, not as a warning or threat. Cicadas cannot bite or sting humans.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation**: 5-LS2-1 - Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS1.A]] - Structure and Function, [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS2.A]] - Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]], [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]], [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]]\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. \"How do you think spending 17 years underground helps cicadas survive as a species?\" (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n2. \"What patterns do you notice in when and how cicadas emerge from the ground?\" (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. \"If climate change causes soil to warm up earlier each year, how might this affect cicada populations?\" (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 4)\n\n4. \"What evidence from the photo shows how this cicada is adapted to live in trees?\" (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Emergence**: When cicadas come out of the ground all at the same time after many years underground.\n* **Nymph**: The young form of a cicada that lives underground and looks different from the adult.\n* **Adaptation**: A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment.\n* **Predator satiation**: A survival strategy where so many animals appear at once that predators cannot eat them all.\n* **Synchronous**: Happening at exactly the same time across a large area.\n* **Compound eyes**: Eyes made of many small parts that help insects see movement and light.\n\n## 🔗 Cross-Curricular Ideas\n\n1. **Math - Data Analysis**: Create a bar graph showing the number of years different cicada species spend underground (13 years vs. 17 years). Students can calculate how many days that equals and compare it to their own age. They could also estimate how many cicadas emerge in a given area based on sample counts.\n\n2. **ELA - Informative Writing**: Have students write an explanatory paragraph from the perspective of a cicada nymph describing what happens during its 17 years underground. They should use sensory details and sequence words to describe the journey from egg to emergence. This builds narrative writing skills while reinforcing scientific understanding.\n\n3. **Art - Nature Illustration**: Students create detailed colored-pencil or watercolor drawings of cicadas in their natural habitat, paying close attention to the wing vein patterns, body segments, and colors visible in the photo.
