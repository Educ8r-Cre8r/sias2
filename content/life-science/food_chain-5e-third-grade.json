ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the lizard in its soil habitat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the photograph (large enough for class to see clearly)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the image so all students can see the lizard clearly among the soil and leaf litter. Do not label or explain anything yet.\n\n2. **First Impressions:** Ask students to turn to a neighbor and describe what they see in the picture without naming it. (\"What do you notice? What is that animal doing?\")\n\n3. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the animal you found?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this animal is so hard to spot? What helps it hide?\"\n   - \"What is this animal's home like? What does it need to survive here?\"\n   - \"If this lizard lived in a bright, sandy desert instead, would it look the same way? Why or why not?\"\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Scientists call this animal's hiding colors 'camouflage.' Do you think this lizard was always this color, or did it change to match where it lives? Turn and talk to a partner about your ideas.\"\n\n5. **Record Ideas:** Write student predictions on chart paper under the heading \"What We Wonder About Lizards.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become lizard detectives! We'll explore how animals get their special traits and how those traits help them survive in the places where they live.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how organism traits connect to habitat survival through hands-on exploration and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small containers or trays (6-8)\n- Soil samples, leaf litter, small twigs, and rocks (collected beforehand or purchased)\n- Colored paper or cardstock in various colors: brown, green, gray, bright red, bright blue, white, yellow\n- Scissors\n- Timer or clock\n- Clipboard and pencil for each student\n- Small figurine lizards or paper cutouts of lizards in different colors (optional enhancement)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup:** Divide students into pairs or small groups. Provide each group with a tray containing soil, leaves, twigs, and rocks arranged naturally. Place the tray on a table or desk where students can work comfortably.\n\n2. **Create \"Organism Traits\":** Give each pair scissors and colored paper squares (about 2 inches × 2 inches). Explain: \"You're going to create paper lizards in different colors to test how camouflage works. Cut out or fold a shape that looks like a small lizard in your color.\"\n\n3. **Hide-and-Seek Investigation:**\n   - Assign each group a specific color to hide in their tray (or use multiple colors in rotation).\n   - Have the first group place their colored lizard shape into the tray and hide it among the soil and leaves.\n   - Other groups look at the tray for 10 seconds and try to spot the lizard.\n   - Record: How many students could spot it? Was it easy or hard?\n   - Remove the lizard and repeat with different colors.\n\n4. **Documentation:** Students record on a simple chart:\n   - Color tested: _____\n   - How many students spotted it? _____\n   - Was this color easy or hard to see in the soil habitat? _____\n   - Why do you think? _____\n\n5. **Observation Focus:** Ask students: \"Which colors disappeared best in the soil? Which colors stood out? Why do you think that is?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups and ask clarifying questions: \"Why do you think the brown lizard blended in better than the red one?\"\n- Guide observations without providing answers.\n- Ensure fair testing (same hiding time, same lighting conditions).\n- Help students notice patterns in their data.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that colors matching the habitat (brown, gray, tan) are harder to see than bright colors (red, blue, yellow).\n- Students begin to connect the idea that an organism's appearance affects its chances of survival.\n- Students record observations showing evidence of camouflage effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration; connect observations to survival advantages.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Large poster or printed images showing examples of camouflage in different habitats\n- Student science journals or worksheet with vocabulary and definitions\n- Photograph of the lizard (displayed again for reference)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Out:** Ask each group: \"What did you discover about which colors helped the lizard hide? What evidence did you collect?\" Record responses on chart paper titled \"What We Discovered About Hiding.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary:** Using the photograph and student discoveries, introduce and define these terms with student-friendly language:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Camouflage:** Colors and patterns on an animal's body that help it blend in with its surroundings so predators or prey cannot see it easily.\n   - **Adaptation:** A special trait (like color, shape, or behavior) that an animal has that helps it survive in its habitat.\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, shelter, and other things it needs.\n   - **Trait:** A characteristic or feature of an animal, such as color, size, or body shape.\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n\n3. **Make Connections:** Point to the photograph and explain: \"This lizard has brown and gray colors because its parents passed these traits down to it. These colors are an adaptation that helps it survive in this soil and leaf habitat because predators have a harder time seeing it. If this same lizard lived on white sand, it might not hide as well. The environment influences whether a trait is helpful or not.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:** Ask students:\n   - \"What is camouflage? Can you give an example from our activity?\"\n   - \"Why is the brown color an adaptation for this lizard? How does it help?\"\n   - \"Do you think all lizards have the same color? Why or why not?\" (Leads to discussion of trait variation.)\n\n5. **Connect Back to Photograph:** \"The lizard in our picture has these brown and gray colors because of where it lives. This is an example of how traits and environment work together to help animals survive.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define camouflage and adaptation using evidence from their exploration.\n- Students understand that certain traits are advantageous in specific habitats.\n- Students recognize that environment influences which traits help an organism survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by analyzing multiple organisms and habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or printed images of different lizards in different habitats (desert, forest, rocky area, sandy beach)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Large poster board or chart paper\n- Scenario cards with descriptions of different habitats\n- Student worksheet: \"Which Lizard Belongs Here?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Habitat-Trait Matching Challenge:** Display images of 4-5 different lizards with different color patterns (green, bright red, spotted white and gray, sand-colored). Also display images or descriptions of different habitats (green forest floor, red rocks, sandy desert, wet leaf litter).\n\n2. **Guided Matching:** Ask students: \"Which lizard would survive best in which habitat? Why?\" Work through one example as a whole class:\n   - \"This green lizard has green coloring. Where would it hide best?\"\n   - \"This sandy-colored lizard has tan and brown spots. Which habitat would be a good home?\"\n   - \"Why do different lizards have different colors?\"\n\n3. **Small Group Application:** Provide each group a scenario card describing a specific habitat (e.g., \"You are exploring a rocky canyon with gray and brown rocks and dirt\"). Groups discuss and draw or describe:\n   - What colors and traits would help a lizard survive here?\n   - What colors would NOT help?\n   - Why is this adaptation helpful?\n\n4. **Create a Survival Argument:** Students complete a sentence frame:\n   - \"A lizard with [color/trait] would survive well in [habitat] because ___________.\"\n   - \"A lizard with [color/trait] would NOT survive well there because ___________.\"\n\n5. **Gallery Walk (if time permits):** Display group work and have students observe how different groups connected traits to habitats.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask probing questions: \"How does the lizard's color help it survive in this habitat?\"\n- Guide students to use evidence from their Explore activity.\n- Encourage students to think about what happens if a trait doesn't match the environment.\n- Support reasoning with follow-up questions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students match organism traits to specific habitats with reasoning.\n- Students provide evidence-based explanations for why certain traits are advantageous.\n- Students recognize that the same trait might help in one habitat but not another.\n- Students construct simple arguments connecting adaptation, habitat, and survival.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how organism traits relate to habitat survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n- Observe during Explore phase: Are students able to recognize patterns in their hide-and-seek data? Can they explain why certain colors hide better?\n- Listen during Explain phase: Do students use new vocabulary correctly when describing the lizard's camouflage?\n- Monitor during Elaborate phase: Are students making logical connections between traits and habitat survival?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (printed or written on an index card) with the following prompts:\n\n1. **Observation Question:** \"Look at this picture of a lizard. What color is it? What is it hiding in?\"\n\n2. **Explanation Question:** \"Why is this lizard's color a good adaptation for where it lives? Use the word 'camouflage' in your answer.\"\n\n3. **Application Question:** \"Imagine a bright green lizard in this same soil habitat. Would it be a good adaptation? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Sample Acceptable Responses:**\n- 1: Student identifies the color (brown, gray, tan) and habitat (soil, leaves, dirt).\n- 2: Student explains the color matches the habitat, making it hard to see (camouflage), which helps it hide from predators or hunt prey without being seen.\n- 3: Student states that a green lizard would NOT be a good adaptation because it would stand out against the brown soil and be easy to spot.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students accurately identify the lizard's characteristics.\n- Students explain at least one way the trait helps survival.\n- Students apply the concept to a new scenario (green lizard in soil habitat).\n- Students use evidence-based reasoning (references to what they observed).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students (70%+) will correctly identify camouflage and connect it to survival advantage.\n- Students will provide reasoning that references the habitat or predator/prey relationship.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that traits must match the environment to be helpful.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Hide-and-Seek:** Reduce the number of colors tested to 3 (brown, green, bright red). Provide a data sheet with pictures and checkboxes instead of writing sentences.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Support:** Create a small reference card with pictures and one-word definitions for camouflage, adaptation, and habitat. Allow students to reference this during the exit ticket.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames:** Provide sentence starters for explanations:\n   - \"This lizard is _____ colored because _____.\"\n   - \"The color helps it survive by _____.\"\n   - \"A _____ lizard would NOT work here because _____.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extend the Concept:** Ask: \"What other adaptations besides color might help this lizard survive? (Consider body shape, size, texture, behavior.) How might the environment have influenced these traits?\" Have them research or sketch additional adaptations.\n\n2. **Comparative Habitat Analysis:** Provide images of multiple lizard species in their actual habitats (chameleon in leaves, horned lizard in desert, blue-tailed lizard in rocky areas). Challenge students to explain why each species looks different based on its environment.\n\n3. **Create a Habitat:** Challenge students to design a new habitat for a lizard with specific traits. They must explain why their design matches the lizard's adaptations and how that helps it survive.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Camouflage Hunt Outdoors:** Take students outside or to a designated area to search for naturally camouflaged organisms (insects, spiders, small animals, plants with protective coloring). Document findings with photos or sketches and discuss why each organism blends in with its environment.\n\n2. **Design Your Own Lizard:** Provide students with outline drawings or paper cutouts of lizards. Have them color and pattern their lizard for a specific habitat (desert, forest, rocky mountain, wetland) and write a short explanation of their design choices. Display as a class gallery with habitat labels.\n\n3. **Life Cycle Connection:** Extend learning by researching and creating a poster about the complete life cycle of a lizard (egg, hatchling, juvenile, adult). Discuss how traits change through growth stages and how environmental factors (temperature, humidity, food availability) influence development. This connects 3-LS1-1 (life cycles) and 3-LS3-2 (environmental influence on traits).\n\n---",
