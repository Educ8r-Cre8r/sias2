Observe and describe what a caterpillar and chrysalis look like using colors and textures they can see.\n2. Explain that caterpillars eat plants and change into butterflies as they grow.\n3. Identify that caterpillars and chrysalises need safe places to live and grow.\n4. Use pictures or drawings to show the stages of a butterfly's life (caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly).\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the monarch caterpillar and chrysalis\n- Chart paper and markers\n- A real caterpillar in a clear container (optional, if available; otherwise, use the photo)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or as a printed poster where all students can see clearly. Point to the striped caterpillar first.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What colors and stripes do you notice?\"\n   - \"Do you think this stripey thing is alive? What makes you think so?\"\n   - \"What do you think it eats?\" (Listen for student ideas—many will guess leaves!)\n   - \"Look at this other thing next to it—it's white and shaped like a tiny bag. What could it be? Is it alive too?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Say: \"I wonder what happens to the stripey caterpillar inside that white bag. Do you think it stays a caterpillar forever, or does something magical happen?\"\n\n4. **Document curiosity:** Write student predictions and questions on chart paper. Read them back so students hear their own ideas valued.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to discover the secret of what happens to these amazing caterpillars—and why they need special places to hide while they change!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Playdough (green, yellow, orange, black) or modeling clay\n- Construction paper (green and white)\n- Pipe cleaners (black)\n- Small plastic container or cup with a piece of paper towel\n- Real milkweed leaf (or printed picture of milkweed leaf)\n- Picture cards showing: caterpillar eating a leaf, chrysalis hanging, butterfly emerging (sequence cards)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Build a caterpillar:** Give each student a handful of green or yellow playdough and three pipe cleaners.\n   - Students roll the playdough into a caterpillar shape (bumpy, long body).\n   - They add two pipe cleaners as antennae and one as a tail.\n   - They can make stripes with a toothpick or their finger (copying the stripes they saw in the photo).\n\n2. **Create a chrysalis:** Students wrap their playdough caterpillar in a small piece of white construction paper or tissue paper, creating a protective \"case.\"\n\n3. **Build a habitat:** Give each student a small container. They place their chrysalis inside and decorate a \"leaf\" from green construction paper to place next to it—this is where the caterpillar found food.\n\n4. **Sequence the stages:** Lay out the picture cards in order. Students physically arrange their models from caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly (teacher has butterfly pictures available), walking through the transformation.\n\n5. **Record observations:** Students draw or mark checkboxes on a simple worksheet:\n   - ☐ I made a striped caterpillar.\n   - ☐ I wrapped it in a protective case (chrysalis).\n   - ☐ I showed where it gets food (a leaf).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"Tell me about your caterpillar's stripes. What do you think they do?\" or \"Why do you think the chrysalis looks like a little bag?\"\n- Do NOT say \"That's not right.\" Instead, say: \"That's one idea! Let's look at the photo again. What do you notice?\"\n- Help students who struggle with fine motor tasks by pre-rolling playdough or providing pre-cut shapes.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce a 3D model showing a caterpillar with stripes, a chrysalis (covered), and connection to food (leaf).\n- Students engage in peer sharing: \"Look, my caterpillar has yellow stripes like the one in the picture!\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled diagram (drawn by teacher beforehand)\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Picture sequence strip (caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly)\n- Real or stuffed toy butterfly (optional, for handling)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 3-4 volunteers to show their models and explain one thing about them. Affirm each contribution.\n\n2. **Introduce the life cycle story:**\n   - \"Let me tell you the story of this special caterpillar.\" Point to the photograph.\n   - \"This stripey creature is called a **caterpillar**. It was born from an egg laid on a milkweed plant.\"\n   - \"The caterpillar's job is to EAT, EAT, EAT the leaves. That's why it needs to live on the plant—it's like a grocery store!\"\n   - \"Then one day, the caterpillar spins a special home called a **chrysalis** (say it together: KRIS-uh-lis). Inside the chrysalis, something amazing happens—the caterpillar changes into something completely new!\"\n   - \"After a few weeks, the chrysalis opens, and out comes a **butterfly**! A butterfly doesn't eat leaves like a caterpillar. Instead, it drinks sweet juice called nectar from flowers.\"\n\n3. **Display the sequence:** Show pictures in order while telling the story again. Have students point and repeat: \"Caterpillar... chrysalis... butterfly!\"\n\n4. **Connect to needs for survival:** Ask: \"What did the caterpillar need to survive? Yes—leaves to eat! What about the chrysalis? Did it need anything?\" Guide students to see it needs shelter/protection and a safe place to stay.\n\n5. **Check for understanding:** Play \"True or False\":\n   - \"A caterpillar eats flowers.\" (False—it eats leaves!)\n   - \"A chrysalis is a house for the caterpillar while it changes.\" (True!)\n   - \"The butterfly looks just like the caterpillar.\" (False—it's completely different!)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Caterpillar** | A small, long animal with a striped body that eats leaves and grows very fast. |\n| **Chrysalis** | A hard, protective shell or house where a caterpillar goes to rest and change into a butterfly. It looks like a little teardrop or bag. |\n| **Butterfly** | A beautiful flying insect with four big wings, a thin body, and long feelers. Butterflies drink sweet juice from flowers. |\n| **Life cycle** | The stages a living thing goes through as it grows: starting as a baby, growing up, and becoming an adult. |\n| **Milkweed** | A plant that monarch caterpillars eat. It's their favorite food! |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the three main stages: caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly.\n- Students understand that the caterpillar eats leaves and changes in the chrysalis.\n- Students know butterflies look different from caterpillars.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture sequence strip (three images: caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly)\n- Blank paper divided into three boxes or a simple \"flip book\" booklet (6 pages)\n- Crayons and markers\n- Glue stick\n- Optional: green leaf cutouts to glue onto caterpillar pages\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Story Sequencing Booklet**\n\n1. Give each student a pre-made booklet (construction paper folded to make 6 pages, or three sheets stapled together).\n\n2. **Pages guide students through the story:**\n   - **Page 1:** Draw a tiny egg on a milkweed leaf. Label: \"Egg\"\n   - **Page 2:** Draw a caterpillar eating a leaf. Label: \"Caterpillar eats and grows.\"\n   - **Page 3:** Draw the caterpillar forming a chrysalis. Label: \"Chrysalis—the caterpillar changes inside.\"\n   - **Page 4:** Draw a butterfly inside or near the chrysalis. Label: \"Butterfly is born!\"\n   - **Page 5:** Draw the butterfly on a flower. Label: \"Butterfly drinks from flowers.\"\n   - **Page 6 (Back Cover):** Draw or glue the monarch butterfly photo. Title: \"The Life of a Monarch Butterfly\"\n\n3. Students color, draw details, and glue on prepared leaf cutouts to show food.\n\n4. **Read aloud protocol:** Teacher reads aloud a simple story like *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* (or a paraphrased version) while students follow along with their booklets, pointing to matching pictures.\n\n**Option B: Nature Walk & Observation (if outdoors access available)**\n\n1. Take students on a brief walk to look for milkweed plants, leaves, or insects (if it's monarch season).\n2. Students observe and point: \"Do you see a caterpillar? Do you see a plant for it to eat?\"\n3. Return and draw what they saw.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide verbal guidance for non-readers: \"First page: show the tiny egg. Draw it very small on the leaf.\"\n- Celebrate creativity: \"I love how you made that caterpillar so colorful! Does it look striped like the one in the photo?\"\n- Answer questions: If a student asks, \"How long is it a caterpillar?\" answer: \"A few weeks! Then it changes into a chrysalis.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce a sequenced booklet showing understanding of the life cycle stages.\n- Students can \"read\" their booklet to a partner or teacher, pointing to each stage.\n- Students demonstrate that they know the chrysalis is where the change happens.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of life cycle stages and what animals need to survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing, throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student engagement during Engage (Are they curious? Are they asking questions?)\n- Circulate during Explore: Can students describe their caterpillar's stripes and the chrysalis's purpose?\n- Listen to student language during Explain: Do they use the words caterpillar, chrysalis, and butterfly correctly?\n- Review sequencing booklets: Are the three stages in the correct order? Do drawings show the caterpillar eating and the chrysalis as a shelter?\n\n**Summative Exit Assessment (end of lesson or Day 3):**\n\n**Option 1: Picture Sorting** (simplest for early Kindergarten)\n- Show 6 pictures mixed up: caterpillar eating, egg, butterfly on flower, chrysalis, leaf, flower.\n- Ask: \"Point to the picture that shows the caterpillar eating. Now point to the chrysalis. Show me the butterfly.\"\n- **Success Criterion:** Student correctly identifies at least 2 of 3 stages.\n\n**Option 2: Verbal Response (for mid-to-advanced Kindergarteners)**\n- Show the original photograph.\n- Ask these three questions:\n  1. \"What is this stripey animal called? (Caterpillar) What does it eat?\" (Leaves)\n  2. \"What is this white bag next to it called? (Chrysalis) Why does the caterpillar need this?\" (To hide and change / To be safe while it changes)\n  3. \"What does the caterpillar turn into?\" (Butterfly)\n- **Success Criterion:** Student answers at least 2 questions correctly with supporting words.\n\n**Option 3: Draw & Label** (for stronger students)\n- Provide a blank page divided into three boxes.\n- Say: \"Draw the three stages of the butterfly's life. Draw the caterpillar in the first box, the chrysalis in the second, and the butterfly in the third.\"\n- Students draw; teacher or student labels with teacher support.\n- **Success Criterion:** Three stages are in correct order and recognizable.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify the caterpillar, chrysalis, and butterfly from the photograph or from pictures.\n- Students can explain that caterpillars eat leaves and live on plants.\n- Students understand that a chrysalis is a protective home where the caterpillar changes.\n- Students demonstrate the life cycle sequence (caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners or younger Kindergarteners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only caterpillar, chrysalis, and butterfly. Skip \"life cycle\" and \"milkweed\" until later.\n   \n2. **Pre-made shapes:** Provide pre-cut and pre-formed caterpillar shapes, chrysalises, and butterflies so students focus on assembly and observation rather than fine motor creation.\n   \n3. **Paired exploration:** Assign struggling students a peer partner during Explore phase. They work together to build one model, with the teacher checking in every 3 minutes to ask: \"Tell me what you made. What does the caterpillar eat?\"\n\n4. **Picture-only sequencing:** Instead of drawing their own booklet, provide a pre-printed booklet with photos. Students color one area on each page and point to and repeat the stage name.\n\n5. **Concrete objects:** If possible, show a real caterpillar or butterfly (even in a video) before asking students to draw or imagine one.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners or older Kindergarteners):\n\n1. **Deeper questioning:** Ask \"Why does the caterpillar get so big before it becomes a chrysalis?\" or \"Why do you think the chrysalis is green/brown instead of bright colors like the caterpillar?\" Guide them to think about camouflage and protection.\n\n2. **Predict and observe:** Show a chrysalis and ask: \"What do you think will happen in one week? Two weeks? How will we know when the butterfly is ready to come out?\" Have them make predictions and record with drawings.\n\n3. **Extended research booklet:** Instead of 3 pages, create a 5-6 page booklet that includes: egg stage, caterpillar eating, caterpillar growing, chrysalis, butterfly emerging, butterfly flying. Have students illustrate each stage with extra details (many leaves, flowers, etc.).\n\n4. **Compare two insects:** Show pictures of a caterpillar vs. a butterfly and ask students to list how they are different in a Venn diagram (teacher draws, students dictate). Example: Caterpillar has stripes, butterfly has big wings.\n\n5. **Role-play:** Advanced students can act out the life cycle stages or create a short puppet show using hand puppets of a caterpillar and butterfly.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Monarch Migration Map Activity (Follow-Up Lesson)**\n   - Monarch butterflies fly to Mexico in fall. Show a simple map with North America and Mexico highlighted.\n   - Use a butterfly cutout and tape to move it across the map. Ask: \"Why would a butterfly need to fly so far? What does it need?\" (Warmth, flowers, food)\n   - Students color a map and draw butterflies flying south.\n   - **Connection to NGSS K-LS1-1:** Observing that animals need certain conditions to survive (warm places, food sources).\n\n2. **Plant Milkweed at School (Real Application)**\n   - If your school has a garden space, plant milkweed seedlings in spring.\n   - Students water and observe the plants over time.\n   - Check for monarch eggs or caterpillars in summer/early fall.\n   - Document with photos: \"This is where our caterpillars eat!\"\n   - **Connection:** Students see real caterpillars eating real plants—direct observation of life cycle.\n\n3. **Butterfly vs. Moth Sorting Game (Comparative Learning)**\n   - Provide picture cards of butterflies and moths (looks similar but different).\n   - Students sort by similarities and differences.\n   - Teacher reveals: \"Both start as caterpillars! But caterpillars that eat different plants might become moths instead.\"\n   - This deepens understanding that different animals have different life cycles but follow patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Photography connection:** Return to the original photograph throughout the lesson. Each phase should reference it: \"Remember the caterpillar we saw in the picture?\"\n- **Read-aloud recommendation:** Pair this lesson with *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* by Eric Carle for Elaborate phase—it visually reinforces the life cycle.\n- **Timing flexibility:** If your class needs more time on Explore (playdough/model building), extend to two sessions. Combine Explain and Elaborate into a single session if needed.\n- **Vocabulary retention:** Create a simple classroom anchor chart showing the three stages with pictures. Leave it up for weeks so students internalize the concept.\n- **Safe handling:** If using a real caterpillar, ensure students know: gentle hands, don't squeeze, observe only unless the teacher says it's okay to touch.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson centers on direct observation of the photograph while meeting K-LS1-1 by having students describe patterns (the stages of the monarch butterfly) and identifying what the organism needs to survive (food, shelter, a safe place to change).",
