Identify external structures (like color and pattern) that help animals survive in their habitats.\n2. Explain how camouflage works as an adaptation that helps animals hide from predators or prey.\n3. Describe how animals use their senses to find other animals, even when they are camouflaged.\n4. Apply their understanding of camouflage by creating and testing their own camouflaged objects.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the camouflaged lizard on rocky/sandy ground (8.5\" x 11\" or larger, color)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Document camera or projector (optional, for display)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display & Introduction:** Project or hold up the photograph. Say: \"There is a hidden animal in this picture. Your job is to find it! Look carefully for 30 seconds, and then we'll talk about what you notice.\"\n\n2. **Directed Observation:** Allow students 30-60 seconds of silent looking time. Then ask:\n\n   - **Discussion Question 1:** \"Did anyone find the animal? What does it look like? How did it hide so well?\"\n   - **Discussion Question 2:** \"Why do you think an animal would want to hide like this? What could be hunting it?\"\n   - **Discussion Question 3:** \"What colors and patterns do you see in the background? How are they the same as or different from the animal?\"\n   - **Discussion Question 4:** \"If you were an animal that lived here, what color would help you stay safe?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Write on chart paper: \"I wonder why some animals blend in with their surroundings...\" Encourage students to complete the sentence with partners. Share 2-3 responses aloud.\n\n4. **Reveal the Answer:** Once students have searched, reveal where the lizard(s) are and point it out. Express genuine excitement: \"This is called **camouflage**, and today we're going to discover how it works!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now that you've found the hidden animal, let's investigate why animals are colored and patterned the way they are.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- One sheet of colored paper or poster board in a natural pattern (tan, brown, gray, or with speckled/mottled texture)\n- Scissors\n- Small objects to hide: pasta shapes, pom-poms, or beads in 3-4 different colors (at least 5-6 of each color)\n- A small container or cup\n- Paper towel or cloth (for covering)\n- Recording sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and post visually):**\n\n1. **Choose a Background:** Each group gets one sheet of colored or patterned paper. This is your \"habitat.\"\n\n2. **Predict:** Before you start, write or draw on your recording sheet: \"What color objects do you think will be easiest to hide on this paper? Why?\"\n\n3. **Hide the Objects:** \n   - Scatter your small objects (pasta, pom-poms, beads) across your paper habitat.\n   - Mix colors—put some objects that match the paper color and some that don't.\n   - Spread them out so they're visible but slightly tucked under paper edges or into texture.\n\n4. **Test the Camouflage:**\n   - Trade habitats with another group.\n   - Set a timer for 1 minute.\n   - Without touching the paper, count how many objects YOU can spot in 1 minute. Write the number on the recording sheet.\n   - Do this separately for each color if possible (e.g., \"I found 5 red objects, 2 blue objects\").\n\n5. **Discover Patterns:**\n   - Return your habitat to the original group.\n   - Look at your recording sheet. Which colors were found the most? Which were hidden best?\n   - Write: \"The objects that matched the paper color were harder to find because...\"\n\n**Recording Sheet (simple template students complete):**\n```\nCamouflage Investigation Record\n\nGroup Name: _______________\n\nOur habitat color/pattern: _______________________\n\nPREDICTION: What colors will hide best?\n_________________________________________________\n\nRESULTS: How many objects we found:\nRed: _____  Blue: _____  Green: _____  Yellow: _____\n\nWhich color was HARDEST to find? ________________\n\nWhy do you think that color was hardest to see?\n_________________________________________________\n```\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups. Listen for student thinking rather than correcting.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Why do you think you couldn't find that one?\" or \"What does the background look like?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answer; let them discover that matching colors = better camouflage.\n- Help manage materials and time, but allow students to drive the investigation.\n- Encourage groups to share observations with each other: \"Tell the other group what you found.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that objects matching the background color are harder to find.\n- Students will begin to connect color/pattern to survival (\"It hides from the predator\").\n- Groups will have a recorded comparison showing which colors blended in best.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The original photograph of the camouflaged lizard\n- Picture of the same lizard species in a contrasting environment (e.g., on green grass or a bright rock) if available, OR a simple colored drawing\n- Vocabulary anchor chart (poster or digital display)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups: \"What did you discover? Which colors were the best at hiding?\"\n   - Record responses on chart paper.\n   - Listen for students using words like \"blend,\" \"match,\" \"same color,\" \"hard to see,\" etc. Celebrate this language.\n\n2. **Introduce Formal Concepts (10 minutes):**\n   \n   Display the original photograph again. Say:\n   \n   > \"You just discovered something that this animal has been using for thousands of years! The lizard in this picture is brown, tan, and speckled—just like the rocks and sand around it. This is called **camouflage**. It's a special adaptation that helps animals survive.\"\n\n   Explain using student-friendly language:\n   \n   - **What is an adaptation?** \"A special feature of an animal's body or behavior that helps it survive in its home.\"\n   - **How does camouflage work?** \"When an animal's color and pattern match its habitat, predators can't see it easily. This keeps the animal safe.\"\n   - **Why is camouflage important?** \"If a predator can't see you, it can't hunt you. If prey can't see you, you can hunt them. Camouflage helps animals survive!\"\n\n3. **Make the Connection (5 minutes):**\n   - Point back to their Explore activity: \"The pasta that matched the paper? That's like camouflage. It was harder to see, just like the lizard is harder to see in the rocks.\"\n   - If you have a second image of the same lizard species in a different habitat, show it: \"What if this lizard lived on bright green grass? Would its brown color still work?\" (Guide students to say \"No—it would be easy to see.\")\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can you show me with your hands how a predator's eyes might move across this habitat trying to spot the lizard?\" (Mime scanning the photo.)\n   - Pose: \"If you were a hungry hawk looking for a lizard on these rocks, why might you have a hard time finding it?\" (Listen for: \"It matches,\" \"same color,\" \"blends in.\")\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|------|\n| **Camouflage** | When an animal's color, pattern, or shape matches its surroundings so it's hard to see. |\n| **Adaptation** | A special feature of an animal's body or the way it acts that helps it survive in its home. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives, with the rocks, plants, water, and weather it needs. |\n| **Predator** | An animal that hunts other animals for food. |\n| **Prey** | An animal that is hunted by other animals for food. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define camouflage in their own words.\n- Students understand that camouflage is an adaptation that helps survival.\n- Students can connect their Explore activity to real animals.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of 4-6 animals with camouflage (printed or projected):\n  - Stick insect on a branch\n  - Snow hare in snow\n  - Deer in forest\n  - Crab on sandy bottom\n  - Frog in foliage\n  - Moth on tree bark\n- Large chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Optional: student drawing paper and colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**\"Camouflage in the Wild\" Analysis:**\n\n1. **Introduce the Task (2 minutes):**\n   > \"We found camouflage in rocks and sand. But camouflage happens all over the world! Let's look at real animals and figure out how their colors help them survive.\"\n\n2. **Examine Images Together (8-10 minutes):**\n   - Show one animal image at a time. For each, ask:\n     - \"Where does this animal live?\" (habitat)\n     - \"What colors and patterns do you see on the animal?\"\n     - \"What colors and patterns do you see in its habitat?\"\n     - \"How does the animal's color help it stay safe or hunt?\"\n   - Create a chart:\n\n   | Animal | Habitat | Colors/Patterns | How It Helps |\n   |--------|---------|-----------------|--------------|\n   | Stick Insect | Tree branch | Brown, straight shape | Looks like a twig—predators don't see it |\n   | Snow Hare | Snowy forest | White fur | Blends with snow—hard to spot |\n   | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n3. **Student Application (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Assign each pair or small group one animal from the images.\n   - Ask: \"Draw or describe how your animal uses camouflage to survive. Include: What does it look like? Where does it live? How does its color/pattern help?\"\n   - Students can draw on paper or write 2-3 sentences explaining the connection.\n\n4. **Share Out (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to show or read their explanations.\n   - Affirm: \"You're thinking like animal scientists!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to notice details: \"Look closely at the color of that insect compared to the branch.\"\n- If students struggle, prompt: \"What color would make this animal easiest to see? What color makes it hard to see? Why?\"\n- Celebrate connections to their Explore activity: \"Remember when you couldn't find the red pasta on the tan paper? This is the same idea!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain camouflage in multiple habitats, not just the original photo.\n- Students understand that different animals need different camouflage for their specific habitats.\n- Students can draw or describe the relationship between an animal's appearance and its survival.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist** (use during Explore and Elaborate):\n  - ☐ Student identifies that matching colors are harder to find.\n  - ☐ Student explains why camouflage helps animals survive.\n  - ☐ Student can point out color/pattern matches between animals and habitats.\n  - ☐ Student uses vocabulary (camouflage, habitat, adaptation) appropriately in discussion.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes, end of Day 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple one-page exit ticket. Read questions aloud; students can draw, write, or dictate responses:\n\n---\n\n**CAMOUFLAGE DETECTIVES EXIT TICKET**\n\n**Name: ________________________   Date: ____________**\n\n**Question 1:** What is camouflage? (Draw it or write 1-2 sentences.)\n\n*What I'm looking for:* Student mentions blending in, matching colors, or hiding.\n\n**Question 2:** Look at this picture [provide a new image of an animal in a habitat]. How does this animal's color help it survive?\n\n*What I'm looking for:* Student identifies that the animal's color matches or blends with the background.\n\n**Question 3:** Why is camouflage an important adaptation for animals?\n\n*What I'm looking for:* Student mentions safety from predators, hunting prey, or survival.\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Proficient:** Student correctly answers at least 2 of 3 questions, using or demonstrating understanding of camouflage concepts.\n- **Approaching:** Student answers 1-2 questions with partial understanding (may confuse camouflage with color in general; may understand hiding but not why).\n- **Developing:** Student struggles to define camouflage or explain its purpose; requires additional support.\n\n**Addressing Exit Ticket Results:**\n- **If proficient:** Celebrate! Move to challenge activities.\n- **If approaching/developing:** Plan a quick 1-on-1 or small-group review using the original photograph and a concrete object-hiding activity.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that camouflage is an external structure (color/pattern) that helps animals survive.\n- Students can explain the relationship between an animal's appearance and its habitat.\n- Students recognize camouflage as an adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Explore Activity:**\n   - Reduce the number of colors to 2 (one matching, one contrasting).\n   - Use larger objects (pasta instead of small beads) for easier counting.\n   - Provide a sentence frame on the recording sheet: \"The _____ color was easier to hide because it matched the _____.\"\n\n2. **Paired Explanation:**\n   - Pair struggling readers/listeners with a stronger partner during the Explain phase.\n   - Provide a vocabulary visual anchor with pictures alongside each term (e.g., photo of a camouflaged animal next to the word \"camouflage\").\n\n3. **Guided Questions During Elaborate:**\n   - Instead of open-ended analysis, provide specific prompts: \"This animal is brown. Is the tree brown? How does this help the animal?\"\n   - Use a graphic organizer with picture-based categories (animal picture → habitat picture → how it matches).\n\n#### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Adaptive Variation Research:**\n   - Assign students to research why animals of the same species might have *different* colors in different geographic locations (e.g., snowshoe hares: white in snowy regions, brown in temperate forests).\n   - Have them create a poster or presentation: \"Camouflage Across Climates.\"\n\n2. **Design a New Camouflaged Animal:**\n   - Ask: \"Invent a habitat (rainforest, desert, ocean). What would an animal living there look like to be camouflaged? Draw and label its colors, patterns, and explain why it would work.\"\n   - Extend: \"What predators or prey would it have? How would they look different?\"\n\n3. **Camouflage Vs. Other Adaptations:**\n   - Introduce the concept of other survival adaptations (speed, spines, poison).\n   - Have advanced students research and create a comparison chart: \"Camouflage vs. Other Adaptations: Which animals use which, and why?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Camouflage Hunt\" Field Activity (20-30 minutes, outdoor or classroom):**\n   - Hide small, colored objects (buttons, paper squares) throughout a classroom corner or outdoor space.\n   - Ask students to \"collect prey\" by spotting objects (easier-to-see colors) vs. \"camouflaged prey\" (harder-to-spot colors).\n   - Debrief: \"Which colors did predators (you) find first? Why? What does this tell us about real animals?\"\n   - Connects to sensory information processing (4-LS1-2): students use sight to search, process what they see, and decide how to respond (searching, collecting).\n\n2. **Camouflage Pattern Design & Testing (homework or extended lesson):**\n   - Send students home with a small piece of patterned or colored paper and a challenge: \"Design your own camouflaged animal. What does it look like? Where would it live? Bring your design back and explain how it hides.\"\n   - Or: Provide a template where students color an outlined animal to match a given habitat (e.g., \"Color this mouse to blend with a forest floor\").\n   - Follow-up: Have students test each other's designs—can a classmate easily spot the camouflaged animal? Why or why not?\n\n3. **Picture Book Exploration: \"Camouflage in Literature\":**\n   - Read aloud picture books featuring camouflage (e.g., *Where's Waldo?*, *The Very Busy Spider*, or *Animals in Camouflage* by Jo Ellen Moore).\n   - Stop and ask: \"Can you find the animal? Why is it hard to see?\"\n   - Have students create their own \"find the animal\" page using magazine cutouts or drawings, and challenge classmates to locate the hidden creature.\n   - This reinforces vocabulary and engages students who are strong visual learners.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis lesson uses the camouflaged lizard photograph as an anchor for exploring how animals' external structures (color, pattern) support survival. Through hands-on investigation, students discover that matching colors hide objects effectively, then apply this learning to real-world animals across multiple habitats. The lesson explicitly connects to both NGSS standards: students construct arguments about how external structures function for survival (4-LS1-1) and model how animals use their senses (sight) to gather information and respond to their environment (4-LS1-2).\n\nThe 5E structure ensures students first engage with curiosity, then explore through discovery, formalize their learning with vocabulary and explanation, elaborate with real-world examples, and finally evaluate their understanding. Differentiation and extensions support the full range of Fourth Grade learners while keeping the core concept—camouflage as survival adaptation—at the center of every activity.",
