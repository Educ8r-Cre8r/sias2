Identify and describe at least three physical adaptations visible on a lizard that help it survive in its environment.\n2. Explain how a specific body structure (scales, claws, eye placement, tail) helps a lizard meet its survival needs.\n3. Create a model showing how a lizard fits into a food web and impacts energy movement in an ecosystem.\n4. Compare how different animals have different adaptations suited to different habitats.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the lizard on the photograph (large, clear display)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: printed copies of the photograph (one per student or pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** large on the screen or document camera. Have students observe silently for 30 seconds, then tell them: *\"This is a real lizard. Look carefully—what do you notice about its body?\"*\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause between questions to allow think-time):\n   - \"What body parts can you see on this lizard? Name as many as you can.\" *(Expect: scales, tail, legs, claws, eyes, head, bumpy skin)*\n   - \"Why might a lizard need claws on its feet?\" *(Guide toward: climbing, gripping, catching prey)*\n   - \"Look at the lizard's colors and bumpy texture. Why do you think it looks like that?\" *(Guide toward: hiding from predators, matching tree bark)*\n   - \"If you were a lizard, what would be the hardest thing about surviving in nature?\" *(Expect: finding food, not being eaten, staying warm/cool)*\n\n3. **Record student responses** on chart paper titled \"What We Wonder About Lizards.\" Do not correct; accept all predictions.\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** *\"I think lizards have special body parts that help them survive. Let's investigate what those superpowers are.\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to become lizard scientists and discover how a lizard's body helps it stay alive.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover adaptation concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Laminated photographs of the lizard (one per pair or small group) OR printed color copies\n- Magnifying glasses (2–3 per group)\n- Bark, sandpaper, or textured surfaces (to compare to lizard skin)\n- Rulers or measuring tapes\n- Student observation sheets (see below)\n- Color pencils or markers\n- Real objects for comparison (optional): branches, leaves, clay\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs or small groups.** Distribute one photograph and a magnifying glass to each group.\n\n2. **Give explicit directions:**\n   - *\"Look very carefully at the lizard's body. Use your magnifier to see details. I want you to find and trace at least FIVE body parts that help the lizard survive.\"*\n   - *\"For each body part, ask yourself: 'Why is this important for staying alive?'\"*\n   - *\"Record your discoveries on your observation sheet by drawing or labeling the body part and writing one sentence about why it helps.\"*\n\n3. **Provide a partially completed observation sheet** (scaffold for emerging readers):\n\n   | **Body Part** | **What I See** | **Why It Helps the Lizard Survive** |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | Scales | Bumpy, textured, overlap like shingles | |\n   | Claws | | |\n   | Tail | | |\n   | Eyes | | |\n   | Legs | | |\n\n4. **Optional tactile exploration:** Provide bark or sandpaper samples. Ask: *\"Touch this bark. Then look at the lizard's skin under the magnifier. How are they similar? Why might this help?\"*\n\n5. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n   - *\"Tell me about those bumpy scales. What do they look like? What surface in nature do they remind you of?\"*\n   - *\"Why would strong claws matter to an animal that lives on a tree?\"*\n   - *\"Where are the eyes pointing? What might the lizard be watching for?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify at least 3–5 visible adaptations.\n- Students generate plausible survival explanations (may not be scientifically precise yet—that comes in Explain).\n- Groups complete observation sheets with drawings/labels and survival hypotheses.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Completed student observation sheets from Explore\n- Projected photograph\n- Optional: short video clip (2–3 minutes) on lizard adaptations from a source like PBS Kids or National Geographic Kids\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 2–3 groups to share one discovery from their observation sheet. Record key findings on new chart paper titled \"How Lizards Are Adapted to Survive.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with Fifth Grade-friendly definitions and examples from the photograph:\n\n   | **Vocabulary** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Example from Lizard** |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home | Claws for climbing trees |\n   | **Inherited trait** | A characteristic passed from parents to their babies through genes | The lizard's scale pattern and color; these came from its parents |\n   | **Camouflage** | Coloring or texture that helps an animal blend in with its surroundings so predators don't see it | The lizard's brown scales match tree bark |\n   | **Predator** | An animal that hunts and eats other animals | Snakes, birds, or larger lizards that might eat this lizard |\n   | **Prey** | An animal that is hunted and eaten by another animal | Insects that this lizard hunts and eats |\n   | **Ecosystem** | All the living things (plants, animals) and non-living things (air, soil, water) in one area, and how they interact | The tree, bark, insects, lizard, predators, and soil all together |\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph using a think-aloud:**\n   - *\"Look at this lizard's scales. They're bumpy and brown. That's not just random—those are inherited traits. The lizard's parents had similar scales, and they passed those genes to their babies. Why would that be helpful?\"* *(Guide: blends with bark, harder for predators to see)*\n   - *\"See how strong and curved those claws are? They're adaptations. They let the lizard grip the bark tightly and climb. If this lizard didn't have these claws, it might fall or get caught by a predator.\"*\n\n4. **Check for understanding using a quick show-and-tell:**\n   - *\"I'm going to point to a part of the lizard. You hold up fingers to show: How important is this body part for survival? One finger = a little important; five fingers = super important. Why?\"*\n   - Point to: scales, claws, tail, eyes, legs.\n\n5. **Introduce the food web concept:**\n   - *\"Lizards aren't alone in their ecosystem. This lizard eats insects (that's what it hunts). But what eats the lizard? Snakes, birds, and larger predators. The lizard is prey for bigger hunters. It's also a predator to tiny insects. This is called a food web—how energy and matter move through an ecosystem.\"*\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment.\n- **Inherited trait:** A characteristic that is passed from parents to offspring.\n- **Camouflage:** Coloring, pattern, or texture that helps an animal hide by blending in.\n- **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals.\n- **Prey:** An animal that is hunted and eaten by another animal.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use at least two new vocabulary words correctly to describe the lizard.\n- Students explain one adaptation and why it's useful.\n- Students understand that the lizard is part of a food web (both predator and prey).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding to a new context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed scenario cards (one per group)\n- Blank \"Adaptation Design Sheet\" (see below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Chart paper (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge:** *\"Now that you're lizard experts, let's use what you learned. I'm going to give you a NEW habitat. Your job is to design what a lizard would need to look like and how it would act to survive there.\"*\n\n2. **Assign each group a different scenario card:**\n   - **Card A:** A lizard living in a hot, sandy desert (lots of sun, very few plants)\n   - **Card B:** A lizard living in a cold, snowy forest (dark, freezing temperatures, thick trees)\n   - **Card C:** A lizard living in a dark cave with no sunlight\n   - **Card D:** A lizard living on a beach with white sand and rocks\n\n3. **Provide the \"Adaptation Design Sheet\"** (scaffold):\n\n   | **Our Habitat:** | (e.g., Sandy Desert) |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Challenge:** What's hard about surviving here? | Example: It's very hot and dry. There aren't many places to hide. |\n   | **Our Lizard's Adaptations** | **Why this helps** |\n   | Color/skin texture: | |\n   | Body size/shape: | |\n   | Behavior (how it acts): | |\n   | **Drawing:** Sketch your adapted lizard | |\n\n4. **Student directions:**\n   - *\"Talk with your group about your habitat. What would be hardest for a lizard living there? What would help it survive?\"*\n   - *\"On your design sheet, draw what you think a lizard would look like in that habitat. Label at least three adaptations and explain why each one is useful.\"*\n   - *\"Think about color, body shape, size, and behavior. Could it be different from our tree lizard?\"*\n\n5. **Teacher role:**\n   - Circulate and ask probing questions: *\"Why did you choose that color? What predators live there? What does your lizard eat?\"*\n   - Prompt reasoning: *\"How would that body shape help in a cave? Tell me your thinking.\"*\n   - Affirm logical connections without correcting (e.g., if a student says a desert lizard should be purple because it likes the color, guide: *\"That's creative! But would a purple lizard hide well in sandy desert? Why or why not?\"*)\n\n6. **Gallery walk (optional):** Post designs around the room. Have students do a brief walk to see other groups' habitats and adaptations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design realistic adaptations suited to a new habitat.\n- Students explain the connection between a body part and survival needs.\n- Students demonstrate transferable understanding of adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of adaptations and ecosystems.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase showing adaptation identification\n- Group discussions and student explanations throughout Explain and Elaborate\n- Teacher questioning and student responses (show-of-fingers activity)\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5 minutes, end of session):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper. Read questions aloud; students may write, draw, or dictate responses (use scribe for students who need support):\n\n1. **Draw or write:** *\"Show one body part the lizard has that helps it survive. Label it and write why it's important.\"*\n\n2. **Multiple choice or short answer:** *\"A lizard's bumpy, brown scales are an example of:*\n   - *A) An inherited trait that helps it hide (camouflage)*\n   - *B) Something the lizard learned*\n   - *C) A tool the lizard made*\"\n   \n   *Why did you choose that answer?*\n\n3. **Open-ended:** *\"What do you think would happen to this lizard if it lived in a forest with white birch trees and snow instead of dark bark? Why?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n\n| **Learning Objective** | **Evidence of Mastery** |\n|---|---|\n| Identify 3+ adaptations | Student labels at least 3 body parts on observation sheet or exit ticket with survival explanations |\n| Explain how body structures aid survival | Student provides at least one complete sentence explaining the connection (e.g., \"The claws help the lizard grip the bark so it doesn't fall\") |\n| Create a model of food web | Student can identify the lizard as both predator (eats insects) and prey (eaten by larger animals) when asked |\n| Compare adaptations across habitats | Student's habitat design includes at least 2 adaptations that differ from the original tree-dwelling lizard and explains why |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show that 80%+ of students can identify at least one lizard adaptation and provide a plausible survival explanation.\n- Most students can correctly identify the lizard's role in a food web (both hunter and hunted).\n- Students who complete the Elaborate task demonstrate transfer of adaptation concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Scaffold observation sheets:** Pre-fill some body parts and survival benefits; have students only complete 2–3 instead of 5. Provide a word bank of adaptations and purposes.\n\n2. **Pair with stronger reader:** During Explore, partner students with more developed reading/writing skills with those who need support. Have the stronger reader read directions aloud; both contribute ideas.\n\n3. **Use a concept anchor chart:** Display a visual chart with pictures and words showing adaptations (claws = climbing, scales = protection, color = hiding). Reference frequently during discussions. Let students point to the chart to answer questions.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Compare multiple habitats:** Instead of one scenario, have advanced students design lizards for TWO different habitats and explain how the adaptations differ and why.\n\n2. **Research and present:** Provide access to age-appropriate resources (e.g., National Geographic Kids, library books) to research real lizard species from different habitats (horned lizards, monitor lizards, day geckos). Students create a comparison poster: *\"How is a real desert lizard adapted differently than our tree lizard?\"*\n\n3. **Deeper ecosystem thinking:** Ask students to draw and label a complete food web for the tree ecosystem shown in the photo, including plants, the lizard, insects, predators, and decomposers. Have them trace energy flow and explain: *\"Where does the lizard get energy? What animal gets energy from the lizard?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Lizard Observation Journal:** If you have access to a classroom lizard, pet store, or nature area, have students observe a real lizard for 10–15 minutes over several days. They record in a science journal: What does the lizard do? How does it move? When does it hide? What does it eat? Students share findings and compare to the photograph.\n\n2. **Adaptation Charades:** Create cards with lizard body parts (scales, claws, long tail, eye placement). Students draw a card and act out how that body part helps the lizard survive; peers guess the adaptation and explain its purpose.\n\n3. **Design a Lizard Creature:** Students invent a fictional animal that must survive in a completely unusual habitat (e.g., a swamp, a tall tree canopy, underwater rocks). They sketch it, label at least 4 adaptations, and explain why each one is essential. Display as a \"Creature Gallery.\"\n\n4. **Food Web Game:** Use string and cards with ecosystem members (lizard, insects, plants, snakes, hawks, soil/decomposers). Students stand in a circle; each holds a card. String connects who eats whom, showing energy flow. Discuss: *\"If all the insects disappeared, what would happen to the lizard?\"*\n\n5. **Field Investigation:** Take students on a nature walk to observe real lizards, insects, or tree bark. Have them sketch and photograph examples of camouflage and adaptation in their actual environment.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Pacing:** This lesson comfortably fits two 45-minute sessions (Engage/Explore on Day 1; Explain/Elaborate/Evaluate on Day 2). Combine into a 90-minute block if possible.\n- **Safety:** If handling real lizards, review gentle handling guidelines and ensure all students wash hands after.\n- **Inclusivity:** Provide options for showing understanding (drawing, writing, speaking, building). Use visual charts and real objects alongside words.\n- **Connection to NGSS 5-LS2-1:** This lesson builds understanding of how the lizard (an animal) obtains matter (insects as food) and how energy moves through the ecosystem (food web). Students model this in the Elaborate habitat design and food web extension.",
