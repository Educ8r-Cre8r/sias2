ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed copy of the photograph (the sprouting bean plant)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student science notebooks or paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Give students 30 seconds of silent viewing time to observe without speaking. This builds curiosity.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (display one at a time, allowing 1-2 minutes for partner talk before sharing):\n   - \"What do you notice about this plant? What parts can you see, and what do you think each part does?\"\n   - \"If you look at the left side of the plant (the green part with leaves), it looks alive and healthy. But look at the right side—those brown, curly parts look dead or dried. Why do you think some parts of the same plant look different?\"\n   - \"This plant came from a tiny seed. How do you think it got so big? What did it need to grow?\"\n   - \"If this plant didn't get water for two weeks, what do you predict would happen to the green leaves?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"Think about a bean seed buried in soil right now. What is happening *inside* that seed? What is happening underground that we can't see?\" Have students write or draw a quick prediction in their science notebooks.\n\n4. **Create a class \"Wonder Board\"** on chart paper. Write down 3-4 student questions about plant growth (e.g., \"How long does it take a seed to sprout?\" \"Where do roots go?\" \"Can plants live without water?\"). Tell students these are the questions we'll investigate today.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to plant our own seeds and observe them like scientists to find out how plants grow and what they really need.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small clear plastic cups (or clear plastic bottles cut in half), one per student or pair\n- Potting soil or garden soil\n- Bean seeds (kidney beans, pinto beans, or mung beans work best—at least 3-4 per student)\n- Water in spray bottles or watering cans\n- Paper towels\n- Masking tape and markers\n- Rulers\n- Student observation sheets (see below)\n- Optional: transparent plastic bags to create humidity\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and display on board):**\n\n1. \"Label your cup with your name and today's date using masking tape and a marker.\"\n\n2. \"Fill your cup about three-quarters full with moist potting soil. Press it down gently so it's packed but not hard.\"\n\n3. \"Plant 3-4 bean seeds about 1 inch deep in the soil. Space them out so they're not touching. Cover them with soil.\"\n\n4. \"Water the soil gently until it's moist but not soggy—the way a sponge feels after being squeezed once.\"\n\n5. \"Place your cup in a warm spot with indirect light (a windowsill works great). If you want seeds to sprout faster, cover the cup loosely with a plastic bag to trap moisture—but don't seal it completely; leave a tiny gap for air.\"\n\n6. \"Starting tomorrow, check your seeds every day. Record observations in your observation sheet each day (see template below). Measure and draw pictures of what you see. Water when the top of the soil feels dry.\"\n\n**Observation Sheet Template** (provide on paper):\n\n| Date | Observations (What do I see?) | Measurements | Drawing/Sketch | Questions |\n|------|-------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| Day 1 | | Height: __ cm | | |\n| Day 2 | | Height: __ cm | | |\n| Day 3 | | Height: __ cm | | |\n| Day 4 | | Height: __ cm | | |\n| Day 5 | | Height: __ cm | | |\n\n**How the activity connects to the photograph:**\n- Students will begin to observe the very changes shown in the class photograph—the emergence of green shoots, the appearance of roots at the soil surface, and the unfurling of cotyledons (seed leaves).\n- They'll see firsthand what happens when they provide water (comparing a watered plant with a neglected one, if you set up a control).\n\n**What students should record or document:**\n- Daily height measurements (using rulers)\n- Sketches of the plant's appearance each day\n- Observations in words: color, texture, what structures they see\n- Any changes in the soil appearance (drying out, staying moist)\n- Questions or predictions for what happens next\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate daily to observe student plants and ask guiding questions: \"What changed since yesterday?\" \"Why do you think the stem is growing upward instead of sideways?\" \"Is your soil moist or dry?\"\n- Do **not** tell students what they're seeing; instead, ask open-ended questions that push observation.\n- Facilitate discussion if one student's plant is thriving and another's isn't—ask students why they think this is happening (likely due to watering differences or light).\n- If germination is slow, have a \"reference plant\" (pre-sprouted bean) ready to show students what they'll see within 2-3 days.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe seeds germinating over 3-7 days.\n- They will record at least 3-5 days of data showing growth progression.\n- They will begin to recognize that the roots grow first (below soil), then the shoot emerges (above soil).\n- Students will notice that plants watered consistently grow better than neglected ones.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large plant diagram or model (real sprouted bean plant from the photograph, or printed diagram)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student handout with labeled plant diagram\n- Optional: magnifying glasses\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a circle.** Display the classroom photograph again, alongside some of the students' actual sprouted plants (or pictures of them).\n\n2. **Share out from Explore phase:** Ask 3-4 students to describe what they've observed so far in their plants. Write their observations on chart paper (e.g., \"I see a tiny white root,\" \"The seed coat fell off,\" \"Two green leaves came out of the soil\").\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** by pointing to each structure on a real plant or labeled diagram:\n\n   - **Root:** The part of a plant that grows *down* into the soil. Roots suck up water and minerals (nutrients) from the soil that the plant needs to grow and stay healthy. Roots also hold the plant in place so it doesn't fall over.\n   - **Stem (or Shoot):** The part that grows *up* from the seed. The stem carries water and nutrients from the roots up to the leaves. It also holds the leaves up toward the light.\n   - **Cotyledon (Seed Leaves):** The first tiny leaves that pop out of the soil when a seed sprouts. They look different from real leaves and store food for the baby plant. Soon, bigger \"true leaves\" will grow.\n   - **Leaves:** The parts that are usually green and flat. Leaves catch sunlight and use air and water to make food for the plant. This is how the plant grows bigger and stronger.\n   - **Germination:** The process of a seed sprouting and starting to grow into a plant. It happens when a seed gets water, warmth, and air.\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:** \"Look at the plant in our class photo. On the left, you see green healthy leaves and stem—this means it got water, air, and light. On the right, you see brown, dried-up parts. This probably happened because those parts didn't get enough water or got damaged. The plant is like us—if we don't drink water, we get tired and weak.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:** Hold up your actual student plants or pictures. Point to different parts and ask, \"What is this? What does it do?\" Have students respond with thumbs up (confident), sideways thumb (sort of sure), or thumbs down (not sure yet). Revisit any structures students are unsure about.\n\n6. **Model matter movement:** Draw a simple arrow diagram on chart paper:\n   - Roots → Water from soil\n   - Leaves → Air (oxygen and carbon dioxide)\n   - Sun → Light energy\n   - Show arrows pointing to the plant, with labels: \"Plant uses water + air + light to grow.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Root** | The part that grows down into soil and drinks up water and food for the plant. |\n| **Stem/Shoot** | The part that grows up and carries water from the roots to the leaves. |\n| **Cotyledon** | The baby leaves that come out of a seed first; they store food to help the seed start growing. |\n| **Leaf/Leaves** | The green parts that catch sunlight and make food for the plant using air and water. |\n| **Germination** | When a seed wakes up, gets water, and starts growing into a baby plant. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and label the four main plant structures (roots, stem, cotyledons, leaves).\n- Students can explain the job of each structure (roots absorb water; stems transport; leaves make food).\n- Students understand that water and air are materials plants need to grow.\n- Students can explain why the plant in the photograph has healthy and dead parts.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Two identical bean plants (or student plants): one that will be watered, one that won't (or one in the dark, one in light)\n- Water bottles/spray bottles\n- Chart paper for predictions\n- Optional: small grow lights or lamps\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up a fair-test comparison:** Show students two identical sprouted bean plants. Announce: \"We're going to run a real science experiment to test if water is really needed for plants to grow. One plant will get water every day. The other plant will NOT get water. Let's predict: what do you think will happen?\"\n\n   - Have students write predictions in science notebooks: \"I think the plant without water will... because...\"\n   - Save these predictions to revisit in 2-3 days.\n\n2. **Daily observation protocol:** Each day, students will observe *both* plants and record observations on a comparison chart:\n\n   | Day | Watered Plant | Non-Watered Plant |\n   |-----|---------------|-------------------|\n   | Day 1 | | |\n   | Day 2 | | |\n   | Day 3 | | |\n\n   Students draw or write: color, firmness of leaves, height, any wilting or browning.\n\n3. **Application to real-world scenario:** Read aloud: \"Imagine a farmer in a hot, dry country grows beans to feed her family. She can only water her plants once a week because she doesn't have much water. What can she do to help her plants grow better?\" \n\n   - Facilitate a brief brainstorm (students might suggest: water in the early morning or evening to reduce evaporation, use a cover to trap moisture, plant in a shady spot, add mulch/leaves on top of soil to keep it moist).\n   - Explain that these are real strategies farmers use.\n\n4. **Model of matter movement (optional, if time allows):** Give each student a simple diagram template showing a plant with arrows. Students label:\n   - Where water comes from (soil, rain)\n   - Where air comes from (atmosphere)\n   - Where light comes from (sun)\n   - And draw arrows showing these materials moving *into* the plant through roots and leaves.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the experimental setup and ensure the \"no water\" plant is actually left dry (this is the hardest part—students want to water it!).\n- Ask questions daily: \"What changed? Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Connect observations back to 5-LS1-1: \"This is evidence that plants really do need water to grow and stay healthy.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can articulate predictions and explain reasoning.\n- Students will observe visible differences between watered and non-watered plants within 2-3 days (wilting, color loss in the non-watered plant).\n- Students can explain that water is a material plants need, supporting the NGSS standard 5-LS1-1.\n- Students apply concepts to a real-world farming context.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation of student notebooks:** Check daily observation sheets for accuracy, detail, and evidence of learning. Look for: accurate measurements, detailed sketches, thoughtful questions, and observations that link to plant structures and needs.\n- **Questioning during Explain phase:** Listen to student responses when you point to plant parts and ask \"What is this? What does it do?\" Note who can explain function vs. who only names the part.\n- **Comparison chart (Elaborate phase):** Review daily predictions and observations to see if students are making causal connections (e.g., \"The non-watered plant is wilting because roots can't absorb water without moisture\").\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment** (administer at the end of the 2-session lesson):\n\nProvide each student with a drawing of a sprouting bean plant with unlabeled parts. Students must:\n\n1. **Label the four main parts** (roots, stem, cotyledon, leaf).\n2. **Write one sentence for each part** explaining what it does. Example: \"The roots drink water from the soil.\"\n3. **Answer this question:** \"Why is it important that a plant gets water? Use what you learned from your own plant.\"\n4. **Make a prediction:** \"If you stopped watering your plant for two weeks, what do you think would happen? Why?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student labels 3-4 plant structures correctly.\n- Student provides accurate explanations of at least 2 plant functions.\n- Student references their own observation data or the class plant comparison to explain the need for water.\n- Student's prediction shows logical thinking based on observations (e.g., \"The plant would wilt and turn brown because it needs water to live, like how I need water to be healthy\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate mastery of 5-LS1-1 (understanding that plants need water and air to grow) through written explanations and labeled diagrams.\n- Students show evidence of understanding 5-LS2-1 (movement of water through plants) in their comparison of watered vs. non-watered plants.\n- Most students (80%+) can correctly identify plant structures and explain their functions.\n- Most students (75%+) can provide evidence-based explanations for why plants need water, drawn from their own investigations.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-made observation sheets with sentence starters:** Instead of a blank page, provide frames like:\n   - \"Today my plant looks ___.\"\n   - \"I notice the roots are ___.\"\n   - \"I think this happened because ___.\"\n   \n   This scaffolds recording without reducing rigor.\n\n2. **Partner with a strong observer:** Pair a struggling student with a peer who can help describe observations and check measurement accuracy. Struggling students can practice speaking the vocabulary aloud, which builds confidence.\n\n3. **Simplified exit ticket:** Provide a fill-in-the-blank exit ticket instead of open-response:\n   - \"Roots help the plant by ___.\" (options: drinking water, growing up, making food)\n   - \"A plant needs ___ and ___ to grow.\" (options: water and air; toys and water; sun and soil)\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Investigate additional variables:** Challenge students to design their own experiments. \"What else might affect how fast a plant grows?\" Students could test: light (bright vs. dark), soil type (potting soil vs. sand), temperature (warm windowsill vs. cool spot), or seed burial depth. They'd develop a hypothesis, control variables, and collect data over a week.\n\n2. **Research plant adaptations:** Ask advanced students, \"Some plants live in deserts where water is rare. How do you think they've adapted to survive with little water?\" Provide access to library/online resources about succulent plants, cacti, or other drought-resistant plants. Students present findings to the class.\n\n3. **Create a detailed movement-of-matter model:** Challenge students to create a diagram or 3D model (using craft materials) showing how water and nutrients move from soil through roots, up the stem, to leaves, and eventually into the air (transpiration). This deepens 5-LS2-1 understanding. They could label each stage and explain the journey of a water molecule.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Grow in the Dark\" Investigation:** Plant two identical bean seeds. Keep one in a dark closet (water it as usual) and keep the other on a windowsill. After 1-2 weeks, compare. Students observe that the dark-grown plant is pale, stretched, and weak. Discuss: \"Why do you think this happened? What does a plant do with sunlight?\" This extends understanding that light is also a material plants need (5-LS1-1).\n\n2. **Roots and Water Movement Experiment:** Place a sprouted bean plant in a clear glass of water with a drop of food coloring. Over 2-3 days, students observe the colored water traveling up the stem and sometimes reaching the leaves. Students can cut the stem crosswise and see the water-carrying tubes inside. This provides concrete evidence of matter (water) moving through the plant (5-LS2-1).\n\n3. **Plant Life Cycle Comic Strip or Poster:** Students create a 4-6 panel comic or poster showing the complete life cycle of a bean plant: seed → germination → seedling → flowering → seed pod → new seeds. They can label each stage and write captions explaining what the plant needs and what's happening at each step. This consolidates understanding and allows creative expression.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing:** Germination typically takes 3-7 days depending on bean variety and temperature. Consider starting seeds 1-2 days before this lesson so students see dramatic changes immediately.\n- **Moisture is key:** Overwatering is a common failure. Teach students to check soil by touching it—it should feel like a wrung-out sponge.\n- **Real plants are powerful:** If possible, use actual sprouted beans rather than drawings. The concrete, tactile experience is invaluable for Fifth Graders.\n- **Revisit the photo regularly:** Return to the original photograph throughout the lesson to anchor learning. Point out that students' plants will eventually look like the class photo.\n- **Document growth:** Keep a time-lapse or photo series of student plants over 2-3 weeks to show dramatic growth—this motivates and visually reinforces the concepts.",
