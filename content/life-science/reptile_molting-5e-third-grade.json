ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the lizard on the leaf.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the lizard on the green leaf (displayed large on screen or printed poster)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Ask students to look at it carefully for 30 seconds without talking. Then ask: \"What do you notice?\"\n\n2. **Facilitate a brief observation discussion** using these specific questions:\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? How do you know it's a lizard?\" (Students identify visible features: scales, claws, tail, alert eye, body position.)\n   - \"Why do you think the lizard is on a green leaf? What might it be doing there?\" (Students infer: hiding, hunting, resting, looking for food.)\n   - \"Look at the lizard's colors. It has brown, white, and spotted patterns. Do you think all lizards look exactly like this one, or might some look different?\" (Students consider variation.)\n   - \"If this lizard was a baby, what might it have looked like? How might it have changed as it grew bigger?\" (Students activate prior knowledge about growth and change.)\n\n3. **Create a \"Wonder Wall\"** on chart paper. Write down 3-4 student questions or wonderings about lizards' lives, growth, or how they survive. Examples: \"Do lizards get bigger?\" \"Why are some parts of this lizard brown and some white?\" \"How does a baby lizard become a grown-up lizard?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore the life of a lizard and discover how lizards grow, change, and use special body parts to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts about lizard life cycles and adaptations through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or illustrations showing different life stages of a lizard (egg, hatchling, juvenile, adult) — 1 set per pair of students\n- Index cards with descriptions of lizard body parts and what they do (scales protect, tail stores energy/helps escape predators, claws grip, eyes see color and movement)\n- Small plastic lizard toys or models (optional, 1 per pair)\n- Life cycle diagram template (simple, with 4 boxes for: egg, hatchling, young lizard, adult lizard)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute life stage picture cards** to each student pair. Tell them: \"These pictures show a lizard at different times in its life. Your job is to put them in order from youngest to oldest. Talk with your partner about why you think that order makes sense.\"\n\n2. **After 5-7 minutes, bring the group together.** Ask pairs to share their ordering and reasoning. Create a class consensus life cycle on the board: **Egg → Hatchling (newborn) → Young Lizard → Adult Lizard.** Point out that this shows growth and change, just like the students asked about in the Wonder Wall.\n\n3. **Transition to body part exploration.** Display the photograph again. Say: \"This grown-up lizard has special body parts that help it live on plants and survive in its habitat. Let's discover what each part does.\"\n\n4. **Distribute body part index cards** to small groups. Each card describes a different feature:\n   - Scales: Rough, overlapping skin that protects the body from harm and drying out.\n   - Tail: Stores fat for energy; can drop off if a predator grabs it (helps the lizard escape).\n   - Claws: Sharp and curved, perfect for gripping leaves and branches.\n   - Eyes: Large and alert, can see color and movement to spot food and dangers.\n   - Green/brown coloring: Helps the lizard blend in with plants (camouflage).\n\n5. **Have students match each body part card to a part visible in the photograph.** Ask: \"Why do you think the lizard needs THIS part to survive where it lives (on plants and leaves)?\"\n\n6. **Student recording:** Each pair completes a simple **Life Cycle and Body Parts Worksheet** with:\n   - A sketch or paste-in of the four life stages they ordered\n   - Labels of 3-4 body parts they observed in the photograph with one-sentence explanations of what each does\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the size? How do you think the lizard's claws help it on a leaf? What would happen if this lizard didn't have a tail?\"\n- Avoid telling answers; instead, prompt students to look at the photo and make inferences.\n- Encourage peer discussion and explanation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly sequence the life stages (egg → hatchling → young → adult) and can explain that all animals grow and change.\n- Students identify at least 3 body parts and can connect each to the lizard's survival on plants (claws for gripping, scales for protection, eyes for seeing).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect discoveries to key science concepts about life cycles and adaptation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large anchor chart paper with vocabulary and definitions\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Students' worksheets from Explore phase\n- Visual model of a complete lizard life cycle (poster or digital slide)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Ask 2-3 pairs to share what they learned about the lizard's life cycle and one body part they discussed. Affirm their thinking and correct any misconceptions gently.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (write on anchor chart with student-friendly definitions and simple drawings):\n\n   - **Life Cycle:** The series of stages a living thing goes through: being born, growing bigger, making babies, and eventually dying. (Show the 4-stage lizard cycle as an example.)\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. (Example: \"The lizard's claws are an adaptation because they help it grip leaves.\")\n   - **Trait:** A characteristic or feature of an animal—like color, size, or body shape. (Example: \"This lizard has brown and white coloring as a trait.\")\n   - **Environment:** The place where an animal lives, including plants, weather, other animals, and rocks. (Example: \"Green plants are part of this lizard's environment.\")\n   - **Camouflage:** Colors or patterns that help an animal hide or blend in with its surroundings. (Example: \"The lizard's brown and white coloring helps it blend with leaves and branches—that's camouflage!\")\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Point to different parts: \"This adaptation (claws) helps the lizard survive in this environment (on plants).\"\n   - Discuss: \"If this lizard was a hatchling when it came out of its egg, it was tiny. As a juvenile and adult, it grew bigger. That's part of its life cycle.\"\n   - Explain: \"All the things we see on this lizard—the coloring, the scales, the claws—are traits. Some of these traits came from its parents, and some might change based on where it lives.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can you point to an adaptation on this lizard? Why is it helpful?\"\n   - Ask: \"What are the four stages of a lizard's life cycle?\"\n   - Ask: \"If a baby lizard grows up in a very sunny, dry place, how might that affect how it looks or behaves?\" (Introduce the idea that the environment influences traits.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Life Cycle** | The stages a living thing goes through: born, grows, makes babies, dies. |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or way of acting that helps an animal survive. |\n| **Trait** | A feature or characteristic of an animal, like its color, size, or shape. |\n| **Environment** | The place where an animal lives and everything in it (plants, weather, other animals). |\n| **Camouflage** | Colors or patterns that help an animal hide by blending in with its surroundings. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use the vocabulary terms correctly when discussing the photograph and the lizard's body parts.\n- Students understand that life cycles include birth, growth, and change.\n- Students recognize that adaptations help animals survive in their environments.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by exploring how different environments could affect lizard traits and adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or illustrations of three different environments: (1) green forest with lots of plants, (2) sandy desert with rocks, (3) rocky mountain with sparse vegetation\n- Chart paper divided into 3 sections (one for each environment)\n- Markers and colored pencils\n- Optional: pictures of different lizard species from various habitats\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the scenario:** \"We've learned about one lizard that lives on green plants. But did you know that lizards live in many different places on Earth? Some live in deserts, some in forests, and some in mountains. The environments are very different!\"\n\n2. **Show the three environment picture cards.** Discuss what each place is like:\n   - **Green Forest:** Lots of green plants, shade, moisture, insects for food.\n   - **Sandy Desert:** Very hot, little water, sandy and rocky ground, sparse plants.\n   - **Rocky Mountain:** Cool, rocks and gravel, few plants, wind.\n\n3. **Pose the challenge:** \"If a lizard lived in each of these places, how might its traits be different? What color might it be? What adaptations would it need to survive there? Let's think about how the environment influences a lizard's traits!\"\n\n4. **Small group exploration:** Divide the class into three groups. Assign each group one environment. Using the chart paper, have them:\n   - Draw or describe what a lizard might look like if it lived there.\n   - List 2-3 adaptations it would need.\n   - Explain WHY those adaptations would help it survive in that specific environment.\n\n   **Example for Desert Group:**\n   - A lizard might be tan or sandy-colored to blend in with sand (camouflage).\n   - It might have wider feet to walk on hot sand without sinking.\n   - It might be lighter colored to reflect heat and stay cooler.\n\n5. **Gallery Walk (Optional):** Post the three group charts around the room. Have students do a silent walk to see what each group discovered. Then gather for a brief discussion: \"How are these imaginary desert, forest, and mountain lizards different from the green-plant lizard in our photograph? Why?\"\n\n6. **Connect to Learning Objective:** \"The environment can influence how a lizard looks and what special parts it has. A lizard's traits help it fit perfectly into the place where it lives!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group discussions by asking: \"What color would help this lizard hide in a desert? Why?\"\n- Encourage students to refer back to the original photograph and compare.\n- Guide students to understand that environmental factors (sunlight, temperature, available food) can shape a lizard's appearance and behavior over time.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain how a lizard's environment influences its traits and adaptations.\n- Students recognize that different lizards in different places have different adaptations suited to survival in those places.\n- Students deepen understanding that variation in traits exists within species and is related to where animals live.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of life cycles, adaptations, traits, and how environment influences survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n- Observe student participation during Engage discussions and listen for use of vocabulary.\n- Review students' completed worksheets from Explore phase for accuracy in sequencing life stages and identifying body parts.\n- Listen to group explanations during Elaborate activity to assess understanding of how environment influences traits.\n- Ask individual students clarifying questions: \"Tell me about one adaptation this lizard has. Why does it need it?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (can be verbal, written, or drawn depending on writing ability). Include these prompts:\n\n1. **Life Cycle Question:** \"Name one stage of a lizard's life cycle and describe what happens to the lizard at that stage.\" (Students may draw or write.)\n\n2. **Adaptation Question:** \"Look at this lizard's photograph again. Pick one body part (like claws, eyes, tail, or scales) and explain how it helps the lizard survive.\"\n\n3. **Environment and Traits Question:** \"If a lizard lived in a sandy desert instead of on green plants, what color do you think it might be? Why?\" (Assesses understanding that environment influences traits.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Advanced |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| **Life Cycle Understanding** | Student names one stage but cannot explain it. | Student names one or more stages and describes what happens (growth, change, etc.). | Student sequentially describes multiple stages and explains the complete life cycle. |\n| **Adaptation Knowledge** | Student identifies a body part but cannot explain its function. | Student identifies a body part and explains one way it helps the lizard survive. | Student identifies multiple body parts and explains how they work together to help the lizard survive in its specific environment. |\n| **Environment-Trait Connection** | Student gives a response but doesn't connect to environment. | Student explains one way environment influences a trait (e.g., \"Sandy desert → tan color to hide\"). | Student explains multiple ways environment influences traits and shows understanding of camouflage and adaptation. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding by:\n- Correctly naming and describing at least one stage of a lizard's life cycle.\n- Identifying at least two body parts/adaptations and explaining their functions.\n- Making a logical connection between an environment and how a lizard's traits might change to help it survive there.\n- Using vocabulary terms (life cycle, adaptation, trait, environment, camouflage) accurately in discussions and written responses.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Life Cycle:** Provide students with only 2-3 life stage cards (egg, hatchling, adult) instead of four, with larger, clearer pictures and minimal text.\n\n2. **Guided Body Part Exploration:** Pair students with a peer or adult who can point to body parts in the photograph and ask \"What do you think this does?\" rather than requiring independent reading of complex index cards. Provide only 2-3 body parts to focus on instead of five.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Support:** Create a picture-word card set where each vocabulary term has a simple icon or drawing. Allow students to refer to these cards throughout the lesson and use them during the exit ticket.\n\n4. **Sentence Frames:** Provide sentence starters for written or verbal responses:\n   - \"The lizard's _____ helps it _____.\"\n   - \"This is part of the lizard's life cycle: _____.\"\n   - \"If a lizard lived in a desert, it might be _____ because _____.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research and Present:** Have advanced students research a specific lizard species (e.g., anole, bearded dragon, chameleon) and create a short presentation comparing its life cycle, adaptations, and environment to the lizard in the photograph. Encourage them to find out how that species' traits are specifically suited to its habitat.\n\n2. **Camouflage Comparison:** Ask students to find pictures of 2-3 different lizard species from different environments and analyze why each looks the way it does based on its habitat. Create a comparison chart or poster.\n\n3. **Predict and Explain:** Challenge students with: \"If this green-plant lizard's habitat were suddenly cut down and replaced with brown rocks and dirt, what changes might happen to the lizard's population over many generations? Could they survive? Why or why not?\" This introduces the concept of adaptation and survival over time.\n\n4. **Design Challenge:** \"Design a lizard that would be perfectly adapted to survive in [unusual environment like: a snow-covered mountain, a rainforest with constant rain, an urban city]. What would it look like? What special body parts would it need?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Lizard Life Cycle Poster Project:** Students create a large, illustrated four-stage life cycle poster for a lizard, with sentences or captions explaining what happens at each stage. Display in the classroom or hallway.\n\n2. **Adaptation Scavenger Hunt:** Create a classroom or playground scavenger hunt where students find pictures or examples of other animals (birds, insects, mammals) and identify one adaptation each has. Then compare: \"Which animals have similar adaptations to the lizard we studied? Why?\"\n\n3. **Interview an Imaginary Lizard:** Students write or draw responses to: \"If you could ask a lizard one question about its life, what would you ask? What do you think the lizard would answer?\" This creative extension assesses understanding while building engagement and imagination.\n\n4. **Reptile Research Mini-Book:** Create a simple booklet where each page focuses on one fact about lizards (where they live, what they eat, how they grow, how they use their tail, different colors they can be). Students can contribute pages or create their own version.\n\n5. **Compare Life Cycles:** Bring in pictures or information about other reptiles (snakes, turtles, crocodiles) and compare their life cycles to the lizard's. Chart what's the same and what's different, reinforcing that all organisms share common life cycle stages.\n\n---",
