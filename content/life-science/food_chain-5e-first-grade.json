ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal body parts and survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of lizard in soil and debris habitat (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph on the board or projector. Allow students to look at it silently for 15-20 seconds.\n\n2. Ask these guiding questions:\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? What is it doing?\"\n   - \"What does the lizard's body look like? Describe its skin, legs, and tail.\"\n   - \"Where do you think this lizard lives? Why would this be a good home for it?\"\n   - \"How do you think the lizard's bumpy, colored skin helps it survive here?\"\n\n3. Encourage students to share their observations. Record 2-3 student responses on chart paper under \"What We Notice About the Lizard.\"\n\n4. Ask a prediction prompt: \"If this lizard wanted to hide from a big bird, what part of its body would help it the most? Why?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great observations! Now we're going to explore how animals use their bodies to stay safe and find food. Let's investigate how body parts help animals survive!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate animal body parts through hands-on exploration and discover how structures help animals survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Live lizard in a small terrarium or enclosure (optional, if available) OR high-quality photos/video of lizard movement\n- Pictures of different animals (spider, snake, bird, squirrel, frog) with clear external features visible\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per pair or group)\n- Index cards with animal names and body part labels\n- Small objects: craft sticks, paper, cotton balls, sand, soil, leaves\n- Shallow containers or trays\n- Student observation sheets (pre-drawn with pictures of animals)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Body Part Detective (If using live lizard or video):**\n   - Show students the lizard (or play a 2-3 minute video of a lizard moving, hiding, and eating).\n   - Give each student a magnifying glass to closely observe the lizard's skin texture, legs, and tail (from safe distance).\n   - Ask: \"What do you notice about how the lizard moves? What parts move it forward? What helps it hide?\"\n\n2. **Animal Adaptation Matching:**\n   - Distribute pictures of different animals to pairs of students.\n   - Have students identify one external body part visible in their picture and use an index card to label it.\n   - Ask pairs: \"How does this body part help the animal survive? What does it use it for?\"\n   - Examples: Spider's legs (climbing), snake's long body (squeezing into spaces), bird's wings (flying away from danger), squirrel's tail (balance), frog's powerful back legs (jumping away).\n\n3. **Camouflage Exploration:**\n   - Place sand, soil, and leaves on a tray.\n   - Give each group a picture of the lizard.\n   - Ask: \"How would our lizard hide in this habitat? Let's arrange these materials to match the lizard's colors and patterns.\"\n   - Students arrange soil, sand, and leaves to create camouflage for the lizard picture.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask follow-up questions: \"Why did you choose that color? How does the bumpy skin match the dirt?\"\n- Avoid confirming answers; instead, ask students to explain their thinking: \"How do you know that?\"\n- Record observations on chart paper under \"How Body Parts Help Animals.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify at least 2-3 external body parts of the lizard (legs, tail, rough skin, eyes).\n- Students make simple connections between body parts and survival (e.g., \"legs help it run,\" \"bumpy skin helps it hide\").\n- Students arrange camouflage materials showing understanding that the lizard's appearance matches its environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to scientific concepts about animal survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with heading \"How Animals Survive\"\n- Picture cards of the lizard and other animals\n- Pre-made vocabulary cards with pictures and words\n- Student science journals or paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 pairs to share one observation from the Explore phase: \"What body part did you observe, and how does it help the animal?\"\n   - Record responses on chart paper under \"Our Discoveries.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Introduction (8 minutes):**\n   - Introduce these terms using student-friendly language and visuals:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **External Parts:** The outside body parts we can see, like skin, legs, tail, and eyes. External parts help animals eat, move, hide, and stay safe.\n   - **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or pattern matches its home so it is hard to see. This helps animals hide from danger.\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives, like soil, trees, or water. A habitat gives an animal food, water, shelter, and safety.\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. A lizard's bumpy skin is an adaptation.\n   - **Survival:** To stay alive and healthy by having what you need (food, water, shelter, safety).\n\n3. **Connection Back to Photo (4 minutes):**\n   - Display the original lizard photograph again.\n   - Point to the lizard and ask: \"What external parts do you see? How does each part help it survive in this soil habitat?\"\n   - Emphasize: \"The lizard's rough, brown skin matches the soil—that's camouflage! Its four legs help it move quickly away from danger. Its tail helps it balance. All of these parts work together to keep the lizard alive.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask individual students:\n     - \"Can you point to the lizard's legs? Why are legs important?\"\n     - \"Why is the lizard's bumpy skin helpful in this habitat?\"\n     - \"What do we call the place where the lizard lives?\" (habitat)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use new vocabulary to describe the lizard's body parts and how they help survival.\n- Students explain in simple sentences that external parts help animals survive (e.g., \"Legs help run,\" \"Bumpy skin hides\").\n- Students identify the habitat in the photo as a survival place.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by designing a tool or structure that mimics an animal body part to solve a human problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Craft sticks, paper, clay, cotton balls, sandpaper, tape, glue\n- Problem cards (printed, with pictures and simple words)\n- Shallow boxes or trays\n- Sand, soil, or leaves (real or craft materials)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge: Design a Tool Like an Animal**\n\nPresent this problem in simple language with a picture card:\n\n*\"A farmer wants to dig in hard soil to plant seeds. A lizard digs using its strong legs and claws. Can you design a digging tool that copies the lizard's leg and claw?\"*\n\nOr alternative problems:\n- *\"A person wants to climb a tree safely. How could we make hands and feet like a lizard to grip the bark?\"*\n- *\"We want to hide our toy in a box. How could we make the box look like dirt and leaves so it's hard to see, like a camouflaged lizard?\"*\n\n**Student Steps:**\n\n1. Show a picture of the animal part you're copying (lizard's leg with claw, or rough skin texture).\n2. Draw your idea first on paper.\n3. Use craft materials to build your tool or design.\n4. Test it: Does it dig? Does it grip? Does it hide?\n5. Explain: \"This part of my tool copies the _____ because _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Display the materials visibly and allow students to explore freely.\n- Ask guiding questions without giving answers: \"Which animal body part could help? What material feels bumpy like lizard skin?\"\n- Encourage testing and revision: \"What would happen if you added more texture? Try again!\"\n- Take photos or save drawings as evidence of student thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a simple tool or structure using materials that mimics an animal body part.\n- Students explain (verbally or with a drawing) how their creation copies an animal's survival feature.\n- Students test their tool and notice if it works.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal body parts and their role in survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during discussions and question-asking in all phases.\n- Use a simple checklist: Can the student identify at least 2 external body parts? Can the student explain one way a body part helps an animal survive?\n- Listen for vocabulary use (external parts, camouflage, habitat, adaptation, survival).\n\n**Exit Ticket Assessment (End of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a card or paper with these 2-3 prompts (use pictures + words for first graders):\n\n1. **Draw and Label:** \"Draw a lizard's body part that helps it survive. Label it and write or tell me how it helps.\"\n\n2. **Picture Selection:** \"Which helps a lizard survive? (A) Bumpy skin that matches dirt (camouflage)  or  (B) Smooth skin that shines. Circle the right answer.\"\n\n3. **Sentence Stem:** \"A lizard's _______ helps it _______ because _______.\" (Students complete with a body part and survival benefit.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n\n✓ Student correctly identifies at least 2 external body parts of an animal.\n✓ Student explains how at least 1 body part helps the animal survive (e.g., \"Legs help run away,\" \"Brown color helps hide\").\n✓ Student uses vocabulary like habitat, camouflage, or external parts correctly in a sentence.\n✓ Student designs a simple tool or model that copies an animal feature and explains the connection.\n✓ Student makes observations that show understanding that animals' bodies are suited to their habitats.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nMost first graders should:\n- Name 2-3 external body parts of the lizard (legs, tail, skin, eyes).\n- Explain in simple 3-5 word sentences how one body part helps survival.\n- Show camouflage understanding by recognizing that the lizard's color matches soil.\n- Design a simple creation inspired by animal body parts.\n\n**If students struggle:**\n- Simplify: Focus on one body part (legs) and one function (moving/running).\n- Use photo cards for matching instead of drawing.\n- Repeat vocabulary 3-4 times with the same photo.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Body Part Picture Matching:** Instead of open-ended observation, provide labeled picture cards of animal body parts (leg, tail, skin) and have students match them to parts on an actual photo or toy animal. Reduce expectations to identifying 1-2 parts.\n\n2. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only 2 key terms (external parts, habitat) and repeat them in the same context each time. Pair words with the same photo repeatedly so students build recognition.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Explanation:** Provide a frame like \"The lizard's _____ helps it _____\" and offer 2-3 word choices (e.g., legs/hide/run) that students can select and repeat aloud. Accept one-word or two-word answers.\n\n4. **Concrete Camouflage Demo:** Before the camouflage activity, physically place a toy lizard on plain paper, then on dirt/sand. Ask \"Where is it harder to see?\" so students understand the concept before applying it themselves.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Compare Multiple Animals:** Provide pictures of 3-4 animals (lizard, frog, snake, bird) and have students compare how different body parts solve the same problem (e.g., \"How do a lizard's legs and a frog's legs help them survive differently?\").\n\n2. **Design for a New Habitat:** Challenge: \"If the lizard moved to a snowy place, what would need to change about its body to survive? Draw the lizard in snow and show how it would look different.\" (Introduces concept that adaptations match habitats.)\n\n3. **Investigate Parent-Offspring Similarity (1-LS3-1 extension):** Show a photo of a baby lizard and an adult lizard. Ask: \"How are they the same? How are they different? Do you think a baby lizard's legs work the same way as an adult's?\" Have students predict and explain.\n\n4. **Create a Detailed Field Guide:** Have students draw the lizard in detail, label at least 4 external parts, and write or dictate a sentence about each part's survival function. Create a class \"Lizard Survival Guide.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Habitat Diorama:** Students create a small box diorama showing the lizard's habitat with soil, rocks, leaves, and a camouflaged lizard cutout. They label the external parts of the lizard and identify 3 things the habitat provides (food, shelter, safety). This extends 1-LS1-1 and reinforces habitat understanding.\n\n2. **Animal Body Part Scavenger Hunt:** Create a matching game where students match animal pictures to cards describing body parts and their functions (e.g., \"I have strong back legs to jump away from danger\" = Frog). Students work in pairs to match all cards and explain their choices. This reviews and deepens vocabulary use.\n\n3. **Design and Test a Survival Tool:** As homework or a follow-up lesson, send students home with a challenge card: \"Design a tool that helps you survive in a rainstorm, copying an animal body part. You could mimic a duck's waterproof feathers, a turtle's hard shell, or a cat's sensitive whiskers. Bring your design to school and explain it to the class.\" This extends 1-LS1-1 into real-world problem-solving.\n\n---",
