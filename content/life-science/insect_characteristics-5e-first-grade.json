ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about grasshoppers and how animals move.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Projected or printed copy of the grasshopper photograph (large enough for all students to see clearly)\n  - Chart paper or whiteboard\n  - Markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. Display the photograph of the grasshopper on the leaf. Ask students to look carefully at the image for 30 seconds without talking.\n  2. Ask these discussion questions to spark curiosity:\n     - \"What animal do you see in this picture? What is it doing?\"\n     - \"What parts of the grasshopper's body do you notice? Can you point to them?\" (Guide students to identify legs, antennae, wings, and overall body shape.)\n     - \"Why do you think the grasshopper is green? What does that help it do?\"\n     - \"If you were a grasshopper, how would you use your legs to escape from something that wanted to eat you?\"\n  3. Invite students to act out jumping motions with their own legs, building excitement for the lesson.\n  4. Write student observations and wonderings on chart paper: \"What do grasshoppers use their body parts for?\" and \"How does a grasshopper jump so far?\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to discover exactly how grasshoppers use their body parts to survive, and we'll even build our own jumping grasshopper!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate and discover how grasshopper body parts enable movement and survival through hands-on building and observation.\n\n- **Materials:** (per pair or small group)\n  - Plastic spoon or popsicle stick (as the \"body\")\n  - Rubber band\n  - Folded construction paper or craft foam (pre-cut into leg shapes, approximately 2-3 inches long; provide 6 pieces per group)\n  - Googly eyes or dot stickers (for antennae and eyes)\n  - Tape (masking or painter's tape works best for first graders)\n  - Markers or crayons\n  - Small pom-poms or yarn (optional, for antennae)\n  - Observation worksheet (simple pictures with labels: legs, antennae, wings, body)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Build a Jumping Grasshopper Model:** Provide each pair or small group with materials to construct a simple grasshopper model.\n     - Step 1: Show students a completed example (pre-made by the teacher).\n     - Step 2: Have students tape two craft foam \"legs\" to the underside of their spoon or stick as back legs (these will be the \"jumping legs\").\n     - Step 3: Have students tape four smaller craft foam pieces to the sides as front and middle legs.\n     - Step 4: Help students attach googly eyes or draw eyes with markers.\n     - Step 5: Attach a pom-pom or yarn piece with tape as antennae.\n     - Step 6: Students can decorate their grasshopper with markers to make it green or patterned.\n  \n  2. **Test the Grasshopper:** Once built, students will:\n     - Place their grasshopper on a table and gently press down on the spoon/stick handle, then release to make it \"jump.\"\n     - Observe and test: Does it jump? How far? What happens when they use different amounts of force?\n     - Try again, adjusting the position of the back legs or the rubber band tightness.\n  \n  3. **Observation Recording:**\n     - Students complete a simple observation sheet with pictures and words:\n       - \"Draw the back legs of your grasshopper. Why are they bigger/different?\"\n       - \"What helps your grasshopper jump?\"\n       - \"How is your jumping grasshopper like a real grasshopper?\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:** \n  - Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What are your back legs doing?\" \"Why do you think we made those legs bigger?\" \"What happens when you press down?\"\n  - Avoid explaining the mechanism; let students discover through trial and error.\n  - Help with tape and construction only; encourage problem-solving.\n  - Encourage students to compare their models and test distances together.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  - Students build a simple grasshopper model with identifiable body parts.\n  - Students discover that the back legs (when pressed and released) create the jumping motion.\n  - Students make connections between their model's jumping action and how real grasshoppers use their back legs.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration. Connect back to the photograph and student discoveries.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Original grasshopper photograph\n  - Chart paper with labeled diagram (pre-drawn or created during this phase)\n  - Student-built grasshopper models\n  - Picture cards showing grasshopper body parts (optional)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Group Share-Out:** Gather students in a circle with their models and the photograph visible.\n     - Ask 3-4 students to share what they discovered: \"What did your grasshopper do? What made it jump?\"\n     - Listen for language about legs, pushing, and movement.\n  \n  2. **Teacher-Led Explanation:** Using the photograph, point to and name each external body part:\n     - \"A grasshopper has **legs** — six of them! The two back legs are very strong and long. Those are for jumping.\"\n     - \"See these long, thin sticks? Those are **antennae**. Grasshoppers use them to feel and smell their world.\"\n     - \"Look at these wings. **Wings** help grasshoppers fly to escape from predators.\"\n     - \"All of these parts help the grasshopper survive in the grass and plants where it lives.\"\n  \n  3. **Connection to the Photograph:**\n     - \"Just like your model, the real grasshopper uses its back legs to jump away from danger. The green color helps it hide in the grass so predators can't see it.\"\n     - \"Why is the grasshopper sitting on a leaf? Because it needs plants for food and shelter!\"\n  \n  4. **Check for Understanding:**\n     - Ask individual students: \"Show me the legs on your grasshopper. Show me the antennae. Why are the back legs important?\"\n     - Use a simple thumbs up/sideways/down signal: \"If you can tell me one way a grasshopper uses its body parts, show thumbs up.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Legs:** Body parts that help animals walk, jump, and move around.\n  - **Antennae:** Long, thin parts on a grasshopper's head that help it feel and smell.\n  - **Wings:** Flat body parts that help some animals fly.\n  - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n  - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal live in its environment.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  - Students use vocabulary words to identify and describe grasshopper body parts.\n  - Students understand that each body part has a purpose for survival.\n  - Students can explain why the grasshopper's back legs are special for jumping.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply concepts to a new context and deepen understanding by solving a real-world problem using animal body parts as inspiration.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Images or real items showing other animals and their body parts (e.g., pictures of a bird's wings, a duck's feet, a cheetah's legs, a rabbit's ears)\n  - Construction paper, straws, paper cups, rubber bands, craft materials\n  - Chart titled \"How Animals Help Themselves\"\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Real-World Problem:** Present a scenario: \"Imagine you need to help someone move a heavy box across the room, but they can't pick it up. How could you design something that helps, using ideas from how grasshoppers (or other animals) use their body parts?\"\n  \n  2. **Explore Other Animals:** Show pictures or discuss how other animals use their body parts:\n     - A bird's wings for flying (moving through air quickly)\n     - A duck's feet for paddling (moving through water)\n     - A cheetah's long legs for running (moving fast on land)\n     - A rabbit's ears for listening (sensing danger)\n  \n  3. **Design a Solution:** Students work in small groups to:\n     - Choose one animal body part and how it works.\n     - Design a simple tool or device inspired by that animal part (e.g., \"flippers\" like a duck's feet to help move something, or \"long arms\" like a grasshopper's strong legs to reach something).\n     - Build a prototype using available materials (straws, paper cups, rubber bands, construction paper).\n     - Test their design and explain how it was inspired by an animal.\n  \n  4. **Share and Compare:** Each group demonstrates their design and explains:\n     - \"Our design was inspired by [animal] and its [body part].\"\n     - \"It helps because...\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:** \n  - Guide groups to choose realistic, manageable designs.\n  - Ask questions: \"How does this animal use this body part? How can we copy that idea?\"\n  - Encourage testing and adjustment.\n  - Celebrate creative thinking and effort over perfection.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  - Students apply understanding of animal body parts to solve a new problem.\n  - Students demonstrate ability to mimic animal adaptations in a simple design.\n  - Students articulate the connection between an animal's body part and its function.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of grasshopper body parts, their functions, and ability to apply this learning.\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n     - Observation during Explore phase: Can students identify body parts? Do they understand the back legs create jumping?\n     - Questioning during Explain phase: Listen for use of vocabulary and understanding of purpose.\n     - Participation during Elaborate phase: Can students apply concepts to new animals and problems?\n  \n  2. **Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 1 or Lesson 2):**\n     - Use a simple pictorial/written exit ticket with these questions:\n       - \"Draw a grasshopper and label one body part. Write or tell how it helps the grasshopper survive.\"\n       - \"If you had a grasshopper's back legs, what could you do? Draw or write.\"\n       - \"What did you learn today about how animals use their body parts?\"\n  \n  3. **Summative Assessment:**\n     - Students complete a \"Grasshopper Body Parts\" worksheet:\n       - Match pictures of body parts to their names (legs, antennae, wings, body).\n       - Draw lines connecting each part to a sentence describing its job (e.g., \"These help me jump\" → legs).\n     - OR: Students verbally explain to the teacher or a peer three body parts of a grasshopper and one thing each part does.\n  \n  4. **Success Criteria:**\n     - Student correctly identifies at least 3 external body parts of a grasshopper.\n     - Student explains or demonstrates understanding of how at least 2 body parts help the grasshopper survive (jump, hide, sense danger).\n     - Student successfully builds a model that jumps and can describe which part makes it jump.\n     - (For 1-LS1-1) Student designs a simple solution inspired by an animal body part and can explain the connection.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  - Students demonstrate knowledge of grasshopper anatomy and function.\n  - Students show ability to transfer learning by mimicking animal adaptations.\n  - Students understand the relationship between body structure and survival.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (for struggling learners):**\n  1. **Simplified Building Task:** Provide a pre-assembled grasshopper body with only legs to be added. Focus on testing and observation rather than full construction.\n  2. **Vocabulary Support:** Use picture cards with labeled body parts. Practice saying and pointing to parts before and during activities. Provide sentence frames: \"The [body part] helps the grasshopper ___.\"\n  3. **Guided Observation:** During Explore, pair struggling students with a peer or provide a printed diagram with pictures for them to point to and name, rather than drawing from memory.\n\n- **Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n  1. **Extend the Design Challenge:** Ask students to design a grasshopper-inspired tool that solves a more complex problem, such as \"How could you help someone reach something high?\" (inspired by jumping ability) or \"How could you make something that can sense in the dark?\" (inspired by antennae).\n  2. **Compare Multiple Animals:** Have students research and compare how 3-4 different insects or animals use their body parts. Create a comparison chart or poster.\n  3. **Prediction and Testing:** Challenge students to predict how changing the design of their grasshopper model (e.g., longer back legs, different angle) would affect how far it jumps, then test their predictions and record results.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grasshopper Hunt Habitat Walk (Outdoor or Virtual):**\n   - Take students on a nature walk to observe real grasshoppers in grass or garden areas (or use nature videos if outdoor access is limited).\n   - Students sketch or photograph grasshoppers and their habitats.\n   - Discuss: \"Why do you think grasshoppers live in grass? What body parts help them stay safe here?\"\n   - Back in the classroom, create a habitat display with students' observations and drawings.\n\n2. **Insect Body Part Sorting Game:**\n   - Create picture cards of various insects (grasshopper, butterfly, ant, ladybug, dragonfly).\n   - Students sort them by body parts: \"Which insects have wings? Which have long legs? Which have antennae?\"\n   - Create a chart showing similarities and differences.\n   - Discuss: \"How do different body parts help different insects survive?\"\n\n3. **Engineering Challenge: Build a Better Jumper:**\n   - Students redesign their grasshopper model to jump farther or higher.\n   - Provide materials and allow experimentation with different leg lengths, angles, and spring mechanisms.\n   - Measure jump distances and create a simple bar graph of results.\n   - Students explain their design choices: \"Why did you make the back legs longer? What happened?\"\n\n4. **Read-Aloud and Literature Connection:**\n   - Read aloud a picture book about grasshoppers or insects (e.g., *A Grasshopper Grows* by Melissa Stewart or *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* by Eric Carle, connecting to body changes).\n   - Students draw and label body parts from the story.\n   - Connect to 1-LS1-2 by discussing: \"How do baby grasshoppers (nymphs) look like their parents? What is different?\"\n\n---",
