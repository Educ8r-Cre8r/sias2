Identify frogs as amphibian organisms and describe the external structures that help them survive in their environment.\n2. Explain how matter (in the form of food and energy) moves between frogs, their food sources, and their predators in an ecosystem.\n3. Create a model showing how a frog obtains necessary materials (food, water, oxygen) from its environment and returns matter to the ecosystem.\n4. Support an argument that frogs depend on specific environmental conditions and play a role in the flow of matter through food webs.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about frogs and activate prior knowledge about animal structures and ecosystems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of frogs (or projected image)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the image of the three frogs on a light-colored surface. Give students 30 seconds to observe silently and take in details.\n\n2. **Initiate Discussion with Targeted Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the frog's feet? Why do you think they look this way?\"\n   - \"If you were a frog, what would you need to survive? Where would you find it?\"\n   - \"Can you think of animals that might eat a frog, or animals that a frog might eat?\"\n   - \"These frogs are resting on a light-colored surface. Where do you think frogs live in nature, and why might they need to be near water?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** Ask students to write or discuss: *\"If this frog eats a mosquito, what happens to that mosquito's body? Where does the energy from that mosquito go?\"* Collect responses on chart paper without correcting—these become the basis for later exploration.\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become ecosystem scientists and trace where a frog gets the things it needs to survive, and how it connects to other living things around it.\"\n\n**Expected Student Engagement:** Students should demonstrate curiosity about frog anatomy, habitat needs, and food relationships.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the movement of matter (food and energy) through a simple ecosystem using frogs as a focal organism.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards (30-40 per group)\n- Markers (colored and black)\n- String or yarn (3-4 balls per group)\n- Tape\n- Large poster board or chart paper (1 per group)\n- Simple ecosystem cards (pre-made or for students to create): **Sun → Plant → Mosquito → Frog → Heron**\n- Diagram worksheet (optional, for recording)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Building a Food Web Model (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Organize into small groups** (3-4 students per group).\n\n2. **Distribute ecosystem cards** or have students create them:\n   - Each card represents one organism: Sun, Grass/Plants, Mosquito, Ant, Frog, Heron, Snake\n   - Students illustrate each organism on their cards\n\n3. **Model Matter Movement:**\n   - Ask: \"A frog eats a mosquito. The mosquito ate plants. Where did the plant get its energy?\" (From the sun)\n   - Have students arrange cards on poster board in a sequence showing energy/matter flow\n   - Connect cards with string, labeling each connection: *\"Eats\"* or *\"Gets energy from\"*\n   - Create multiple pathways to show that frogs eat different things (mosquitoes, ants, small fish)\n\n4. **Add the \"Return Path\":**\n   - Ask: \"When a frog dies, what happens to its body?\" Guide students to include decomposers (bacteria, fungi) and show how matter returns to soil and eventually plants\n   - Add arrows showing decomposition and cycling back to plants\n\n**Part 2: Tracing Matter Through the Frog (7 minutes)**\n\n5. **Use a graphic organizer or worksheet** to have students trace one piece of matter (energy):\n   - *\"Follow this mosquito's journey: It ate a plant. The plant made food from sunlight. The frog ate the mosquito. Now the energy is in the frog's body. What happens next?\"*\n   - Students draw or write the path, identifying each organism involved\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"Where did that mosquito get its energy?\"* and *\"What could eat this frog?\"* rather than providing direct answers\n- Encourage students to discuss and justify their connections\n- Note misconceptions (e.g., energy creation from nowhere) for the Explain phase\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual food web or food chain showing the frog's role\n- Students identify that matter moves from sun → plants → animals and back to soil through decomposers\n- Students recognize that frogs are both consumers (eating insects) and part of larger food chains (eaten by predators)\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and formalize understanding of matter movement in ecosystems with the frog as the focal organism.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart (prepared or created during lesson)\n- Vocabulary cards with images\n- Student notebooks\n- Digital resource or picture book showing frog lifecycle and ecosystem role (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to show their food web/food chain models\n   - Ask the class: *\"Where does the frog get the materials it needs to grow?\"* and *\"When a frog eats food, what happens to that food inside its body?\"*\n   - Highlight accurate observations: \"Yes! The frog's body breaks down the food and uses it for energy and to build new cells.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n\n   Use images, the photograph, and student work to define and discuss:\n\n   - **Producer:** An organism (like plants) that makes its own food using sunlight, water, and air. *Example: The grass the mosquito ate.*\n   - **Consumer:** An organism that eats other organisms to get energy. *Example: The frog is a consumer because it eats insects.*\n   - **Decomposer:** An organism (like bacteria or fungi) that breaks down dead matter and returns nutrients to the soil. *Example: Bacteria that break down a dead frog.*\n   - **Food Chain:** A sequence showing how energy moves from one organism to another (Sun → Plant → Mosquito → Frog → Heron).\n   - **Matter:** The material that makes up all living and nonliving things; it cycles through an ecosystem. *In our frog example, the mosquito's body is matter that becomes part of the frog's body.*\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph and Explore Activity (4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the frogs in the photograph: *\"This frog is a consumer. To survive, it needs to eat insects (mosquitoes, ants) that it catches. But the mosquito was a consumer too—it ate plants. Where did the plant get its energy? From the sun!\"*\n   - Draw a simple labeled chain on the board: **Sun → Plant → Mosquito → Frog → (Predator like a heron)**\n   - Emphasize: *\"Matter moves through this chain. The plant uses sunlight, water, and air to grow. The mosquito eats the plant. The frog eats the mosquito. All these organisms are connected!\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding Strategy (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask students to turn to a partner and explain: *\"In one sentence, tell your partner where the frog gets the energy to jump and live.\"*\n   - Listen in on conversations to gauge understanding\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Producer** | A living thing (like a plant) that makes its own food from sunlight, water, and air. |\n| **Consumer** | A living thing that eats other living things to get energy (like a frog eating a mosquito). |\n| **Decomposer** | A living thing (like bacteria or mushrooms) that breaks down dead plants and animals and returns nutrients to the soil. |\n| **Food Chain** | A sequence showing how energy moves from the sun through plants to animals. |\n| **Matter** | The \"stuff\" that makes up all living and nonliving things; it doesn't disappear—it changes form and moves through ecosystems. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify the frog as a consumer and describe what it eats\n- Students understand that matter comes from the sun (through plants) and cycles through organisms\n- Students recognize that decomposers are part of the cycle and return matter to the environment\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by modeling the complete cycle of matter and considering the frog's role in a broader ecosystem context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster board or butcher paper\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- Pre-drawn ecosystem template (soil, water, sun, sky sections) OR blank paper for free design\n- Optional: images of local wetland/pond ecosystems to reference\n- Sentence stems handout (optional, for writing support)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Create a Complete Ecosystem Model (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Assign or have students choose** a specific frog habitat: pond, wetland, swamp, or forest edge.\n\n2. **Students design a complete ecosystem model** that includes:\n   - **The sun** (energy source at the top)\n   - **Producers:** Plants that frogs' prey eat (grass, aquatic plants, insects' food sources)\n   - **Primary consumers:** Insects and small animals (mosquitoes, ants, small fish) that the frog eats\n   - **Secondary consumers:** The frog itself\n   - **Tertiary consumers:** Predators that eat frogs (heron, snake, turtle)\n   - **Decomposers:** Shown in the soil (bacteria, fungi)\n   - **Arrows showing matter movement** between all organisms\n\n3. **Use color coding or labels** to make matter movement clear:\n   - Green arrows = energy from sun to producers\n   - Yellow arrows = producers to consumers\n   - Orange arrows = consumers to other consumers\n   - Brown arrows = decomposition back to soil\n\n**Part 2: Write an Explanation (6 minutes)**\n\n4. **Students write a short paragraph (4-6 sentences)** using sentence stems such as:\n   - *\"In this ecosystem, the frog is a _____ because it eats _____.\"*\n   - *\"The mosquito in the frog's food chain gets energy from _____ by eating _____.\"*\n   - *\"When the frog dies, _____ will break down its body, returning matter to the _____.\"*\n   - *\"This model shows that matter moves through an ecosystem when _____ eats _____, and then _____ eats the _____.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask prompting questions: *\"What would happen to this ecosystem if all the frogs disappeared?\"* or *\"Where does that arrow come from, and why?\"*\n- Assist students in refining their understanding by asking them to justify their model choices\n- Provide sentence stems for students who need writing support\n- Encourage students to discuss their models in pairs before finalizing\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce a labeled ecosystem model showing the frog's role in matter movement\n- Students write an explanation connecting their model to the concept of matter cycling through an ecosystem\n- Students demonstrate understanding that matter comes from the sun, moves through food chains, and returns to the environment through decomposition\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of matter movement in ecosystems and the frog's role as a consumer.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Observe student discussions during Explore phase: Can they identify food sources and connections?\n- Listen to partner explanations during the Explain phase: Do they use vocabulary accurately?\n- Review food web/food chain diagrams: Do they show logical matter connections?\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5 minutes at end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide students with a prompt and ask them to write or draw a response:\n\n**Question Set:**\n1. *\"Look at this food chain: Sun → Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Hawk. Explain where the frog gets the matter (materials) it needs to grow and move. Use the word 'energy' in your answer.\"*\n\n2. *\"The frog eats 10 mosquitoes. What happens to the mosquitoes' bodies? Write what you think happens to this matter.\"*\n\n3. *\"If there were no decomposers in the frog's ecosystem, what would happen? Use complete sentences.\"*\n\n**Alternative Assessment (for students who prefer visuals):**\n- Provide a blank food chain diagram with \"Sun → Plant → ? → Frog → ?\" \n- Students fill in missing organisms and explain their choices\n\n**Success Criteria for Proficiency:**\n\n| Criteria | Proficient | Developing | Beginning |\n|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| **Identifies the frog's role as a consumer** | Student clearly identifies frog as a consumer and explains what it eats | Student identifies frog as a consumer but provides limited detail about diet | Student has difficulty identifying frog's feeding role |\n| **Explains matter movement** | Student describes how matter moves from sun through plants to the frog with accurate vocabulary | Student describes matter movement but uses imprecise language or minor misconceptions | Student shows minimal understanding of how energy/matter moves |\n| **Models ecosystem connections** | Food web/chain shows logical, accurate connections; decomposers included | Most connections are accurate; minor gaps in understanding | Food web/chain is incomplete or shows significant misconceptions |\n| **Uses scientific vocabulary** | Accurately uses producer, consumer, decomposer, food chain, and matter | Uses 2-3 terms correctly; occasional misuse | Limited or inaccurate vocabulary use |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly identify the frog as a consumer and trace matter back to the sun\n- Students explain that matter cycles through organisms and returns to the environment\n- Students create or complete a model showing how the frog fits into an ecosystem food chain/web\n- Students demonstrate understanding that decomposers are essential to the cycle of matter\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support for Struggling Learners:**\n\n1. **Simplified Food Chain:** Provide a pre-made food chain (Sun → Plant → Insect → Frog → Heron) and have students label each organism's role using a word bank (Producer, Consumer, Consumer, Consumer). Focus on just the main pathway rather than a complex web.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames and Word Banks:** During the Explain and Elaborate phases, provide students with partially completed sentences and vocabulary options to reduce cognitive load: *\"The frog is a _____ [producer/consumer] because it _____. It gets energy from _____.\"*\n\n3. **Reduced Writing Demand:** Allow students to draw their ecosystem model with minimal written explanation, or provide a template with blanks to fill in rather than requiring a paragraph.\n\n4. **Buddy System:** Pair struggling learners with stronger peers during the Explore phase so they can participate in model-building and benefit from peer explanations.\n\n**Challenge for Advanced Learners:**\n\n1. **Multi-Trophic Level Analysis:** Ask students to research and create a detailed wetland or pond food web with 8-10 organisms, clearly labeling trophic levels (producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, decomposers). Have them calculate energy transfer (if applicable to curriculum) or explain why some organisms can occupy multiple levels.\n\n2. **Real-World Scenario:** Present a scenario: *\"Humans drain a swamp to build a housing development. What happens to the frogs and other organisms in the food chains we studied? How does matter still cycle, and where does it go now?\"* Students write a detailed explanation or create a before-and-after ecosystem model.\n\n3. **Decomposer Deep Dive:** Have advanced students research specific decomposers (bacteria, fungi, earthworms) and create a detailed diagram showing how decomposers break down a frog's body and return specific nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon) to the soil and back to plants.\n\n4. **Digital Food Web Tool:** Introduce a digital tool (such as a food web simulator or interactive model) where students can manipulate ecosystem variables and observe how matter and energy flow change when populations shift.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Local Ecosystem Investigation:** Take students on a nature walk to a local pond, wetland, or stream (if available). Have them observe actual frogs or frog habitats, identify plants and insects they see, and sketch a real food chain that includes frogs. Back in the classroom, they can compare their local ecosystem to the model they created in the lesson.\n\n2. **Lifecycle Timeline:** Create a detailed illustrated timeline of a frog's life cycle (egg → tadpole → froglet → adult frog), showing at each stage what the organism eats and what eats it. Students can research and present how a tadpole's role in the food web differs from an adult frog's role.\n\n3. **Wetland Habitat Diorama or 3D Model:** Students design and build a three-dimensional representation of a frog ecosystem using craft materials, containers, and figures. Each component is labeled with its role (producer, consumer, decomposer), and students create a written guide explaining the flow of matter through their diorama.\n\n4. **Frog Population Simulation:** Using a classroom game or digital simulation, students model what happens to a frog population when key food sources (insects) increase or decrease, or when predators are removed. They track matter flow and discuss how ecosystems are interconnected.\n\n5. **Research Different Frog Species:** Students select a specific frog species native to your region or another habitat, research its diet, predators, and environmental needs, and present findings in relation to matter cycling in its specific ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Notes\n\nThis lesson directly addresses **5-LS2-1** by having students develop a model (food webs, food chains, ecosystem diagrams) that describes the movement of matter (food/energy) among plants (producers), animals (consumers), decomposers, and the environment. The frog serves as the focal organism, allowing students to trace matter from its source (the sun, through plants) through consumers and back to the environment via decomposers. Students move from concrete exploration (building physical models with string and cards) to abstract representation (explaining energy flow in writing), meeting the developmental needs of fifth graders.",
