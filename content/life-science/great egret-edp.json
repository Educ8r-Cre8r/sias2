  "content": "# NGSS Engineering Design Process Challenge\n\n## Visible Elements in Photo\n- A white egret (large wading bird) standing on stacked wooden logs\n- Gray-blue agave plant with thick, pointed leaves in the background\n- Scattered rocks and pebbles forming a garden bed\n- Green decorative frog sculpture on a wooden log\n- Various shrubs and flowering plants (yellow and green foliage)\n- Wooden fence structure and garden setting\n\n## Reasonable Inferences\n- **From the egret's posture and habitat**: Wading birds need stable, elevated resting spots above water or wet ground to avoid predators and stay dry while hunting.\n- **From stacked logs and rocks**: The garden uses natural materials to create perches and drainage zones, suggesting a design that supports wildlife while managing water flow.\n- **From dense vegetation nearby**: Birds require nearby shelter and vegetation for food sources and protection from weather.\n\n## Engineering Task\n\n### K-2\n**Build a Safe Landing Spot for Birds**\n\nYour job is to design and build a platform where birds can rest and stay dry. Use natural materials like sticks, small logs, and pebbles to create a sturdy perch. Your platform must be tall enough to keep a bird (or a toy bird) above the ground, and strong enough that it doesn't wobble when you gently tap it. Test it by placing a toy bird on top and checking if it stays balanced!\n\n**Success looks like**: Your platform stands at least 6 inches tall, doesn't tip over, and a toy bird can stand on it without sliding off.\n\n---\n\n### 3-5\n**Design a Waterfront Refuge Platform for Wading Birds**\n\nWading birds like egrets need safe resting spots in wet environments. Your challenge: design and build a platform using natural materials (sticks, logs, stones, bark) that:\n- **Height**: Raises a model bird at least 8 inches above the ground (to stay above water level)\n- **Stability**: Withstands a gentle 10-second \"wind test\" (light shaking) without tilting more than 15 degrees\n- **Drainage**: Includes gaps or spaces so water can drain through, preventing pooling\n- **Footprint**: Uses a base no larger than 12 inches × 12 inches\n\nTest your design by placing a small weighted object (tennis ball in a cup) on top and documenting what happens during the wind test. Modify your design if it fails, and re-test.\n\n**Success criteria**: Platform is stable, drains water, and supports the weight of your test object.\n\n## EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis phase fits because the photo shows a real environmental need (birds needing safe, stable resting places in wet habitats) without showing an existing solution strategy. Students must first understand *why* the problem matters before jumping to building. The visible egret and logs invite the question: \"Why does this bird need that spot?\" rather than \"How do we copy this design?\"\n\n## Suggested Materials\n\n- Small branches and twigs (collected from outdoors or craft bundles)\n- Wooden craft sticks or popsicle sticks\n- Small rocks, pebbles, and gravel\n- Small logs or bark pieces (available at garden centers)\n- Plastic toy bird or weighted test object (tennis ball, small cup of sand)\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Water spray bottle (for drainage test, grades 3-5 only)\n\n## Estimated Time\n\n- **K-2**: One 40-minute session (design + build + test)\n- **3-5**: Two 35-minute sessions (design + build in session 1; test, modify, re-test in session 2)\n\n## Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.A (Define the problem)** and **ETS1.B (Develop possible solutions)** by asking students to identify a real organism's need and prototype a structure that solves it, grounding engineering in observable, natural systems.",
