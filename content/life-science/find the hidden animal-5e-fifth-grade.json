ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity by presenting a visual puzzle that activates prior knowledge about animals and their environments.\n\n#### Materials\n- Printed or digitally displayed photograph (enlarged if possible)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"I notice, I wonder\" graphic organizer (teacher-prepared handout or displayed template)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display the Photograph:**\n- Project or display the image of rocks and pebbles on a large screen or printed poster where all students can see it clearly.\n- Do NOT tell students there are animals in the photo yet.\n\n**Pose the Challenge:**\nSay: \"This photograph looks like just rocks and dirt, but I'm hiding something from you. Your job is to look very carefully and find the animals hiding in this picture. You have 2 minutes to search—don't call out, just point to your neighbor or write down where you think you see something alive.\"\n\n**Facilitate Discussion with These Questions:**\n1. \"Did you find any animals? What did they look like, and where were they?\"\n2. \"Why do you think these animals would be hard to see? What colors and shapes do you notice?\"\n3. \"If you were a bird or a snake looking for lunch, would this be an easy or hard place to find animals? Why?\"\n4. \"What do you think animals need to do to stay safe in a place like this?\"\n\n**Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\nHave students complete an \"I notice, I wonder\" sheet:\n- *I notice:* Animals that blend in with rocks\n- *I wonder:* How do animals change their skin or fur to match where they live?\n\n#### Transition\n\"Today, we're going to explore how animals hide in their habitats and why this is important for their survival. Let's investigate this more closely.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents actively investigate camouflage and adaptation through a hands-on discovery activity.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Per student or pair:**\n  - A small container of mixed materials: craft paper torn into small pieces (tan, brown, gray, white), actual pebbles/rocks (if available), sticks, and leaves\n  - One colored paper animal cutout (pre-made by teacher: lizard, cricket, or beetle shape, 2-3 inches long, in bright colors like red, blue, or green)\n  - One matching colored paper animal cutout in camouflage colors (browns, tans, grays)\n- Shallow trays or baking pans\n- Timer\n- Observation sheets (template provided below)\n- Pencils\n\n#### Activity: \"Predator Search Game\"\n\n**Setup (Teacher prepares in advance):**\n1. Create two sets of animal cutouts: one brightly colored (unmotorized, easy to see) and one camouflaged (matching tan/brown/gray colors).\n2. Prepare small containers with mixed \"habitat materials\" (crumpled brown, tan, and gray paper; actual small pebbles; twigs; dried leaves).\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n**Round 1 – The Bright Animal (5 minutes):**\n1. \"You are a hungry predator. Your partner will hide ONE brightly colored animal somewhere in your habitat tray filled with rocks and materials.\"\n2. Partner hides the bright animal in the tray and says, \"Go!\"\n3. You search for 30 seconds. Mark on your observation sheet: Did you find it? How long did it take?\n4. Trade roles so your partner gets a turn.\n\n**Round 2 – The Camouflaged Animal (5 minutes):**\n1. Repeat the game, but this time use the camouflaged animal that matches the habitat colors.\n2. Mark on your observation sheet: Did you find it? How long did it take? Was this harder or easier?\n\n**Recording Sheet (Students complete):**\n\n| | Bright Animal | Camouflaged Animal |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Found it in 30 seconds?** | Yes / No | Yes / No |\n| **Time to find (estimate)** | ___ seconds | ___ seconds |\n| **Was it easy or hard to spot?** | Easy / Hard | Easy / Hard |\n| **Why do you think?** | | |\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate to each pair and observe their search process.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"What are you looking for? Does the animal's color help or hurt its chances of hiding?\"*\n- Do NOT tell them the answer; let them discover the difference in search time.\n- Ensure all students take a turn as both predator and hider.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students discover that the camouflaged animal takes longer to find than the bright animal.\n- Students begin to infer that matching colors help animals hide.\n- Students record observations that they can reference in the Explain phase.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nFormalize student discoveries with scientific vocabulary and connect findings back to the photograph.\n\n#### Materials\n- Completed observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Word cards for vocabulary (pre-made or written as you teach)\n- Picture examples of camouflaged animals in nature (optional visuals: frog on leaf, moth on bark, etc.)\n\n#### Activity: Teacher-Led Discussion & Instruction\n\n**Share Findings (5 minutes):**\n1. Ask pairs to share their results: \"How many of you found the camouflaged animal faster than the bright animal? How many found it was harder?\"\n2. Create a simple tally on chart paper showing the pattern.\n3. Guide students to notice: \"Most of us found the camouflaged animal was harder to spot. Why do you think that is?\"\n\n**Introduce Key Vocabulary with Definitions (7 minutes):**\n\nPresent each term with a student-friendly definition. Write on chart paper and keep posted:\n\n1. **Camouflage** – \"When an animal's color, pattern, or shape matches its environment so it's hard to see. It's like nature's invisible cloak!\"\n   \n2. **Adaptation** – \"A feature or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. Camouflage is one type of adaptation.\"\n   \n3. **Habitat** – \"The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. A rocky shore is a habitat.\"\n   \n4. **Predator** – \"An animal that hunts and eats other animals. You were the predator in our game!\"\n   \n5. **Prey** – \"An animal that is hunted and eaten by a predator. The hidden animal was the prey in our game.\"\n\n**Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n1. Display the original photograph again.\n2. \"Now, let's look back at the hidden animals in this photograph. Can you spot them?\"\n3. Point out or have students identify the lizards/insects and discuss: *\"How does this animal's color match the rocks? How does this help it survive?\"*\n4. Ask: *\"If a snake came looking for lunch, would it be easy to find this animal? Why or why not?\"*\n\n#### Check for Understanding\nAsk individual students:\n- \"Use the word 'camouflage' in a sentence about what we observed.\"\n- \"Why is camouflage an adaptation that helps animals survive?\"\n- \"Can you point to an animal in the photo that uses camouflage?\"\n\n#### Vocabulary\n- **Camouflage:** Color, pattern, or shape that helps an animal hide by blending with its environment\n- **Adaptation:** A feature or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds what it needs\n- **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals\n- **Prey:** An animal that is hunted and eaten by another animal\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students correctly use the five vocabulary terms in context.\n- Students can explain WHY camouflage is important (helps animals hide from predators or hide while hunting).\n- Students link the game activity to real animals in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply camouflage and adaptation concepts to a new context and think more deeply about how organisms interact in their habitat.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Per student or small group:**\n  - One white paper plate (represents a rocky habitat)\n  - Assorted craft materials: colored pencils, markers, small pieces of colored paper, glue stick, natural materials (small twigs, crumpled paper in habitat colors)\n  - Pre-drawn animal outline (teacher-provided template of a lizard, cricket, or mouse, blank and ready to decorate)\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase (for reference)\n- Example photo of a well-camouflaged animal in nature (optional reference image)\n\n#### Activity: \"Design an Adapted Animal\"\n\n**Activity Scenario:**\n\"Your job is to create an animal that MUST survive on a rocky shore like the one in our photo. You will design what this animal looks like based on the habitat it lives in. Your animal must be camouflaged to hide from predators. Use the colors and materials you have to make your animal blend in.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Directions:**\n\n1. **Choose Your Habitat Colors:**\n   - Look at the photograph again. What colors do you see most? (Brown, tan, gray, white)\n   - These are the colors your animal should match.\n\n2. **Design Your Camouflaged Animal:**\n   - You have an animal outline (provided by teacher).\n   - Color it using the habitat colors so it blends in with a rocky shore.\n   - You can add textures by gluing on small pieces of paper, twigs, or other materials to make it look bumpy like rocks.\n\n3. **Create Your Habitat:**\n   - Glue your animal onto the white paper plate.\n   - Glue down habitat materials (crumpled brown/gray paper, small pebbles if available, twigs) around your animal so it blends in.\n\n4. **Reflect:**\n   - Answer on the back: \"How does your animal's appearance help it survive on a rocky shore? How is it adapted to this habitat?\"\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: *\"Why did you choose those colors? How does your animal hide on the rocks? What predator might hunt your animal?\"*\n- Encourage students to reference the photograph for color and texture ideas.\n- Challenge advanced students to think about what the animal would eat in this habitat (elaborating the food web concept, tying to 5-LS2-1).\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students create a camouflaged animal design showing understanding of how color and texture relate to habitat.\n- Students explain in writing how their design helps the animal survive.\n- Students recognize that adaptation is not random—it matches the specific habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of camouflage, adaptation, and habitat through formative and summative strategies.\n\n#### Activity: Multi-Part Assessment\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- Observation of student participation during the predator search game (Can they identify the difference in camouflage effectiveness?)\n- Listening to student responses during Explain discussion (Can they use vocabulary correctly?)\n- Review of completed observation sheets and written reflections from Elaborate\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative, given at end of lesson):**\n\nProvide students with a printed or digital exit ticket to complete individually. Ask:\n\n1. **Vocabulary Check (Circle the correct answer):**\n   - \"When an animal's color matches its environment so it can hide, that is called ___.\"\n     - A) Hibernation   B) Camouflage   C) Migration   D) Evolution\n\n2. **Short Answer (Write 1-2 sentences):**\n   - \"Look at the photograph of rocks again. Explain how an animal that lives there might use camouflage to stay alive.\"\n\n3. **Application (Draw or write):**\n   - \"Draw a simple picture of an animal and its habitat. Label how the animal is camouflaged. What color is it? What does the habitat look like?\"\n\n4. **Reflection:**\n   - \"What was the most important thing you learned today about how animals adapt to their homes?\"\n\n#### Success Criteria\n\n**Students demonstrate understanding if they:**\n- Correctly identify at least one camouflaged animal in the photo and explain how its color helps it hide.\n- Use the vocabulary terms camouflage, adaptation, habitat, predator, and prey in context (verbally or in writing).\n- Explain that camouflage is a survival strategy (connects to predator-prey relationships).\n- Design or describe an animal that is adapted to match its habitat.\n- Show that camouflage is not random—it must match the specific environment.\n\n#### How to Determine if Learning Objectives Were Met\n- **Objective 1 (Identify & Explain Camouflage):** Review photo-identification accuracy and reasoning on exit ticket.\n- **Objective 2 (Describe Adaptation):** Listen to student explanations during Explain and Elaborate phases.\n- **Objective 3 (Develop a Model):** Assess the habitat model created during Elaborate and written reflection.\n- **Objective 4 (Use Vocabulary):** Review written work and observe verbal participation; check exit ticket vocabulary section.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce Vocabulary Load:**\n   - Focus on just three core terms: camouflage, habitat, and predator.\n   - Provide visual vocabulary cards with pictures and simplified definitions.\n   - Allow students to use a word bank on the exit ticket.\n\n2. **Simplified Explore Activity:**\n   - Pair the student with a strong partner for the predator search game.\n   - Pre-hide the animal in an easier location for their first round so they experience success.\n   - Use larger, more obvious camouflaged animals (high-contrast but still matching).\n\n3. **Observation Sheet Modification:**\n   - Provide a simpler chart with yes/no questions instead of open responses.\n   - Allow drawing instead of writing to record observations.\n   - Reduce the number of questions to two or three.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Food Chain Extension:**\n   - Ask: \"What would your camouflaged animal eat? Draw what it hunts. Now draw what would hunt your animal. Create a simple food chain.\"\n   - This connects to 5-LS2-1 (movement of matter among plants, animals, and the environment).\n\n2. **Camouflage Research Project:**\n   - Have students research a real animal that uses camouflage (praying mantis, stick insect, arctic hare, etc.).\n   - Create a poster or short presentation explaining: *What habitat does it live in? What does it eat? What hunts it? How does camouflage help?*\n\n3. **Design Challenge—Seasonal Adaptation:**\n   - Ask: \"What if the rocky shore changed and became snowy in winter? How would your animal need to change its appearance? Design what it would look like then.\"\n   - This introduces the concept that adaptations are specific to environment conditions.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Camouflage Hunt\" Field Trip or Outdoor Search:**\n   - Take students outside to look for camouflaged animals in your schoolyard (insects on bark, birds in bushes, etc.).\n   - Have them photograph or sketch animals they find and explain their camouflage in a journal.\n   - Reinforce habitat awareness and real-world application.\n\n2. **Create a Camouflage Demonstration Book:**\n   - Students create a simple book with 3–4 pages, each showing a different habitat (forest, desert, ocean, arctic).\n   - On each page, they draw or glue pictures of animals that are camouflaged in that habitat.\n   - Write a caption explaining how each animal is adapted to its environment.\n   - Share as a class book in the library.\n\n3. **Interactive Digital Game or Simulation:**\n   - Use free online camouflage games (e.g., \"Camouflage Game\" on PBS Learning Media or similar platforms).\n   - Students play to reinforce the concept that matching your surroundings helps you hide.\n   - Optional: Tie in predator-prey population dynamics if your program offers advanced modules.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson works best across two sessions—one 45-minute period for Engage and Explore, and another for Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. Alternatively, condense Elaborate or run it as a homework activity.\n- **Safety:** Ensure small pebbles or natural materials are clean and splinter-free. Supervise glue and scissors use.\n- **Preparation:** Pre-cut animal outlines, pre-make vocabulary word cards, and pre-print observation sheets before the lesson to save class time.\n- **Connection to 5-LS2-1:** This lesson introduces the concept of organisms interacting in their environment; emphasize that camouflage is part of how animals survive in a system with predators and prey.\n- **Vocabulary Retention:** Keep the vocabulary chart posted throughout the unit for reference. Reinforce terms in subsequent lessons about food chains, habitats, or ecosystems.",
