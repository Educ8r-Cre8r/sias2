ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the large live oak tree.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the live oak tree\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers (multiple colors)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Ask them to sit in a circle or gathering area facing the image.\n\n2. **Introduce with curiosity:** \"Look at this amazing tree! This tree is much, much older than you are—maybe even older than your grandparents! Let's discover what makes this tree so special and so strong.\"\n\n3. **Pose specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What parts of this tree do you see? Point and tell me what you notice.\" (Expect: branches, trunk, leaves, etc.)\n   - \"Why do you think the branches are so thick and strong? What job do they do?\"\n   - \"If you were a leaf on this tree, what would you need from the branches to stay safe and healthy?\"\n   - \"This tree has been alive for a very, very long time. How do you think it grew so big? What helped it grow?\"\n\n4. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if we wanted to build something that could hold up as many leaves as this tree does, what would we need to make it look like? What could we learn from this tree to help us build something strong?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking, scientists! Today we're going to explore how trees use their parts to stay alive and strong, just like this magnificent tree. Then we're going to design our own strong structure inspired by what we learn!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate tree structures through hands-on exploration and begin to understand how external parts function.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real tree branches (various sizes—collect beforehand from outside or use from craft stores): thick branches (about 12 inches long), thin branches (about 8 inches), twigs (about 4-6 inches)\n- Leaves (real or paper leaves cut in advance)\n- Tape (painter's tape or masking tape—NOT duct tape, which is too permanent)\n- Small baskets, paper cups, or small containers\n- Paper clips or clothespins (optional, for holding leaves)\n- Chart paper for recording observations\n- Colored pencils or crayons for drawing\n\n**Activity - Part A: Investigating Real Branches (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Small group setup:** Divide the class into 3-4 groups. Provide each group with a collection of branches (thick, medium, thin) and a cup or basket.\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Hold each branch. Feel how thick or thin it is. Is it strong or easy to bend?\"\n   - \"Let's pretend these paper leaves are real leaves that need to sit on the branch. Using tape, place some leaves on each branch—a thick one, a medium one, and a thin one.\"\n   - \"Now gently try to hold your branch level (flat like a table). Which branch can hold up the most leaves without bending too much? Which one bends easily?\"\n   - \"Draw a picture of what you discovered. Show which branch held up the leaves best.\"\n\n3. **Documentation:** Students draw a quick picture or mark on chart paper showing which branch worked best for holding leaves.\n\n**Activity - Part B: Building a Strong Structure (13 minutes)**\n\n1. **Challenge introduction:** \"Now you're going to be tree engineers! Trees use their thick, strong branches to hold up all their leaves. Can you build a structure using branches and tape that can hold up paper leaves?\"\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Use the thick branches as your main 'trunk and branches.' Tape them together to make a strong structure that stands up.\"\n   - \"Now add your paper leaves to the structure using tape or paper clips. How many leaves can your tree structure hold without falling over?\"\n   - \"If your structure starts to bend or fall, what can you change? Can you make it stronger?\"\n\n3. **Teacher Role:** Circulate and ask guiding questions without giving solutions:\n   - \"What happens when you add more leaves?\"\n   - \"How is your structure like the tree in the picture?\"\n   - \"What's making it stronger—the thick branch or the thin branch?\"\n   - \"What could you do if it's bending too much?\"\n\n4. **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n   - Students discover that thicker branches hold more weight and are stronger.\n   - Students recognize that the structure of branches matters for survival (holding leaves).\n   - Students build a standing structure that holds multiple leaves using tape and branches.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific explanations for what students discovered.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper (pre-drawn with labeled tree diagram)\n- Printed or displayed photograph of the live oak tree\n- Student structures from Explore phase\n- Picture cards or simple drawings of tree parts (trunk, branches, leaves, roots—optional)\n- Markers for labeling\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):** \n   - Invite 2-3 groups to briefly share which branches worked best and why.\n   - Ask the class: \"Why do you think the thick branches worked better?\"\n   - Record student ideas on chart paper.\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Instruction (10 minutes):**\n\n   Display the photograph again and point to each part as you introduce vocabulary:\n\n   - \"Every tree has special **external parts**—that means the parts we can see on the outside. Let me show you the parts of our tree in the picture.\"\n   \n   - **Point to the trunk:** \"This thick part is the **trunk**. It's like the tree's main body. It's very strong because it has to hold up all the branches and leaves.\"\n   \n   - **Point to the branches:** \"These are **branches**. They grow out from the trunk. The branches hold the leaves up high so they can get lots of sunlight. Branches are thick so they're strong enough to carry all those leaves!\"\n   \n   - **Point to the leaves:** \"These are **leaves**. Leaves help the tree eat and drink sunlight and water. They need to be held up by the branches so they can catch the sun.\"\n   \n   - **Point to or draw the roots below ground:** \"Under the ground, trees have **roots**. We can't see them in the picture, but they're there! Roots suck up water from the soil to help the tree grow. Roots also hold the tree in the ground so it doesn't blow over—kind of like the tree's feet!\"\n\n   - **Explain function:** \"All these parts work together. The trunk is strong. The branches hold up the leaves. The leaves catch sunlight. The roots drink water. Everything a tree needs to survive comes from its special parts!\"\n\n3. **Connection to Explore Activity (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to student-built structures. \"See? Your branches worked just like a real tree's branches! The thick ones held up more leaves because they were stronger. Real trees use thick branches for the same reason!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Show the photograph and ask students to point to and name tree parts.\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think trees need strong branches?\" (Listen for: to hold leaves, to keep them up in the sun)\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if a tree's branches were very thin?\" (Prompt if needed: they might break, they couldn't hold many leaves)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Trunk:** The big, thick part of a tree that grows from the ground and holds everything up.\n- **Branches:** The parts that stick out from the trunk and hold the leaves.\n- **Leaves:** The flat, green parts that catch sunlight and help the tree make food.\n- **Roots:** The parts underground that suck up water and hold the tree in place.\n- **External Parts:** The parts we can see on the outside of a plant or animal.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name at least 3-4 external parts of a tree.\n- Students understand that tree parts have jobs that help the tree survive.\n- Students see the connection between their structure-building activity and how real trees work.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing solutions inspired by tree structures.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Craft sticks (popsicle sticks, different thicknesses if available)\n- Tape (painter's tape, masking tape)\n- String or yarn\n- Paper or cloth \"leaves\" (pre-cut or students cut them)\n- Small weights (paper clips, washers, or small objects) to represent heavier loads\n- Design challenge worksheet or poster (teacher-created)\n- Chart paper showing the \"Design Challenge\"\n\n**Activity - Real-World Connection:**\n\n1. **Introduce the Challenge:** \"A playground near a school wants to build a shade structure that looks like a big tree. It needs to hold up a cloth roof that will keep kids cool and dry. The cloth is heavy, just like lots of leaves. How can engineers use what trees do to build a strong shade structure?\"\n\n2. **Design & Build Task (10 minutes):**\n   - \"Your job is to design a frame that can hold up the 'cloth roof' (paper or lightweight cloth). You can use craft sticks, string, and tape.\"\n   - \"Make it look like how a tree uses its trunk and branches—with a strong main part and supporting pieces.\"\n   - Students design and build a structure that mimics a tree's branching pattern to hold up a \"roof.\"\n\n3. **Test & Improve (5 minutes):**\n   - Gently place paper or lightweight cloth on top of the structure.\n   - Students test: Does it hold? Does it bend? Can we make it stronger?\n   - Ask: \"What did you copy from the tree to make your structure strong?\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Facilitate and praise problem-solving.\n   - Ask guiding questions: \"How is your structure like a real tree?\" \"What part is like the trunk?\" \"What parts are like branches?\"\n   - Encourage trial-and-error and iteration.\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students design a functional structure inspired by tree architecture.\n   - Students articulate how their design mimics natural structures.\n   - Students demonstrate understanding that thick, angled supports work better than thin, straight ones.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of tree structures and their functions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Can they identify which branches are stronger? Do they recognize the connection between thickness and strength?\n- Listen to discussions during Explain phase: Can students name tree parts and describe their functions?\n- Monitor Elaborate phase: Do students apply tree-structure ideas to their own designs?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple worksheet or ask them to respond orally. Include these prompts:\n\n1. **Draw or point to the parts:** \"Show me a tree. Label or point to: the trunk, branches, leaves, and roots.\"\n\n2. **Function question:** \"Why does a tree need strong branches? Draw or tell me.\"\n\n3. **Application question:** \"If you were building a structure to hold up something heavy, what would you copy from a tree? Why?\"\n\n4. **Observation question:** \"Look at the picture of the big oak tree again. How do you think this tree got so big and strong?\" (Expect: It grew over time, it had strong branches, it got sunlight and water, etc.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student can name at least 2 tree parts (trunk, branches, leaves).\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student can name all 4 parts (trunk, branches, leaves, roots) and explain one function (e.g., \"branches hold up leaves\").\n\n✓ **Advanced:** Student can explain how multiple tree parts work together for survival and can apply this understanding to design a structure (e.g., \"I used a thick stick for the trunk because trees use thick trunks to be strong\").\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Can they identify external parts? (Objective 1)\n- Can they explain how parts help trees survive? (Objective 2)\n- Did they successfully build/design a structure? (Objective 3)\n- Can they discuss growth over time? (Objective 4)\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-Label Visuals:** Provide students with a diagram of a tree with parts already labeled. During Explain phase, they match vocabulary words to parts rather than generating labels independently.\n\n2. **Simplified Explore Task:** Pair students with a peer or allow them to work with a teacher-supported group. Give them only 2 types of branches (thick vs. thin) rather than three, making the comparison clearer and less overwhelming.\n\n3. **Verbal Scaffolding:** Ask yes/no questions or multiple-choice questions during discussion:\n   - \"Is this part the trunk or the leaf?\"\n   - \"Do you think the thick branch or the thin branch can hold more leaves?\"\n   - Provide sentence frames: \"The _______ is strong because _______.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Design Task:** Challenge students to create a structure that can hold weight AND withstand a \"wind test\" (gentle push). Ask them to predict and test: \"Which shape is strongest against wind—straight branches or angled branches like in a tree?\"\n\n2. **Research & Compare:** Provide pictures of trees with different shapes (weeping willow, pine tree, oak, palm). Ask: \"How is the shape of this tree different? Why might that shape help it survive in its environment?\" Connect to real-world adaptation.\n\n3. **Roots Investigation:** Have students research or discuss (with teacher guidance): \"What do you think tree roots look like? How are roots like branches?\" Create a full-plant model showing both above-ground and below-ground parts.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Tree Age & Growth Investigation:** Bring in a cross-section of a tree trunk (log slice, if available, or show pictures). Discuss tree rings. \"Each ring shows one year of growth. Count the rings to find out how old this tree is. How many years older is it than you?\" This extends understanding of growth over time and connects to real data.\n\n2. **Design a Tree for a New Home:** \"A family is moving to a sunny, windy place. They want to plant a tree outside their house. Using what you know about tree parts, draw or build a tree that would work well in a windy, sunny spot. What would its trunk and branches look like? Why?\" Students apply learning to a new scenario.\n\n3. **Tree Parts Hunt & Journal:** Take students outside for a nature walk. Have them collect (or observe and draw) different tree parts: bark rubbings, leaves of different shapes, twigs, roots. Create a classroom \"Tree Parts Collection\" and discuss how different trees' parts are similar or different. This builds observational skills and deeper understanding of variation in plants.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
