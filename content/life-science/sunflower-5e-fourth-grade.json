Identify and name the external structures of a seed and explain what each part does to help the plant survive.\n2. Describe the sequence of events in a plant's life cycle from seed to seedling, using observations and evidence.\n3. Explain how a seed's protective structures help keep the developing plant safe until it is ready to grow.\n4. Make predictions about how a plant's structures help it survive and grow in its environment.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the sunflower seedling (or printed copies, 1 per student)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Individual whiteboards and dry-erase markers (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the seedling image on the board or distribute printed copies. Let students observe silently for 15-20 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Facilitate Curiosity-Building Discussion:**\n   - Ask: \"What do you notice about this tiny plant? What parts can you see?\"\n   - Ask: \"Where did this plant come from? What was it before it looked like this?\"\n   - Ask: \"Do you see anything protecting the very top of the plant? What do you think that hard, bumpy part is?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why would a plant need a hard shell around its seed? What might it be protecting?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \n   - Display this on chart paper: \"I wonder... what happens inside a seed before it starts to grow?\"\n   - Have students sketch and label their predictions on whiteboards or paper: \"My Seed Prediction.\" Collect these to review later.\n\n4. **Wonder Wall:** Post a large piece of chart paper titled \"Our Seed Questions.\" Record 2-3 student-generated questions such as, \"How does a seed know when to start growing?\" or \"What's inside the hard seed coat?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate real seeds to discover the hidden structures that help plants survive and grow.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Soaked bean seeds (lima beans or sunflower seeds soaked overnight in water), 3-4 per group\n- Small bowls of water\n- Paper towels\n- Plastic spoons or craft sticks\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per pair)\n- Student Investigation Sheet (provided below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity: Seed Structure Investigation**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Observe the Outside:** Place your soaked seed on a paper towel. Using a magnifying glass, carefully look at the outside. Draw what you see on your investigation sheet. Label anything you notice: Is it smooth? Bumpy? What color is it?\n\n2. **Feel the Seed:** Gently touch the seed coat (the hard outside layer). Describe what it feels like in the \"My Observations\" box: Is it hard? Soft? Wrinkly?\n\n3. **Peel It Open Carefully:** Using your fingernail or a spoon, very gently peel away the seed coat. **Be careful—the plant parts inside are delicate!** Place the coat aside.\n\n4. **Investigate the Inside:** Now look at what was hiding under the coat. You should see a tiny plant curled up inside! \n   - Can you find a tiny root (the pointed part)?\n   - Can you find a tiny stem?\n   - Can you find tiny leaves?\n   - Draw what you see and label these three parts.\n\n5. **Record Your Findings:** Complete the Investigation Sheet:\n   - **What did the seed coat look like on the outside?**\n   - **Why do you think the seed needed this hard coat?**\n   - **What parts of a plant did you find inside the seed?**\n   - **Draw and label: the seed coat, the tiny root, the tiny stem, and the tiny leaves.**\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** \n\"The seedling in our photograph started out looking exactly like the seed you just opened. The hard seed coat protected the tiny plant inside. Now the seed has started to grow, so the seed coat is splitting apart. The root is growing down into the soil, and the stem is growing up toward the light.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What does that part remind you of?\" \"Why would a plant need roots before it has leaves?\"\n- Help students handle seeds gently; provide extra soaked seeds if one becomes damaged.\n- Encourage peer observation: \"What did your partner find? Is yours the same?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the names of structures; let them discover and describe first.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will identify and sketch at least 3 internal seed structures (root, stem, leaves/cotyledons).\n- Students will make observations about the seed coat and hypothesize its function.\n- Students will complete the Investigation Sheet with drawings and descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Labeled diagram of seed structure (teacher-prepared, or display projected image)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures (root, stem, seed coat, cotyledon/leaf)\n- Student copies of labeled diagram\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask pairs to share one discovery: \"What was the most surprising thing you found inside your seed?\"\n   - Record key observations on chart paper under the heading \"What We Discovered About Seeds.\"\n   - Affirm observations: \"Great! You noticed the seed coat is hard. Let's learn why that's so important.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Display each labeled diagram and introduce terms with student-friendly definitions:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Seed Coat:** The hard, protective shell on the outside of a seed that keeps the tiny plant safe and dry until it's ready to grow.\n   - **Root:** The part of a plant that grows downward into the soil to take in water and nutrients (food) that help the plant grow.\n   - **Stem:** The plant part that grows upward and holds up the leaves and flowers. It also carries water from the roots to the leaves.\n   - **Cotyledon (or Seed Leaf):** A tiny leaf stored inside the seed that gives the baby plant its first food for growing.\n   - **Life Cycle:** The different stages a plant goes through during its life, starting as a seed and growing into a full plant.\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Project the seedling image again. \n   - Point out: \"See how the seed coat is starting to crack open? That's because the tiny plant inside is growing and pushing its way out. The root has already grown down into the soil (you can't see it in this picture). The stem is pushing up toward the light, and soon the first leaves will unfold.\"\n   - Ask: \"Which structures from inside the seed can we see in this photograph?\" (stem, emerging leaves/bud, hint of seed coat)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"If a seed didn't have a seed coat, what might happen to the tiny plant inside?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why does a root need to grow down before the leaves grow up?\"\n   - Accept student responses and affirm correct thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use vocabulary terms to describe seed and seedling structures.\n- Students will explain that the seed coat protects the developing plant.\n- Students will understand that different plant parts have different jobs that help the plant survive.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper for plant life cycle diagram (11\" × 14\" or larger)\n- Colored pencils, markers, crayons\n- Magazines for cutting pictures of plants (optional)\n- Glue sticks\n- Ruler (optional)\n- Reference chart from Explain phase (vocabulary and labeled diagram)\n\n**Activity: Create a Plant Life Cycle Illustration**\n\n**Student Task:**\n\nWorking in pairs or small groups, create a labeled diagram showing the stages of a plant's life cycle from seed to seedling to mature plant. \n\n**Directions:**\n1. Divide your paper into 4 boxes (like a comic strip).\n2. Label each stage:\n   - **Stage 1: Seed** — Draw the seed with the seed coat. Label the hidden parts inside (root, stem, leaves).\n   - **Stage 2: Sprouting** — Draw the seed coat beginning to crack. Show the root starting to grow down and the stem starting to grow up.\n   - **Stage 3: Seedling** — Draw the seedling as shown in our photograph. Show the root in the soil, the stem above ground, and the first leaves opening.\n   - **Stage 4: Young Plant** — Draw what you think the plant will look like when it's bigger. Include roots, stem, and leaves.\n3. Use arrows to show the direction of growth (roots down, stems and leaves up).\n4. Label at least 3 plant parts in each drawing: seed coat, root, stem, leaves.\n5. Add one sentence under each stage explaining what is happening: Example: \"The seed coat cracks open because the plant inside is growing and needs space.\"\n\n**Real-World Connection:** \n\"Every plant you see outside started as a tiny seed with a protective coat. Understanding how seeds work helps gardeners and farmers know how to grow food, flowers, and trees.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Display the reference chart so students can check vocabulary.\n- Ask questions to prompt thinking: \"What happens to the seed coat as the plant grows? Where should the root be in each stage? Why?\"\n- Encourage students to use both drawings and words.\n- Circulate and take photos of student work for documentation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create a labeled, sequential diagram showing plant life cycle stages.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that plant structures have specific functions across the life cycle.\n- Students will use 3+ vocabulary terms correctly in their illustrations and captions.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Observe student predictions in Engage phase and compare to understanding after Elaborate.\n- Check Investigation Sheets for accuracy of observations and reasoning.\n- Listen to discussions during Explain share-out to assess vocabulary use and conceptual understanding.\n- Review Life Cycle diagrams for labeled structures and sequential understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nDistribute an exit ticket with the following prompts (choose format based on student level):\n\n**For all students:**\n1. **Drawing + Sentence:** Draw a seed and label the seed coat. Write one sentence explaining what the seed coat does.\n\n2. **Multiple Choice:** Which structure helps a plant drink water from the soil?\n   - A. Seed coat\n   - B. Stem\n   - C. Root\n   - D. Leaf\n\n3. **Open Response:** Explain why a seed needs to have a hard coat on the outside before it starts to grow. Use the word \"protect\" in your answer.\n\n4. **Prediction:** If you planted a seed tomorrow, which structure do you think would come out of the soil first—the root or the stem? Why?\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- Student correctly identifies at least 2 seed structures.\n- Student explains one function of the seed coat (protection, keeping it dry, etc.).\n- Student demonstrates understanding of life cycle sequence (seed → sprouting → seedling → plant).\n- Student uses at least 2 vocabulary terms correctly (seed coat, root, stem, etc.).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- 85% of students will correctly identify the seed coat and explain its protective function.\n- 80% of students will accurately label a diagram with at least 3 plant structures.\n- 75% of students will explain the relationship between root growth and survival (roots absorb water).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Pre-teach Vocabulary:** Before Explain phase, show real seeds and seedlings. Point out structures and say the words repeatedly in context. Use tactile learning: students feel the seed coat, feel the thin root, etc.\n\n2. **Simplified Investigation Sheet:** Provide an outline sheet where students only draw and label 2 structures (seed coat and root) rather than 4-5. Include word banks with pictures for each term.\n\n3. **Pair with Peer:** Assign a strong reader/observer to work with the student. Roles: one manipulates the seed gently while the other records observations. Roles switch halfway through.\n\n4. **Chunked Life Cycle Diagram:** Instead of 4 stages, have students focus on just 2: \"Seed\" and \"Growing.\" Provide a template with spaces already outlined. Teacher or aide helps label during small group work.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extended Inquiry:** Provide sprouted seeds at different stages (1-day, 3-day, 1-week growth). Have students measure and compare root and stem growth. Create a graph: \"How fast do roots grow compared to stems?\" Record data daily over a week and present findings.\n\n2. **Research Extension:** Assign research on different seeds: \"Why are some seeds big and some tiny? Do bigger seeds grow into bigger plants?\" Students present findings to the class with pictures/diagrams.\n\n3. **Claim-Evidence-Reasoning:** Ask students to write: \"Claim: Why do you think plants produce so many seeds instead of just one? Evidence: What did you learn about seeds that supports your idea? Reasoning: Explain your thinking.\" This connects to reproduction and survival.\n\n4. **Design a Seed:** \"Design a seed that could survive in a desert or on a mountain. What structures would it need? Draw and label it. Explain how each structure helps it survive.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Germination Observation Station (1-2 weeks):**\n   - Plant soaked beans in clear cups with moist paper towels. Students observe and sketch daily (or every 3 days). Track root length, stem height, and leaf development. Create a growth chart: \"How much did the root grow this week?\" Compare to classmates' plants. Display on a classroom bulletin board. *Connection: Life cycles, growth, adaptation.*\n\n2. **Plant Parts Exploration Walk:**\n   - Take students on a nature walk around the school or neighborhood. Find real plants and identify roots (if visible), stems, leaves, flowers, and seeds. Take photos or sketch. Bring back samples (with permission) and press them in a class book: \"Plants Around Our School.\" Label each plant part. *Connection: Real-world application, biodiversity.*\n\n3. **Seed Sorting and Classification Activity:**\n   - Collect different seeds (beans, sunflower, pumpkin, corn, rice, grass). Have students sort by size, color, texture, and shape. Create a chart: \"What's the Same? What's Different?\" Discuss: \"Do seeds that look different grow into different plants? How do we know?\" *Connection: Observation, classification, plant diversity.*\n\n4. **Write a Seed's Story:**\n   - Students write from the perspective of a seed (narrative, first-person): \"My Life as a Seed\" or \"A Day in My Seed Coat.\" Include what the seed \"feels,\" \"sees,\" and \"needs\" to survive. Include vocabulary words. Illustrate and share. *Connection: Life cycle, empathy for organisms, vocabulary reinforcement.*\n\n5. **Investigate: Do All Seeds Need Water to Grow?**\n   - Simple experiment: Plant seeds in dry soil in one cup, moist soil in another, water-logged soil in a third. Predict which will grow best. Observe weekly. Record: germination time, root growth, leaf growth. Discuss why water matters. *Connection: Plant needs, experimental design, scientific reasoning.*\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Advance Preparation:** Soak beans or sunflower seeds the night before Explore phase (8-12 hours in water). Have extras on hand in case some are damaged.\n- **Safety Reminder:** Students should wash hands after handling seeds and soil.\n- **Accessibility:** For students with fine motor challenges, use larger seeds (sunflower, bean) and provide seeds that are already partially soaked to make opening easier. Consider pre-cutting the seed coat for the student to peel.\n- **Engagement Tip:** Bring in a live sunflower plant (even a small one) during Explain phase if possible. Point out: \"This plant started as the tiny seed you just opened!\"\n- **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a colorful classroom anchor chart with pictures of each vocabulary term. Leave it displayed for the full unit to reinforce vocabulary in context.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson honors the photograph by centering it as the observed reality of what happens after seeds sprout—making visible the growth process and prompting students to investigate the internal structures that make that growth possible.**",
