ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about mushrooms and activate prior knowledge about living things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of fairy inkcaps (printed or displayed on screen)\n- Real mushroom specimens (if available from grocery store or garden center) OR a fresh image of the mushrooms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it large. Ask students to sit in a circle where all can see clearly.\n\n2. **Ask these specific questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What color is it? What shape?\"\n   - \"Do you think this is a plant or something else? Why?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this is growing? Why would it grow there?\"\n   - \"What do you think this living thing needs to stay alive—like we need food and water?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Say, \"I wonder why these little umbrella-shaped things are growing right here in this pile of old wood. Let's find out what mushrooms need to survive!\"\n\n4. **Encourage students to touch a real mushroom sample** (if available) and describe how it feels—soft, smooth, a little damp. Ask: \"Is it hard like a rock or soft like a sponge?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an investigation to discover where mushrooms like to live and what they need to grow!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate mushroom habitats and what mushrooms need to survive through observation and simple hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic containers or sandwich bags (several per small group)\n- Moist soil or potting mix\n- Decaying wood chips, bark pieces, or mulch\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Mushroom spawn (optional; or use photos of mushrooms growing in different places)\n- Pictures/photos of mushrooms in different habitats (garden, forest floor, on logs, in shade, in sun)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Student observation journals or drawing paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Kindergarten-Friendly Investigation Steps:**\n\n1. **Divide students into small groups** (3-4 per group). Assign each group a \"mushroom habitat exploration task.\"\n\n2. **Group 1: The Dark Place Test**\n   - Fill one container with damp soil and mushroom habitat material\n   - Place it in a dark corner (under a table, in a closet, or covered with a cloth)\n   - Place an identical container in a sunny window\n   - Students predict: \"Where will mushrooms like to grow?\"\n   - Check daily for one week and observe any growth\n\n3. **Group 2: The Wet vs. Dry Test**\n   - Fill two containers with decaying wood and soil\n   - Keep one damp (spray with water daily)\n   - Keep one dry\n   - Students observe which one seems like a better home for mushrooms\n\n4. **Group 3: Picture Study**\n   - Show photographs of mushrooms growing in different places\n   - Students sort pictures into two groups: \"Good homes for mushrooms\" and \"Bad homes for mushrooms\"\n   - Look for patterns: Are they in dark places? Wet places? On dead wood?\n\n5. **Group 4: Sensory Exploration**\n   - Provide safe mushroom samples and decaying wood (mushroom habitat material)\n   - Students observe and touch, describing in simple words\n   - Draw or point to what mushrooms might \"like\": darkness, moisture, old wood\n\n**What Students Record/Document:**\n- Daily observations in picture journals (draw what they see)\n- Simple checkmarks on a class chart: \"Is it damp?\" \"Is it dark?\" \"Did we see mushrooms?\"\n- Drawings of mushroom homes vs. places mushrooms don't like\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Is it wet or dry?\" \"Is it bright or dark?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answers—let them observe and discover\n- Help students use sensory language: \"Describe how that feels. Is it squishy?\"\n- Record student observations on chart paper for later discussion\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents discover that mushrooms:\n- Grow better in dark places\n- Need moisture/dampness\n- Grow on or in dead wood/soil, not in sunny, dry places\n- Need specific conditions to survive, just like plants and animals\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect observations to formal understanding of living things and their needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with observations from Explore phase\n- Simple labeled diagram of a mushroom (cap, stem, gills)\n- Picture cards of mushroom habitats\n- Picture of a mushroom environment (dark, damp, on wood)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students together** and review the photograph from Engage phase.\n\n2. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask each small group to share ONE thing they discovered\n   - Write their discoveries on chart paper as simple statements:\n     - \"Mushrooms like dark places\"\n     - \"Mushrooms need water\"\n     - \"Mushrooms grow on old wood\"\n\n3. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Use simple language and show pictures for each term.\n\n   - **Mushroom:** A living thing that is not a plant. It has no leaves or roots. It grows in dark, damp places.\n   - **Habitat:** The place where a living thing lives. A mushroom's habitat is dark, damp soil or wood.\n   - **Decompose/Decay:** When dead things break down and fall apart. Mushrooms help dead wood turn into soil.\n   - **Living thing:** Anything that grows, needs food and water, and changes over time. Mushrooms are living things!\n   - **Needs:** Things a living thing must have to survive (water, food, air, a safe home).\n\n4. **Make Connections Back to Photo & Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"See all this dark, wet, broken wood? This is a perfect mushroom home!\"\n   - Ask: \"What did we find out mushrooms need? Let's check our chart.\"\n   - Compare to students: \"We need water and food. Mushrooms need water and old wood. We both need homes!\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask simple yes/no questions: \"Do mushrooms like sunny places?\" (no) \"Do mushrooms like wet places?\" (yes)\n   - Use thumbs up/down: Show a picture and ask, \"Is this a good home for mushrooms?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Mushroom:** A living thing (not a plant) that grows in dark, wet places and eats dead wood\n- **Habitat:** A home where a living thing lives (mushroom habitat = damp, dark place with dead wood)\n- **Decompose:** To break down and fall apart (mushrooms help dead wood decompose)\n- **Living thing:** Something that grows, needs water and food, and lives in a home\n- **Needs:** Things a living thing must have to survive (water, food, a safe place)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents understand that:\n- Mushrooms are living things with basic needs (water, darkness, dead organic material)\n- All living things need homes (habitats) where their needs are met\n- Mushrooms need very different things than plants or animals students know (they don't need sunlight)\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new context and think about mushrooms' role in nature.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Paper bags or containers (if growing mushrooms at home)\n- Simple picture cards showing different organisms and their needs\n- Drawing paper and crayons\n- Optional: Kit for home mushroom growing (Oyster mushroom or other beginner kit)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Choose ONE of these elaboration options based on available materials:**\n\n**Option A: \"Design a Mushroom Hotel\"**\n1. Show students pictures of different \"homes\" for animals (bird nests, ant farms, beehives)\n2. Ask: \"What would a good mushroom home look like?\"\n3. Guide students to design/draw the perfect mushroom habitat on paper\n4. Students should include: dark color, water drops, pieces of old wood\n5. Students label or tell you what makes it good for mushrooms\n6. Display as a class gallery and discuss each design\n\n**Option B: \"Mushroom vs. Plant\"**\n1. Create a simple chart with pictures (not words, since it's kindergarten)\n2. One side shows a plant; other side shows a mushroom\n3. Ask questions: \"Does this need sunlight?\" \"Does this like wet places?\" \"Does this grow on dead wood?\"\n4. Students point to pictures or move to show which living thing fits each need\n5. Reinforce: \"Plants and mushrooms are different living things with different needs!\"\n\n**Option C: \"Everyone Needs a Home\"**\n1. Show pictures of different living things in their homes (bird in nest, fish in water, child in house, mushroom on wood)\n2. Ask: \"What does each living thing need to stay safe and healthy?\"\n3. Discuss how mushroom habitats are special compared to other homes\n4. Students draw their own animal home and a mushroom home side-by-side\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide thinking with questions: \"Why did you put a dark color in your design?\" \"What does the mushroom need?\"\n- Encourage comparison and critical thinking: \"How is a mushroom home different from a bird's nest?\"\n- Validate all responses—focus on reasoning, not correct answers\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents demonstrate understanding by:\n- Explaining why mushrooms need dark, damp places with dead wood\n- Comparing mushroom needs to other living things\n- Creating/describing a habitat suited to mushroom survival\n- Using vocabulary (habitat, needs, living thing) in context\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of mushroom needs and how mushrooms are living things.\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Do they notice dampness, darkness, and wood in successful mushroom habitats?\n- Listen to group discussions: Are they using language like \"wet,\" \"dark,\" \"dead wood\"?\n- Watch responses during Explain: Do thumbs-up/down answers show understanding of habitat conditions?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nUse **ONE of these age-appropriate assessment strategies:**\n\n**Option 1: Picture Sorting (Most Appropriate for Kindergarten)**\n- Show three pictures: (1) mushroom in dark, wet wood, (2) mushroom in sunny dry grass, (3) mushroom in damp mulch\n- Ask: \"Which pictures show good homes for mushrooms?\"\n- Success: Students point to/circle pictures 1 and 3\n- Follow-up: \"Why is this a good home?\" (Listen for: \"It's dark,\" \"It's wet,\" \"It's got dead stuff\")\n\n**Option 2: Simple Oral Question**\nAsk each student individually:\n- \"What do mushrooms need to live?\" (Expect answers like: water, dark places, dead wood, dampness)\n- \"Where do you think mushrooms like to grow?\" (Expect: dark places, on wood, in wet soil)\n- \"Is a mushroom a living thing like a plant?\" (Expect: \"No, it's different\" or \"Yes, but needs different things\")\n\n**Option 3: Draw and Tell**\n- Give each student a blank paper\n- Prompt: \"Draw a good home for a mushroom\"\n- Listen to their explanation: Does it include darkness, moisture, and dead material?\n- Success: Student indicates at least two conditions mushrooms need (dark + damp, or wood + wet, etc.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least TWO needs of mushrooms (water/dampness, darkness, dead wood)\n- ✓ Student recognizes mushrooms are living things (use \"needs\" language)\n- ✓ Student can explain why a specific location is/isn't good for mushrooms\n- ✓ Student uses observation words (wet, dark, damp, soft, broken)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most kindergarteners will recognize mushrooms need dark, damp places\n- Students will begin to understand that different living things have different needs\n- Students will see mushrooms as special living things, not plants\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support for Struggling Learners:**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:**\n   - Use only the simplest terms: \"Mushrooms like wet and dark.\" \"Mushrooms need a home like we do.\"\n   - Avoid the word \"decompose\"—use \"break down\" or \"old wood becomes food\"\n\n2. **Hands-On Sorting:**\n   - Provide physical objects to sort rather than pictures: real damp soil, dry sand, pieces of wood, a dark box, a sunny spot\n   - Let students physically place items where mushrooms would go\n\n3. **Peer Partnerships:**\n   - Pair struggling students with stronger observers during Explore phase\n   - Assign simpler observation tasks: \"Just look and tell me: Is it wet? Is it dark?\"\n\n**Challenge for Advanced Learners:**\n\n1. **Extended Observation:**\n   - Ask advanced students to predict: \"What do you think will happen if we add MORE water?\" or \"What if we put it in the light?\"\n   - Have them check predictions weekly and report back\n\n2. **Comparison Questions:**\n   - \"How is a mushroom like a pet? How is it different?\"\n   - \"Can we grow mushrooms on a sunny windowsill like plants? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What other things grow in dark, damp places?\"\n\n3. **Mushroom Research:**\n   - Provide picture books about different types of mushrooms (toadstools, button mushrooms, shelf fungi)\n   - Ask: \"Do all mushrooms look the same? What is different? What is the same?\"\n   - Extend to: \"Where do YOUR mushrooms grow in your house or yard?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Home Mushroom Growing Kit:**\n   - Send home simple, ready-to-fruit mushroom kits (Oyster mushroom kits are safest and easiest)\n   - Provide parent letter explaining how to create dark, damp conditions\n   - Students check growth at home and share pictures or drawings with class\n   - Closes the loop: \"We observed mushrooms, now we can grow them!\"\n\n2. **Mushroom Hunt Exploration:**\n   - Take a nature walk to observe mushrooms in their natural habitats (after rain or in very damp areas)\n   - Bring magnifying glasses and notebooks to sketch what students see\n   - Discuss: \"What conditions did we find mushrooms in? Why?\"\n   - Compare real mushrooms to classroom observations and photograph\n\n3. **Life Cycle Story:**\n   - Create a simple 4-picture sequencing story: (1) Spores land on wet wood, (2) Darkness and dampness, (3) Mushroom begins to grow, (4) Full mushroom appears\n   - Students arrange pictures in order and tell the story\n   - Introduces the idea that mushrooms change and grow, just like other living things\n   - Connects to concept that all living things have life cycles\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- Mushrooms are best observed during/after rainy seasons or in consistently damp environments\n- If growing mushrooms indoors, check moisture daily—mushroom caps flatten if too dry\n- Never use wild mushrooms for tasting or eating with young students; focus on observation only\n- This lesson sets the stage for later grades where students will learn mushrooms are fungi (not plants) and their role in decomposition\n- Kindergarteners may need repeated exposure to these concepts—revisit the photograph and observations across weeks",
