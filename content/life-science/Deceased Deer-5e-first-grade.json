ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by introducing the photograph and activating prior knowledge about animals and habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of the deceased deer (large format, 11×14 inches or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pointer or stick to direct attention\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector and give students 30 seconds of silent looking time. Say: *\"Look carefully at this picture. What do you notice? What do you see?\"*\n\n2. **Facilitate a brief observation discussion** using these specific questions:\n   - *\"What animal is this? How do you know?\"* (Guide to: This is a deer; we can see four legs, ears, and a long body.)\n   - *\"Where do you think this deer lived? What do you see around it?\"* (Expected: dirt, grass, leaves, outdoor habitat.)\n   - *\"What do you notice about the deer's body? What parts do you see?\"* (Expected: legs, ears, nose, fur, tail.)\n   - *\"Why do you think the deer is lying down? What might the deer be doing?\"*\n\n3. **Introduce a wonder prompt:** *\"I wonder what this deer needed to stay healthy and strong when it was alive? Turn and talk to a partner: What do YOU need to stay healthy?\"* (Allow 1-2 minutes of partner talk; listen for answers about food, water, sleep, air.)\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper titled \"What Do Living Things Need?\" Save this for the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to learn about what animals like deer need to survive, and we'll discover that all animals go through changes in their lives—just like you do!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what animals need to survive through a hands-on sorting and habitat-building activity.\n\n**Materials (per student pair):**\n- Picture cards (pre-printed, 3×4 inches): \n  - 4 cards showing survival needs: food (grass, berries), water (stream), shelter (tree/cave), space/open ground\n  - 4 distractor cards: TV, bicycle, toy house, book\n- One sheet of construction paper (8.5×11)\n- Glue stick\n- Small paper bag or envelope for sorting activity\n- Markers or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Sorting Activity (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute picture cards** to each student pair in a mixed-up pile in the paper bag.\n\n2. **Give clear directions:** *\"Look at all your pictures. Some show things an animal like a deer needs to LIVE and stay healthy. Some show things we use that animals don't need. Your job: Sort your pictures into two piles—'Animals Need This' and 'Animals Don't Need This.' Talk with your partner about why you think so.\"*\n\n3. **Circulate and listen.** Ask guiding questions:\n   - *\"Why does a deer need water?\"*\n   - *\"Can a deer use a bicycle? Why not?\"*\n   - *\"What would happen if a deer had no shelter?\"*\n\n4. **Have pairs report out one card at a time** (2-3 cards). Ask: *\"Why did you put this in that pile?\" Listen for reasoning.*\n\n**Part B: Habitat Building (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Transition:** *\"Now you're going to build a home for a deer! This is called a habitat. You'll show all the things a deer needs to live.\"*\n\n2. **Distribute construction paper and glue sticks.** Instruct: *\"Take your 'Animals Need This' cards and glue them onto your paper to make a picture of a place where a deer could be healthy and safe. You can draw other things too!\"*\n\n3. **Provide sentence frame on the board:** *\"A deer needs _________ to survive.\"*\n\n4. **Students glue and add drawings** (trees, grass, water, space to run).\n\n5. **Teacher Role:** Circulate and ask open-ended questions:\n   - *\"Tell me about your deer's home. What did you include?\"*\n   - *\"Why did you put water in this habitat?\"*\n   - *\"Where do you think this deer would sleep?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Sorted pictures correctly, showing understanding that animals need food, water, shelter, and space.\n- Created a visual habitat showing at least 2-3 survival needs.\n- Verbally explained why they included certain elements.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to life science concepts using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with \"What Do Living Things Need?\" from Engage phase\n- Large poster board or chart paper with labeled diagram: \"What Deer Need to Survive\" (prepared in advance with pictures/drawings)\n- Picture cards of a young fawn and adult deer (if available)\n- Sentence frame poster: \"The _________ helps the deer survive.\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share out from Explore phase (5 minutes):** Invite 2-3 student pairs to briefly show their habitats. Each pair says: *\"We included _________ because the deer needs it to _________.\"*\n\n2. **Introduce survival vocabulary (7-8 minutes):** Display the photograph again. Point to elements and define vocabulary using kid-friendly language:\n\n   **Vocabulary List:**\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. It has everything the animal needs. (Point to the ground, plants, and space in the photograph.)\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy. (Say: \"The deer survived by finding food and water in this habitat.\")\n   - **Body parts:** The different pieces that make up an animal's body. (Point to the deer's legs, ears, nose.)\n   - **Life cycle:** The changes an animal goes through from birth until it dies—baby, growing up, adult, and then the end of life. (Show simple progression.)\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph (5 minutes):** \n   - *\"This deer had long, strong legs. What do you think it used those legs for?\"* (Run, jump, escape from danger.)\n   - *\"This deer had a nose and mouth. What did it use those for?\"* (Smell food, eat grass and plants.)\n   - *\"This deer needed to find grass and water every day to stay alive. Where do you think it found these things?\"* (In the forest/habitat around where it lived.)\n\n4. **Introduce life cycle concept:**\n   - *\"This deer was born as a tiny baby (called a fawn). It grew bigger and bigger. When it was grown up, it was a strong adult deer. All animals go through these changes. You did too! You were a baby once.\"*\n\n5. **Check for Understanding Strategy:** \n   - Show the photograph and ask: *\"What is ONE thing this deer needed to survive?\"* (Chorus response or thumbs up/down if students heard you correctly.)\n   - *\"What do we call the place where an animal lives?\"* (Habitat.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Understand that animals have habitats with food, water, shelter, and space.\n- Know that animals' body parts help them survive.\n- Recognize that animals go through life cycles.\n- Use new vocabulary in simple sentences: *\"The deer's legs helped it survive.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply survival concepts to different animals and design a way to meet an animal's need using animal body parts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of 3-4 other animals: squirrel, rabbit, bird, fish\n- Materials for building activity: straws, blocks, paper cups, paper, tape, scissors (safety scissors only)\n- Challenge poster: \"Design a Tool Using Animal Body Parts\"\n\n**Activity Option A: Compare Different Animals (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show pictures of different animals** (squirrel, rabbit, bird). Ask: *\"How is a squirrel different from a deer? What does it eat? Where does it live?\"*\n\n2. **Guide discovery:** *\"Different animals have different habitats and different body parts that help them survive.\"*\n   - Squirrel: bushy tail for balance, sharp claws for climbing.\n   - Bird: wings for flying, beak for picking seeds.\n   - Rabbit: long ears for hearing danger, strong back legs for jumping.\n\n3. **Record on a chart:** \"How Animals Use Body Parts to Survive.\"\n\n**Activity Option B: Design Challenge (Mimicking Animal Body Parts)**\n\n1. **Present the challenge:** *\"Animals use their body parts in smart ways. For example, a deer uses its legs to RUN away from danger. A bird uses its wings to FLY away. Can YOU design something that helps solve a human problem by copying how an animal uses its body?\"*\n\n2. **Provide a simple example:** *\"Birds have long beaks to pick up seeds. Could a beak help you pick up small things? Let's try!\"*\n\n3. **Offer building materials.** Invite students to design a simple \"tool\" that mimics an animal body part:\n   - Use straws taped together to make \"tweezers\" like a bird's beak (for picking up small items).\n   - Roll paper into a \"tube\" like an elephant's trunk.\n   - Use blocks to build a \"shelter\" like a bird's nest.\n\n4. **Students test and explain:** *\"My tool works like a _________ because _________.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Facilitate without building for students.\n- Ask: *\"Which animal does this remind you of?\"* and *\"How does this help?\"*\n- Encourage trial and error.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Make connections between different animals and their habitats.\n- Understand that different body parts solve different survival problems.\n- Create a simple tool or solution inspired by an animal's body part.\n- Explain the connection: *\"This is like a bird's beak because...\"*\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal survival needs, habitats, and life cycles.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing Throughout Lesson):**\n- Listen to student discussions during partner talk in Engage.\n- Observe sorting and habitat-building decisions in Explore.\n- Monitor student responses to vocabulary checks in Explain.\n- Watch student explanations during Elaborate activities.\n\n**Exit Ticket Assessment (End of Lesson, 5-10 minutes):**\n\nProvide students with a simple visual exit slip (template below). Read each question aloud; students respond by:\n- Drawing and coloring\n- Pointing to a picture\n- Giving a verbal response to the teacher\n\n**Exit Ticket Template:**\n\n```\nName: ___________________________  Date: _________________\n\n1. What does a deer NEED to survive?\n   (Draw or point to: food, water, shelter, space)\n\n2. This is a HABITAT because it has... \n   (Circle: food  water  shelter  space  all of these)\n\n3. The deer's LEGS help it survive by...\n   (Circle or draw: run  jump  escape danger)\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least 2 survival needs (food, water, shelter, OR space).\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies a habitat as a place with multiple survival needs.\n- ✓ Student explains one way an animal body part helps survival.\n\n**Summative Evidence:**\nCollect habitat posters from Explore and exit tickets. Review for:\n1. Inclusion of survival needs (food, water, shelter, space).\n2. Ability to explain why each element is needed.\n3. Understanding that animals have life cycles (from discussion observations).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most First Grade students will identify food and shelter as key survival needs.\n- Students will recognize that habitats provide what animals need.\n- Students will make simple connections between body parts and survival (e.g., \"Legs help run away\").\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Reduce sorting complexity:** Provide only 3 \"survival need\" cards and 2 distractor cards instead of 4 and 4. Remove confusing items.\n\n2. **Pre-teach vocabulary with picture supports:** Show pictures of food, water, shelter, and space BEFORE the lesson. Practice saying words together multiple times.\n\n3. **Provide sentence frame support:** Offer pre-written sentence frames on individual cards:\n   - *\"A deer needs _________ because _________.\"* (with picture options for blanks)\n   - During Evaluate, read questions aloud twice and allow extended processing time (5-10 seconds of silence).\n\n4. **Pair with a strong peer:** During Explore, intentionally pair struggling students with a peer who can model thinking and language.\n\n---\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deeper habitat design:** Invite advanced students to add a \"food chain\" to their habitat. *\"What plants grow here? What does the deer eat? What animals might hunt the deer?\"* Provide picture cards to arrange.\n\n2. **Extend life cycle thinking:** Ask: *\"What happens to a baby fawn when it's born? How does it change? What does a mother deer teach her baby?\"* Introduce the idea of parent-offspring patterns (1-LS1-2).\n\n3. **Design challenge extension:** Challenge students to design TWO tools inspired by animal body parts that solve different human problems:\n   - *\"A beaver's flat tail is like a paddle for swimming. What could we use that is like a paddle?\"*\n   - *\"A porcupine has sharp quills for protection. What could protect us like quills protect a porcupine?\"*\n\n4. **Research and present:** Invite students to choose another animal and create a poster showing its habitat needs and body parts. Present to the class: *\"I chose a ________. It needs _________ to survive because _________.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Class Book: \"Our Animal Habitats\"**\n   - Compile habitat posters from Explore into a class book with captions.\n   - Each student's page reads: *\"[Student name]'s deer lives in a habitat with [food/water/shelter/space] because...\"*\n   - Share with families and other classes.\n\n2. **Field Exploration: \"Habitat Hunt\"**\n   - Take students outside to observe a real habitat (school garden, park, or nature area).\n   - Ask: *\"What animals might live here? What food do they have? Where could they sleep?\"*\n   - Bring clipboards; students draw or point to habitat elements.\n   - Debrief: *\"How is this habitat like the deer's habitat? How is it different?\"*\n\n3. **Story & Movement Activity: \"Life Cycle of a Fawn\"**\n   - Read an age-appropriate picture book about a baby deer (e.g., \"Elmer\" by David McKee or \"Fawn in the Forest\" by Nancy Smiler Levinson).\n   - Use the photograph to introduce the concept that even healthy animals have a full life cycle.\n   - Have students move in different ways to show fawn growth: *\"Move like a tiny baby fawn. Now you're growing—move a little faster. Now you're a big strong deer.\"*\n   - Discuss gently: *\"All animals grow, and eventually their lives end. That's natural.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes for Sensitive Handling\n\nThe photograph shows a deceased animal. Use this as a natural opportunity to:\n- Normalize the concept that all living things have life cycles and eventually die.\n- Frame death as a natural part of nature (not something to be afraid of).\n- Keep language matter-of-fact and age-appropriate: *\"This deer is no longer alive, but it was once a healthy animal that lived in nature.\"*\n- If a student becomes upset, acknowledge their feelings: *\"It's okay to feel sad. All animals have lives that eventually end, just like all of us will someday.\"*\n- Focus the lesson on LIVING animals and how to keep them healthy, not on death itself.\n\n---\n\n## Standards Alignment Summary\n\n| NGSS Standard | How This Lesson Addresses It |\n|---|---|\n| **1-LS1-2** (Behavior patterns of parents and offspring) | Students learn that baby animals (fawns) grow into adults and that parents teach offspring survival skills. Photograph prompts discussion of life cycles. |\n| **1-LS1-1** (Design solutions using animal body parts) | Elaborate phase includes design challenge where students create tools inspired by animal body parts (e.g., beak, legs, tail). |\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is ready to teach! All activities use classroom-available materials, build logically through the 5E sequence, and honor the photograph as the central anchor for discovery.",
