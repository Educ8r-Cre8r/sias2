ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about hidden animals and what they need to live by observing the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy of the katydid photograph (large enough for all students to see, or displayed on a screen)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Say: \"I have a mystery animal to show you today. It's hiding in this picture. Can you find it?\"\n\n2. **Give students 1-2 minutes** to scan the image silently, pointing or whispering to a neighbor where they think the animal is.\n\n3. **Guide their eyes** to the katydid if needed: \"Look right in the middle—do you see the green insect with long legs? That's called a katydid. It's a cousin of a grasshopper!\"\n\n4. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause for responses):\n   - \"Why do you think this animal is hard to find in the picture?\"\n   - \"What color is the katydid? What color is all around it?\"\n   - \"What do you think this animal eats?\" (Point to the grass around it.)\n   - \"Why do you think the katydid lives in the grass instead of somewhere else?\"\n\n5. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder... do you think this animal chooses to live here because it gets what it needs? What might it need?\" (Accept all ideas: food, water, a safe hiding place, etc.)\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to be nature detectives and find out what this katydid needs to survive and how it uses the grass to stay safe!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate animal needs and habitats through hands-on observation and a matching activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of different habitats (forest, desert, pond, grassland, tree branch) printed or drawn\n- Pictures of various animals (bird, lizard, fish, squirrel, bee, frog, rabbit)—printed or magazine cutouts\n- Glue sticks\n- Large sheets of paper or poster board (one per small group or pair)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- The katydid photograph (reference copy at each table)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide students into small groups** (3-4 students per group).\n\n2. **Give each group a large sheet of paper with a different habitat drawn or glued** (forest, desert, pond, grassland, etc.).\n\n3. **Show the katydid picture again** and say: \"The katydid lives in the grassland habitat. It needs grass for food AND to hide in. Let's think about other animals. Where do they live? What do they need?\"\n\n4. **Provide animal picture cards.** Ask students:\n   - \"Which animals belong in YOUR habitat?\"\n   - \"What food would they find there?\"\n   - \"What safe place could they hide?\"\n\n5. **Students glue animal pictures** into the correct habitat and draw or write (with teacher help) one thing that animal needs from that place (food, water, shelter).\n\n6. **Documentation:** Each group should be able to point to their habitat and say: \"The _____ lives here because it has _____ (food/water/hiding place).\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"Why did you put that animal there?\" \"What does it eat?\" \"Where does it hide?\"\n- Model the thinking: \"I put the fish in the pond because it needs water to drink AND water to live in.\"\n- Prompt with sentence starters: \"This animal needs _______.\" \"It lives here because _______.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly match at least 2-3 animals to appropriate habitats.\n- Students identify at least one need (food, water, shelter) for each animal.\n- Students recognize that animals need things from their environment to survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of animal needs and habitats after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with pre-drawn columns labeled: \"What Animals Need,\" \"Food,\" \"Water,\" \"Shelter,\" \"Safe Place\"\n- Katydid photograph\n- Picture cards of animals and habitats (from Explore)\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on the carpet** with the katydid photograph visible.\n\n2. **Group share-out:** Ask 2-3 groups to show their habitat and explain one animal and why it lives there. Validate and celebrate their thinking.\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** using the photograph and Explore work:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. It has everything the animal needs. (Point to the grass: \"The katydid's habitat is the grassland.\")\n   - **Camouflage:** Colors or patterns on an animal's body that help it hide from danger. (Point to the katydid: \"The katydid is green like the grass—that's camouflage!\")\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive by getting what you need (food, water, shelter, safety).\n   - **Shelter:** A safe home or hiding place. (Show pictures: \"A bird's nest is shelter. A hole in a tree is shelter. Thick grass is shelter for a katydid!\")\n\n4. **Build a class chart** on paper:\n   - Title: \"What Animals Need to Survive\"\n   - Columns: Food | Water | Shelter | Safe Place\n   - Add pictures of the katydid and other animals from Explore under each need.\n   - Example: Under \"Food,\" draw grass and an insect. Under \"Shelter,\" show the grass plant.\n\n5. **Check for understanding** by asking:\n   - \"Does the katydid get water in the grass?\" (Yes, from dew on plants.)\n   - \"What food does the katydid find?\" (Grass and leaves.)\n   - \"How does its green color help it survive?\" (It hides from predators.)\n   - \"Can a fish survive in the grassland? Why not?\" (It needs water to live in.)\n\n6. **Connect back to the photograph:** \"The katydid is green because its habitat is green. This helps it hide. The grass gives it food and shelter. The katydid has everything it needs right here!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the words \"habitat,\" \"camouflage,\" and \"survive\" correctly in context.\n- Students explain that animals need food, water, shelter, and safety.\n- Students recognize that the katydid's green color and grassland home are connected to its survival.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding of animal needs by exploring camouflage and habitat design in new contexts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or white poster board (one per small group)\n- Markers, colored pencils, crayons\n- Pre-cut animal shapes (brown, gray, tan, green—simple outlines of rabbits, birds, insects)\n- Scissors (optional, for cutting)\n- The katydid photograph\n\n**Activity - Choice Board (select one):**\n\n**Option A: Design a Safe Habitat**\n- Give each group a large sheet showing a blank outdoor space (empty paper).\n- Say: \"Design a home for an animal. Draw plants, water, and hiding places that animal needs to survive.\"\n- Prompt: \"What will your animal eat? Where will it hide? Is there water? Why is this a good habitat?\"\n- Students draw a habitat and label one or two things the animal needs.\n\n**Option B: Camouflage Hunt**\n- Prepare a simple habitat scene on paper (grassland, forest, or pond).\n- Scatter pre-cut animal shapes (in colors) around the scene.\n- Challenge: \"Which animals blend in with their habitat? Which ones stand out? Color the animals green, brown, or tan to help them hide better. Why did you choose those colors?\"\n- Students color animals to match their habitat.\n\n**Option C: Animal Needs Match-Up**\n- Create simple picture cards: animal, food, habitat, shelter (for katydid, bird, fish, squirrel).\n- Students match each animal to its habitat and draw one thing it needs.\n- Extend: \"Can a katydid live in the ocean? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What would this animal eat here?\" \"Where could it hide?\" \"Does it have water?\"\n- Affirm connections: \"You made that animal green because, like the katydid, it needs to hide. Great thinking!\"\n- Challenge: \"What would happen if all the grass disappeared from the katydid's habitat?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design or identify habitats that meet animal needs.\n- Students explain why certain colors or features help animals survive.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that animals need specific places to live.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal needs, habitats, and survival through observation and questioning.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n   - Observe students during Explore: Do they correctly match animals to habitats? Can they name one need?\n   - Listen during group share-outs: Can they explain why an animal lives in a specific place?\n   - Check understanding with quick questions during Explain: \"What do animals need to survive?\" \"Why is the katydid green?\"\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (Picture-Based):**\n   - Show the katydid photograph one more time.\n   - Ask students to respond (verbally, with gestures, or with drawings):\n     - **Question 1:** \"Point to something the katydid needs to survive.\" (They should point to grass.)\n     - **Question 2:** \"Why is the katydid hard to see?\" (They should say it's green like the grass or it hides.)\n     - **Question 3:** \"If we took away all the grass, could the katydid survive here? Why?\" (They should say no—it needs grass for food and shelter.)\n\n3. **Observation Checklist:**\n   - ✓ Student identifies at least one animal need (food, water, shelter, safety).\n   - ✓ Student connects the katydid to its habitat.\n   - ✓ Student explains a simple reason why camouflage helps an animal.\n   - ✓ Student uses one vocabulary word (habitat, camouflage, survive, shelter) correctly.\n\n4. **Success Criteria for Meeting K-LS1-1:**\n   - **Developing:** Student identifies one or two things a plant or animal needs (with prompting).\n   - **Proficient:** Student identifies 2-3 things animals need (food, water, shelter) and connects them to the katydid's habitat.\n   - **Advanced:** Student explains how an animal's body features (color, shape) and habitat work together to help it survive.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students can point to food (grass) and a hiding place (thick grass) that the katydid needs.\n- Students explain that the katydid's green color helps it stay safe by hiding.\n- Students recognize that habitats provide what animals need to survive.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n1. **Visual anchors:** Use the katydid photograph throughout the lesson. Point to it frequently. Create a simple \"Animal Needs\" poster with pictures (not words) showing food, water, shelter, and safe places.\n2. **Sentence starters:** Provide frames like \"The katydid needs _____.\" \"The katydid lives in _____.\" \"The katydid is green because _____.\" Students complete the sentence orally or with help.\n3. **Simplified matching:** In Explore, give each small group only 2 habitats and 3-4 animals (instead of many). Pre-sort some correctly so students see the pattern.\n4. **One-to-one check-in:** During Elaborate, sit with a struggling learner and guide them through one activity step-by-step, asking them to explain each choice.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n1. **Deeper habitat design:** \"Design a habitat for an animal that lives in a very different place (desert, arctic, rainforest). What would this animal need? How would it look different from the katydid? Why?\"\n2. **Camouflage comparison:** \"Find pictures of other green animals that live in grass (grasshopper, green tree frog, caterpillar). Why are so many grassland animals green? What about animals in other habitats—what colors are they?\"\n3. **Problem-solving:** \"The katydid's habitat is being cut down. How could it survive? Where else could it go? What would it need there?\" (Introduce adaptation in simple terms.)\n4. **Research project:** \"Choose another insect or animal. Draw its habitat. Label three things it needs to survive. Why does it live there?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Outdoor Scavenger Hunt (Session 2 or recess):**\n   - Take students outside to look for hidden animals in grass, bushes, or garden areas.\n   - Provide a simple checklist with pictures: \"Look for something green. Look for something hiding. Look for something eating. Look for something drinking.\"\n   - Return indoors and share: \"Where did we find animals? What were they doing? What did they need?\"\n   - Connection: \"Just like the katydid, these animals hide and find food in their habitats.\"\n\n2. **\"Blend In\" Art Activity (Cross-curricular):**\n   - Students create an animal collage or painting: draw or paint a habitat (trees, grass, water, rocks) on a large sheet.\n   - Then draw or cut out an animal and glue it so it blends in (matches colors and placement).\n   - Title: \"Can You Find Me?\" Display in hallway for other classes to try to spot the animals.\n   - Discussion: \"Why did we make the animal this color? How does it survive?\"\n\n3. **Read-Aloud & Discussion (Literature Connection):**\n   - Read a picture book about habitats or animal needs (e.g., *Where Do You Live?* by Marie-Helene Delval, *A Home for Little Turtle* by Kelly Greenwood, or *The Busy Tree* by Jennifer Ward).\n   - Pause at key moments to connect back to the katydid: \"This animal also needs _____. Where does it find shelter?\"\n   - Have students draw their favorite animal from the book and label one thing it needs to survive.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
