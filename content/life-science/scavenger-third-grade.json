The bird has dark feathers covering most of its body and appears to be looking down at the ground. This type of bird is a scavenger that eats animals that have already died.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** *Why do some birds have bare heads and eat dead animals?*\n\nThis bird is a scavenger—an animal that feeds on carrion (dead animals). The bare, featherless head is a key adaptation that prevents feathers from becoming dirty and matted when the bird reaches deep inside dead animal carcasses to eat. Unlike predators that hunt living prey, scavengers play a critical ecological role by removing dead animals from the environment, which prevents disease spread and recycles nutrients back into the soil. This is a survival strategy that has evolved over millions of years because it provides a reliable food source without the danger or energy cost of hunting living animals.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Adaptation:** Body parts (like the bare head) help animals survive in their environment and find food more easily.\n\n* **Food Webs and Roles:** Scavengers are decomposers that break down dead matter; they occupy a unique and important role in ecosystems different from hunters or herbivores.\n\n* **Animal Behavior:** Birds have inherited behaviors (instincts) that guide them to find and eat food in specific ways.\n\n* **Ecological Relationships:** All animals depend on other living and non-living things to survive; scavengers depend on dead animals as their food source.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nThird graders may initially find scavenging \"gross\" or negative. Reframe this as a *superpower*—these birds are nature's cleanup crew! Use language like \"nature's recyclers\" to help students see the ecological value. This shifts their perspective from disgust to appreciation.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Representation:** Provide images of scavenger birds in their natural habitats alongside diagrams labeling body parts. Use both visual and verbal descriptions. **Action & Expression:** Allow students to choose how to show learning—some may draw and label adaptations, while others create a food web diagram or act out a scavenger's day. **Engagement:** Connect to students' prior knowledge by asking, \"Who cleans up trash in your neighborhood?\" before introducing ecological roles.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 3-LS1-1 Develop models to describe that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but all have in common birth, growth, reproduction, and death.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.C]]—Adaptation behaviors and structures that help organisms survive\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS2.A]]—Organisms depend on their environment and each other\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]]—The bird's bare head is a structure that functions to help it eat efficiently\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]]—The scavenger is part of a larger food web system\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you notice about this bird's head compared to other birds you know?** (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why might a bare head be helpful for a bird that eats dead animals?** (Bloom's: Infer | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **How does this bird's role in nature help other living things and the environment?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **If all the scavenger birds disappeared from an area, what problems might happen?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Scavenger:** An animal that eats dead animals or leftover food instead of hunting living prey.\n\n* **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and thrive in its environment.\n\n* **Carrion:** A dead animal's body.\n\n* **Ecosystem:** All the living and non-living things in an area and how they interact with each other.\n\n* **Decomposer:** An organism that breaks down dead plants and animals and returns nutrients to the soil.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Scavenger Bird Adaptation Chart:** Students create a two-column chart titled \"Adaptations\" with drawings and labels of the bird's special features (bare head, long legs, sharp eyes). They write one sentence explaining how each adaptation helps the bird survive. This connects to [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.C]].\n\n2. **Food Web Role-Play:** Divide the class into groups representing different organisms (plants, herbivores, predators, scavengers, decomposers). Create a physical food web using yarn, with students holding cards, to show how energy and nutrients flow through an ecosystem. Highlight the scavenger's unique position.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Detective Game:** Provide picture cards of various environments (forest, grassland, desert). Students predict which scavenger birds might live there and why. Discuss how scavengers are found in many different habitats because dead animals are everywhere.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *What Do You Do With a Kangaroo?* by Mercer Mayer (explores animal behaviors and adaptations)\n- *Who Eats What? Food Chains and Food Webs* by Patricia Lauber (explains scavengers in food webs)\n- *Eagles* by Gail Gibbons (features raptors and predator-prey relationships; helps students contrast with scavengers)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"What Do Vultures Eat? | National Geographic Kids\"** — Shows scavengers in action with age-appropriate footage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=... (Search: National Geographic Kids vultures)\n- **\"Animal Food Chains for Kids\"** by Homeschool Pop — Animated explanation of food chains including scavengers' role. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...

Use this as an opportunity to cultivate scientific curiosity and ecological appreciation.",
