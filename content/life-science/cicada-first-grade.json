Its wings have lines that look like a pattern.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image shows a **cicada emergence phenomenon** - when adult cicadas come out from underground after living there for years. The cicada has just finished changing from its young form (nymph) into its adult form through a process called metamorphosis. This happens when soil temperature reaches the right warmth, triggering thousands of cicadas to emerge at the same time to find mates and lay eggs.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Life Cycles:** Cicadas go through incomplete metamorphosis with three stages - egg, nymph, and adult\n2. **Animal Structures:** The cicada's large eyes help it see, strong legs help it climb, and wings help it fly to find food and mates\n3. **Seasonal Changes:** Cicadas emerge when the weather gets warm enough, showing how animals respond to environmental changes\n4. **Animal Behaviors:** Cicadas make loud sounds to communicate with other cicadas\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use hand motions to act out the cicada life cycle - start crouched down as an egg, crawl as a nymph underground, then \"emerge\" and spread arms like wings as an adult. This kinesthetic approach helps first graders remember the sequence.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to show their learning about cicadas - drawing the life cycle, acting it out, building with blocks, or using picture cards to sequence events. This supports different learning preferences and abilities.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** Inside the cicada's body are special muscles that vibrate very fast to make the loud buzzing sounds we hear - like a tiny drum beating hundreds of times per second\n2. **Zoom Out:** Cicadas are part of the forest food web, providing food for birds, spiders, and other animals when they emerge, which helps keep nature in balance\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"Cicadas are scary and will hurt me\"\n   **Reality:** Cicadas are gentle insects that don't bite or sting people - they only eat tree sap\n2. **Misconception:** \"All bugs look the same when they grow up\"\n   **Reality:** Young cicadas (nymphs) look very different from adult cicadas and live underground\n3. **Misconception:** \"Cicadas come out every summer\"\n   **Reality:** Most cicadas only emerge every few years, spending most of their lives underground\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** [[NGSS:PE:1-LS1-2]] Read texts and use media to determine patterns in behavior of parents and offspring that help offspring survive\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:1-LS1.B]] Adult plants and animals can have young\n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns in nature can be observed and used to make predictions\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you notice about how this cicada looks different from other bugs you've seen? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n2. Why do you think cicadas have such big eyes? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n3. How might baby cicadas be different from this adult cicada? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n4. What would happen if all the cicadas came out at different times instead of together? (Bloom's: Synthesize | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Cicada:** A large insect that lives underground as a baby and comes out to fly and make loud sounds\n* **Emerge:** To come out from a hidden place\n* **Nymph:** The young form of some insects before they become adults\n* **Life cycle:** The different stages an animal goes through as it grows and changes\n* **Metamorphosis:** When an animal changes from one form to another as it grows up\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- Cicadas!
