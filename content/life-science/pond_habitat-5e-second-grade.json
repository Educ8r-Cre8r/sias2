Identify and describe at least three different plants and animals found in a pond habitat.\n2. Explain how water and sunlight help pond plants grow.\n3. Compare what plants and animals need to survive in a pond habitat versus what they see in other habitats (like a garden or forest).\n4. Observe and record evidence of how different living things are suited to life in the water.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the pond habitat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of pond (projected, printed, or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small water tub or birdbath if available\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Allow 1-2 minutes of silent observation first.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see living in this water? Point to something green, something with petals, something that moves.\"\n   - \"Why do you think these plants stay in the water instead of growing on dry ground like in our garden?\"\n   - \"Can you spot any animals here? What might they be doing in the pond?\"\n   - \"What does a plant in water need to grow? (Hint: think about what a plant in your house needs.)\"\n\n3. **Create a quick \"Wonder Wall\":** Write student questions and observations on chart paper as they share. Examples: \"Do fish live here?\" \"How do the leaves stay on top of the water?\" \"Do the white flowers like water?\"\n\n4. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"We're going to become pond scientists. Before we explore, let's predict: Do you think water plants need sun and water to grow, just like plants in a pot? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's investigate what really helps pond plants grow by doing our own water plant experiment!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate whether water and sunlight help aquatic plants grow through a hands-on experiment.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 3 clear plastic cups or jars (labeled A, B, C with markers)\n- Aquatic plant cuttings or aquatic plant seeds (Water sprite, elodea, duckweed, or small water lily pads work well)\n- Watering can with water\n- Sunny window location\n- Dark closet or box to cover one cup\n- Paper towels\n- Observation journals (paper with lines and space for drawings)\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring growth)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up three conditions** (teacher does the initial setup, or students help):\n   - **Cup A:** Aquatic plant in water, placed in sunny window\n   - **Cup B:** Aquatic plant in water, placed in a dark closet or covered with a box (no light)\n   - **Cup C:** Aquatic plant without water (just moist paper towel), placed in sunny window\n\n2. **Give students these steps:**\n   - \"Observe each cup carefully. Look at the leaves, the stems, the color of the plant.\"\n   - \"Draw what you see in Cup A, Cup B, and Cup C in your observation journal.\"\n   - \"Describe the color: Is it bright green, pale green, or dark green?\"\n   - \"Use a ruler to measure how tall the plant is (if possible).\"\n   - \"Write or draw what you think will happen over the next week.\"\n\n3. **Observation Recording:** Students should complete an observation sheet with drawings and simple captions for each cup. Example: \"Cup A: Green and healthy in sunlight with water.\"\n\n4. **Daily Check-ins (if time allows):** Over several days, students repeat observations and check for changes. Record watering schedule (only water Cup A and B; Cup C gets moist paper towel replaced).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Which cup looks healthiest? Why do you think that is?\"\n- Avoid saying \"water plants need sunlight\"—let students discover through observation.\n- Encourage careful descriptions instead of conclusions (\"I see the plant is pale\" not \"It needs light\").\n- Model how to measure and record data.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that Cup A (water + sunlight) shows healthy, vibrant growth.\n- Cup B (water, no light) shows pale or slow growth.\n- Cup C (no water) shows wilting or poor growth.\n- Students document observations in pictures and words, building evidence for the need for both sunlight and water.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration findings to the pond habitat photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of pond (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms\n- Student observation journals from Explore phase\n- Optional: pictures of different water plants and pond animals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Ask students to report what they discovered:\n   - \"Which cup's plant looked the healthiest? Why?\"\n   - \"What did the plant in the dark look like after a few days?\"\n   - \"Did the plant without water survive? What happened?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions:\n\n   | Vocabulary Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Habitat** | A place where plants and animals live and find food, water, and shelter. A pond is a habitat. |\n   | **Aquatic** | Living in or growing in water. Water lilies are aquatic plants. |\n   | **Adapted** | Special parts that help a living thing survive in its home. The flat leaves of a water lily are adapted for floating on water. |\n   | **Sunlight** | Light energy from the sun that plants need to grow strong and green. |\n   | **Diversity** | Many different kinds of plants and animals in one place. The pond has diversity because many species live there. |\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Point to the white water lilies: \"These are aquatic plants adapted to float on water. They have broad, flat leaves because they need to stay on the surface to get sunlight.\"\n   - Point to flowering plants in the background: \"These plants are also getting sunlight and water, so they can grow tall and make flowers.\"\n   - Point to birds visible in trees: \"Animals live in this habitat too. They drink the water, eat seeds, and help spread seeds.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the water lily's leaves float on top instead of sinking? What does it need that floats toward?\"\n   - Have students point to evidence in the photograph: \"Show me where the sunlight is hitting the plants.\"\n   - Ask: \"If we removed all the water from this pond, could these plants still live here?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Habitat:** A place where plants and animals live and find what they need to survive.\n- **Aquatic:** Living in or growing in water.\n- **Adapted:** Having special body parts or behaviors that help an organism survive in its habitat.\n- **Sunlight:** Energy from the sun that plants use to grow.\n- **Diversity:** Many different kinds of living things in one place.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary to describe what they observed (e.g., \"The aquatic plant in sunlight and water was adapted for growth\").\n- Students connect their experiment to the pond habitat (\"The water lilies in the pond get water and sunlight, just like Cup A\").\n- Students explain why different organisms live in ponds (they are adapted to wet environments).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by comparing pond habitats to other habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos of different habitats (garden, forest, desert, pond) or access to picture books\n- Venn diagram template (two overlapping circles, printed or drawn on paper)\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Optional: field guide or simple plant/animal identification cards\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Habitat Comparison Task:**\n   - Show students pictures of two different habitats side by side: **a pond and a garden** (or a pond and a forest).\n   - Ask: \"What plants and animals live in a pond? What plants and animals live in a garden?\"\n\n2. **Create a Venn Diagram:**\n   - **Left circle (Pond):** Students list or draw plants/animals unique to ponds (water lilies, frogs, fish, aquatic plants).\n   - **Overlapping section:** What can live in both (some birds, insects, certain plants that tolerate wet and dry).\n   - **Right circle (Garden):** Plants/animals found in gardens (tomato plants, roses, bees, butterflies, squirrels).\n\n3. **Guiding Discussion:**\n   - \"Why can't a cactus grow in a pond?\"\n   - \"Why can a water lily not survive in a dry desert?\"\n   - \"What makes each habitat special for the plants and animals that live there?\"\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - Show a simple picture of a wetland restoration project or a community garden near water.\n   - Ask: \"If someone wanted to create a habitat for pond animals, what would they need to include?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to see that organisms are suited to specific habitats.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"What does a pond animal need that a forest animal might not?\"\n- Encourage students to think about water needs, sunlight, and shelter.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a Venn diagram showing at least 3 differences and 1-2 similarities between habitats.\n- Students explain why certain plants thrive in ponds (they need water and sunlight, which ponds provide).\n- Students recognize that diversity is high in both habitats but with different species.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pond habitats, plant needs, and habitat diversity.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Listen to student responses during Engage and Explain phases; note who can identify plants/animals and explain why they live in specific habitats.\n- Review observation journals from Explore phase for clarity of descriptions and evidence of understanding that water and sunlight help plants grow.\n- Observe Venn diagram activity to see if students can compare habitats.\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket or Journal Entry):**\n\nProvide students with **one of these assessment options** (choose based on class writing level):\n\n**Option 1 (Drawing + Label):**\n- \"Draw a pond habitat. Label three plants or animals you see. Circle the ones that need water to survive. Draw an arrow pointing to the sun and explain why it is important to pond plants.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Simple Writing):**\n- Answer these three questions:\n  1. \"Name two plants or animals that live in a pond.\"\n  2. \"Why do water lilies have flat leaves that float on top of the water?\"\n  3. \"What do pond plants need to grow? (Choose: water, sunlight, soil, or all of the above.)\"\n\n**Option 3 (Verbal Assessment for Emerging Readers):**\n- One-on-one conversation: \"Tell me about the pond habitat we studied. What plants and animals live there? Why do you think they live in water instead of on dry land?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Identify at least 2 plants or animals from a pond habitat correctly.\n- ✓ Explain that water and sunlight help pond plants grow (using evidence from their experiment).\n- ✓ Describe at least one way pond organisms are different from organisms in other habitats.\n- ✓ Use vocabulary terms (habitat, aquatic, adapted) correctly in context.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most second graders should recognize that water and sunlight are essential for pond plant growth.\n- Students should be able to name pond organisms and explain that they live there because the pond provides what they need.\n- Students should show understanding that different habitats support different life (diversity).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce the number of observations:** Instead of tracking three cups for a week, focus on two cups (light + water vs. dark + water) and observe for 3-4 days only.\n\n2. **Provide sentence frames for writing:** \"The plant in Cup A looks ________. I think this is because ________. The plant in Cup B looks ________.\"\n\n3. **Use picture labels in the habitat comparison:** Instead of drawing, provide pictures of pond and garden animals/plants that students sort into categories (This lives in pond / This lives in garden / Both).\n\n4. **Pre-teach vocabulary:** Introduce words (aquatic, habitat, sunlight) with real objects or dramatic actions before the lesson (e.g., float leaves on water to show \"aquatic,\" point to a light source for \"sunlight\").\n\n**Challenge (for Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Add a fourth condition to the experiment:** A plant in water with light but no fresh water added (to see if it needs replacement/clean water). Have students predict and explain results.\n\n2. **Research task:** \"Find out the name of three real aquatic plants used in ponds. Draw or describe how each one is adapted to living in water.\"\n\n3. **Deeper comparison:** Create a three-habitat Venn diagram (pond, forest, garden) and identify organisms that could theoretically live in two or three habitats, explaining why.\n\n4. **Design challenge:** \"Design a habitat for a pond frog. What does it need? Where would it get water? Sunlight? Food? Draw and label your design.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Virtual or In-Person Pond Visit:** If possible, visit a local pond or wetland area. Have students make field observations: \"Can you find water lilies or other aquatic plants? Do you see animals? What habitat adaptations do you notice?\" Create a field journal with sketches and observations.\n\n2. **Create a Classroom Pond Diorama or Model:** Using a shallow container, water, rocks, and plant cuttings, students build a miniature pond habitat. They label the plants and animals and explain why each organism belongs in that habitat. This reinforces understanding of biodiversity and adaptation.\n\n3. **Read-Aloud & Discussion:** Share a picture book about pond life (e.g., *From Tadpole to Frog* by Gail Gibbons or *The Busy Water Lily* by Lydia Halverson). Discuss how different organisms in the book are adapted to pond life and depend on each other. Create a food web showing how pond organisms are connected (plants → insects → fish → birds).\n\n4. **Experiment Extension—Seed Dispersal:** Revisit the photograph and discuss how animals (birds visible in the background) might help spread water lily seeds or other plant seeds. Design a simple model showing how water and animals disperse seeds in and around a pond habitat.\n\n5. **Home Connection:** Send home a simple observation sheet: \"Find a small habitat at home (under a rock, in a pot, in the yard, by a window). Draw what you observe. Is it like a pond? Why or why not? Bring back your findings to share.\"",
