ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copies of the photograph (one per student or small group)\n- Document camera or smartboard to display the image large for whole class\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"I Wonder\" graphic organizer (provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** using a document camera or projector so all students can see clearly. Do not explain what it is yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds**, then turn to a partner and describe what they see using these sentence starters:\n   - \"I see a plant that looks like...\"\n   - \"The plant has parts that look like...\"\n   - \"I notice the plant is different in different places because...\"\n\n3. **Facilitate a whole-class discussion** using these guiding questions:\n   - **\"What do you think this plant is, and what stage of growth do you think it's in?\"** (Students may not know it's a seedling—accept all guesses; clarify it's a very young plant, or seedling.)\n   - **\"If you could touch this plant, where do you think the roots are, and why would a plant need roots?\"** (This activates prior knowledge about plant parts and function.)\n   - **\"How do you think this plant got started? Did it always look like this?\"** (Introduces the idea of life cycles and growth.)\n   - **\"What do you wonder about how this plant will change as it grows bigger?\"** (Activates curiosity about plant development.)\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on a chart titled \"Our Questions About Plant Growth.\" Save this chart; you'll revisit it in the Explain phase.\n\n5. **Show a brief visual sequence** (optional but recommended): Display three images side-by-side showing a seed → seedling (like in photo) → mature plant with flowers/seeds. Ask: \"Do you think all plants go through these same stages?\"\n\n**Transition:** Now that we're curious about how plants grow, let's investigate plant growth ourselves by observing real seeds and seedlings up close.\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bean seeds (dried pinto, kidney, or lima beans—one per student or pair)\n- Small cups of water (room temperature)\n- Paper towels\n- Plastic bags (optional, for moisture retention)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Paper and pencils for observations\n- **Observation Sheet** (template provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station Setup:** Set up a simple seed-soaking station on one table. Have students work in pairs or small groups.\n\n**Step-by-step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Examine a dry seed.** Use a hand lens to look closely at the seed. Draw and label what you see on your Observation Sheet. Notice the shape, color, size, and texture. Ask: \"What do you think is inside this seed?\"\n\n2. **Soak the seed.** Place your seed in a cup of water for 2-3 minutes. The water will help the seed absorb moisture, just as it would in soil.\n\n3. **Carefully open the seed.** After soaking, gently pry open the seed coat (the outer shell). Use fingernails or a plastic tool—be gentle! Inside, you should see a tiny plant (embryo) and stored food (cotyledons).\n\n4. **Examine the seed parts.** Use your hand lens again. Draw and label the inside of the seed on your Observation Sheet. Label: seed coat, embryo (tiny plant), and cotyledon (food storage). Write one sentence about each part and what you think it does.\n\n5. **Plant your seed.** Place a wet paper towel in a plastic bag, tuck your seed into the folded towel, seal the bag, and tape it to the window. Over the next week, you'll observe roots and shoots emerge.\n\n**Connection to Photograph:**\n- \"The plant in the photograph started as a seed just like yours. As it grew, roots grew down and a shoot (stem with leaves) grew up. You're going to watch this happen!\"\n\n**What Students Record:**\n- Detailed drawings of the dry seed (magnified view)\n- Drawings and labels of seed parts (coat, embryo, cotyledon)\n- Predictions: \"I think my seed will grow because...\"\n- A simple life-cycle prediction: \"First the seed will... then... then...\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n  - \"What do you notice about the seed coat? Why might it be there?\"\n  - \"What do you see inside? Do you think any of it is food?\"\n  - \"Where do you think roots will grow first—up or down?\"\n- Prevent students from simply following directions; encourage observation and reasoning.\n- Help students handle seeds gently; provide extra seeds if any are damaged.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that seeds have an internal structure (embryo, food storage, protective coat).\n- Students can label seed parts and infer their functions.\n- Students have planted seeds and made predictions about growth direction and sequence.\n- Students are excited to observe their seeds over the coming week.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with labeled diagram of a plant\n- **Plant Parts and Functions Chart** (anchor chart to create with students)\n- Index cards with vocabulary terms\n- Student notebooks or worksheets\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations from the Explore activity** (5 minutes):\n   - Invite 3-4 student pairs to briefly share what they discovered inside their seeds.\n   - Display one opened seed under a document camera so all can see.\n   - Ask: \"What parts did we find, and what do we think each part does?\"\n\n2. **Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts** (8 minutes):\n   - Return to the photograph. Point to each visible part of the seedling as you introduce vocabulary.\n   - Create an anchor chart together with students, drawing and labeling each plant part as you discuss it.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Root** | The part of the plant that grows down into the soil. Roots absorb water and nutrients from the soil, and they help hold the plant in place so it doesn't blow away. |\n| **Stem (or Shoot)** | The green part of the plant that grows up above the soil. The stem holds up the leaves and carries water from the roots to the leaves. It's like the plant's skeleton! |\n| **Leaf** | The flat, green part that catches sunlight. Leaves use sunlight, water, and air to make food (energy) that helps the plant grow. |\n| **Seed Pod (or Fruit)** | The part that holds and protects new seeds. When it's mature, seeds are released so new plants can grow. |\n| **Life Cycle** | All the stages a living thing goes through from birth to adulthood to reproduction. For plants: seed → seedling → mature plant → seeds → new plants. |\n| **Germinate** | When a seed starts to grow. It needs water, warmth, and air to germinate. |\n\n3. **Connect vocabulary back to the photograph and the Explore activity** (4 minutes):\n   - \"Look at the photograph again. The green part with the little leaves is the stem and leaves. They're small now because this plant is very young.\"\n   - \"The tan, curly parts are roots. Roots are hard to see in the photo because they're underground, but when we opened our seeds, we saw where roots start.\"\n   - \"Later, this plant will grow bigger, and eventually it will make flowers and seeds, like the dried parts you see in the photo on the right side.\"\n   - \"This shows the life cycle of a plant!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding** (3 minutes):\n   - Show the photograph again and ask: \"Point to the part that absorbs water\" (roots). \"Point to the part that makes food\" (leaves). \"Why does this plant need both roots and leaves to survive?\"\n   - Have students turn to a partner and explain: \"Why do you think a plant needs a stem?\" Listen for responses about support and transport.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and label root, stem, leaves, and seed pod/fruit.\n- Students understand the basic function of each plant part (absorption, transport, energy-making, reproduction, support).\n- Students begin to see how plant structures work together for survival and reproduction.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photographs or images of 3-4 different plants at different life stages (e.g., a seed catalog, printed images, or digital display)\n- **Plant Life-Cycle Sequencing Cards** (printable template provided below)\n- Large index cards (5x7) or sentence strips\n- Scissors and glue\n- Chart paper or large poster board\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: Field guide or plant identification book\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Plant Life-Cycle Sequencing and Illustration**\n\n1. **Provide students with four images or descriptions** of a plant at different life stages (seed, seedling, young plant, flowering plant with seeds).\n\n2. **Students sequence these images** in order and glue them onto a large paper to create a visual life-cycle chart.\n\n3. **For each stage, students write or draw** what's happening to the plant and what structures are present:\n   - Stage 1 (Seed): \"A seed has a coat, embryo, and food inside.\"\n   - Stage 2 (Seedling): \"Roots grow down; a stem and leaves grow up. The leaves are small.\"\n   - Stage 3 (Young Plant): \"The plant is bigger. Roots are longer. More leaves are growing.\"\n   - Stage 4 (Flowering/Mature): \"Flowers appear. Seeds develop in the flower. The cycle begins again.\"\n\n4. **Connect to the photograph**: \"The plant in our photograph is at Stage 2. What do you predict will happen next?\"\n\n**Option B: Compare Plant Life Cycles (for Differentiation)**\n\n1. **Show images of different plant types** (e.g., bean plant, tomato plant, sunflower, grass).\n\n2. **Ask**: \"Do you think all plants go through the same life-cycle stages? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Students work in pairs** to discuss and record similarities and differences in how different plants grow and reproduce.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without showing answers; let students discover the sequence.\n- Ask probing questions: \"What structures does the plant need to make before it can create seeds?\" \"Why do you think leaves appear before flowers?\"\n- Support students in making evidence-based arguments.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can sequence a plant's life cycle and explain what happens at each stage.\n- Students understand that plant structures appear in a logical order to support growth and reproduction.\n- Students can make simple arguments: \"Plants need roots, stems, and leaves before they can make flowers and seeds.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessments Used Throughout:**\n- Observation of students during the Engage discussion (Are they making connections? Do they understand plant parts?)\n- Drawings and labels in the Observe phase (Can they identify and label seed parts?)\n- Partner discussions during Explain and Elaborate (Can they explain function in their own words?)\n- Responses to guiding questions (Do they show understanding of structure-function relationships?)\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nAdminister this at the end of Day 1 or as an assessment at the end of the lesson sequence:\n\n**Student Name: _____________ Date: _____________**\n\n**Answer these questions:**\n\n1. **Look at this picture of a seedling** (show the photograph again):\n   - **Label the root, stem, and leaf.**\n   - **What does the root do?** ___________________________\n   - **What does the leaf do?** ____________________________\n\n2. **Put these in order from 1 to 4 to show a plant's life cycle:**\n   - _____ A plant makes flowers and seeds.\n   - _____ A seed germinates and a tiny root and shoot appear.\n   - _____ The young plant grows taller with more leaves.\n   - _____ A seed is in the soil.\n\n3. **Why do plants need both roots and leaves to survive? Use the word \"function\" in your answer.**\n   - ______________________________________________________________________\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ **Developing**: Student labels 2 of 3 structures; explains 1 function; sequences 2-3 life-cycle stages correctly.\n- ✓ **Proficient**: Student labels all 3 structures; explains 2+ functions; sequences all 4 stages correctly; makes a connection between structures and survival.\n- ✓ **Advanced**: Student explains functions in detail; makes a full argument about how structures support reproduction; identifies adaptations for different plant types.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 80% of students correctly identify and label root, stem, and leaf.\n- At least 70% of students sequence the life cycle correctly.\n- At least 75% of students can explain at least one plant structure's function.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that plant structures are essential for growth and reproduction.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards**: Provide pictures with one-word labels (roots, stem, leaves, seeds) and use the same images repeatedly. Create a personal reference sheet for each student.\n\n2. **Guided seed dissection**: Pre-soak seeds and demonstrate the dissection step-by-step before students attempt it. Pair with a confident peer or provide one-on-one support.\n\n3. **Life-cycle sequencing with pictures only**: For students who struggle with writing, provide a 4-image sequence and have them arrange and glue the images, then draw arrows showing the cycle. Accept drawings or verbal explanations instead of written labels.\n\n4. **Sentence frames for explanations**: Provide sentence starters such as:\n   - \"The root helps the plant by _____.\"\n   - \"The leaf is important because _____.\"\n   - \"First the seed _____. Then _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Explore plant adaptations**: Show images of plants in different environments (desert, rainforest, wetland). Ask: \"How do you think the roots, stems, or leaves of a cactus might be different from a water lily? Why?\" Students research and create a comparison chart.\n\n2. **Investigate seed dispersal**: Introduce the concept that seeds travel in different ways (wind, water, animals, explosion). Students collect different seeds and hypothesize how each travels, then design an experiment to test seed dispersal methods.\n\n3. **Create a detailed life-cycle poster**: Students create a labeled, illustrated poster showing all stages of a plant's life cycle, including details about what's happening inside and outside the plant at each stage.\n\n4. **Write a plant perspective narrative**: Students write a short story from the plant's point of view (\"My Life as a Tomato Plant\"), describing each stage of growth and the functions they depend on to survive.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Long-term seedling observation (1-2 weeks)**: Students monitor their planted seeds daily or every few days, recording observations about root and shoot growth. They measure stem height, count leaves, and document changes with sketches. At the end, they create a growth chart and discuss what conditions helped growth (light, water, warmth).\n\n2. **Plant parts in our food**: Bring in vegetables/fruits and have students identify which plant part each represents:\n   - Roots (carrots, beets)\n   - Stems (celery, asparagus)\n   - Leaves (lettuce, spinach, kale)\n   - Seeds (sunflower seeds, beans, corn)\n   - Fruits/seed pods (tomato, pepper, pea pod)\n   \n   Students sort items and discuss: \"Why do we eat so many different plant parts? What do they provide for us?\" This connects to plant function and human nutrition.\n\n3. **Compare animal and plant life cycles**: Introduce a simple animal life cycle (butterfly or frog) and compare it to a plant life cycle. Students create a Venn diagram showing similarities and differences. Discuss: \"Do all living things have life cycles? What's the same? What's different?\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing flexibility**: The Explore phase (seed dissection) works best if seeds are pre-soaked for 30 minutes to an hour before the lesson. Alternatively, use beans purchased from a garden store that are softer or already partially sprouted.\n\n- **Photograph revisiting**: Return to the photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. Each time students see it, they should notice more details and understand them more deeply.\n\n- **Real plants in the classroom**: If possible, maintain growing seedlings from the planted seeds in a sunny classroom window. This provides ongoing observation opportunities and keeps the concept \"alive\" for students.\n\n- **Vocabulary reinforcement**: Use the anchor chart daily for the first week. Point to plant parts in the photo and ask students to name or explain the function without looking at the chart.\n\n- **Assessment note**: The exit ticket can be administered after Day 1 (to assess Engage/Explore) or at the end of the full sequence (to assess all five phases). Adjust timing based on your schedule.\n\n---\n\n## Observation Sheet Template (for Explore Phase)\n\n**My Seed Investigation**  \n**Name: ___________________ Date: ___________________**\n\n**Drawing 1: My Dry Seed (What I See)**  \n[Space for student drawing]\n\n**What I notice about the seed's appearance:**\n- Color: _____________\n- Shape: _____________\n- Texture: _____________\n\n**Drawing 2: Inside My Seed (After Opening It)**  \n[Space for student drawing with labels for: seed coat, embryo, cotyledon]\n\n**What I found inside:**\n- The seed coat is ___________________________\n- The embryo is ____________________________\n- The cotyledon is ___________________________\n\n**My prediction about how my seed will grow:**\n- First: _______________________________\n- Then: _______________________________\n- Finally: ______________________________\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**\n\nThis lesson directly uses the photograph to anchor student learning, progresses logically through the 5E model, and provides concrete evidence of mastery through the exit ticket.
