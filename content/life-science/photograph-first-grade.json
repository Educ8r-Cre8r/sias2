You can see open fields far away.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image represents the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of habitat diversity within an ecosystem. The phenomenon occurs because different plants and animals need different types of homes to survive. Forests provide shade, shelter, and food for woodland creatures, while open fields support different plants and animals that need more sunlight. The road creates an \"edge effect\" where forest meets open space, creating even more variety in the types of living things that can survive in this area.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Habitats** - Different animals and plants live in different places that meet their needs\n2. **Forest Ecosystems** - Trees provide homes, food, and shelter for many living things\n3. **Human Impact** - People build roads and change natural areas\n4. **Plant Needs** - Trees need space, water, air, and sunlight to grow\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"I Notice, I Wonder, It Reminds Me Of\" protocol when first showing this image. This helps students make observations before jumping to conclusions and connects to their prior experiences with forests or roads.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to share observations: drawing, verbal sharing, or using movement to act out what animals might live in different parts of the image. This supports different learning styles and language development levels.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** Inside the soil under these trees, tiny roots are growing and spreading out to find water and nutrients. Microscopic bacteria and fungi help the tree roots get what they need to grow big and strong.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This forest is part of a much larger ecosystem that includes rivers, mountains, and other forests. Animals might travel between different forest areas to find food, and seeds from these trees can travel by wind or animals to start new forests far away.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"All animals live in trees\"  \n   **Clarification:** Different animals need different types of homes - some live in trees, some on the ground, some underground, and some in water.\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"Trees don't need anything to survive\"  \n   **Clarification:** Trees are living things that need water, air, sunlight, and nutrients from soil to grow and stay healthy.\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"The road doesn't affect the forest\"  \n   **Clarification:** Roads can make it harder for some animals to move around and find food, and they change where plants can grow.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** 1-LS1-1: Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs\n- **Disciplinary Core Idea:** [[NGSS:DCI:1-LS1.A]] - All organisms have external parts that they use to perform daily functions\n- **Crosscutting Concept:** [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] - The shape and stability of structures are related to their function\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you think lives in this forest that we can't see in the picture? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n2. How might the animals that live in the forest be different from animals that live in the open fields? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n3. What would happen to the forest animals if all the trees were cut down? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. Why do you think some areas have lots of trees while others are open fields? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Habitat:** The place where a plant or animal lives and gets what it needs.\n* **Forest:** A place with many trees growing together.\n* **Ecosystem:** All the living and non-living things in an area that work together.\n* **Shelter:** A safe place where animals can hide and rest.\n* **Environment:** Everything around a living thing, including air, water, and land.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- The Great Kapok Tree by Lynne Cherry\n- A Tree Is Nice by Janice May Udry\n- The Busy Tree by Jennifer Ward\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- \"Forest Habitat | Animal Homes\" - Educational video showing different forest animals and their homes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QQaWzVMJlE\n- \"What Do Trees Need to Grow?\" - Simple explanation of tree needs for young learners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwQlByTbMSs",
