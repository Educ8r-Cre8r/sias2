You can see its four wings spread out from its body.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image shows the **anchoring phenomenon** of insect adaptation for survival. The dragonfly demonstrates specialized body structures that help it survive in its environment. Its large compound eyes provide excellent vision for hunting prey and avoiding predators. The four wings allow for incredible flight maneuvers, including hovering and flying backwards. The streamlined body reduces air resistance during flight, while the striped coloration may provide camouflage or warning signals to other animals.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Animal Body Parts and Functions**: Dragonflies have specialized structures like compound eyes for seeing, wings for flying, and strong legs for catching prey.\n\n2. **Adaptation for Survival**: The dragonfly's body parts help it survive by finding food, escaping danger, and moving through its environment.\n\n3. **Life Cycles**: Dragonflies undergo complete metamorphosis, starting as aquatic nymphs before transforming into flying adults.\n\n4. **Habitat Requirements**: Dragonflies need both water (for reproduction) and air (for adult life), showing how animals depend on their environment.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"See-Think-Wonder\" thinking routine when introducing this image.

    "grade5": "## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis close-up photograph shows a dragonfly perched on a piece of weathered wood. The dragonfly has large, bright blue compound eyes and transparent wings with intricate vein patterns. You can clearly see its segmented body with yellow and green markings, and its thin antennae extending from its head.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe **Anchoring Phenomenon** this image represents is **insect adaptation for predation and flight**. Dragonflies are incredibly efficient aerial hunters with specialized body structures that make them nearly perfect flying machines. Their large compound eyes provide nearly 360-degree vision to spot prey, while their four independently-moving wings allow them to hover, fly backwards, and make sharp turns. This combination of sensory and locomotor adaptations has remained virtually unchanged for over 300 million years because it is so successful for their survival as aerial predators.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Compound Eyes and Vision**: Dragonflies have compound eyes made of thousands of individual lenses called ommatidia, giving them exceptional motion detection abilities and wide field of vision.\n\n2. **Wing Structure and Flight Mechanics**: The transparent wings show a network of veins that provide structural support while keeping the wings lightweight for efficient flight.\n\n3. **Body Segmentation**: Like all insects, dragonflies have three main body segments (head, thorax, abdomen) with specialized functions for different life processes.\n\n4. **Predator Adaptations**: The combination of excellent vision, agile flight, and strong mandibles makes dragonflies highly successful predators in their ecosystem.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use hand lenses or magnifying glasses to let students examine real dragonfly wings or high-quality photographs.
