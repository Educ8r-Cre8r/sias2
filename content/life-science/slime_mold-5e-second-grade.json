ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity and activate prior knowledge about living things and habitats using the striking photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of slime molds (or digital projection)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Index cards or sticky notes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph prominently** on a whiteboard or print large copies for small groups. Do not name the organism yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds**, then facilitate a \"Turn and Talk\" where partners share what they notice.\n\n3. **Pose these specific curiosity-sparking questions:**\n   - \"What do you think this yellow thing might be? Is it a plant, an animal, or something else?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this yellow mystery lives? What clues help you decide?\"\n   - \"Does it look alive to you? What makes you think that?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen anything like this before when you were outside playing?\"\n\n4. **Create a Wonder Board:** Record student predictions and questions on chart paper without confirming or denying. Examples: \"Is it a toy?\" \"Is it a plant?\" \"Why is it so yellow?\" \"Is it squishy?\"\n\n5. **Show a brief (30-second) video clip** of a slime mold moving or growing (search \"slime mold time-lapse,\" YouTube has excellent Second Grade-appropriate options). Students' jaws will drop!\n\n**Transition:** \"Scientists have lots of questions about mysterious things too! Today we're going to be investigators and explore what this amazing yellow living thing really is.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover characteristics of slime molds and their habitats through hands-on observation and habitat exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real slime mold specimens (in jars with preserved wet wood, or high-quality photographs if live specimens unavailable)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (at least one per pair)\n- Observation clipboards\n- \"Slime Mold Detective Sheet\" (template provided below)\n- Samples of forest floor materials: dead leaves, twigs, soil, bark pieces, rotting wood (in separate containers)\n- Paper towels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station 1: Close-Up Observation (10 minutes)**\n1. Organize students into pairs. Provide each pair with a slime mold specimen (jar with preserved specimen or photo) and a hand lens.\n2. **Student directions (read aloud and post visually):**\n   - \"Use your hand lens to look very carefully at the slime mold. What do you see?\"\n   - \"Touch the container gently (don't open it). What does the texture remind you of? Is it smooth? Bumpy? Spongy?\"\n   - \"Describe the color. Is it one color or many colors?\"\n   - \"Draw what you see on your observation sheet.\"\n   - \"Count how many separate pieces or 'fingers' you see.\"\n\n3. **On the \"Slime Mold Detective Sheet,\" students draw and label:**\n   - Color (students color their drawing with crayons/markers)\n   - Texture words (bumpy, spongy, wet-looking)\n   - Shape (finger-like, blob, curved)\n   - Size comparison (bigger than your hand? Smaller?)\n\n**Station 2: Habitat Investigation (10 minutes)**\n1. After Station 1, rotate pairs to Station 2 or assign different pairs simultaneously.\n2. Display containers with forest floor materials: dead leaves, twigs, wet soil, bark, rotting wood.\n3. **Student directions:**\n   - \"In the photo, the slime mold is sitting on dead wood and leaves. Feel each material. Which ones are wet or damp?\"\n   - \"Which materials are dead or rotting?\"\n   - \"Which material do you think the slime mold likes best? Why?\"\n   - \"On your detective sheet, check the box: Does the slime mold live in sunny places or dark, shady places?\"\n\n4. **Teacher circulates with guiding questions (without providing answers):**\n   - \"What do you notice about this material? Is it alive or dead?\"\n   - \"Is this place dry or wet? How can you tell?\"\n   - \"Why might the slime mold choose this spot?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Detailed drawings with color, texture, and shape labels\n- Observations that the slime mold grows on damp, dead plant material\n- Recognition that slime molds are found in shady, moist forest floor habitats\n- Ability to identify and touch real decomposing wood and leaves\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after hands-on exploration. Connect observations to the living world.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary cards\n- \"What Is a Slime Mold?\" anchor chart (teacher-created or printed)\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Picture cards showing plant, animal, and slime mold\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students for group share-out** in a circle or carpet area. Hold up the original photograph again.\n\n2. **Facilitate discussion:**\n   - \"Let's share what we discovered! Turn and tell your partner one thing you learned.\"\n   - Call on 4-5 pairs to share one observation. Write on chart paper.\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary with Second Grade-friendly definitions:**\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---------------------------|\n   | **Slime Mold** | A living thing that is not a plant or an animal. It lives in damp, dark places like forest floors and breaks down dead plants. |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where a living thing lives. It has the food, water, and shelter the living thing needs. |\n   | **Organism** | Any living thing, like a plant, animal, or slime mold. |\n   | **Decompose/Decomposer** | To break down or rot. A slime mold is a decomposer because it breaks down dead leaves and wood. |\n   | **Damp** | A little bit wet; not soaking, but not dry. |\n\n4. **Explain using the photograph:**\n   - \"This is a slime mold. It's a living thing, but it's not a plant because it doesn't have roots or leaves. It's not an animal because it doesn't have a mouth or eyes or legs.\"\n   - \"It lives in a special habitat — the forest floor where dead leaves and wood are found. It needs a damp, dark place.\"\n   - \"Slime molds have an important job: they break down dead plants so they can become soil. They're decomposers!\"\n   - \"See how bright yellow it is? That bright color might scare away bugs that want to eat it. That's called a warning color!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding with a \"Thumbs Up, Sideways, Down\" strategy:**\n   - \"I'm going to say some statements. Show thumbs up if you think it's true, sideways if you're not sure, and down if it's false.\"\n   - \"A slime mold is a plant.\" (Down)\n   - \"A slime mold lives in wet, shady places.\" (Up)\n   - \"A slime mold helps break down dead wood.\" (Up)\n   - \"You can find slime molds on a sunny, dry sidewalk.\" (Down)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and identify a slime mold\n- Students understand that slime molds are neither plants nor animals\n- Students know slime molds live in damp, dark forest floor habitats\n- Students understand that slime molds are decomposers with an important role\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (16-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to new contexts and make real-world connections.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos of different habitats (forest floor, desert, pond, grassland, tree trunk)\n- Scenario cards with habitat descriptions\n- \"Slime Mold Homes\" worksheet or chart\n- Crayons and colored pencils\n- Optional: small potted plant or terrarium setup for follow-up\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Matching Game (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display picture cards** of different habitats around the room (forest floor, desert, grassland, wet pond edge, sunny garden).\n\n2. **Explain the game:** \"Now that you're slime mold experts, let's figure out where slime molds WOULD and WOULD NOT live.\"\n\n3. **Read scenario cards aloud one at a time; students walk to or point to the habitat they think is best for a slime mold:**\n   - \"Slime mold is looking for a home. This place is HOT and DRY with no rain. Is this a good home?\" (Students point to desert — NO)\n   - \"This place has lots of shade, dead leaves on the ground, and it rained last night. Is this good?\" (Forest floor — YES)\n   - \"This place is in the bright, hot sun with no dead plants nearby. Is this good?\" (Sunny garden — NO)\n   - \"This place is dark and damp with lots of rotting wood. Is this good?\" (Under logs/forest floor — YES)\n\n4. **Have students justify their choices:** \"Why would/wouldn't a slime mold live there?\"\n\n**Option B: Design a Slime Mold Home (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Give each student a \"Slime Mold Homes\" worksheet** with the prompt: \"Draw the perfect home for a slime mold. Remember what it needs to survive!\"\n\n2. **Students draw and label:**\n   - Is it sunny or shady?\n   - Is it wet or dry?\n   - Are there dead plants to decompose?\n   - What color would it be to help it hide?\n\n3. **Students share drawings in pairs or small groups with one-sentence explanations.**\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Why did you choose this place?\" \"What does your slime mold need to stay alive?\" \"Is this damp or dry? How do you know?\"\n- Accept all reasonable answers; the goal is application of learned concepts.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify appropriate habitats based on moisture, light, and food sources\n- Students explain why certain habitats are better than others\n- Students demonstrate understanding that slime molds need specific conditions to survive\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of slime mold characteristics, habitats, and their role as decomposers.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Watch students' drawings and listen to their descriptions. Do they identify color, texture, and shape?\n- **Thumbs check during Explain:** Note which students struggle with true/false statements about slime molds and re-teach as needed.\n- **Listening during Elaborate:** Do students justify habitat choices using words like \"damp,\" \"shade,\" and \"dead plants\"?\n\n**Summative Exit Ticket (5-8 minutes):**\n\nDisplay these three questions on chart paper or give students a printed exit ticket. Students respond by drawing, pointing, or writing simple sentences:\n\n1. **\"Which picture shows where a slime mold would live?\"** (Show: a sunny, dry sidewalk OR a damp, shady forest floor with dead leaves. CORRECT: forest floor)\n\n2. **\"What is one job that a slime mold does?\"** (Accept: breaks down dead plants, rots wood, makes soil, helps nature recycle)\n\n3. **\"Is a slime mold a plant, an animal, or something different? Tell why.\"** (CORRECT: Something different. It's not a plant because it has no roots or leaves. It's not an animal because it has no eyes, mouth, or legs.)\n\n**Success Criteria (Evidence That Students Met Objectives):**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies slime mold habitat (damp, shady, with dead plants)\n- ✓ Student recognizes slime mold is neither plant nor animal\n- ✓ Student explains one role of slime molds (decomposer, breaks down dead stuff)\n- ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary word correctly (slime mold, habitat, decompose, damp, organism)\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- **Successful:** 3/3 or 4/4 exit ticket questions answered correctly OR student shows understanding through drawings with labels\n- **Approaching:** Student answers 2/3 or 3/4 but may need clarification on one concept (habitat vs. organism type)\n- **Needs Support:** Student struggles with more than one concept; schedule follow-up exploration or re-teach with manipulatives\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce Language Demand:**\n   - Use picture cards instead of written words; label them together\n   - Pre-teach vocabulary with concrete objects (real damp soil, dead leaves, sunlight vs. shade)\n   - Partner with a strong reader/communicator for turn-and-talks\n\n2. **Provide Sentence Frames for Exit Ticket:**\n   - \"A slime mold lives in a _______ place.\" (damp/dark/shady)\n   - \"A slime mold eats ________.\" (dead plants/dead wood/rotting leaves)\n   - \"A slime mold is not a plant because _______.\" (no leaves/no roots)\n\n3. **Simplify Observation Sheets:**\n   - Instead of detailed drawings, provide a large outline of a slime mold; students color and label only color and texture\n   - Use matching instead of open-ended questions (\"Draw a line: Slime molds like... [sunny places / damp places]\")\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Introduce Life Cycle Thinking:**\n   - \"If a slime mold breaks down a dead leaf, what happens next? Where does the leaf go?\" (Becomes soil; nutrients return to earth)\n   - \"What eats the slime mold? Who depends on the slime mold?\" (Slugs, beetles, fungi)\n   - Provide a simple food chain diagram: Dead plant → Slime Mold → Slug → Bird\n\n2. **Compare Multiple Decomposers:**\n   - Show pictures of mushrooms, bacteria, worms — other decomposers\n   - Ask: \"How is a slime mold different from a mushroom? How is it the same?\" (Both grow on dead stuff; mushrooms have a cap, slime molds don't; both are decomposers)\n   - Have students sort pictures into \"Plants,\" \"Animals,\" \"Decomposers\"\n\n3. **Investigate Habitat Variables:**\n   - \"What if we kept a slime mold in a sunny place instead of a shady place? What would happen?\"\n   - \"What if the wood was completely dry instead of damp? Would the slime mold still grow?\"\n   - Have advanced students design a simple prediction: \"If _______, then the slime mold will _______.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Create a Forest Floor Diorama or Terrarium:**\n   - Students build a miniature forest floor habitat in a shoebox or clear container\n   - Include: soil, dead leaves, twigs, moss, and (if available and safe) a slime mold specimen\n   - Students observe for one week and draw daily observations in a \"Forest Floor Journal\"\n   - Discuss: \"What do you notice about the slime mold over time? Is it growing? Moving?\"\n\n2. **Scavenger Hunt Preparation:**\n   - Once students understand slime mold habitats, take the class on a nature walk (in fall/spring when conditions are right) or show a guided photo tour\n   - Students search for evidence of decomposers: mushrooms, rotting logs, slime molds, fungal growth\n   - They photograph or sketch findings and report back to class: \"We found ___ decomposers. They were living on ___ because ___.\"\n\n3. **Comparative Organism Chart:**\n   - Create a three-column class chart: \"Plants,\" \"Animals,\" \"Slime Molds\" (or other decomposers)\n   - Students contribute characteristics they know: roots, legs, color, habitat, food source\n   - Use to solidify that slime molds are a unique category of living things with their own characteristics\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Notes\n\nThis lesson directly addresses **2-LS4-1** (Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats) by:\n- Having students observe a slime mold, an organism that is neither a typical plant nor animal\n- Comparing slime molds to plants and animals students already know\n- Investigating and describing the specific habitat (forest floor, damp, shady) where slime molds live\n- Recognizing that life is diverse and organisms have unique adaptations for their environments\n\nThe lesson is concrete, visual, and hands-on — appropriate for Second Grade scientists who learn through observation, exploration, and play.",
