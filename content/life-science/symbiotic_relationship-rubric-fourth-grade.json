        "exceeds": "Student explains that fuzz traps pollen grains and identifies specific benefits for both organisms: the bee gets food (nectar/pollen) and the flower gets help spreading pollen for reproduction. Uses terms like \"pollen,\" \"reproduction,\" or \"pollination\" accurately.",
        "meets": "Student identifies that fuzz helps collect pollen and explains that this benefits the bee (gets food) and the flower (pollen moves between flowers). Reasoning is clear but may lack scientific vocabulary.",
        "approaching": "Student recognizes that the fuzzy body relates to pollen collection and mentions benefit to either the bee or the flower, but explanation is incomplete or partially unclear.",
        "beginning": "Student makes a simple observation about the bee being fuzzy or mentions pollen, but does not explain how this helps both the bee and flower, or response is vague."

        "exceeds": "Student predicts flowers would not reproduce or make seeds, and explains this would mean fewer flowers grow next year. Response shows understanding of the connection between pollination, reproduction, and population growth.",

      "dokLevel": 2,
      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student explains that the bee-flower relationship helps both organisms (mutualism/symbiosis), while predator-prey harms the prey. Uses accurate vocabulary and distinguishes between the two types of relationships.",
        "meets": "Student identifies that bees and flowers help each other, while a predator hurts or eats its prey. Explanation shows clear understanding of the difference between cooperation and hunting.",
        "approaching": "Student recognizes some difference between the relationships (e.g., the flower gives food to the bee vs. predator kills prey) but explanation lacks clarity or completeness.",

        "exceeds": "Student identifies multiple senses (sight of bright colors, smell of scent, possibly taste) and explains how each sense helps the bee find flowers. References specific details from the photo like the bright red color.",
        "meets": "Student identifies at least two senses bees use, such as seeing bright colors or smelling flowers, and explains how these help locate flowers with food.",
        "approaching": "Student mentions one or two senses (like color or smell) but explanation of how the senses help the bee is incomplete or unclear.",
        "beginning": "Student names one sense or provides a vague response about how bees find flowers without clear reasoning."
