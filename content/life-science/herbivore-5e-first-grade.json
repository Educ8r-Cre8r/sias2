ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about animal tracks and activate prior knowledge about animals and their habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of animal tracks (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Pictures of common local animals (deer, rabbit, squirrel, bird)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** by projecting it large on the board or passing around printed copies. Make sure all students can see the tracks clearly in the center and the surrounding plants.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see in the middle of the picture? What could have made those marks in the dirt?\"\n   - \"Do you think an animal walked here? How do you know?\"\n   - \"What kind of animal do you think made these tracks? Why do you think that?\"\n   - \"Why is there soil and plants in the same place? What might animals need from this spot?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Say, \"I wonder what animal visitor came to this place. I wonder if we can find tracks like this near our school.\" Have students turn to a partner and share their predictions about what animal made the tracks.\n\n4. **Record predictions** on chart paper titled \"Whose Tracks Are These?\" Keep this visible for the rest of the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become animal detectives. We'll learn how animals use their feet to walk and leave tracks, and we'll discover what those tracks tell us about the animals that visit our habitats.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how different animal feet work and create their own tracks.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Shallow container or plate filled with sand, soil, or flour (1-2 inches deep)\n- Small plastic animal figures or toys representing different animals (bear, dog, cat, deer, bird, rabbit)\n- Drawing paper and colored pencils\n- Optional: digital camera or tablet to photograph their tracks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Give students explicit directions:**\n   - \"You will get an animal toy. Press it gently into the sand/soil in your container to make a track.\"\n   - \"Make 3-4 tracks with the same animal. Press from different directions so you can see the track clearly.\"\n   - \"Draw a picture of the track your animal made. Label it with the animal's name.\"\n   - \"Switch animals with a partner and repeat. Try at least 3 different animals.\"\n\n2. **Connect to the photograph:** Say, \"Just like the photograph shows real animal tracks in the dirt, you're making tracks to show how different animals' feet look and work.\"\n\n3. **What students should record:**\n   - Drawings or photographs of tracks from at least 3 different animals\n   - Observations: \"Does this animal have toes?\" \"Are the tracks big or small?\" \"Can you see where the animal walked?\"\n\n4. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n   - \"What does your animal's foot look like? How many toes does it have?\"\n   - \"Are these tracks the same as your friend's animal tracks? How are they different?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this animal's tracks look different from that one?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create visible tracks showing that different animals have different-shaped feet.\n- Students discover that larger animals make bigger tracks and smaller animals make smaller tracks.\n- Students record observations that will support the next phase.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts about how animal body parts help them survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Pictures of animal feet (simple illustrations or photos of a dog's paw, bird's foot, deer hoof, etc.)\n- Student track drawings from Explore phase\n- Whiteboard or poster board\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore phase:**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to show their track drawings and describe which animal made each track.\n   - Ask the class: \"What do you notice? Are all the tracks the same shape?\" (Guide them to see differences.)\n   - Place their drawings on the board to create a visual \"track field guide.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions:**\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Track** | A mark left behind when an animal's foot touches dirt, sand, or mud. |\n   | **Feet** | The body parts animals use to walk and move from place to place. |\n   | **Toes** | The parts at the end of an animal's foot that help it grip and walk. |\n   | **Habitat** | A place where plants and animals live and find food and shelter. |\n   | **External parts** | Body parts on the outside of an animal that help it do things, like feet, legs, wings, and tails. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the original photograph projected on the board.\n   - Say: \"This track was made by an animal's feet. The feet are external parts—parts on the outside of the animal. The feet help the animal move through the habitat to find food, water, and shelter.\"\n   - Ask: \"What other external parts help animals move? What about legs? Tails?\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"Show me your biggest track. That animal probably has big feet. Why might a big animal need big feet?\" (Support: Accept answers like \"to hold it up\" or \"to walk far.\")\n   - Ask: \"Can you find a track that looks different from all the others? Why is it different?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:** (Already listed above in activity)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that tracks are marks made by animal feet.\n- Students recognize that different animals have different-shaped feet that help them survive in their habitats.\n- Students connect the photograph to the concept that animal external parts help them move and survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a solution to help a human problem using animal adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Craft materials: foam, felt, socks, ribbon, tape, scissors\n- A simple human problem scenario card (see below)\n- Student worksheet or poster board\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the real-world scenario:**\n   - Display this problem: \"A person needs to walk safely in mud and sand without getting stuck. Animals like deer and birds can walk on soft ground without sinking. How could we design special shoes or feet like an animal's to solve this problem?\"\n\n2. **Guide students through design:**\n   - Show pictures of a deer's hooves and a bird's feet (toes spread out).\n   - Say: \"How could we make shoes that work like an animal's feet?\"\n   - Have students work in pairs to design and build a simple \"animal-inspired\" shoe or foot model using craft materials.\n   - Students should explain: \"My shoe is like a [animal] foot because _______.\"\n\n3. **Teacher role:**\n   - Ask: \"Which animal's feet would work best for walking in mud? Why?\"\n   - Encourage students to test their models in a shallow pan of sand or flour to see if they work.\n   - Prompt: \"Does it work like the animal's feet? What would you change?\"\n\n4. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students create a model shoe or foot inspired by an animal.\n   - Students explain how animal external parts inspired their design.\n   - Students test their model and describe whether it works well.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how animal feet/external parts help them survive and how to observe and identify tracks.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Listen to student discussions during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Review student drawings and photographs of tracks.\n- Note student responses to guiding questions.\n\n**Summative assessment—Exit Ticket (end of Day 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal or written with teacher support):\n\n1. **Show a picture of a new animal track** (one not used during the lesson—e.g., a rabbit, squirrel, or raccoon).\n   - Ask: \"What animal might have made this track? Why do you think so?\"\n\n2. **Ask one of these questions:**\n   - \"How do an animal's feet help it survive in its habitat?\"\n   - \"Why are tracks different from animal to animal?\"\n   - \"What external part of an animal helps it move and leave tracks?\"\n\n3. **Success criteria for student understanding:**\n   - ✓ Student identifies or makes a reasonable prediction about the animal.\n   - ✓ Student connects the track to animal feet and survival (\"to walk,\" \"to find food,\" \"to move in the dirt\").\n   - ✓ Student describes at least one way animal body parts help them survive.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate they can observe and interpret tracks as evidence of animals in habitats.\n- Students explain that external body parts (feet, legs) help animals move and survive.\n- Students show understanding that different animals have different body parts and leave different tracks.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce complexity of animal choices:** Provide only 2-3 very different animals (e.g., a large animal like a dog, a small animal like a bird, and a hoofed animal like a deer) rather than many similar animals. This makes comparison clearer.\n\n2. **Scaffold vocabulary:** Use picture cards with the animal picture and track together. Label these cards and display them throughout the lesson. Refer back to them during discussions.\n\n3. **Provide sentence frames for observations:** Give students a template like \"The _____ animal has a _____ track because its feet are _____.\" Help them fill in blanks together.\n\n4. **Offer hand-over-hand support:** During Explore, physically guide some students' hands as they gently press the animal into the sand, showing the motion and force needed.\n\n---\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Make more complex comparisons:** Ask students to sort their track drawings by size (biggest to smallest) or by number of toes, and explain the pattern they created.\n\n2. **Introduce fossil connection:** Show simple pictures of fossil footprints and ask: \"How do you think scientists know what animals lived long ago? Could tracks help us figure out which animals were here in the past?\" This connects to 1-LS3-1 and introduces deeper thinking.\n\n3. **Design for a different habitat:** Ask: \"If you were designing an animal's feet for walking on ice (or in water, or on a tree), what would they look like? Why?\" Have them sketch and explain their design.\n\n4. **Research local animals:** Provide a simple field guide of local animals and their tracks. Ask students to match track pictures to the animal guide and identify which animals might live near your school.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Take a \"Track Walk\" around your school grounds or neighborhood:**\n   - If possible (and weather permits), take students outside to look for real animal tracks near soil, gardens, or flowerbeds—just like the photograph.\n   - Provide clipboards and paper. Students sketch and label any tracks they find.\n   - Bring them back to the classroom to compare with the tracks they made in the lesson.\n   - Create a classroom \"Track Field Guide\" poster with real and imaginary tracks.\n\n2. **Story writing or picture book creation:**\n   - Students create a simple story or picture book titled \"The Animal That Made the Track.\"\n   - They write/dictate: What animal made the track? Where is it going? What does it need to find in the habitat? What body parts help it survive?\n   - This reinforces understanding while connecting to literacy.\n\n3. **Parent letter and home investigation:**\n   - Send home a letter explaining the lesson with simple instructions for families to look for animal tracks in their own yards, parks, or neighborhoods.\n   - Provide a simple observation sheet: \"Draw the track we found. Describe the animal you think made it. How do you think its feet helped it move?\"\n   - Have students share their findings in class during the next session.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson builds directly from the photograph's visible animal tracks and surrounding habitat, giving first graders concrete, hands-on experience with how animals use their external body parts to survive and move through their environments.",
