Observe and describe the parts of a germinated seed and identify what each part does.\n2. Explain that seeds need water and light to grow into plants.\n3. Demonstrate how seeds travel from one place to another (seed dispersal) using a model.\n4. Record observations about plant growth over time using drawings and simple words.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed image of the bean seedling (the photograph provided)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: actual bean seeds in a bowl for students to handle\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image on the board or pass around a printed copy in a document holder so all students can see clearly. Give students 30 seconds of silent looking time.\n\n2. **Launch with Wonder:** Say: \"This is a baby plant that came from a tiny seed. What do you notice? What do you wonder?\"\n\n3. **Guided Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What parts do you see? Can you point to something green? Something brown or tan?\"\n   - \"Where did this baby plant come from? Do you think it started as a seed?\"\n   - \"What do you think a plant needs to grow big and strong?\"\n   - \"If you planted a seed in the dark under your bed, what do you think would happen?\"\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** Hold up a dry bean seed (if available) and say: \"Inside this tiny seed is a baby plant, just like the one in the picture. If we give this seed water and put it in a sunny spot, what do you predict will happen?\" Record student predictions on chart paper with words and simple drawings.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to plant our own seeds and investigate what plants really need to grow, just like the plant in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Dried bean seeds (pinto, lima, or kidney beans work well)—5–6 per student\n- 4 clear plastic cups or clear containers per student\n- Potting soil or classroom soil\n- Spray bottles filled with water\n- Paper towels\n- Labels and markers\n- Access to a sunny windowsill\n- Observation sheet (simple template with spaces for drawings and checkboxes)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup (Teacher-Directed):**\n   - Divide the class into two investigation groups.\n   - **Group A:** Will plant seeds in soil and place in sunlight with water.\n   - **Group B:** Will plant seeds in soil and place in a dark or shaded location (e.g., a cabinet or box) with water.\n   - Explain: \"We're testing whether plants really need sunlight to grow.\"\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Fill your cup about three-quarters full with soil. Press the soil down gently.\"\n   - \"Place 2–3 bean seeds on top of the soil. Cover them with about 1 inch of soil.\"\n   - \"Spray water until the soil is moist but not soggy—like a wrung-out sponge.\"\n   - \"Label your cup with your name and today's date.\"\n   - \"Group A: Place your cup on the sunny windowsill.\"\n   - \"Group B: Place your cup in the dark location (we'll check it daily).\"\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:**\n   - \"The plant in the picture already sprouted. Let's see if ours will look like it in a few days!\"\n\n4. **Recording:**\n   - Provide a simple observation sheet with:\n     - A space to draw what the soil looks like today\n     - Checkboxes: \"Did we give it water? Yes/No\" and \"Is it sunny? Yes/No\"\n     - A line: \"I predict my seed will...\"\n\n5. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate to ensure soil is moist (not waterlogged) and seeds are covered.\n   - Ask questions: \"What do you think will happen in this cup?\" \"Why did you put it there?\"\n   - Do not reveal answers; encourage observation and prediction.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will have planted seeds with water in two different light conditions.\n- Students will have made predictions and documented them.\n- Over the next few days (before Session 2), Group A seeds should begin sprouting visibly; Group B should show little to no growth, providing concrete evidence.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The original photograph (projected or printed)\n- Simple diagram of seed parts (teacher-made or found online)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Observations (Days 2–3 after planting):**\n   - Have students observe their planted seeds.\n   - Ask: \"What do you see? Did anything change? Which cup has more growth—the sunny one or the dark one?\"\n   - Discuss Group A vs. Group B results on chart paper.\n\n2. **Return to the Photograph:**\n   - Project the seedling image again.\n   - Say: \"This baby plant had water and sunlight. Let's name the parts we can see.\"\n   - Label on the image (or on a simple diagram):\n     - **Roots** (the tan, thin, wavy parts going down)\n     - **Stem** (the main green stalk)\n     - **Seed Leaves/Cotyledons** (the first leaves that came from the seed)\n     - **Seed Coat** (the brown part—the seed's protective shell)\n\n3. **Key Vocabulary (with student-friendly definitions):**\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---------------------------|\n   | **Germinate** | When a seed wakes up and starts to grow roots and leaves. |\n   | **Seed Coat** | The hard, protective shell that keeps the baby plant safe until it's ready to grow. |\n   | **Root** | The part of the plant that grows downward into the soil to drink water. |\n   | **Stem** | The green stalk that grows upward and holds up the leaves. |\n   | **Sunlight** | Light from the sun that plants need to make food and grow strong. |\n\n4. **Direct Instruction:**\n   - Explain: \"Plants are living things that need three things to grow: water, sunlight, and soil. Water comes from the ground. Sunlight comes from the sun. Soil gives the plant nutrients—like food for plants.\"\n   - Point to the photograph: \"This seedling received all three. That's why it grew roots, a stem, and green leaves.\"\n   - Say: \"Our Group B seeds in the dark didn't grow as well. Without sunlight, plants get pale and weak. Plants need sunlight to grow healthy and green.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If you forgot to water your plant, what would happen?\" (Expect: It would dry up, wilt, or die.)\n   - Ask: \"If you put your plant in a dark closet, what would it look like after a week?\" (Expect: Pale, weak, or no growth.)\n   - Ask: \"What do the roots do?\" (Expect: Drink water or hold the plant in the soil.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Germinate:** When a seed wakes up and starts to grow roots and leaves.\n- **Seed Coat:** The hard, protective shell that keeps the baby plant safe.\n- **Root:** The part of the plant that grows downward into the soil to drink water.\n- **Stem:** The green stalk that grows upward and holds up the leaves.\n- **Sunlight:** Light from the sun that plants need to make food and grow strong.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify parts of a seed and seedling.\n- Students understand that plants need water, sunlight, and soil to grow.\n- Students can explain why Group A plants grew better than Group B plants (light requirement).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Various objects for seed dispersal model: cotton balls, plastic bags, tape, paper cups, paint, markers\n- Pictures of different animals (bird, squirrel, ant, person, wind) that disperse seeds\n- Chart showing seed dispersal methods\n- Construction paper\n- Glue sticks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Seed Dispersal Introduction:**\n   - Say: \"Seeds need to travel to new places to grow. But seeds can't walk or run! How do you think seeds get from one place to another?\"\n   - Show pictures of seeds being spread by: wind (dandelion, maple), animals (acorns, burrs), water (coconuts), people (planting gardens).\n\n2. **Build a Seed Dispersal Model:**\n   - Explain: \"We're going to make a model of how a seed travels.\"\n   - **Option A (Wind):** Attach a cotton ball to a paper cup with tape. Students decorate it and test how far it \"floats\" when dropped or blown.\n   - **Option B (Animal):** Create a model \"burr\" using a cup with velcro or sticky tape that \"sticks\" to a felt cloth (representing animal fur). Test how the seed \"travels\" on the animal.\n   - **Option C (Water):** Place a seed in a plastic bag \"boat\" and float it in a tub of water to show how water carries seeds.\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph and Real World:**\n   - Say: \"The bean plant in our picture came from a seed. That seed probably came from a bean farmer's garden. But in nature, animals or wind carry seeds far away, and new plants grow in new places. Our models show how that happens!\"\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Students draw and label their seed dispersal model.\n   - Write or dictate: \"This seed travels by _______.\"\n\n5. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Facilitate model building; provide assistance with tape, glue, etc.\n   - Ask: \"How far did your seed travel? Why do you think it went that far?\"\n   - Celebrate creative designs and effort.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a working model of seed dispersal.\n- Students explain (verbally or in writing) how their seed travels.\n- Students connect seed dispersal to real plants and animals in their community.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant life cycles, seed structures, and growth requirements.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observation of student predictions, discussions, and model-building\n- Review of observation sheets and drawings\n- Questioning during discussions (listen for understanding of vocabulary and concepts)\n- Note which students correctly identify seed parts and growth requirements\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (End of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be drawn, dictated to an aide, or written depending on literacy level):\n\n**Question 1 (with picture reference or sentence frame):**\n\"A seed needs _________________ to grow.\" \n(Acceptable answers: water, sunlight, soil, or any combination)\n\n**Question 2:**\n\"Draw or tell me: What three parts do you see in the baby plant picture?\"\n(Success: Students identify any two of: roots, stem, seed leaves, seed coat)\n\n**Question 3:**\n\"If you planted a bean seed in a dark closet, what would happen?\"\n(Success: Students predict poor or no growth; may say \"pale,\" \"weak,\" or \"won't grow well\")\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Students identify at least two parts of a seedling.\n- ✓ Students can name at least two things plants need to grow (water and light).\n- ✓ Students predict that light affects plant growth.\n- ✓ Students create and describe a seed dispersal model.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will demonstrate understanding of basic plant needs and seed structure.\n- Students will be able to explain why their Group A plants grew better than Group B.\n- Exit tickets will show familiarity with vocabulary (seed coat, root, stem, germinate).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Sentence Frames for Explanations:**\n   - \"Plants need __________ and __________ to grow.\"\n   - \"The __________ is the part that drinks water.\"\n   - Provide fill-in-the-blank observation sheets instead of open-ended questions.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Support:**\n   - Use picture cards with words for seed parts; students match pictures to labels.\n   - Pre-teach vocabulary (root, stem, leaves) during a mini-lesson before Engage phase.\n   - Display a permanent word wall with pictures and definitions.\n\n3. **Hands-On Modifications:**\n   - Pair struggling students with a peer buddy during planting and model-building.\n   - Provide pre-cut pieces for seed dispersal models so students focus on assembly and understanding rather than fine-motor challenges.\n   - Offer a choice: draw observations or dictate to a teacher/aide instead of writing independently.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Investigation:**\n   - Ask: \"What if we changed only one thing—like watering one plant more than another? What would happen?\" Students design and conduct their own single-variable experiment.\n   - Have students predict and measure plant height growth over 2–3 weeks, recording data on a simple graph.\n\n2. **Deeper Exploration of Concepts:**\n   - Research and report: \"Where do beans come from? What is the life cycle of a bean plant?\" (Plant → Flower → Pod → Bean Seed → Plant)\n   - Investigate: \"Which type of seed do you think travels the farthest—wind-blown or animal-carried? Why?\" Create a data collection project.\n\n3. **Real-World Application:**\n   - Design a garden plan: \"If you were planting a garden, where would you put plants that need lots of sun? Where would you put plants that like shade?\"\n   - Create an informational poster or booklet: \"How to Grow a Healthy Plant\" with labeled diagrams and step-by-step care instructions.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Plant Growth Observation Journal (Days 3–10 after planting):**\n   - Students continue observing their bean plants and drawing weekly changes.\n   - Track: Height, number of leaves, leaf color, stem thickness.\n   - Compare Group A (light) vs. Group B (dark) growth.\n   - **Outcome:** A visual portfolio of plant growth over time; students see germination, root development, and leaf expansion—connecting to the Explain phase concepts.\n\n2. **Seed Dissection and Internal Structure Exploration:**\n   - Soak large bean seeds overnight to soften them.\n   - Students carefully open seeds and examine the embryo (baby plant) inside, the cotyledon (stored food), and the seed coat.\n   - Draw and label what they find inside.\n   - **Outcome:** Deeper understanding of seed structure and function; students see the \"baby plant\" inside the seed coat mentioned in the Explain phase.\n\n3. **Seed Dispersal Scavenger Hunt & Nature Walk:**\n   - Take students on a nature walk around the school grounds or local park.\n   - Challenge them to find seeds or seed structures that are dispersed by wind (dandelion, maple helicopters), animals (burrs, acorns), or water.\n   - Collect (ethically) and bring seeds back to classify by dispersal method.\n   - Create a class display: \"How Seeds Travel in Our Neighborhood.\"\n   - **Outcome:** Real-world connection to seed dispersal concept; students see plant biodiversity and adaptation.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis lesson uses the photograph of a germinated bean seedling as a launching point to investigate what plants need to grow and how seeds disperse. Through hands-on experimentation (planting in light and dark conditions), direct observation, hands-on modeling, and continued documentation, Second Grade students will understand that plants are living things requiring water, sunlight, and soil—and that seeds are nature's way of creating new plants in different places. The lesson meets 2-LS2-1 and 2-LS2-2 standards while building scientific curiosity and observation skills.",
