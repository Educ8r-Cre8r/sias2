Observe and describe characteristics of fungi using words like \"bumpy,\" \"spongy,\" \"pink,\" or \"round.\"\n2. Identify that fungi are living organisms that grow in specific habitats (dark, moist places with dead material).\n3. Explain that fungi help break down dead wood and leaves, returning nutrients to soil.\n4. Compare the habitat needs of fungi to the habitats of plants and animals they already know.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about the unusual organism in the photograph and activate prior knowledge about habitats and living things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of fungi or projected image (large enough for whole class to see)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: hand lens or magnifying glass for small group close-up viewing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or pass around a large printed copy. Do NOT immediately tell students what it is.\n\n2. **Ask students to turn and talk** to a partner for 1 minute: \"What do you see in this picture? What color is it? What shape are the bumps?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate whole-group discussion** using these specific prompts:\n   - \"Is this alive or not alive? How do you know?\" (Students may notice it's growing, has color, or looks wet.)\n   - \"Where do you think this is living? Is it in a sunny garden or somewhere dark and wet?\" (Guide them to notice the brown wood and dark soil.)\n   - \"Could a plant grow here? Could an animal live here? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What do you wonder about this pink, bumpy thing?\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper. Accept all ideas without correction. Examples: \"Is it yucky?\" \"Does it grow?\" \"Is it alive?\" \"Why is it pink?\"\n\n5. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to tell you this is a living thing called a fungus. What do you think it might be eating or using to grow?\"\n\n**Transition:** Now we're going to explore and discover what fungi really are and why they grow in places like this wood and soil.\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate fungi and decomposition through hands-on observation and a model-building activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small clear containers (plastic cups, small jars, or takeout containers) — one per pair of students\n- Dead leaves, small twigs, or bark pieces (collected outdoors or from craft supplies)\n- Damp potting soil or garden soil\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Optional: actual fungal samples if safely available, or printed close-up photos of different fungi\n- Observation worksheets (see below) or science notebooks\n- Hand lenses\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Observation Station (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide students into pairs. Give each pair a hand lens and a small piece of bark, a dead leaf, or twig.\n\n2. **Direct students:** \"Look very closely at your piece of wood/leaf. Do you see anything growing on it? Draw or describe what you see. Is it smooth or bumpy? What color is it?\"\n\n3. Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What's growing here? Is it alive? How do you know?\"\n\n4. **Bring pairs together** and share what they observed. Some pieces may have visible fungi, lichen, or mold; some may not. That's okay.\n\n**Part B: Build a Decomposition Model (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Explain the task:** \"We're going to make a small world where fungi can grow, just like in the picture.\"\n\n2. **Give each pair a container.** Direct step-by-step:\n   - Layer about 2 inches of damp soil in the bottom\n   - Place dead leaves, bark pieces, or twigs on top\n   - Lightly spray with water so it's damp (not soaking)\n   - Cover loosely (don't seal completely—fungi need some air)\n\n3. **Ask:** \"What do you think will happen to this dead leaf over the next few weeks? Will fungi grow on it? Why?\"\n\n4. **Have students record predictions** in a drawing or with words: \"I think the fungi will...\" Students place their containers in a dark, cool area (shelf, closet corner, or windowless shelf).\n\n5. **Assign observation jobs:** \"Over the next two weeks, you'll check your container twice a week. Draw what you see each time. Did anything change? Did anything grow?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate during construction and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you think fungi need to grow?\" \"Where is it warm and wet?\"\n- Do not give answers; instead ask, \"What do you notice?\" or \"What could we try?\"\n- Ensure soil is damp but not waterlogged (fungi need moisture, not mold-killing dryness or mushroom-promoting flooding).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and describe wood and leaf textures using sensory language.\n- Students predict that fungi will grow on dead material.\n- Students recognize that damp, dark conditions are needed.\n- Over time, students see decomposition in action as mold, fungal growth, or bacterial breakdown occurs.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and teach formal concepts about fungi and habitats based on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph from Engage phase\n- Student observation containers (to show progress)\n- Optional: simple illustration of fungi lifecycle (optional visual aid)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on the carpet.** Display the original photograph again.\n\n2. **Ask:** \"Now that you've explored, what do you think this pink, bumpy thing is?\" Listen to student responses. Validate observations.\n\n3. **Introduce the term formally:** \"This is a **fungus** (and many together are called **fungi**). Fungi are living things, but they're not plants and not animals. They're their own kind of living thing.\"\n\n4. **Teach vocabulary in context:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Fungus/Fungi:** A living organism that grows on dead things like wood and leaves and helps break them down.\n   - **Decompose/Decomposition:** The breaking down of dead plants and animals into smaller and smaller pieces, returning nutrients to soil.\n   - **Habitat:** The place where a living thing lives. Fungi live in dark, damp places with dead material.\n   - **Nutrients:** Food and materials that living things need to grow. Fungi help put nutrients back in soil.\n\n5. **Make connections to photograph:**\n   - \"The pink bumps we see are fungi growing on the dead wood. See the dark soil? That's damp and dark—perfect for fungi. Fungi don't need sunlight like plants do.\"\n   - \"The fungi are slowly eating the dead wood, breaking it into pieces. This is decomposition. It takes a long time.\"\n   - \"After fungi break down the wood, those nutrients go back into the soil. Then new plants can use that soil to grow!\"\n\n6. **Compare habitats:**\n   - Chart: Draw two columns: \"Fungi Habitat\" and \"Plant Habitat\"\n   - Fungi: Dark, damp, dead material\n   - Plants: Sunny, soil with nutrients, need water\n   - Ask: \"Why doesn't fungi grow in the sunny part of the garden?\"\n\n7. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Thumbs up, thumbs sideways, or thumbs down: I understand what fungi are.\" (Students show nonverbal response.)\n   - \"Where do fungi like to grow? Can someone tell me?\"\n   - \"What is fungi doing to the dead wood?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define fungi as a living organism that breaks down dead material.\n- Students identify that fungi need dark, damp places with dead material.\n- Students understand decomposition as a natural process that returns nutrients to soil.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of fungi and habitats to a new scenario; deepen learning through comparison and real-world connection.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Four habitat picture cards (or draw simple scenes):\n  1. Sunny vegetable garden\n  2. Dark basement with wet leaf pile\n  3. Sunny lawn\n  4. Rotting log in shady forest\n- Chart paper divided into 4 sections (one per habitat)\n- Index cards with pictures or drawings of: plant seedling, mushroom, tree, mold on bread, frog, moss, fungal growth on log\n- Student worksheet (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Habitat Matching Game (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display four habitat cards** where students can see them.\n\n2. **Explain:** \"Now we know fungi live in special places. Let's figure out where different living things live.\"\n\n3. **Show an index card** (e.g., a plant seedling). Ask: \"Where would this plant grow best? Why?\" Place it in the sunny garden.\n\n4. **Show a mushroom** (or fungi card). Ask: \"Where would fungi grow?\" Students discuss and decide (dark, wet leaf pile or rotting log in forest).\n\n5. **Continue with other pictures:** moss (damp, shady), frog (near water/logs), tree (sunny), mold on bread (dark container—note that mold is a fungus).\n\n6. **Debrief:** \"Different living things live in different habitats because they need different things. Fungi don't need sun, but they need moisture and dead stuff.\"\n\n**Part B: Real-World Connection (5-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Ask:** \"Where have you seen fungi or mold in real life?\" (Bread, basement, bathroom, flower pot, log in yard, etc.)\n\n2. **Share a simple scenario:** \"If your family has a compost pile (or leaf pile) in the yard, fungi help break down vegetable scraps and leaves so they become soil. Fungi are nature's recyclers!\"\n\n3. **Activity option:** \"Draw or write: Where could you find fungi hiding in your own home or yard?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask questions that push thinking: \"Why is that a good home for fungi?\" \"What does fungi need that it finds there?\"\n- Celebrate student thinking and correct misconceptions gently: \"Great thinking! Fungi actually prefer dark places, not sunny ones.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students match organisms to appropriate habitats.\n- Students explain why fungi belong in dark, damp places.\n- Students recognize fungi in everyday contexts (mold, compost, forest logs).\n- Students understand fungi as helpful decomposers.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students meet the learning objectives through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Are students describing the wood/leaf accurately? Do they predict fungi will grow?\n- **Thumbs check during Explain:** Can students show understanding of fungi and habitat?\n- **Questioning during Elaborate:** Can students match organisms to habitats and explain why?\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (end of Session 2 or after Elaborate):**\n\nProvide these 3 questions (read aloud for Second Grade; students draw or dictate responses):\n\n1. **\"What is fungi? Draw it or tell me.\"**\n   - *Success criteria:* Student describes fungi as a living thing, possibly mentioning \"bumpy,\" \"pink,\" \"grows on wood,\" etc.\n\n2. **\"Where does fungi like to live? Circle the right place: sunny garden, dark damp log, or sunny lawn?\"**\n   - *Success criteria:* Student circles \"dark damp log\" and can explain \"it likes dark and wet.\"\n\n3. **\"Fungi breaks down dead leaves. What happens to the nutrients from those leaves?\"**\n   - *Success criteria:* Student says nutrients \"go back to soil,\" \"help new plants,\" or \"stay in the ground.\"\n\n**Alternative Summative Assessment - Drawing Prompt:**\n- \"Draw a place where you would find fungi. Label: fungus, dead wood, dark, and damp (or damp).\"\n- Rubric: 2 points for fungi drawn; 2 points for dark/damp environment; 2 points for dead material (wood, leaves, log).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly identify fungi as a living decomposer.\n- Students match fungi to dark, damp habitats.\n- Students recognize decomposition as a natural, helpful process.\n- At least 80% of students can respond to 2 of 3 exit ticket questions correctly.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"fungus,\" \"grows in wet dark places,\" and \"breaks down dead stuff.\" Avoid \"decomposition\" and \"nutrients\" initially; introduce later if capacity allows.\n\n2. **Sentence frames for discussion:**\n   - \"Fungi grows on _____ (wood, leaves).\"\n   - \"Fungi likes _____ (dark and wet) places.\"\n   - \"I see fungi because _____ (it's bumpy, it's pink, it's growing).\"\n\n3. **Paired exploration:** Always pair with a strong partner during Explore phase. Assign the support student a specific role: \"You are the drawer. Draw what we see.\" This gives agency without requiring all language.\n\n4. **Reduced exit ticket:** Provide only 2 questions instead of 3, and allow verbal response or pointing to picture choices.\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research extension:** \"Fungi come in many shapes and sizes. Can you find a picture of a different kind of fungi (mushroom, puffball, shelf fungus) and describe how it looks different from the pink fungi in our photo?\"\n\n2. **Deeper investigation:** \"Fungi breaks down wood. How long do you think it takes? Let's measure our container's dead leaf in weeks. Keep a chart and predict how long until it disappears.\"\n\n3. **Ecosystem thinking:** \"If fungi weren't there, what would happen to all the dead leaves in the forest? Why are fungi important to animals and plants?\" (Leads to discussing food webs and nutrient cycles—scaffold with guiding questions.)\n\n4. **Compare and contrast:** Create a Venn diagram: \"Fungi and Plants: How are they the same? How are they different?\" (Fungi: no chlorophyll, break down dead stuff; Plants: make own food from sun, grow in soil.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Compost Exploration:** If your school has a compost bin, take students to observe it. Look for fungi, mold, and decomposing material. Ask: \"What living things are here helping to break things down? Can you see fungi?\"\n\n2. **Mushroom Walk:** In fall or after rain, take a nature walk to observe mushrooms (fungi fruiting bodies) in the school yard or local park. Keep a distance and don't touch. Take photos and discuss: \"These are fungi! Where are they growing? Why is it dark and wet there?\"\n\n3. **Bread Mold Investigation (with parent/guardian permission):** Create a safe, supervised mold experiment:\n   - Place two bread pieces in sealed plastic bags (mold is fungus).\n   - Keep one in sunlight, one in dark.\n   - After 3-5 days, observe which has more mold.\n   - Discuss: \"Mold (fungi) grew better in the dark, just like the pink fungi in our photo!\"\n   - **Safety note:** Do NOT open bag to smell or touch. Seal, observe, and discard after observation.\n\n4. **Fungi Art:** Create a class \"Fungi Hunt\" poster where students draw or paste pictures of fungi they've seen (or search from a teacher-provided image bank). Label habitats: \"Bathroom mold,\" \"Moldy bread,\" \"Forest log,\" \"Basement,\" etc.\n\n5. **Observe Decomposition Long-Term:** Continue observing the student containers weekly. Create a \"Growth Journal\" with drawings and descriptions. Measure changes (height of fungal growth, leaf breakdown). Display as a class time-lapse chart.\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Notes\n\nThis lesson directly uses **2-LS4-1** by having students:\n- **Make observations** of the fungi in the photograph and in their own containers (diverse organism)\n- **Compare diversity** by identifying that fungi live in different habitats (dark, damp, decaying material) compared to plants (sunny, soil, need light) and some animals\n- **Describe habitat characteristics** as essential to where organisms live\n\nThe lesson also naturally supports **2-LS2-1** (needs of organisms) and **2-LS2-2** (organism function) conceptually, though not the formal PEs, by exploring how fungi need moisture and darkness and how they function to break down dead material.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Preparation Checklist\n\n- [ ] Collect dead leaves, bark, and twigs (or purchase)\n- [ ] Gather small clear containers (one per pair)\n- [ ] Prepare damp potting soil\n- [ ] Print or project the fungal photograph\n- [ ] Create habitat picture cards (4 scenes)\n- [ ] Prepare observation worksheets or have science notebooks ready\n- [ ] Gather hand lenses\n- [ ] Create exit ticket questions\n- [ ] Identify a dark, cool location for student containers\n- [ ] Optional: source mushroom or mold images for Elaborate activity\n- [ ] Plan compost visit or mushroom walk (if extending)\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is hands-on, observation-based, and grounded in the photograph while meeting Grade 2 life science standards. Students leave with a concrete understanding that fungi are living organisms with specific habitat needs and important ecosystem roles.",
