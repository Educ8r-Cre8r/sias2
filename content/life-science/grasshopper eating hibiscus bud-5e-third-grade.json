Identify the body parts of a grasshopper and explain how each part helps it survive in its habitat.\n2. Describe how a grasshopper's green color is an adaptation that helps it survive in a garden environment.\n3. Explain that grasshoppers eat plants and are an important part of the garden ecosystem.\n4. Compare how different grasshoppers might look slightly different and discuss why those differences might help them survive.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Color printout or digital display of the grasshopper-eating-hibiscus-bud photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Teacher device (projector or smartboard)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or projected on the board. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Introduce with curiosity:** \"Today we're looking at a very special photograph of two living things sharing a moment together. What do you notice?\"\n\n3. **Ask specific discussion questions calibrated to Third Grade:**\n   - \"What is the insect in this picture? What is it doing?\" (Students observe the grasshopper and the fact that it's eating the plant bud.)\n   - \"Why do you think the grasshopper is eating the flower bud? What would happen if it didn't eat?\" (Students begin thinking about why animals need food.)\n   - \"Look at the grasshopper's color. It's green. Why might being green be helpful when living on plants and flowers?\" (Students start noticing adaptations.)\n   - \"If you were a grasshopper, what would be a superpower you'd want to have to stay safe?\" (Students think about survival needs — jumping, hiding, moving fast, etc.)\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... does this grasshopper live by itself, or do grasshoppers live together in groups? And if there are many grasshoppers, how do they all find enough food?\" Write student wonderings on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Let's become grasshopper scientists and explore how grasshoppers are built and how they survive in gardens.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Grasshopper model (plastic toy grasshoppers) OR detailed, large photographs of grasshoppers showing body parts clearly — **one per small group**\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per group)\n- Chart paper or large index cards\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Tape\n- Picture cards of different grasshoppers showing color variation (provided by teacher beforehand or printed from images showing green, brown, striped grasshoppers)\n- Plant pictures (leaves, buds, flowers) — laminated if possible\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Exploring Grasshopper Body Parts**\n\n1. **Organize students into small groups** (3-4 students per group).\n\n2. **Distribute materials:** Each group receives one grasshopper model or large detailed photo, a magnifying glass, and a sheet of chart paper divided into sections labeled: \"Head,\" \"Legs,\" \"Antennae,\" \"Color,\" \"Mouth.\"\n\n3. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Use your magnifying glass to look very carefully at your grasshopper model or photo.\"\n   - \"Draw or point to each body part we labeled: head, legs, antennae, color, and mouth.\"\n   - \"For each part, write or draw one thing it can do. For example, legs help jump. Antennae help sense things.\"\n   - \"Think about this: Which body parts help the grasshopper stay alive? Mark those with a star.\"\n\n4. **Facilitate by circulating:** Ask prompting questions: \"What do those long back legs look like? Have you ever jumped really far?\" \"What might those long antennae touch to help the grasshopper?\" Resist answering; guide thinking.\n\n**Part 2: Exploring Color Variation and Survival**\n\n5. **Regroup the class.** Distribute picture cards showing different grasshoppers (green, brown, striped).\n\n6. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Look at these three grasshoppers. Are they exactly the same? What differences do you see?\"\n   - \"Now, imagine placing each grasshopper on different plants: a bright green leaf, brown bark, and a striped flower.\"\n   - \"Which grasshopper do you think would be hardest for a bird to find on each plant? Why?\"\n   - \"Record your thinking by drawing or writing on your paper.\"\n\n7. **Teacher role:** Listen to student reasoning. Do not correct; instead ask: \"What makes you think that?\" and \"Can you show me what you mean?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify and label main grasshopper body parts.\n- Students recognize that body parts have functions related to survival (jumping, eating, sensing).\n- Students observe that grasshoppers come in different colors and discuss how color might help them hide.\n- Students begin making connections between the photograph and their models/pictures.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original grasshopper-eating-hibiscus photograph (re-displayed)\n- Poster-sized diagram of a grasshopper with labels (prepared before lesson)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms pre-written\n- Student science journals or paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Ask 2-3 groups to share their findings: \"What body parts did you find? What does that body part help the grasshopper do?\" Record key discoveries on the board.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** using the diagram and the photograph:\n\n   **Vocabulary with student-friendly definitions:**\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. (Example: \"The grasshopper's strong back legs are an adaptation that helps it jump away from danger.\")\n   - **Herbivore:** An animal that eats only plants. (Example: \"Grasshoppers are herbivores — you can see in this photo that the grasshopper eats the hibiscus bud, which is a plant.\")\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. (Example: \"A garden is a grasshopper's habitat because there are plants to eat and places to hide.\")\n   - **Camouflage:** The color or pattern of an animal's body that helps it blend in with its surroundings. (Example: \"The grasshopper's green color is camouflage — it helps it hide among green plants.\")\n   - **Variation:** Small differences between individual animals of the same species. (Example: \"Some grasshoppers are bright green, some are dark green, and some are brown — these are variations.\")\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:** \"In this photo, we see a grasshopper with green color — that's camouflage! It's eating a red hibiscus bud — that means grasshoppers are herbivores. The grasshopper's strong legs are an adaptation for jumping. This garden is its habitat.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:** \n   - Ask: \"If a grasshopper has strong back legs, what problem does that solve for the grasshopper?\" (Students should respond with ideas about escaping danger, jumping to new plants, etc.)\n   - \"Why is being green helpful for a grasshopper living in a garden?\" (Blending in; hiding from predators.)\n   - Thumbs up, thumbs sideways, or thumbs down: \"Do you feel like you understand what adaptations are?\" Observe responses.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define adaptation, herbivore, habitat, camouflage, and variation using examples.\n- Students connect vocabulary to the photograph and their Explore observations.\n- Students see that structures (legs, color) and behaviors (eating plants) are ways grasshoppers survive.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos of various habitats: garden, desert, forest, grassland, pond edge\n- Picture cards of various animals: grasshopper, butterfly, ant, snail, bird, beetle\n- Chart paper labeled \"Who Can Survive Here?\"\n- Colored pencils\n- Optional: Outdoor observation supplies (clipboards, hand lenses) if taking students outside\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Matching Game (In-Class)**\n\n1. **Set up stations or a large display** showing 4-5 different habitats (garden, dry grassland, dark forest, wet field edge).\n\n2. **Display animal picture cards**, including several types of grasshoppers and other animals.\n\n3. **Small group task:** \"Here are different habitats. Choose three habitats where you think a grasshopper could survive. Now, choose animals that also live in those habitats. Make an argument: Why can these animals survive together in that habitat? What do they need?\"\n\n4. **Students create a claim:** \"Grasshoppers can survive in a garden because...\"\n   - There are plants to eat.\n   - There are places to hide.\n   - The temperature is right.\n\n5. **Students work collaboratively** to draw or write their answer on chart paper.\n\n**Option B: Outdoor Observation (If possible)**\n\n1. **Take students to a garden, yard, or green area** with observation clipboards.\n\n2. **Task:** \"Be a grasshopper scientist. Find a plant with leaves. Look very carefully. Do you see any insects eating the plant or living on it? What color are they? Do they blend in with the plant? What adaptations help them survive here?\"\n\n3. **Students draw and label what they observe.**\n\n4. **Back in class:** Share observations and discuss how what they saw matches what they learned.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Facilitate group discussions without giving answers.\n- Ask: \"How do you know grasshoppers could survive there?\"\n- Encourage evidence-based thinking: \"What would they eat? Where would they hide?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply understanding of adaptations and habitats to new scenarios.\n- Students make claims supported by reasoning.\n- Students recognize that grasshoppers have specific needs that certain habitats meet.\n- Students see that variation (different grasshopper colors) helps different individuals survive in different environments.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of all learning objectives.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Do students identify body parts and discuss their functions?\n- Listening during group discussions: Do students use vocabulary appropriately?\n- Check for Understanding questions: Can students explain adaptations?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with this assessment (choose format based on class ability: verbal, written, or drawn):\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Look at this picture of a grasshopper.** (Show the original photograph again.) **What is one body part this grasshopper has? How does that body part help it survive?**\n   - *(Success Criteria: Student identifies a body part [legs, antennae, mouth, etc.] and explains its survival function.)*\n\n2. **Grasshoppers are herbivores. What does that mean? What do they eat?**\n   - *(Success Criteria: Student explains that herbivores eat plants, or gives a correct example like \"grass\" or \"flower buds.\")*\n\n3. **This grasshopper is green. Why is being green helpful for a grasshopper living in a garden?**\n   - *(Success Criteria: Student explains camouflage or blending in, hiding from predators, or being hard to see on plants.)*\n\n4. **If you found two grasshoppers in a garden, they might look a little different. One might be darker green, and one might be lighter green. Why might these differences be important for grasshoppers?**\n   - *(Success Criteria: Student explains that different colors help them hide in different plants or that variation helps them survive in different places.)*\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n- Students identify at least 2 grasshopper body parts and explain their function. (Objective 1)\n- Students explain that green color helps a grasshopper hide or blend in with plants. (Objective 2)\n- Students explain that grasshoppers eat plants or describe grasshoppers as part of the garden ecosystem. (Objective 3)\n- Students recognize that grasshoppers come in different colors and discuss why that variation matters for survival. (Objective 4)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 75%+ of students correctly answer 3 out of 4 exit ticket questions, demonstrating understanding of adaptations, herbivory, habitat, and variation.\n- Students can verbally explain at least one way a grasshopper's body helps it survive.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Sentence Starters:** Provide sentence frames for exit tickets and discussions:\n   - \"The grasshopper's _____ helps it _____ because _____.\"\n   - \"Grasshoppers eat _____, so they are _____.\"\n   - \"Being green helps grasshoppers hide because _____.\"\n\n2. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use simpler terms when introducing concepts. Instead of \"adaptation,\" say \"special body part that helps it stay alive.\" Check understanding frequently with thumbs up/down signals.\n\n3. **Partner Support:** Pair struggling students with stronger readers/writers during Explore and Elaborate activities. Provide a pre-made body-parts chart with pictures they can point to and label rather than generating from scratch.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Comparative Adaptations:** Ask: \"Grasshoppers and crickets are related insects. What adaptations do you think they share? What might be different? Why?\" Have them research or compare pictures.\n\n2. **Food Web Complexity:** \"Grasshoppers eat plants. But what eats grasshoppers? Create a food chain or web that includes the grasshopper, the hibiscus plant, and at least two other animals.\"\n\n3. **Design Challenge:** \"If a grasshopper's habitat changed and it got much colder, or much hotter, or much drier, how might grasshoppers need to change or adapt? Design a 'new' grasshopper with adaptations for an extreme environment.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grasshopper Life Cycle Investigation:**\n   - Students research or observe the life cycle of grasshoppers (egg, nymph, adult).\n   - They create a labeled diagram or poster showing birth → growth → reproduction → death, connecting to **3-LS1-1** (life cycles).\n   - This can be a homework project or a follow-up 20-minute lesson.\n\n2. **Garden Survey Project:**\n   - If access to a garden is available, students conduct a 10-minute \"organism count\": How many insects do they find? What plants are being eaten? Are there predators?\n   - They draw conclusions about how many grasshoppers and other herbivores \"survive well\" or \"survive less well\" in that particular habitat, supporting **3-LS4-3**.\n   - Create a class bar graph or tally chart showing what they found.\n\n3. **Grasshopper Adaptations in Other Environments:**\n   - Show pictures of grasshoppers from different habitats: desert grasshoppers (tan/brown), forest grasshoppers (mottled), bright meadow grasshoppers.\n   - Students discuss: \"Why might these grasshoppers look different? How do their colors match their homes?\"\n   - They can color or cut-and-paste a grasshopper to match a habitat they choose, explaining their color choice.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Prior Preparation:** Gather or print comparison images of grasshoppers in different colors before the lesson. Laminate if possible for durability.\n- **Live Observation:** If you have access to a live grasshopper in a tank or can observe one outdoors, this dramatically increases student engagement. However, the lesson works fully with models and photographs.\n- **Pacing:** This lesson can comfortably fit into two 45-minute sessions: Session 1 (Engage + Explore), Session 2 (Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate). Alternatively, all five phases can occur in one 90-minute block.\n- **Safety:** If taking students outdoors, ensure supervision and remind students to observe insects gently without harming them.\n- **Standards Alignment:** This lesson primarily addresses **3-LS4-2** (adaptations as advantages for survival) and **3-LS4-3** (organism survival in particular habitats). It touches on **3-LS2-1** through discussions of ecosystems and interdependence.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson transforms a striking photograph into a complete, scaffolded learning experience that keeps Third Graders engaged while building deep understanding of how organisms survive in their environments.",
