Support an argument with evidence that plants obtain the materials they need for growth primarily from air and water, not just from soil.\n2. Design and conduct an investigation to identify what a growing plant needs to survive and grow.\n3. Develop a model showing how water and other materials move from the environment into a plant and how plants fit into larger cycles of matter.\n4. Explain the role of germinating seeds and growing plants in nutrient cycles within an ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about plant growth and activate prior knowledge about what plants need.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital display of the germination photograph (large enough for whole class to see clearly)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: actual sprouting seeds in containers (bean sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, or seedlings in early stages)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the germination image prominently. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Launch Discussion with Guided Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about this seed? Describe what's happening to it.\"\n   - \"Where do you think this seed got the energy to start growing and pushing out that green stem?\"\n   - \"What do you think this tiny plant needs to keep growing bigger and stronger?\"\n   - \"Do you think plants get their food from the soil, or could they get it from somewhere else?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \n   - Ask students to turn and talk to a partner: \"If we could follow this sprouting seed for the next month, what materials do you think it would need from its environment to become a bigger plant? Make a prediction and explain your thinking.\"\n\n4. **Class Brainstorm:** \n   - Chart student ideas on a \"What Plants Need\" anchor chart. Accept all ideas without judgment at this stage (soil, water, sunlight, air, nutrients, food, etc.).\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate exactly where plants get the materials they need to grow—and you might be surprised to discover that soil isn't the whole story!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students conduct hands-on investigations to discover what germinating seeds and growing plants actually require.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 4 clear plastic containers (small yogurt cups or clear cups)\n- Potting soil\n- Bean seeds or pea seeds (pre-soaked overnight for faster germination)\n- Water (in spray bottles or cups)\n- Plastic wrap or plastic bags\n- Labels and markers\n- Optional: paper towels for alternative germination method\n- Recording sheets (provided below)\n- Optional: grow lights or sunny windowsill access\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station 1: The \"Four Conditions\" Investigation (Whole class or small groups)**\n\nStudents set up four experimental containers with different conditions:\n\n1. **Container A (Control):** Moist soil + water + sunlight (normal conditions)\n2. **Container B:** Moist soil + water + NO light (cover with opaque bag)\n3. **Container C:** Dry soil + NO water + sunlight\n4. **Container D:** Moist soil + NO water added after initial planting\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud and display):**\n- \"Label each container A, B, C, and D.\"\n- \"Plant 3 seeds in each container exactly 1 inch deep.\"\n- \"For Container A: Add water to keep soil moist. Place in sunlight or under a grow light.\"\n- \"For Container B: Add water to keep soil moist. Cover tightly with a dark bag so NO light reaches the seeds.\"\n- \"For Container C: Do NOT add water after planting. Place in sunlight.\"\n- \"For Container D: Add water once at planting time. Do NOT add more water for 2 weeks.\"\n- \"Make a prediction in your notebook: Which seeds do you think will sprout best? Why?\"\n- \"Each day for 10 days, observe each container and record: Has the seed sprouted? How tall is it (in cm)? What does it look like?\"\n\n**Recording Sheet Format:**\n\n| Day | Container A (Normal) | Container B (No Light) | Container C (No Water) | Container D (Water Once) |\n|-----|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1   | Prediction:          | Prediction:            | Prediction:            | Prediction:              |\n| 3   | _____ cm, ______     | _____ cm, ______       | _____ cm, ______       | _____ cm, ______         |\n| 5   | _____ cm, ______     | _____ cm, ______       | _____ cm, ______       | _____ cm, ______         |\n| 10  | _____ cm, ______     | _____ cm, ______       | _____ cm, ______       | _____ cm, ______         |\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask questions without providing answers: \"What differences do you see between Container A and Container B? Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Help students take accurate measurements using rulers.\n- Ensure all containers are set up identically except for the variables being tested.\n- Remind students to water only Container A and D at designated times.\n- Prompt students to look closely at leaf color, stem thickness, and overall appearance—not just height.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that seeds in Container A (with water and light) germinate and grow robustly.\n- Seeds in Container B (no light) may germinate but will be pale/yellow and leggy (stretched).\n- Seeds in Container C (no water) will not germinate.\n- Seeds in Container D (watered once) may show initial sprouting but will slow or stop growing.\n- Students recognize water as essential for germination and growth.\n- Students notice that light affects the color and appearance of plants.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to the concept that plants get materials from air and water.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart from Engage phase\n- Diagram of water cycle (optional visual aid)\n- Chart showing plant parts and their functions\n- Access to the photograph again\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out and Data Analysis (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask groups to share their observations from Containers A and B: \"What happened to the seedlings without light?\"\n   - Ask groups to share from Container C: \"What happened when there was no water?\"\n   - Guide students to notice: \"What do all the growing plants have in common?\" (water)\n   - \"What did the plants without light look like?\" (pale, yellow-ish, stretched)\n\n2. **Mini-Lesson: Where Plants Get Their Materials (8 minutes)**\n\n   Display a simple plant diagram showing roots, stem, and leaves. Explain using student-friendly language:\n\n   **Key Concept 1: Water**\n   - \"The germinating seed in our photograph couldn't grow without water. Water enters through the roots and travels up the stem to the leaves. Water is one of the two main things plants need to grow. Plants get water from the soil.\"\n\n   **Key Concept 2: Air and Light**\n   - \"Plants also need something from the air called carbon dioxide. Leaves absorb carbon dioxide from the air around them. Light from the sun gives the plant energy to use that carbon dioxide to make food—a process called photosynthesis. That's why the plants in Container B (no light) looked pale and unhealthy.\"\n\n   **Key Concept 3: Soil's Role (Not What We Might Think)**\n   - \"You might think plants get their food from soil. But here's the surprise: soil mainly provides **water** and **nutrients** (minerals like nitrogen), not the main food that plants make. Plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and air!\"\n\n   **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Point to the sprouting seed: \"This seed is just beginning. Its roots (underground) are already starting to absorb water from the soil. Its tiny green leaves are beginning to catch light. Soon, this little plant will make its own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide from the air.\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary Introduction (3 minutes):**\n\n**Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n- **Germination:** The process when a seed starts to grow and sprout. (Point to the photograph.) \"This is germination happening!\"\n- **Photosynthesis:** The process where plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide from the air to make food (sugar) for energy. \"It's like the plant's kitchen!\"\n- **Nutrients:** Minerals and elements in soil (like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) that plants absorb through roots to help them grow strong. \"Think of nutrients like vitamins for plants.\"\n- **Carbon Dioxide:** A gas in the air that plants absorb through their leaves. Humans breathe out carbon dioxide, and plants take it in!\n- **Chlorophyll:** The green substance in plant leaves that captures light energy from the sun. \"It's what makes plants green!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"If a plant gets light and air but no water, what will happen?\" (It will not grow or will die.)\n   - Ask: \"Where does a plant actually make its food?\" (In its leaves, using sunlight, water, and air.)\n   - Ask: \"Is soil the main source of a plant's food?\" (No, it provides water and minerals, but the plant makes most of its food from sunlight and air.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that water and air (carbon dioxide) are the primary materials plants need for growth.\n- Students can explain the role of light in helping plants make food.\n- Students recognize that soil provides water and nutrients, not the plant's main food source.\n- Students understand the connection between the visible parts of the seed (roots, shoots, green color) and what the plant needs from its environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by developing a model showing how matter moves from the environment into plants and through ecosystems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper (11x14\" or poster board)\n- Colored markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Scissors and glue\n- Pre-cut images or student drawings of: sun, cloud, plant, animal, decomposer (optional image bank)\n- Arrows (string, yarn, or drawn)\n- Student model template (provided) or blank paper for design\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Task: Create a \"Matter Movement Model\"**\n\nStudents work in pairs or small groups to design a visual model that shows:\n- How water moves from soil into a plant through roots\n- How carbon dioxide enters a plant through leaves\n- How sunlight provides energy for the plant\n- How the plant then becomes food for an animal\n- How the matter eventually returns to the soil and air when something dies and decomposes\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Draw or cut out and glue a plant (like the sprouting seed we've been studying) in the center of your paper.\"\n2. \"Add arrows showing where water comes from (soil/rain) and how it enters the plant (through roots).\"\n3. \"Add arrows showing where carbon dioxide comes from (air) and how it enters the plant (through leaves).\"\n4. \"Add the sun above and arrows showing how light gives the plant energy.\"\n5. \"Add an animal (like a rabbit or person) and show how the plant becomes food for the animal.\"\n6. \"If you have room, show what happens when the animal dies or when leaves fall—where does that matter go? (Add arrows to decomposers and soil.)\"\n7. \"Label each arrow or part with words explaining what's moving and where it's going.\"\n\n**Presentation (5-7 minutes):**\n- Have 2-3 groups share their models.\n- Ask: \"How does your model show that materials come from the environment?\" \n- Ask: \"Can you trace the path of water through your model?\"\n- Ask: \"Where does the energy in the plant come from originally?\" (The sun.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide the template or blank paper and image bank to support students who need scaffolding.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Where does the water enter the plant? Where does the sun's energy go? What happens to matter when things decompose?\"\n- Encourage students to use arrows, labels, and colors to make relationships clear.\n- Highlight models that clearly show the cycle of matter moving through the ecosystem.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation showing water, air (carbon dioxide), and light entering a plant.\n- Students show the plant transferring energy/matter to an animal that eats it.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that matter cycles through living things and the environment.\n- Students can explain their model to a partner or the class, using vocabulary from the Explain phase.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of where plants get materials for growth and how matter cycles through ecosystems.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation During Explore:** Circulate and listen to student explanations. Do they recognize that water is essential? Can they compare Container A with other containers?\n- **Check-for-Understanding Questions During Explain:** Use responses to quick questions to gauge comprehension before moving to Elaborate.\n- **Model Presentations:** Listen to explanations of their models. Can they trace matter/energy through the diagram?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes)**\n\nStudents complete the following in their notebooks or on a provided card:\n\n---\n\n**EXIT TICKET: What Plants Really Need**\n\n**Question 1 (Evidence):** Look back at your data from the four containers. Which container had the healthiest, tallest plant? Why do you think it grew best?\n\n**Question 2 (Explanation):** Where do plants get the materials they need to grow? Name at least three things and explain where each comes from.\n\n**Question 3 (Application):** A plant owner forgets to water her houseplant for three weeks, but it sits in bright sunlight. Will the plant survive? Explain why or why not.\n\n**Question 4 (Reasoning):** The germinating seed in our photograph will eventually become a big plant. Draw or describe what materials this plant will be taking in from its environment in one month.\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student identifies water as essential and mentions at least two of the following: light/energy from the sun, carbon dioxide from air, nutrients from soil. Explains at least two of these in a sentence. Correctly predicts the plant will not survive without water (even with light). Shows understanding that matter comes from environment into plant.\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student identifies water and light as important but may confuse soil as the main source of plant food. Provides partial explanations. Makes a reasonable prediction about the plant but with incomplete reasoning.\n\n✓ **Beginning:** Student identifies water but may not articulate other needs clearly. Shows limited connection between environment and plant growth.\n\n---\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- **100% of students** should be able to identify water and light as essential for plant growth.\n- **85%+ of students** should recognize that plants get carbon dioxide from air and water from soil, not that soil is the main food source.\n- **75%+ of students** should create a model showing matter cycling from environment through plants and potentially to animals/decomposers.\n- All students should provide evidence from their Explore investigation to support statements about plant needs.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for students who struggle with abstract thinking or reading):**\n\n1. **Simplified Recording Sheet:** Provide a fill-in-the-blank observation chart instead of open-ended journaling. Example: \"Container A: The seed _____ (sprouted/did not sprout). It is _____ cm tall. It looks _____.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Word Bank and Visuals:** Provide index cards with vocabulary terms (germination, water, sunlight, carbon dioxide) paired with simple illustrations. Allow students to reference these during discussions and activities.\n\n3. **Guided Model Creation:** Provide a partially completed template for the elaborate phase with the plant already drawn and some labels filled in. Students only need to add arrows, remaining labels, and complete the cycle. Pair with a peer or teacher for explanation.\n\n4. **Concrete Demonstration:** Before students begin investigations, show a real sprouting seed and let students feel the moist soil, observe the roots, and hold the seed. Connect tactile experience to learning.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Investigation Variable:** Have students design their own experimental variables. \"What if we tested: seeds in soil vs. seeds on wet paper towels? Seeds with regular water vs. seeds with salt water? Seedlings in artificial light vs. natural light?\" Students predict, observe, and compare results beyond the standard four containers.\n\n2. **Deep Dive into Photosynthesis:** Provide simplified diagrams of the photosynthesis equation (sunlight + water + CO₂ → glucose + oxygen). Have students research what glucose is and why plants need it. Create a poster explaining photosynthesis to younger students.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Model Expansion:** Challenge students to create a more complex model showing multiple plants, multiple animals, decomposers, and multiple cycles (water cycle, carbon cycle, nutrient cycle). Include written explanations of each cycle.\n\n4. **Research Connection:** Have students research how farmers or gardeners know whether a plant needs water, more light, or more nutrients. Compare methods (soil testing kits, plant appearance observation). Share findings with the class.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grow a \"Window Plant\" Over 4-6 Weeks:** \n   - Students plant a bean seed in a clear plastic cup and place it on a sunny windowsill. They water it regularly and measure height, count leaves, and document changes weekly. After 4-6 weeks, they have a full plant to compare with the germinating seed from the photograph. Students graph growth and present findings on: \"Where Did My Plant Get the Materials to Grow This Big?\"\n\n2. **Design a \"Plant Hospital\" Poster or Presentation:**\n   - Students receive descriptions of unhealthy plants (\"My plant leaves are turning yellow,\" \"My plant is very tall and spindly,\" \"My plant's leaves are wilting\"). They diagnose the problem (too little light, too much water, too little water, poor nutrients) and recommend solutions based on what plants need. Students create a diagnostic poster or give advice to the class.\n\n3. **Conduct a Classroom Decomposition Experiment:**\n   - Place dead leaves, fruit scraps, and shredded paper in a clear plastic container with soil. Observe over 4-8 weeks as decomposers (bacteria, fungi, worms if available) break down the matter. Document changes and discuss how this matter returns to soil, providing nutrients for new plants. Connect to 5-LS2-1 (matter cycles through the ecosystem).\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
