(connection to habitat requirements)\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Identify** the body parts of insects (wings, legs, head, body) visible in the photograph.\n2. **Describe** how insects use plants as a habitat and why they live near or on plants.\n3. **Compare** the features of different insects and explain how their body parts help them survive.\n4. **Observe** and record details about insects in nature using drawings and words.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about insects and their habitats through observation of the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph projected or printed (one per pair/small group)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks or paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a large printed image. Show it for 30 seconds without talking—let students just look.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (pause after each for responses):\n   - *\"What do you see in this picture? What animal is it?\"* (Allow students to identify the dragonfly.)\n   - *\"Where is the dragonfly? What is around it?\"* (Guide them to notice the green leaves and plant stems.)\n   - *\"What parts of the dragonfly can you see? Point to them.\"* (Discuss wings, legs, body, eyes.)\n   - *\"Why do you think the dragonfly is sitting on these plants? What does it need?\"* (Accept all ideas—this is prior knowledge activation.)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Say, *\"I wonder... what would happen to this dragonfly if there were no plants around? Where would it go? What would it eat or do?\"* Write student wonderings on chart paper.\n\n4. **Transition:** *\"Let's explore what insects need to live and what their bodies are made of so we can understand why dragonflies and other bugs love plants.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students hands-on investigate insect body parts and observe how insects interact with plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **One of the following (choose based on availability):**\n  - Live insects in observation containers (crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, or other safe classroom insects—NOT the dragonfly itself)\n  - High-quality insect photographs (printed or digital—multiple species)\n  - Plastic toy insects (realistic models)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (one per pair)\n- \"Insect Detective\" recording sheets (simple labeled diagrams with blanks):\n  - Head, wings, legs, body, eyes\n  - \"I see this insect near: ___\"\n  - \"This insect's body parts help it: ___\"\n- Colored pencils\n- Chart paper labeled \"What We Observe\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Insect Body Parts Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs.** Provide each pair with an insect to observe (live, photograph, or model).\n\n2. **Give clear directions:** *\"You are insect detectives. Your job is to look very carefully at your insect using the hand lens. Find and count its legs. Look for wings. Find its head and eyes. Draw what you see on your Insect Detective sheet and label the parts.\"*\n\n3. **Model this first:** Show an example using the photograph or a sample insect. Point out legs, wings, head.\n\n4. **Circulate while students work.** Ask guiding questions (not answers):\n   - *\"How many legs do you count?\"*\n   - *\"Does your insect have wings? What do you think wings help it do?\"*\n   - *\"Where is the head?\"*\n\n5. **Students record** by drawing and labeling their insect on the recording sheet.\n\n**Part 2: Insect Habitat Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Refocus the group.** Show the photograph again. Ask, *\"In this picture, the dragonfly is surrounded by plants. Let's think about other insects and where they live.\"*\n\n2. **Display a second chart labeled \"Where Insects Live.\"** Show pictures or discuss:\n   - Ants in soil\n   - Bees on flowers\n   - Butterflies near plants\n   - Beetles under bark\n\n3. **Provide scenarios:** *\"Here's a bee. Draw or write: What plant places would a bee visit? Why?\"*\n\n4. **Students draw and write/dictate** one place they think an insect from their investigation would be found and why. (Teacher or aid transcribes if needed for struggling writers.)\n\n5. **Collect these to review during Explain phase.**\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without answering directly—use \"I notice...\" and \"Tell me more about...\"\n- Prompt careful observation: *\"Look more closely. What else do you see?\"*\n- Encourage peer discussion: *\"What did your partner find?\"*\n- Keep energy positive and exploratory.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify at least 3 body parts of an insect (legs, wings, head).\n- Students record observations in drawings with labels.\n- Students make a connection between insects and plants/habitats in their words or pictures.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and tie observations back to the photograph and concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- Images of diverse insects in different habitats (printed or projected)\n- \"Insect Parts\" poster or diagram\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** \n   - Ask pairs to share one thing they observed about their insect's body parts.\n   - Record on chart: \"Insect Body Parts We Found\" (legs, wings, head, eyes, body, antennae).\n   - Ask, *\"Which body parts do all insects have? What are they for?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with Second Grade-friendly language (8 minutes):**\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Insect** | An animal with six legs, a body in three parts (head, middle, back), and often wings. |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives that has everything it needs, like plants, water, and shelter. |\n   | **Wings** | Body parts that help insects fly through the air. |\n   | **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal live in its habitat. |\n   | **Legs** | Body parts that help insects walk, jump, or stay on plants. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the dragonfly photo again.\n   - *\"This is a dragonfly. It's an insect. Can you see its wings? Its legs? Its body?\"* (Point to each.)\n   - *\"The dragonfly lives near plants and water. That's its habitat. It has wings so it can fly over the water and plants. It has legs so it can hold onto the plants. These are perfect for where the dragonfly lives.\"*\n   - Show 2-3 other insect images. *\"This is a butterfly. Where do you think it lives? What does it use its body parts for?\"* (Flowers/plants; wings to fly to flowers, legs to hold on.)\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask students to show body parts on themselves (stretch arms like wings, count fingers like legs).\n   - *\"If you were an insect, which body part would help you live on plants?\"* (Legs to grip, wings to fly to them.)\n   - Quick thumbs up/sideways/down: *\"Thumbs up if you can name one insect body part. Thumbs sideways if you're still learning. Thumbs down if you need more help.\"*\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart:**\nCreate and post a visual chart with the five terms, simple drawings, and definitions at student eye level. Leave it up throughout the unit.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name 3-4 insect body parts.\n- Students understand that habitats are specific places where animals live.\n- Students can explain one reason why an insect's body parts help it in its habitat (e.g., wings help dragonflies fly to plants).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students deepen understanding by comparing different insects and predicting how they use their habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of 4-5 different insects (printed color pictures or projected):\n  - Ant (no wings, lives in soil)\n  - Bee (has wings, visits flowers)\n  - Grasshopper (long legs, jumps on plants)\n  - Ladybug (has wings, lives on plants, eats pests)\n  - Caterpillar (no wings, crawls on leaves)\n- \"Insect Habitat Detective\" worksheet with columns:\n  - Insect name | Body parts I see | Where I think it lives | Why\n- Colored pencils\n- Chart paper: \"Insects Are Different!\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the investigation:** *\"We know insects have different body parts. Today, we're detectives again. We'll look at different insects and figure out where they live and why their body parts are perfect for that place.\"*\n\n2. **Model the first insect together (5 minutes):**\n   - Show an ant image. *\"This is an ant. What body parts can you see? It has small wings or no wings. Short legs. It's small.\"*\n   - *\"Where do you think ants live?\"* (Underground, in soil, on the ground.)\n   - *\"Why? Why are short legs and a small body good for living in the soil?\"* (Can dig, fit in tunnels, easy to carry food.)\n   - Fill in the chart together as a model.\n\n3. **Guided practice (10 minutes):**\n   - Show a bee image.\n   - Ask students to identify body parts: *\"Point to the wings. Count the legs if you can.\"*\n   - *\"Where does a bee live? What does a bee need?\"* (Flowers, plants, they visit flowers.)\n   - *\"Why are wings good for a bee?\"* (Helps it fly from flower to flower.)\n   - Students complete the \"Insect Habitat Detective\" sheet for the bee (with adult support as needed).\n\n4. **Independent or partner practice (5 minutes):**\n   - Provide one or two more insect images.\n   - Students complete their own rows on the detective sheet.\n   - Circulate and provide sentence stems if needed: *\"This insect has ___. It lives in/on ___. Wings/legs help it ___ .\"*\n\n5. **Share and add to anchor chart:**\n   - Ask volunteers to share one insect. Add to the posted \"Insects Are Different!\" chart with drawings and descriptions.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Model thinking aloud: *\"I notice the bee has big wings. I think that's because it needs to fly far to find flowers. That makes sense because...\"*\n- Ask students to explain their thinking: *\"Why do you think that?\"*\n- Validate all reasonable responses tied to observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students compare at least 2 insects and identify differences in body parts.\n- Students explain how an insect's body parts match its habitat (e.g., \"Grasshoppers have strong legs to jump on plants\").\n- Students show developing understanding of adaptation concepts.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of insect body parts, habitats, and adaptation concepts.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore and Elaborate phases:\n  - ☐ Student identifies at least 3 insect body parts\n  - ☐ Student makes a connection between body parts and habitat/function\n  - ☐ Student describes where insects live\n  - ☐ Student participates in discussions and shares observations\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of lesson):**\n\n**Option 1: Drawing with Labels**\n- Provide a blank insect outline.\n- *\"Draw and label three body parts of an insect. Then draw where you think this insect lives.\"*\n- **Success criteria:** Student labels at least 3 parts correctly (head, legs, wings, body, eyes) and draws a reasonable habitat.\n\n**Option 2: Sentence Completion**\n- Read aloud and have students draw a picture or write/dictate responses:\n  1. *\"An insect has _____ body parts that help it.\"* (legs, wings)\n  2. *\"This insect lives in/on _____ because _____.\"* (accepts plant-based or environment-based answers with reasoning)\n  3. *\"The [insect name]'s [body part] helps it _____.\"* (Example: \"The bee's wings help it fly.\")\n\n- **Success criteria:** Student identifies at least one body part and one reason it helps the insect in its habitat.\n\n**Option 3: Photograph Comparison**\n- Show the original dragonfly photograph and one other insect photo.\n- Ask: *\"How are these insects the same? How are they different? Where does each one live?\"*\n- Student draws or dictates similarities, differences, and habitats.\n- **Success criteria:** Student identifies at least one similarity and one difference, and names or describes a habitat.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that insects have specific body parts (legs, wings, head, body).\n- Students connect insect body parts to their habitats and survival (wings for flying, legs for gripping/walking).\n- Students recognize that different insects live in different places.\n- **Mastery level:** Student explains two ways an insect's body helps it live in its habitat.\n- **Developing level:** Student names insect body parts and identifies a habitat.\n- **Emerging level:** Student identifies one body part or names one habitat with teacher prompting.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visuals:**\n   - Use the \"Insect Parts\" poster during all activities.\n   - Provide pre-labeled insect diagrams; students color and trace rather than label.\n   - Use high-contrast, large insect images.\n\n2. **Sentence stems and frames:**\n   - Provide sentence starters: *\"The insect has ___. It uses its ___ to ___.\"*\n   - Offer word banks with 4-5 body part and habitat words.\n   - Allow drawing instead of writing; adult transcribes responses.\n\n3. **Reduce task complexity:**\n   - Focus on one insect type at a time rather than comparing many.\n   - Use live insects or 3D models rather than photographs (more concrete).\n   - Pair with a stronger reader/observer during investigations.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Deeper comparative analysis:**\n   - Provide 5-6 insect images and ask students to sort them by body parts (insects with wings vs. without, insects with long legs vs. short).\n   - *\"How do insects in this group look alike? How are they different?\"*\n   - Challenge: *\"Which insect would be best at living on a tall plant? Why?\"*\n\n2. **Research and extension thinking:**\n   - *\"Choose one insect. Find out or guess: What does it eat? How does its body help it find food?\"*\n   - Create an \"insect ID guide\" with drawings and descriptions.\n   - Introduce simple food chains: *\"Insects eat plants. What eats insects?\"* (Start discussing predators.)\n\n3. **Real-world application:**\n   - *\"If humans wanted to fly like a dragonfly, what would we need? Why?\"*\n   - Discuss how scientists study insects to create new inventions (biomimicry).\n   - Design a new insect: *\"Create an insect for a habitat we name. Draw its body parts and explain why it would survive there.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Insect Hunt Nature Walk (20-30 minutes)**\n   - Take students outdoors to a garden, grassy area, or park (with proper supervision and safety protocols).\n   - Students observe insects in their natural habitats without capturing them.\n   - Record findings: *\"Where did we find insects? What were they doing? What plants were near them?\"*\n   - Return to class and create a chart: \"Insects We Saw and Where.\"\n   - **Connection:** Reinforces that insects really do live among plants.\n\n2. **Insect Life Cycle Introduction (follow-up lesson)**\n   - Show photographs or videos of caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly.\n   - *\"Insects change! Let's see how.\"*\n   - Connect to habitats: *\"Why does a caterpillar need to live on leaves? What does it eat?\"*\n   - **Prepares for:** Deeper life cycle understanding in later grades.\n\n3. **Make an Insect Habitat Terrarium (take-home or classroom project)**\n   - Provide a clear container, soil, plants (small safe varieties), and insects (e.g., pill bugs, safe beetles).\n   - Students observe insects in a semi-natural habitat for 1-2 weeks.\n   - Daily observation journal: *\"What is the insect doing? Where is it in the container? What is it eating?\"*\n   - Release insects safely afterward with discussion of responsibility.\n   - **Connection:** Deepens understanding of what insects actually need.\n\n4. **Insect Body Part Match-Up Game (15 minutes, indoor/recess)**\n   - Create cards with insect images and matching body part cards (wings, legs, head, antennae).\n   - Students play memory or matching games.\n   - *\"Find the insect that has six legs. Find the wings. Which insect would you pair them with?\"*\n   - **Reinforces:** Vocabulary and body part identification.\n\n5. **Reading and Writing Integration**\n   - Read-aloud picture book: *\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\"* or *\"Dear Ladybug\"* series.\n   - Class writes: *\"If I were an insect, I would be a ___ because ___.\"*\n   - Students illustrate their own insect story.\n   - **Connection:** Reinforces learning across literacy and science.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Classroom safety:** If using live insects, ensure all are classroom-safe (no wasps, bees, or venomous species). Crickets, grasshoppers, mealworms, and ladybugs are ideal.\n- **Sensitivity consideration:** Some students have insect phobias. Offer the option to observe via photographs or drawings instead of live insects.\n- **Accessibility:** Ensure high-contrast visuals and large text for students with vision needs. Provide audio descriptions of the photograph for students with visual impairments.\n- **Timing flexibility:** The two-session structure allows for one session per day, or both in one block. Adjust based on your class's focus and stamina.\n- **Documentation:** Keep student Insect Detective sheets and exit tickets as evidence of learning for assessment and parent communication.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson builds directly from the dragonfly photograph, moving students from observation to vocabulary to application. The 5E flow ensures deep engagement with life science concepts while keeping activities concrete and age-appropriate. Happy investigating!",
