Identify and describe the stages of a tree's life cycle (birth, growth, reproduction, and death) using evidence from the photograph.\n2. Explain how a dead or dying tree provides a habitat where certain organisms can survive well.\n3. Describe how decomposer organisms (like fungi and insects) are adapted to survive in the environment of a decaying tree.\n4. Construct an argument using evidence about which animals or organisms could live in or on the old tree and why those organisms thrive there.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about trees, life cycles, and animal habitats using the photograph of the hollow tree.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the hollow tree (or printed copies)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small branches or pieces of bark for students to handle\n\n**Activity:**\n\nDisplay the photograph on the board or screen where all students can see it clearly.\n\n**Discussion Questions (ask these in order, allowing think-pair-share time before whole-group responses):**\n\n1. \"What do you notice about this tree? What looks different or unusual about it compared to trees you see every day?\" *(Elicit observations about the large hole, the hollow cavity, bare branches, etc.)*\n\n2. \"How old do you think this tree might be? What clues help you guess?\" *(Listen for reasoning about size, bark texture, lack of leaves.)*\n\n3. \"Do you think anything lives in or on this old tree? What could make a home here?\" *(Accept all predictions—animals, insects, plants, fungi.)*\n\n4. \"What do you think happened to this tree that made it look this way? How did it change over time?\" *(Guide toward idea of decay, aging, environmental damage.)*\n\n**Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n\n\"This tree is very old and hollow inside. I wonder: Is this tree still alive? Could it still be growing? Could it still have babies (seeds)? What happens to a tree when it gets this old? And here's the biggest question—even though this tree is old and broken, do you think it's still useful to nature and other animals?\"\n\nRecord student wonderings on chart paper to revisit at lesson's end.\n\n**Transition:** \n\n\"Today, we're going to become tree detectives and explore how old trees like this one have an important job in nature—even after they start to die. Let's investigate what we can learn about life cycles and animal homes.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the life cycle of trees and discover which organisms could thrive in or on a decaying tree through hands-on exploration and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photographs of the hollow tree (one per student or pair)\n- Magnifying glasses or hand lenses\n- \"Tree Detective Observation Sheets\" (worksheet with labeled areas: bark, cavity, hollow space, branches, surrounding area)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Small samples (if available): bark pieces, dead leaves, twigs, moss, or small rocks to examine under magnifiers\n- Chart labeled \"Who Could Live Here?\"\n- Picture cards or drawings of potential tree-dwelling organisms: woodpeckers, owls, beetles, carpenter ants, fungi, spiders, squirrels, raccoons, bees, beetles (optional—use simple drawings)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1 (5 minutes):** Distribute printed photographs and magnifying glasses to each student or pair. Model how to use the hand lens to observe fine details.\n\nInstruct students: \"Look very carefully at the tree photo using your magnifying glass. Use your 'Tree Detective Observation Sheet' to record what you see. In each section of the sheet, draw or describe: the bark (outside covering), the cavity (the big hole), the inside (what's left after decay), branches, and anything else you notice.\"\n\n**Step 2 (8 minutes):** Students complete detailed observations on their sheets. Walk around and ask guiding questions without providing answers:\n- \"What textures do you see? Smooth, rough, crumbly?\"\n- \"How do you think the wood inside changed? Did something eat it? Did it break down?\"\n- \"If you were a small animal, where would you feel safest in this tree?\"\n\n**Step 3 (5 minutes):** Transition to the \"Who Could Live Here?\" chart. Show students the organism picture cards (or draw simple pictures of different animals on the board).\n\nExplain: \"I'm going to show you pictures of different animals and organisms. For each one, I want you to think: Could this creature live in, on, or around this old tree? Would it survive well here? Would it struggle? You'll vote by moving to different corners of the room, or by raising your hand.\"\n\nShow each organism and facilitate quick peer discussion:\n- Woodpecker (Yes—it could peck for insects and make a nest)\n- Owl (Yes—it could nest in the cavity)\n- Beetle (Yes—it eats the decaying wood)\n- Squirrel (Maybe—it could use the branches and cavity)\n- Deer (No—it doesn't use trees for homes this way)\n- Fish (No—it needs water)\n- Carpenter Ants (Yes—they tunnel through old wood)\n- Fungi/Mushrooms (Yes—they break down dead material)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\nFacilitate observations without leading them to \"correct\" answers. Ask probing questions like: \"Why would a beetle thrive here?\" and \"What would a bird need to survive in this tree?\" Document student thinking on the chart without judgment. Use their responses to guide the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents will create detailed visual records of the tree's features, identify the hollow cavity and decayed areas, and demonstrate reasoning about which organisms could survive in or on the tree based on observable features. They will recognize that different organisms have different needs and that an old tree can meet the needs of many creatures.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts about life cycles, decomposition, and habitat after students' hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Life cycle diagram template (visual showing: seed → young tree → adult tree → old tree → dead tree)\n- Pictures or drawings of decomposer organisms (fungi, beetles, bacteria—use simple, age-appropriate images)\n- \"Tree Life Cycle\" poster (pre-made or co-created during lesson)\n- Anchor chart: \"What Decomposers Do\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1 (5 minutes): Connect to Observations**\n\nGather students and review the \"Who Could Live Here?\" chart from Explore. Say: \"You noticed that many different animals and organisms could live in this old tree. Let's talk about why this tree became hollow and how it became such an amazing home.\"\n\n**Step 2 (8 minutes): Introduce Life Cycle Vocabulary and Concept**\n\nDisplay the life cycle diagram. Explain in student-friendly language:\n\n\"Every living thing goes through stages called a **life cycle**. A tree's life cycle has four big stages, just like yours does:\n\n1. **Birth** – A seed grows into a baby tree (a seedling). It's tiny and needs lots of water, sunlight, and good soil.\n\n2. **Growth** – The baby tree gets bigger and taller. Its trunk gets thicker. Its roots go deep into the ground.\n\n3. **Reproduction** – When the tree is all grown up, it makes flowers or cones that become seeds. Those seeds can make new baby trees.\n\n4. **Death** – Eventually, the tree gets very, very old. It stops making new leaves. Parts of it start to break down and decay.\"\n\nPoint to the photograph: \"This tree is in the death stage of its life cycle. But here's the amazing part—even though the tree is dying, it's not the end of the story!\"\n\n**Step 3 (7 minutes): Introduce Decomposition and Decomposers**\n\nSay: \"When a tree dies, special organisms called **decomposers** get to work. Decomposers are living things that break down dead material and turn it into nutrients that go back into the soil.\"\n\nDisplay pictures of decomposers. Explain:\n\n- **Fungi** (like mushrooms and mold) – These grow on dead wood and slowly break it down into smaller pieces. They're like nature's recyclers!\n- **Insects** (like beetles and carpenter ants) – These tunnel through dead wood, eating it and breaking it into smaller bits.\n- **Bacteria** (tiny, invisible organisms) – These live everywhere in the soil and help break down everything.\n\nCreate an anchor chart titled \"What Decomposers Do\":\n- Break down dead plants and animals\n- Turn them into nutrients\n- Put nutrients back in the soil\n- Help new plants grow\n- Clean up nature's trash!\n\nConnect to the tree: \"This hollow tree you observed? The hole was made over many, many years as decomposers slowly broke down the inside of the tree. But while they were doing that job, the tree became a perfect **habitat**—a home—for animals like woodpeckers, owls, beetles, and spiders.\"\n\n**Step 4: Check for Understanding**\n\nAsk formative assessment questions:\n- \"Can you point to the tree and show me where you think decomposers were working?\" *(Students point to hollow area.)*\n- \"What are decomposers doing? Use your own words to explain.\" *(Listen for ideas about breaking down, recycling, returning materials to soil.)*\n- \"Why is this old tree still important to nature, even though it's not growing new leaves anymore?\" *(Elicit responses about providing habitat and being recycled.)*\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n1. **Life Cycle** – The stages all living things go through: birth, growth, reproduction, and death.\n2. **Decomposition** – The natural process where dead things break down and decay.\n3. **Decomposers** – Organisms (like fungi, bacteria, and insects) that break down dead material.\n4. **Habitat** – A place where an organism lives and finds food, water, and shelter.\n5. **Adaptation** – A trait that helps an organism survive in its environment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents will understand that all organisms have life cycles that end in death, that decomposition is a natural and important process, and that decomposer organisms are specially adapted to survive in the environment of decaying wood. They will recognize that dead trees provide valuable habitats for many animals.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing a model or argument about how a decaying tree serves multiple purposes in an ecosystem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster paper or chart paper (one per small group)\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- Pictures or magazine cutouts of organisms (pre-cut or printed)\n- Glue sticks\n- \"Tree Roles in Nature\" reference sheet listing: shelter, food source, decomposition, nutrient recycling\n- Optional: small branches, bark pieces, moss for tactile model-building\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Collaborative Ecosystem Poster (Recommended for most classes)**\n\nDivide the class into 3-4 small groups. Assign each group one of these roles the old tree plays:\n\n- **Group 1: The Tree as Home** – Create a poster showing all the animals that use the tree for shelter or nesting.\n- **Group 2: The Tree as Food** – Create a poster showing how the decaying tree provides food for decomposers and insects, which then feed birds and other animals.\n- **Group 3: The Tree as Recycler** – Create a poster showing how decomposers break down the tree and return nutrients to the soil for new plants.\n- **Group 4: The Tree as Environment** – Create a poster showing how the tree's environment (damp cavity, rough bark, protected space) helps organisms survive.\n\nDistribute poster paper, markers, and organism pictures to each group. Instruct students:\n\n\"Your group's job is to show one important job the old tree does. Draw or glue pictures of the organisms involved. Label or describe why each organism thrives in or on the tree. Be ready to explain your poster to the class.\"\n\nStudents work collaboratively to create visual representations. Circulate to ask guiding questions:\n- \"Why does a beetle do well on this tree?\"\n- \"What does the tree give to the fungi? What do the fungi give back?\"\n- \"How does the tree's old age help this organism survive?\"\n\n**Step 2 (5 minutes): Gallery Walk and Peer Discussion**\n\nPost all posters around the room. Students do a quick gallery walk, observing peers' work. Bring the class back together and have each group share their poster (1-2 minutes per group).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\nFacilitate group collaboration, ask questions to deepen thinking, and help students make connections between their assigned role and the broader ecosystem. Encourage students to see the tree as a multi-functional organism even in death.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents will create visual evidence that a decaying tree serves multiple purposes: as a home, food source, decomposition site, and nutrient recycler. They will articulate how specific organisms are adapted to thrive in the tree's environment and why that adaptation is useful for survival.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of tree life cycles, decomposition, and how organisms survive in specific habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation of student responses during Engage and Explore phases\n- Quality of observations recorded on \"Tree Detective Observation Sheets\"\n- Student reasoning during \"Who Could Live Here?\" discussion\n- Participation and reasoning during group poster creation\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nAt the end of Session 2, provide each student with an exit ticket (can be written, drawn, or verbal depending on class needs). Choose one or more of these prompts:\n\n**Option 1 (Drawing + Label):**\n\"Draw this tree in two pictures: one showing it when it was young and healthy, and one showing it now when it is old. Label the life cycle stages.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Written/Verbal Response):**\n\"Look at this old tree. Write or tell me: (a) What stage of the life cycle is this tree in? (b) Why is this old tree still important to nature, even though it's not growing new leaves? (c) Name one organism that lives in or on this tree and explain why it can survive there.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Argument with Evidence):**\n\"Some people say an old, hollow tree should be cut down because it looks dead and broken. Do you agree or disagree? Use what you learned about decomposition and habitats to write or say why.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Identify the tree as being in the \"death\" or \"old age\" stage of its life cycle\n- ✓ Explain that decomposers (fungi, insects, bacteria) break down dead wood\n- ✓ Describe at least one organism that survives in or on the tree and give a reason why it can thrive there\n- ✓ Recognize that an old, decaying tree is still valuable to nature (provides habitat, recycles nutrients, feeds organisms)\n- ✓ Use evidence from the photograph or their observations to support their thinking\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nMost students will demonstrate understanding that trees have life cycles ending in death, that decomposition is a natural process, and that old trees provide important habitats and food sources for many organisms. Students will recognize that an organism's traits help it survive in specific environments.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Provide sentence stems or multiple-choice options. Example: \"This tree is in the _____ stage of its life cycle: (a) birth, (b) growth, (c) death.\" Pair with a drawing activity rather than writing.\n\n2. **Graphic Organizer:** Provide a pre-drawn life cycle circle with images for students to arrange in order, rather than creating from scratch. Reduce the number of vocabulary terms introduced (focus on life cycle, decomposer, habitat).\n\n3. **Small Group Support During Explore:** Work with a small group during the observation activity, using hand lenses together and asking targeted questions to build understanding before whole-group discussion.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Decomposition Timeline:** Ask advanced students to research and create a timeline showing how long it takes different organisms to decompose (leaves, wood, insects). Have them estimate how many years the photographed tree has been decomposing and justify their estimate.\n\n2. **Organism Adaptation Research:** Assign advanced students to choose one organism visible in or on the tree and research specific adaptations it has developed to survive in decaying wood. Have them present findings to the class (e.g., \"Carpenter ants have strong mandibles to chew through wood\").\n\n3. **Design a Solution:** Present the challenge: \"If this tree were near a school playground, would you recommend cutting it down or leaving it? Create a poster or write a letter to the principal explaining your decision using evidence about life cycles and habitats.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Tree Detective Field Walk:** Take students on a nature walk around the school grounds or local park to find and photograph other old trees in various stages of decay. Create a class gallery or digital presentation comparing different trees' life cycles and decomposition stages.\n\n2. **Decomposer Observation Jar:** Set up a \"decomposition observation station\" in the classroom. Place layers of soil, dead leaves, twigs, and small organisms (pill bugs, if available) in a clear jar. Have students observe and record changes over 2-4 weeks, sketching what decomposers are doing. Connect observations back to the hollow tree and the concept of nutrient cycling.\n\n3. **Life Cycle Book or Timeline:** Have students create a \"Tree Life Story\" book or poster showing all four stages of a tree's life cycle (from seed to old hollow tree) with illustrations and captions. Include pages about decomposers and animals that live in old trees, creating a comprehensive narrative of a tree's complete life and \"afterlife\" in the ecosystem.\n\n---",
