Observe and name body parts of a lizard visible in a photograph.\n2. Identify what a lizard needs to survive (food, water, shelter, a safe place).\n3. Describe why a lizard's home (habitat) is important for its survival.\n4. Create or draw a simple lizard habitat that meets the animal's basic needs.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animals and their needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, clear photograph of the lizard (printed 8.5\" × 11\" or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: small stuffed lizard toy\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or poster board at child's eye level. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions one at a time**, pausing for 3–5 student responses to each:\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? What is it doing?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this lizard is? What do you see around it?\" (Point to the branch.)\n   - \"Does this lizard look like any animals you know? How is it the same or different?\"\n   - \"What do you think this lizard needs to be healthy and safe?\" (Accept all answers without judgment.)\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n   Say: \"This lizard lives on a tree branch. I wonder: Does the lizard have everything it needs to live there? Let's find out what animals like this lizard need to survive!\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper. Save this for later reference.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become lizard detectives and explore what this animal needs!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate animal needs through hands-on exploration and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the lizard (one per pair or small group)\n- \"Lizard Detective\" observation worksheet (simple picture chart with rows labeled: Body Parts, Home, Food, Water, Safety)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Real or realistic toy lizards (optional, for tactile learners)\n- Tree branch or bark sample (optional, to handle safely)\n- Picture cards showing: insects (food), water droplet, tree, rocks, predators\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud and demonstrate):**\n\n1. \"Look at the lizard picture very carefully. You are a lizard detective!\"\n\n2. \"Draw or circle what you see on your worksheet:\n   - What body parts does the lizard have? (Head, tail, legs, eyes)\n   - What is around the lizard? (Tree branch—this is its home!)\n   - Where might the lizard find food? (On the tree, in cracks, insects nearby)\"\n\n3. \"Now, think like the lizard. If YOU were a lizard living on a tree branch:\n   - What would you need to drink? (Water)\n   - Where would you hide if something scary came? (Under bark, in cracks)\n   - What would you eat? (Insects)\"\n\n4. \"Draw or write (or tell a teacher) two things the lizard needs to stay alive.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups. Ask guiding questions: \"Why does the lizard need this?\" \"Where do you see that in the picture?\"\n- Do NOT give answers. Instead, redirect: \"What do you think? Let's look closer.\"\n- For non-writers, accept verbal responses and record them.\n- Point out details (scales, claws, color) without explaining—let kids discover why these matter.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify at least 2 basic needs (shelter, food, water, safety).\n- Students note observable features of the lizard and its environment.\n- Drawings or statements show connections between the lizard and its habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and solidify understanding through teacher-led discussion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of the lizard (large)\n- Picture cards or simple icons for: food, water, shelter, safety\n- Student worksheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 4–5 students to share one thing their lizard needs: \"Tell us one thing the lizard needs. Why does it need that?\"\n   - Record each need on a chart titled \"What Lizards Need to Survive\" with simple drawings.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (7–10 minutes):**\n   Use the photograph and point to features as you explain:\n\n   - **Lizard:** A small animal with scales, a tail, and four legs. Lizards are cold-blooded (their bodies are warm or cool like the air around them).\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives—like the tree branch where this lizard lives. It has everything the lizard needs.\n   - **Shelter:** A safe place to hide and rest. The cracks in the bark are shelters for lizards.\n   - **Scales:** Tiny, bumpy pieces of skin that protect the lizard's body. Feel your arm—it's smooth. A lizard's skin is bumpy like this tree bark!\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n\n3. **Connect Back (3–5 minutes):**\n   Say: \"Remember when we wondered what the lizard needs? Let's check our list:\n   - **Food?** Yes! Insects and bugs.\n   - **Water?** Yes! From rain or damp places.\n   - **Shelter?** Yes! The tree branch and bark.\n   - **Safety?** Yes! The color helps it hide!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   Ask: \"Point to the lizard's tail. Show me where the lizard's shelter is. Can you find the scales?\"\n   (Use gestures and visuals, not complex language.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Lizard** | A small animal with scales, a tail, and four legs. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds food and shelter. |\n| **Shelter** | A safe, cozy place where an animal can hide and rest. |\n| **Scales** | Tiny, bumpy pieces of skin that cover and protect a lizard's body. |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use 2–3 new vocabulary words correctly.\n- Students can point to and name parts of the lizard and its habitat.\n- Students understand that animals need multiple things to survive (not just one).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a lizard habitat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Shoeboxes or small containers (one per student or pair)\n- Natural materials: twigs, leaves, bark, soil, rocks, moss\n- Paper cup or shallow dish for water\n- Crayons, paper, glue\n- Picture of the lizard (reference)\n- Optional: toy lizard to place in the box\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Habitat Building Challenge:**\n\n1. **Explain the task:** \"We're going to build a home for a pretend lizard! Your lizard needs: something to climb on, a place to hide, water, and a safe spot. Let's create the perfect habitat!\"\n\n2. **Model first (2 minutes):**\n   Show how to arrange two twigs in the box to look like branches. Point out: \"This twig is for climbing, like our lizard in the picture. Now I need a place to hide...\"\n\n3. **Student Activity (10–12 minutes):**\n   - Give each student/pair a shoebox and materials.\n   - Students arrange items to create a lizard habitat.\n   - They must include: a climbing place (branch/twig), a hiding spot (under bark, leaves), water (cup), and a safe space.\n   - Optional: Add a toy lizard and place it in the habitat. \"Does your lizard have everything it needs?\"\n\n4. **Student Reflection:**\n   Ask each student: \"Tell me one thing in your habitat that helps the lizard survive. Why does it need this?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Encourage creativity while gently redirecting: \"Where is your lizard's water? Remember, all animals need water!\"\n- Ask students to explain their choices: \"Why did you put the leaf there?\"\n- Facilitate sharing: \"Show a partner your habitat and tell them what your lizard needs.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each student/pair creates a functional habitat with at least 3 of the 4 basic needs visible.\n- Students explain verbally why they included each element.\n- Habitats demonstrate understanding that animals need specific environmental features to survive.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal needs and habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage (predictions and wonderings).\n- Listen to student explanations in Explore (what do they notice?).\n- Monitor vocabulary use during Explain (do students use new words?).\n- Evaluate habitat choices in Elaborate (do they justify their decisions?).\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (5–10 minutes):**\n\nChoose one or more based on your students' abilities:\n\n**Option A (Visual/Hands-On):**\nDisplay the lizard photograph again. Ask:\n1. \"Show me the lizard's home with your finger. Why is this a good home?\"\n2. \"What does this lizard need that we give our pets?\" (Accept: food, water, shelter, safety.)\n3. \"Can you find the lizard's hiding place?\"\n\n**Option B (Verbal):**\nAsk individual students:\n- \"What is one thing a lizard needs to survive?\"\n- \"Where do you think a lizard finds water in nature?\"\n- \"Why do you think the lizard's color is important?\" (It helps hide.)\n\n**Option C (Drawing):**\nProvide a simple outline of a tree. Ask: \"Draw or tell me one thing a lizard needs on this tree.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n✓ Student identifies **at least 2 basic animal needs** (food, water, shelter, safety).\n✓ Student describes **where** the lizard finds those needs in its habitat.\n✓ Student makes **one connection** between the lizard's body features and survival (e.g., \"The color helps it hide\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly name at least 2 animal needs.\n- 70% of students will explain why a specific habitat feature helps the animal survive.\n- All students will create or describe a habitat with multiple survival elements.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce complexity with sentence frames:**\n   - Provide sentence stems: \"The lizard needs ___.\" \"The lizard lives on a ___.\" \"The scales help the lizard ___.\"\n   - Offer 2–3 picture choices and have student point instead of generating ideas.\n\n2. **Pair with a stronger reader/observer:**\n   - Assign a \"buddy\" during Explore and Elaborate. The buddy asks guiding questions; the focus student observes and answers.\n\n3. **Focus on one need at a time:**\n   - Instead of four needs, concentrate on **shelter** and **safety** during the first lesson. Introduce food and water in a follow-up.\n   - Simplify the habitat activity: provide a pre-made box with two twigs and ask student to add ONE more thing.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Add a research component:**\n   - Provide picture cards or simple books about different lizard types. Ask: \"Do you think this lizard's needs are different from another lizard? Why or why not?\"\n   - Challenge: \"Can you find another animal that lives on trees? What does it need?\"\n\n2. **Design a habitat for a specific scenario:**\n   - \"It's very dry where your lizard lives. How will you help it find water?\"\n   - \"A bird is hunting near your lizard. How can you make the habitat safer?\"\n\n3. **Compare animal needs:**\n   - Provide images of a lizard, bird, and fish. Ask: \"Which animals need shelter? Which need water to drink? Which needs are the same?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Lizard Life Cycle Hunt (Outdoor Exploration):**\n   Take students on a safe nature walk to look for lizards, insects (lizard food), trees with hiding spots, and water sources. Use a clipboard and simple picture checklist: ☐ Lizard or lizard track, ☐ Insect, ☐ Tree with bark, ☐ Water or wet place. Discuss observations afterward: \"Did we find all the things a lizard needs?\"\n\n2. **Create a \"Needs of Animals\" Anchor Chart (Ongoing Reference):**\n   Make a colorful poster with pictures and words for Food, Water, Shelter, Safety. Add images of different animals (lizard, rabbit, bird, fish) and have students sort or match: \"Which animals need water? Which need shelter?\" Use this chart throughout the year for other animal lessons.\n\n3. **Lizard Movement Game (Physical Activity):**\n   Teach students a \"lizard crawl\" (low to the ground, scurrying movements). Play \"Lizard and Predator\" (tag variant): Lizards crawl around; one student is a predator. When a student touches a \"shelter\" (designated safe zone), they're safe. Debrief: \"Why did the lizard need to hide? What was the shelter?\" Connects movement to survival concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** If using real branches or bark, check for sharp splinters. Wash hands after handling natural materials.\n- **Accessibility:** Use large, clear photographs. Describe details aloud. Offer tactile experiences (smooth vs. bumpy surfaces).\n- **Cultural connections:** Discuss where students have seen lizards. Some cultures have stories or traditions about lizards—invite sharing.\n- **Vocabulary scaffolding:** Use gestures, visuals, and repetition. Don't assume students know words like \"scales\" or \"predator\"—show them!\n- **Assessment flexibility:** Accept drawings, verbal responses, and physical demonstrations. Not all K students write or draw representationally yet.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly scaffolds K-LS1-1 by having students observe a real photograph, describe what they see, and build understanding that animals have specific survival needs tied to their habitats.**",
