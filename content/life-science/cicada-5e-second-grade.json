A Closer Look at Cicadas**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or 90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-LS4-1: Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify and describe the body parts of insects using simple language (legs, wings, head, body)\n2. Explain how insects depend on plants for food and shelter\n3. Observe and compare how different insects are suited to live in their specific habitats\n4. Draw and label an insect they observe, noting the features that help it survive\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about insects and what they need to survive by examining the photograph closely.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (8x10 or larger) or digital display projected on screen\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Do not explain it yet. Ask students to look quietly for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the creature?\"\n   - \"What is it standing on or holding onto?\"\n   - \"What colors and shapes do you notice on the creature's body?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this creature might be visiting this plant? What could it be doing here?\"\n\n3. **Create a class \"Wonder Wall\":** Ask students, \"What do you wonder about this creature?\" Write 4–5 student wonderings on chart paper (e.g., \"Does it eat the plant?\" \"Why does it have wings?\" \"Where does it sleep?\").\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"Do you think this creature is a bug or an insect? What makes you think that?\"\n\n**Transition:** \n\"Today we're going to become insect detectives! We'll explore what insects look like and why they need to live on plants like the ones in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate insect body parts and how insects interact with plants through hands-on observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of 5–6 different insects (ant, butterfly, beetle, ladybug, grasshopper, fly) — one set per pair of students\n- Colored pipe cleaners (6 per pair)\n- White paper\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- Large paper leaves (pre-cut from green construction paper, 5–6 per pair)\n- Small objects to represent \"food\" (dried beans, small crackers) scattered on a table\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but encouraged)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Partner Insect Investigation (10 minutes):**\n   - Distribute insect picture cards to pairs. Each pair gets one insect.\n   - Ask: \"Look closely at your insect. Can you count the legs? Can you see wings? Does it have a head? A body?\"\n   - Students use magnifying glasses to observe details and draw their insect on white paper, labeling: **legs, wings, head, body**.\n   - Circulate and ask: \"Why might this insect need wings?\" \"What could those legs help it do?\"\n\n2. **Insect Model Building (10 minutes):**\n   - Give each pair 6 pipe cleaners and a small paper ball or foam ball (the \"body\").\n   - Challenge: \"Use your pipe cleaners to build an insect with 6 legs. Can you add wings?\"\n   - Students construct a 3D pipe cleaner insect.\n   - Ask: \"Why do insects need 6 legs? Why do they need wings?\"\n\n3. **Record Observations:**\n   - On a simple graphic organizer (provided), students draw their insect and check boxes for: \"Has legs ☐  Has wings ☐  Has head ☐  Can move ☐\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate observations without naming the insects initially.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What parts does this creature have?\" \"How are these insects alike? How are they different?\"\n- Use magnifying glasses alongside students; model close observation.\n- Do not directly teach insect anatomy — let students discover it through looking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 4 basic insect body parts through observation.\n- Students create a model insect with 6 legs, demonstrating understanding of insect structure.\n- Students record observations in drawings and checkboxes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain how insects depend on plants, directly connecting to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original photograph (enlarged)\n- Vocabulary poster board (pre-made with pictures)\n- Class chart labeled \"Why Insects Need Plants\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2–3 pairs to show their pipe cleaner insects.\n   - Ask the class: \"What parts did we find on ALL the insects? Legs, wings, head, body — yes!\"\n   - Celebrate observations: \"You're scientists! You discovered what insects look like.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Using the vocabulary poster, teach these terms with pictures:\n\n   - **Insect:** A small animal with 6 legs, a head, a body, and often wings\n   - **Habitat:** The home or place where a plant or animal lives\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps a plant or animal survive in its habitat\n   - **Depend on:** To need something to live and grow\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the cicada photograph again.\n   - \"This is a cicada. It is an insect. Where is it living? [On the plant!] Why is it on the plant? [To find food!]\"\n   - Point to the cicada's strong legs: \"See these legs? They help it grip and hold onto branches. That's an adaptation!\"\n   - Point to the wings: \"These wings help it fly to different plants. Another adaptation!\"\n   - Create a class chart together:\n\n   | **What the Cicada Has** | **How It Helps** |\n   |---|---|\n   | 6 legs | Holds onto plants |\n   | Wings | Flies to find food |\n   | Mouth | Drinks from plants |\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Does an insect need a plant? Who can tell us why?\"\n   - Expect answers like: \"To eat,\" \"For shelter,\" or \"To drink.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Insect:** A tiny animal with 6 legs, wings, and a body\n- **Habitat:** Where an animal lives and finds food and shelter\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part that helps an animal survive in its home\n- **Depend on:** To need something to stay alive\n- **Plant:** A living thing with leaves, stems, and roots that makes its own food\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that insects have specific body parts.\n- Students can explain in simple terms why insects visit plants (food, shelter).\n- Students recognize that body parts are adaptations.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a habitat and observing how insects and plants interact.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-made \"habitats\" — paper plates or shallow boxes with the following:\n  - Drawn or paper plant (flower, leaf, or branch)\n  - Picture of an insect taped or drawn inside\n  - Small food items (seeds, crackers, or paper shapes labeled \"food\")\n- Colored pencils and markers\n- Optional: Real potted plant (safe, non-toxic) and outdoor insect photos\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Create-a-Habitat Challenge (10 minutes):**\n   - Distribute pre-made habitat bases (paper plates with plants).\n   - Ask: \"Your insect needs to survive. What does it need in its habitat?\" (Food, the plant to hold onto, safe space)\n   - Students draw or place a food source and the insect in the habitat.\n   - Students label: \"This is [insect name]. It eats [food]. It lives on [plant].\"\n\n2. **Compare Habitats (5 minutes):**\n   - Post 2–3 finished habitats side by side.\n   - Ask: \"Are these habitats the same? What's different? Do all insects need the same plants?\"\n   - Guide students to see: Some insects like flowers, some like leaves, some like tree bark.\n\n3. **Real-World Connection (optional, 5 minutes):**\n   - If possible, step outside briefly or show photos of local insects on plants.\n   - Ask: \"Do we have insects in our yard? What plants do they live on?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate habitat creation by asking, \"What does your insect need to survive here?\"\n- Validate all reasonable responses.\n- Use questions to deepen thinking: \"Does every insect eat the same food?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a labeled habitat showing an insect and a plant together.\n- Students articulate why the insect and plant belong together.\n- Students recognize that different insects have different habitat needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of insect body parts, plant-insect relationships, and habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist:** As students explore and elaborate, note:\n  - ☐ Student identifies 3+ insect body parts\n  - ☐ Student explains why insects visit plants\n  - ☐ Student uses vocabulary: insect, habitat, adaptation, depend on\n  - ☐ Student makes comparisons between different insects\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) — Show Me and Tell Me (5–10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an **Exit Ticket** (simple worksheet or verbal prompt):\n\n1. **Draw:** Draw the insect from the photograph (the cicada). Label 2 body parts.\n2. **Fill in the blank:**\n   - \"An insect has _____ legs.\"\n   - \"Insects depend on _____ for food.\"\n   - \"Wings help insects _____.\"\n\n3. **Explain (teacher asks orally or student draws):**\n   - \"Why does the cicada in the picture need to be on that plant?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student correctly draws and labels an insect with 2+ body parts\n- ✓ Student answers: \"6 legs,\" \"plants,\" and \"fly/move/get away\"\n- ✓ Student explains: \"For food,\" \"To live,\" or \"To get food\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify an insect and 2 body parts.\n- Most students can state one reason insects need plants.\n- Students use the word \"insect\" or \"habitat\" in conversation.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n1. **Simplified graphic organizer:** Provide a pre-drawn insect with only 2 body parts to label (legs, wings) instead of 4.\n2. **Partner with a stronger reader:** Pair for Explore activities so verbal support is available.\n3. **Use real insect images during observation:** Instead of picture cards, provide 2–3 large, clear photos of actual insects to reduce visual complexity.\n4. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on only 2 key terms: \"insect\" and \"habitat.\" Introduce \"adaptation\" orally with clear examples only.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n1. **Insect life cycle exploration:** Provide picture cards showing insect metamorphosis (egg, larva, adult) and ask, \"What changes? Why?\" This preps for future NGSS standards on life cycles.\n2. **Habitat comparison research:** Ask students to research or sketch two different insects and compare how they live (e.g., butterfly on flower vs. beetle on bark). \"How are their habitats different?\"\n3. **Design a new habitat:** Ask, \"If you created a perfect habitat for a specific insect, what would it have?\" Have them justify choices with reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Insect Hunt Journal (Field Observation):**\n   - Take students outdoors on a nature walk (or use photographs if outdoors isn't available).\n   - Provide a simple **insect observation sheet** with a blank box for drawing, and prompts: \"What insect did you see? What plant was it on? What was it doing?\"\n   - Students sketch and discuss findings in a class \"Insect Spotter\" bulletin board.\n\n2. **Create an Insect Fact Card:**\n   - Students choose one insect from the lesson.\n   - Provide a template card (index card size) with: Picture, insect name, \"Where it lives,\" \"What it eats,\" \"How many legs.\"\n   - Cards become a classroom reference display.\n\n3. **Story or Puppet Play:**\n   - Students create a simple dialogue between an insect and a plant (e.g., Butterfly: \"Can I land on your flower?\" Flower: \"Yes! Please drink my nectar!\").\n   - Perform as a whole class or small group using drawn/constructed puppets.\n   - Reinforces the interdependence concept in a memorable, engaging way.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson directly uses the cicada photograph as the anchor text and returns to it multiple times, ensuring visual literacy and observation skills.\n- Second graders learn best through hands-on exploration before formal vocabulary, so the Explore phase is intentionally lengthy and discovery-based.\n- The pipe cleaner model building concretely demonstrates insect structure, which is developmentally appropriate for this age.\n- Real insects or outdoor observation (if safe and possible) dramatically increases engagement and relevance.",
