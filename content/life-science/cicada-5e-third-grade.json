ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity about cicadas and activate prior knowledge about insects and their habitats.\n\n#### Materials\n- Projected or printed photograph of the cicada on the plant branch (large enough for all students to see)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Recording device to play a cicada sound (10 seconds)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display Phase (2 minutes):**\n- Project the cicada photograph on the board or pass around a large printed version. Pause for 30 seconds of silent observation.\n- Say: *\"Look carefully. What do you notice about this creature? What do you wonder about it?\"*\n\n**Discussion Questions (8 minutes):**\nAsk these questions in sequence, allowing 30-45 seconds for thinking and partner talk before sharing:\n\n1. **\"What do you see in this picture? Describe the insect to a partner using words like 'color,' 'size,' 'body parts,' and 'where it is.'\"** (Students notice brown/tan coloring, wings, legs, positioned on a plant with red flowers.)\n\n2. **\"Why do you think this insect might be sitting on this plant with flowers? What could it be doing there?\"** (Listen for: eating, drinking, laying eggs, hiding, resting. Affirm all hypotheses.)\n\n3. **\"This insect is called a cicada. Have you ever heard a loud buzzing or humming sound outside on a summer day? That might have been a cicada! What do you wonder about how cicadas make that sound?\"** (Spark curiosity about their abilities and sounds.)\n\n4. **\"If I told you that this cicada spent **years** living underground before it looked like this, what would you want to know about?\"** (Guide toward curiosity about life stages and change.)\n\n**Prediction Prompt (2 minutes):**\n- Record on chart paper: *\"What do you think a baby cicada looks like? Where do you think it lives?\"*\n- Have 3-4 volunteers share predictions. Say: *\"Today, we're going to discover the secrets of the cicada's incredible life journey!\"*\n\n#### Transition\n*\"Let's explore and discover what really happens during a cicada's life by acting out their amazing story.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate the cicada life cycle through a kinesthetic, hands-on simulation.\n\n#### Materials\n- Large open floor space (or hallway)\n- Index cards or paper labels (pre-made): \"Egg,\" \"Underground Nymph (Years 1-5),\" \"Nymph Emerging,\" \"Adult Cicada\"\n- Markers (students will add drawings)\n- Optional: Plant materials (branches, twigs) to represent the environment\n- Student observation sheets (see below)\n- Chart showing basic cicada life cycle (kept covered until Explain phase)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Setup (2 minutes):**\n- Divide students into groups of 3-4. Assign each group one life stage: eggs, underground nymph, emerging nymph, or adult.\n- Place \"station\" areas around the room, each labeled with a life stage name.\n\n**Student Exploration Directions (15 minutes):**\n\n*Teacher says: \"You are going to become cicadas and explore each stage of a cicada's life. At each station, you'll discover what that stage is like and draw or label what you observe.\"*\n\n**Station Rotations (3 minutes per station, 12 minutes total):**\n\n**Station 1: Egg Stage**\n- Students find a \"laying place\" on the floor (representing tree bark).\n- They crouch down very small (like an egg) and cannot move.\n- Teacher or student guide whispers: *\"Cicada eggs are tiny and stay still in tree bark. They don't move or eat.\"*\n- Students draw or label: egg, small, tree bark\n\n**Station 2: Underground Nymph Stage** \n- Students are given \"root\" materials (yarn or drawn lines on floor) to explore around.\n- They crawl and burrow slowly through the area, using their \"legs\" (arms and legs) to dig.\n- Guide says: *\"The nymph lives underground for many years—maybe 5 years! It drinks juice from plant roots and slowly grows bigger. It cannot fly yet.\"*\n- Students draw/label: underground, roots, digging, no wings\n\n**Station 3: Emerging Nymph Stage**\n- Students slowly stand up and stretch upward (still without moving fast).\n- They climb an imaginary tree (wall or designated space).\n- Guide says: *\"After many years, the nymph climbs out of the ground and up a tree. It is ready to change. Its skin will split open.\"*\n- Students draw/label: climbing, tree, skin splitting\n\n**Station 4: Adult Cicada Stage**\n- Students stand tall, move freely, and flap their \"wings\" (arms).\n- They \"sing\" or hum (mimicking the cicada sound briefly).\n- Guide says: *\"The adult cicada has wings and can fly! It makes loud sounds to find other cicadas. It will lay eggs to start the cycle again.\"*\n- Students draw/label: wings, flying, making sound, adult\n\n**Documentation (7 minutes):**\n- Return to classroom/group area.\n- Each group receives an observation sheet with four boxes (one for each stage).\n- Groups draw or write **one thing they learned** about each life stage from their exploration.\n- Teacher circulates, asking: *\"What did you discover about how the cicada changes? What was the biggest change you noticed?\"*\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Facilitate without explaining life cycles directly—let students experience the stages.\n- Ask open-ended questions: *\"How did your body change when you moved from stage 1 to stage 2?\"* \"What made the adult stage different?\"\n- Ensure all students participate physically (modify for mobility needs as necessary).\n- Encourage students to observe the photograph again during stations: *\"Look at the wings on this adult cicada. Do you see how detailed they are?\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students physically experience the cicada's major life stages.\n- Student observation sheets show drawings/notes of each stage.\n- Students can describe orally: *\"The cicada started underground and couldn't fly, but when it grew up, it got wings and could fly.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and solidify understanding of the cicada life cycle and adaptations.\n\n#### Materials\n- Life cycle diagram (chart or projected image showing: egg → nymph underground → nymph emerging → adult)\n- Photograph of the cicada (displayed throughout)\n- Vocabulary cards (5-6 index cards with terms and pictures)\n- Chart paper for co-created anchor chart\n- Student science notebooks or worksheet\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Sharing Student Discoveries (5 minutes):**\n- Call on 2-3 groups to share one thing they learned during their station rotations.\n- Write key words students say on chart paper (e.g., \"wings,\" \"underground,\" \"growing,\" \"climbing\").\n- Say: *\"You discovered something scientists have studied for a long time. Today we're going to name these discoveries with special science words.\"*\n\n**Introducing the Life Cycle (6 minutes):**\n- Display the cicada life cycle diagram.\n- Walk through each stage, connecting back to student experiences:\n  - **Stage 1: Eggs** — *\"Remember when you were still and tiny at Station 1? Cicada eggs are laid in tree bark. They stay there for a few weeks.\"*\n  - **Stage 2: Nymph (Underground)** — *\"You crawled and burrowed at Station 2. This is the longest part—a cicada nymph lives underground for 2-17 years (depending on the species), drinking juice from plant roots.\"*\n  - **Stage 3: Emerging Nymph** — *\"You climbed up at Station 3. The nymph climbs out of the ground and up a tree. Its hard skin splits open—and look! A new form comes out.\"*\n  - **Stage 4: Adult** — *\"You had wings and could move freely at Station 4. The adult cicada has beautiful, transparent wings. It flies, finds mates, makes loud sounds, and lays eggs to start the cycle all over again.\"*\n\n**Vocabulary Introduction (5 minutes):**\n- Present each term on a card with a simple picture. Say the word, define it, and connect to the photograph or student experience.\n\n| **Vocabulary** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Life Cycle** | All the stages an organism (living thing) goes through from birth to death. A cicada's life cycle has four stages. |\n| **Nymph** | A young insect that looks different from its parents and is not ready to have babies yet. Cicada nymphs live underground. |\n| **Molt/Molting** | When an insect sheds (loses) its hard outer skin so it can grow bigger. A cicada molts many times as it grows. |\n| **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive. Wings help cicadas fly; strong legs help them climb. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. Cicadas live on plants and trees. |\n\n**Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n- Ask: *\"Can you point to the adult cicada in the photograph? Now tell your partner one thing the adult cicada's body helps it do—like flying or making sound.\"*\n- Listen for: wings → flying, strong legs → climbing, big eyes → seeing.\n\n#### Vocabulary\n- **Life Cycle:** The stages a living thing goes through from being born to growing up, making babies, and growing old.\n- **Nymph:** A young insect that lives in the ground and looks different from the adult. It will change as it grows.\n- **Molt:** When an insect sheds its outer skin to grow bigger. It happens many times during a cicada's life.\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or way of living that helps an animal survive where it lives.\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives, finds food, and stays safe.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students can identify and name the four stages of a cicada life cycle.\n- Students can explain (in their own words) why cicadas need to molt and change.\n- Students can point to the photograph and name at least two body parts that help the adult cicada survive.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents deepen understanding by exploring how cicada adaptations help them survive and by comparing life cycles.\n\n#### Materials\n- Cicada photograph (main reference)\n- \"Adaptation Detective\" worksheet (see below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Chart paper\n- Optional: Pictures of other insects (ant, butterfly, ladybug) for comparison\n- Cicada life cycle card set (for sorting activity)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Option A: Adaptation Detective Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n*Teacher says: \"The cicada's body has special features that help it survive. You're going to be detectives and figure out what each body part does.\"*\n\n**Directions for Students:**\n1. **Examine the photograph.** Look closely at the adult cicada.\n2. **Record observations** using the \"Adaptation Detective\" worksheet:\n   - **Body Part:** What do you see? (e.g., wings, legs, eyes, mouth)\n   - **What It Looks Like:** Draw it or describe the color, size, or shape.\n   - **What It Helps the Cicada Do:** How does this body part help it survive? (e.g., wings → fly away from danger; legs → climb plants)\n3. **Pair Share (5 min):** Turn to a partner and explain your two favorite adaptations.\n4. **Class Share (5 min):** 3-4 students share with the whole class. Record on chart: *\"Cicada Adaptations Help Them Survive.\"*\n\n**Sample Worksheet:**\n```\nADAPTATION DETECTIVE\nLook at the cicada picture. \n\nBody Part: ________________\nWhat it looks like: ________\n\nThis body part helps the cicada _________________.\n\nWhy? Because ___________________________.\n```\n\n---\n\n**Option B: Compare Life Cycles (12 minutes)**\n\n*Teacher says: \"Not all insects have the same life cycle. Cicadas are special. Let's see how their life cycle is the same as and different from other insects you might know.\"*\n\n**Directions for Students:**\n1. **Create a chart** (teacher-made or student-drawn):\n   | | **Cicada** | **Butterfly** | **Ant** |\n   |---|---|---|---|\n   | **Where baby lives** | Underground | In egg | In nest |\n   | **How many stages** | 4 (egg, nymph, emerging, adult) | 4 (egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly) | Many (egg, larva, pupa, adult) |\n   | **Does it have wings as a baby?** | No | No | No |\n   | **Does it molt?** | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n\n2. **Conclusion Question:** Ask students: *\"What do you notice? What is the same about all insect life cycles? What is different about cicadas?\"*\n   - Expected answer: *All insects start small and change as they grow. But cicadas live underground for a very long time, which is different.*\n\n3. **Draw:** Have students draw and label the cicada's life cycle, comparing it to another insect.\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate during Adaptation Detective work, asking: *\"What do you notice about the wings? Have you ever seen transparent things?\"* Prompt without directing.\n- During Compare Life Cycles, guide students to recognize patterns: *\"Look at these three insects. They all molt, but cicadas are special because...?\"*\n- Affirm all observations and reasoning.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students can name and explain 2-3 adaptations that help cicadas survive.\n- Students understand that all insect life cycles involve change, but cicadas' underground stage is uniquely long.\n- Students can draw a labeled life cycle and explain one stage verbally.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student mastery of learning objectives using formative and summative strategies.\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Station Rotations (Explore):** Teacher observation of students' ability to describe each life stage and move through them correctly.\n- **Vocabulary Check (Explain):** Listen during partner talk for students using terms like \"nymph,\" \"molt,\" and \"life cycle.\"\n- **Adaptation Detective (Elaborate):** Review worksheets for accurate identification of body parts and reasonable explanations of survival function.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (Cicada Life Cycle Ticket)**\n\n*Distribute a half-sheet to each student. Students may draw or write answers.*\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **\"A cicada nymph lives underground for many years. Why do you think it stays underground instead of coming out right away?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student mentions drinking from roots, growing, safety, or waiting until ready to fly.\n\n2. **\"Look at this picture of an adult cicada. Point to one body part and tell how it helps the cicada survive.\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student identifies a body part and connects it to survival (e.g., \"Wings help it fly,\" \"Strong legs help it climb\").\n\n3. **\"Finish this sentence: A cicada's life cycle is special because ___________________.\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student mentions the long underground stage, the molting/changing process, or multiple life stages (egg, nymph, adult).\n\n**Quick Oral Check (Optional):**\nFor students who struggle with written responses, ask orally:\n- *\"Tell me the four stages of a cicada's life in order.\"*\n- *\"What's one way a cicada is adapted to live on plants?\"*\n- *\"How is a cicada's life cycle different from what you expected?\"*\n\n#### Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives\n\n| **Learning Objective** | **Success Criteria** |\n|---|---|\n| Describe the cicada life cycle | Student identifies 3-4 stages and explains what happens at each stage (e.g., egg → nymph underground → emerging → adult). |\n| Identify adaptations | Student names 2+ body parts (wings, legs, eyes) and explains how they help survival (flying, climbing, seeing). |\n| Explain organism-habitat relationship | Student explains that cicadas live on plants and use them for food or laying eggs. |\n| Compare life cycles | Student recognizes that cicadas have a different life cycle than humans (longer, more stages) but all living things change. |\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- **90-100%:** Students answer 3/3 exit ticket questions correctly with detailed explanations.\n- **80-89%:** Students answer 2.5/3 questions correctly; may need clarification on why the underground stage is important.\n- **70-79%:** Students answer 2/3 questions; can name stages but need support explaining survival advantages.\n- **Below 70%:** Students identify stages but struggle to connect them to survival or adaptation; needs additional concrete review.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Life Cycle Chart:** Provide a pre-drawn 4-stage chart with pictures and one-word labels (egg, underground, climbing, flying). Students point to and color each stage instead of creating from scratch.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Support:** Create a visual vocabulary wall with pictures + words + simple sentences (e.g., \"A nymph is a baby insect living underground\"). Allow students to reference during activities.\n\n3. **Buddy System for Stations:** Pair struggling students with a confident peer during Explore stations. The partner helps guide movement and description while the teacher checks in more frequently.\n\n4. **Adapted Exit Ticket:** Offer multiple-choice or matching format instead of open-ended questions. Example: *\"A cicada's wings help it: A) dig underground  B) fly and escape danger  C) drink water.\"*\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deep Dive: Why Cicadas Stay Underground So Long:** Provide research prompt: *\"Cicada nymphs live underground for 2-17 years. Use reference books or the teacher's resource to find out WHY they stay so long. Is it the weather? The roots? Something else? Create a poster explaining your theory.\"*\n\n2. **Comparative Life Cycle Research:** Challenge students to research and illustrate the life cycles of 2-3 other insects (ladybug, dragonfly, grasshopper) and create a comparison chart showing similarities and differences with cicadas.\n\n3. **Engineering Design Challenge:** *\"Design a shelter or hiding place where a cicada could be safe underground. Use found materials (leaves, sticks, dirt, clay) to build a model and explain how it protects the nymph.\"*\n\n4. **Extended Adaptation Study:** Have students sketch the cicada and label 5+ adaptations (transparent wings, compound eyes, strong legs, sucking mouth, vibrating abdomen that makes sound). Research each one and write 2-3 sentences about its survival value.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cicada Sound Investigation (Listening & Sound Science)**\n   - **Activity:** Play a recording of actual cicada sounds (freely available online; search \"cicada sound recording\"). Ask: *\"How do you think the cicada makes this loud sound? What body parts might vibrate?\"* \n   - **Extension:** Students draw the inside of a cicada's abdomen showing the vibrating muscles that make sound. Connect to the male cicada's need to attract mates. (Bridges to 3-LS1-1: reproduction)\n   - **Time:** 15-20 minutes\n\n2. **Cicada Habitat Diorama (3D Model Building)**\n   - **Activity:** Students create a shoebox or paper-plate diorama showing a cicada's habitat. Include: underground section (with nymph and roots), tree/plant section (with adult cicada, flowers, other insects). Use clay, markers, craft materials.\n   - **Discussion:** *\"What does a cicada need to survive in this habitat? Where does it find food? Where is it safe?\"*\n   - **Assessment:** Use the diorama to verbally assess whether students understand organism-habitat relationships (3-LS4-3).\n   - **Time:** 30-40 minutes\n\n3. **Life Cycle Sequencing Game (Literacy + Science)**\n   - **Activity:** Create 4 illustrated cards representing each cicada life stage. Mix them up. Students (alone or in pairs) arrange them in correct order and explain the sequence. Repeat with other insects (butterfly, ladybug) for comparison.\n   - **Variation for Families:** Send home a blank template; families illustrate the cicada life cycle together and return to class to display.\n   - **Time:** 10-15 minutes in class; homework optional\n\n---\n\n## Connections to Third Grade Standards & Real-World Applications\n\n### NGSS Alignment Justification\n\n- **3-LS1-1 (Life Cycles):** This lesson directly models the cicada life cycle through kinesthetic stations and visual diagrams, showing a unique four-stage cycle common to all cicadas.\n\n- **3-LS4-2 (Adaptations & Survival Advantages):** Students explicitly examine how wings, strong legs, and sensory organs help cicadas survive, finding food, and reproducing.\n\n- **3-LS4-3 (Organism-Habitat Fit):** The photograph and activities emphasize that cicadas depend on plants and trees; students explore why cicadas thrive on flowering plants but wouldn't survive in other habitats (e.g., ocean, desert without plants).\n\n### Real-World Connections to Share with Students\n\n- **Why Cicadas Matter:** Cicadas are food for birds and other animals. They also help mix soil as nymphs tunnel underground.\n- **Summer Sound:** Tell students: *\"If you hear buzzing in summer, now you know it's a male cicada calling to find a mate!\"*\n- **Different Cicadas, Different Timelines:** Some cicadas emerge every 13 or 17 years in huge numbers (periodical cicadas). This is different from annual cicadas seen more often.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety Reminder:** Ensure exploration stations are safe; supervise all movement, especially floor-based activities. Modify for students with mobility considerations (standing activities instead of crawling).\n- **Timing:** If time is limited, combine Explore and Explain into one longer session (40 min). Elaborate can be a second-day activity.\n- **Visual Support:** Keep the photograph displayed throughout all five phases. Return to it frequently: *\"Look at this adult cicada again. Where do its adaptations come from?\"*\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Use the five terms consistently across all phases. Create a persistent anchor chart students add to as they discover.\n- **Cultural Connection:** Cicadas appear in art, poetry, and music across many cultures. If appropriate, share a brief example (e.g., a cicada haiku or artwork) to deepen engagement.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
