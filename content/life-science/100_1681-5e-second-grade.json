Observe and describe what plants need to grow (water, sunlight, and soil/growing medium).\n2. Plan and set up a simple plant experiment using a recycled bottle and a small plant cutting or seed.\n3. Record observations of plant growth over several days using drawings and words.\n4. Explain why recycling materials to grow plants is helpful to our environment.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about plants growing in unexpected places and activate prior knowledge about plant needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph printed large (11x14\" or displayed on screen/smartboard)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: a real bottle garden (if available) to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Wait Time:** Show the photograph to students. Let them look silently for 20-30 seconds without speaking. This builds anticipation and gives all students processing time.\n\n2. **Initial Observation:** Ask: \"What do you see in this picture?\" Allow 4-5 students to share observations. Accept all responses (bottle, green leaves, water, etc.). Record their observations on chart paper labeled \"What We Notice.\"\n\n3. **Curiosity Questions (ask these sequentially, pausing for answers):**\n   - \"Where is this plant growing? Is it in dirt like plants in the garden outside?\"\n   - \"What do you think this green plant needs to stay alive and healthy?\"\n   - \"Why would someone put a plant in an old bottle? What do you think they were trying to do?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a plant growing in something other than soil? Tell us about it.\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we tried to grow a plant in a bottle just like this one. Do you think it would work? What would we need to do?\" Write student wonderings on chart paper with a star next to them.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become plant scientists and test whether plants can really grow in bottles, just like the plant in this picture!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what plants need to grow by planning and setting up a bottle garden experiment.\n\n**Materials (per student pair or small group):**\n- Clean, clear plastic 2-liter bottle (cut horizontally by teacher beforehand to create a flat-bottomed container, or use as-is with soil)\n- Potting soil or growing medium (damp)\n- Water in a small cup\n- One small bean seed OR a 2-3 inch cutting from a fast-growing plant (sweet potato vine, coleus, or impatiens works well)\n- Small label and marker\n- Observation journal (paper or digital)\n- Optional: ruler to measure height\n- Tray to catch spills\n\n**Activity: \"Design Your Bottle Garden\"**\n\n**Step-by-step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Bottle:** \n   - If using whole bottles: Fill the bottom 2-3 inches with damp potting soil.\n   - If using cut bottles: Use the bottom half, fill with damp soil.\n\n2. **Plant Your Seed or Cutting:**\n   - Make a small hole in the soil with your finger.\n   - Place your seed or plant cutting gently into the soil.\n   - Pat soil around it lightly (not too tight—roots need air!).\n\n3. **Water Gently:**\n   - Pour a small amount of water until the soil feels damp like a wrung-out sponge.\n   - Do not make it soggy; do not leave standing water.\n\n4. **Label Your Bottle:**\n   - Write your name and today's date on the label.\n   - Stick it on your bottle.\n\n5. **Predict and Record:**\n   - Draw a picture of your bottle garden in your observation journal.\n   - Write or tell: \"I think my plant will grow because...\" (teacher scribe for non-writers).\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** \"Just like the plant in the picture is growing in water and getting light from the window, your bottle garden will get light and water. But we're testing: does your plant need both, or just one?\"\n\n**What Students Should Document:**\n- A labeled drawing of their bottle garden on Day 1.\n- One-sentence prediction about whether the plant will grow.\n- Date of planting.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask clarifying questions: \"Why did you use that much water?\" \"Where will you put your bottle so it gets light?\"\n- Help students write predictions if needed; accept drawings as documentation.\n- Do not tell students which conditions are \"best\"—let them discover through observation.\n- Ensure bottles are placed in a sunny window or under grow lights.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each student/pair has a planted bottle garden ready for observation.\n- Students have made a prediction and recorded it.\n- Students understand they are testing whether plants grow in this new \"habitat.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect observations to plant needs using the photograph and student work.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper labeled \"What Plants Need to Grow\"\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Student bottle gardens (visible during discussion)\n- Picture cards or drawings of: sunlight, water, soil (optional visual aids)\n\n**Activity: Group Share and Mini-Lesson**\n\n1. **Share Observations from Explore:**\n   - Ask: \"What did you do to help your plant? What did you give it?\"\n   - Record student responses on chart (e.g., \"water,\" \"dirt,\" \"a sunny spot\").\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary with Definitions:**\n\n   | **Vocabulary** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Growth** | Getting bigger and taller over time. |\n   | **Sunlight** | Light from the sun that helps plants make food and energy. |\n   | **Water** | A liquid that plants drink through their roots to stay healthy. |\n   | **Roots** | The parts of a plant underground (or under the soil) that drink water. |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where a plant or animal lives that has the things it needs. |\n\n3. **Revisit the Photograph:**\n   - Point to the green leaves: \"This plant's leaves are bright green because it gets sunlight. Can you see the window behind it?\"\n   - Point to the bottle: \"The water is in this bottle. The roots of the plant are below—in the water or in the soil. This is the plant's habitat.\"\n   - Point to the stem: \"This stem is green and healthy because the plant is getting everything it needs.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"What three things does our plant need to grow?\" (Sunlight, water, and soil/growing medium.)\n   - Ask: \"Why did we put our plant by the window?\" (To get sunlight.)\n   - Ask: \"Is the bottle in the picture a good habitat for a plant? Why or why not?\" (Yes, because it has water and light.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least two things plants need to grow.\n- Students understand that the photograph shows a plant in a special habitat (a bottle).\n- Students can predict what might happen if the plant didn't get one of these needs.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of plant needs to a new scenario and explore how recycling helps plant growth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper labeled \"Plants in Different Habitats\"\n- Picture cards or photographs of different plant habitats (rainforest, desert, garden, window sill, classroom corner, etc.)—5-6 images\n- Student bottle gardens (for reference)\n- Drawing paper and colored pencils\n\n**Activity: \"Where Else Can Plants Grow?\"**\n\n1. **Scenario Discussion (5 minutes):**\n   - Show images of plants in different habitats.\n   - Ask: \"Do all these plants look the same? Why do you think they look different? What do you think their habitats are giving them?\"\n   - Example: \"A desert plant doesn't get much water, so it looks different from a rainforest plant. But both are alive and growing!\"\n\n2. **Environmental Connection (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Why is it good that we used an old bottle instead of buying a new pot?\"\n   - Guide students to understand: \"Recycling old bottles means less trash and less new plastic. Plants can grow happily in recycled bottles!\"\n   - Chart responses on \"Ways Recycling Helps.\"\n\n3. **Creative Task (10 minutes):**\n   - Students draw their own \"creative plant home\" using recycled materials.\n   - Prompt: \"Draw a picture of a plant growing in something unexpected (a shoe, a tin can, a wooden box, etc.). What does the plant need to grow there?\"\n   - Students label their drawing with: plant, sunlight, water, soil.\n   - Optional: Students share their design with a partner and explain why the plant would be happy there.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide thinking with questions rather than answers.\n- Celebrate creative ideas.\n- Reinforce vocabulary (habitat, growth, sunlight, water).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students draw and explain a plant habitat.\n- Students recognize that plants need the same basics (sunlight, water, growing medium) even in different containers.\n- Students see the connection between recycling and helping the environment.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant needs and the ability to observe growth.\n\n**Activity: Multi-Part Assessment**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing, throughout lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Do they handle plants gently? Do they water appropriately (not too much)?\n- Listen during discussions: Can they name plant needs? Do they reference the photograph?\n- Review student drawings and predictions from Explore: Are observations recorded? Is there evidence of thinking?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (End of Day 2, after 3-5 days of observation)**\n\nProvide each student with a simple form or ask them to verbally respond to these questions:\n\n1. **Drawing Prompt:** \"Draw your bottle garden as it looks today. Show any changes you notice.\"\n\n2. **Observation Question:** \"What has changed about your plant since Day 1? Is it taller? Are the leaves bigger? Are the leaves still green?\" (Accept drawings, words, or both.)\n\n3. **Multiple Choice (read aloud):** \"Your plant is growing because:\n   - A) It gets water and sunlight.\n   - B) It's in a bottle.\n   - C) You talked to it.\n   - Answer: A ✓\n\n4. **Open-Ended (may be oral):** \"If you stopped watering your plant for two weeks, what do you think would happen? Why?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Student demonstrates understanding if they:**\n- Can draw and label observations showing plant growth.\n- Can name at least two things a plant needs to grow (water and sunlight).\n- Can explain why their bottle garden is a good home for their plant.\n- Can predict what would happen if a plant didn't get sunlight or water.\n- Show evidence of careful observation over multiple days.\n\n**How to Determine if Learning Objectives Were Met:**\n- **Objective 1 (Observe and describe needs):** Students correctly identify sunlight and water in discussions and drawings.\n- **Objective 2 (Plan and set up):** Student bottle gardens are planted correctly and cared for.\n- **Objective 3 (Record observations):** Observation journals show drawings and writing from Day 1 and Day 5+ with visible growth.\n- **Objective 4 (Explain recycling benefit):** Students articulate in their elaboration drawing or discussion that recycling helps the environment.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Sentence Stems for Predictions and Observations:**\n   - \"My plant needs _______________.\"\n   - \"I notice the leaves are now _______________.\"\n   - \"My plant is growing because _______________.\"\n   - Provide these on a card; students fill in the blanks with teacher support.\n\n2. **Simplified Observation Journal:**\n   - Provide a template with labeled drawings (leaf, stem, root) rather than asking for open-ended drawing.\n   - Student only needs to circle or color the parts that are growing.\n   - Teacher scribe for written responses.\n\n3. **Buddy System:**\n   - Pair struggling reader/writer with a strong communicator.\n   - Allow non-verbal documentation (pointing, sorting pictures, drawing).\n   - Read questions aloud; accept verbal responses.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Multi-Variable Investigation:**\n   - Challenge students to set up TWO bottle gardens: one in sunlight, one in shade.\n   - Predict which will grow faster and track measurements daily.\n   - Chart data and explain results: \"Why did the sunny plant grow more?\"\n\n2. **Deep Dive into Plant Parts:**\n   - Provide magnifying glasses; students sketch roots, stems, and leaf details.\n   - Research: \"Why do roots need water?\" / \"How do leaves use sunlight?\"\n   - Write a simple \"plant diary\" from the plant's perspective: \"Dear Journal, today the sun was very bright...\"\n\n3. **Habitat Designer Challenge:**\n   - Provide images of extreme habitats (arctic, deep cave, very hot desert).\n   - Ask: \"Could a plant survive here? What would you need to change?\" \n   - Design a special bottle garden that mimics one extreme habitat (include UV light, temperature control, etc.).\n   - Present to class with reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Sprouting Race (Days 6-10 of lesson):**\n   - Students plant seeds in the same bottle-garden setup.\n   - Track daily measurements of sprouting height.\n   - Create a bar graph comparing growth: bean vs. radish vs. herb seeds.\n   - Discuss: \"Why do different seeds grow at different speeds?\"\n\n2. **Classroom Plant Library:**\n   - Expand to create a classroom collection of bottle gardens with different plants (herbs, ivy, succulents, fast-growing beans).\n   - Students maintain a care chart, watering schedule, and rotation to sunny window.\n   - Invite other classes to observe and predict which plants will thrive.\n\n3. **Recycled Container Hunt (Homework/Home Connection):**\n   - Send students home with a challenge: \"Find three things at home that could become a plant habitat.\"\n   - Examples: milk carton, tin can, plastic cup, wooden box, shoe.\n   - Bring photos or items back to class.\n   - Create a \"Recycled Garden Wall\" in the classroom with bottle gardens in various recycled containers.\n   - Write labels: \"This plant lives in a milk carton!\" / \"This one lives in a shoe!\"\n\n---\n\n## Connections to 5E Model and NGSS\n\nThis lesson directly aligns with **2-LS2-1** by having students plan and conduct an investigation where they manipulate plant conditions (water, sunlight) and observe effects on growth over time. It addresses **2-LS4-1** through observation and comparison of plants in different habitats (bottle vs. outdoor garden, sunny vs. shady spaces). The photograph serves as a real-world model of plant growth, making abstract concepts concrete and engaging for Second Grade learners.",
