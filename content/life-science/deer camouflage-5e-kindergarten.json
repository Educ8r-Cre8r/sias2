ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about hidden animals and why they need to hide using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (color, 8.5\" × 11\" or larger for whole-group viewing)\n- Document camera or whiteboard to display image\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Show only the bottom half (the tan/golden grasses) for 10 seconds. Ask students to look carefully without talking.\n\n2. **Reveal the full image** (grasses and forest background). Tell students: *\"Hikers found animals hiding in this field. Can you find them?\"*\n\n3. **Ask discovery questions** (pause after each for responses):\n   - *\"Do you see any animals in this picture? Where are they hiding?\"*\n   - *\"Why do you think the animal is hard to see?\"*\n   - *\"If you were an animal, would you want to be easy to find or hard to find? Why?\"*\n   - *\"What color is the animal? What color is the grass? Are they the same?\"*\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** *\"I wonder... why would an animal want to wear colors that look like grass or dirt?\"* Jot student responses on chart paper without correcting—celebrate all ideas.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Let's play a game to discover why animals hide and how they do it!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate camouflage through hands-on matching and hiding activities.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small toy animals (plastic farm/zoo animals: deer, rabbits, squirrels—8–10 toys)\n- Colored paper or fabric scraps (brown, tan, green, white, bright colors)\n- Small boxes or containers (tissue boxes work well)\n- Construction paper in 2–3 colors (one that matches the animal toys, one that contrasts)\n- Markers\n- Tape or glue sticks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Hiding Hunt (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide the class into pairs or small groups of 3.**\n\n2. **Set up stations:**\n   - **Station 1 (Green):** Place green construction paper on a table. Hide a green toy animal (frog or turtle) on it.\n   - **Station 2 (Brown):** Place brown construction paper on a table. Hide a brown toy animal (deer or rabbit) on it.\n   - **Station 3 (Bright):** Place bright yellow or red paper on a table. Place a bright toy animal (yellow duck) on it in plain sight.\n\n3. **Send pairs to one station with the challenge:** *\"Look at your station. Can you find the animal hiding? What color is the animal? What color is the paper? Why is it hard (or easy) to see?\"*\n\n4. **Rotate groups through all stations.** Give 2–3 minutes per station.\n\n5. **Regroup and ask:** *\"Which animal was easiest to find? Which was hardest? Why?\"* Record observations on chart paper: *\"Animals that match their home are hard to see.\"*\n\n**Part B: Design a Hiding Place (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Give each student (or pair) a toy animal and one piece of colored construction paper** (brown, tan, or green).\n\n2. **Challenge:** *\"Your animal needs a home where it can hide. Using the paper and any scraps you want, make a place where your animal disappears. Draw on the paper to match your animal, or add things that look like bushes, trees, and grass.\"*\n\n3. **Circulate and ask:** *\"Where does your animal live? What colors are in that place? Does your animal match?\"*\n\n4. **Students draw or glue materials to \"hide\" their animal in a safe way.**\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Observe which students notice color matching.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"Does your animal stand out or hide?\"*\n- Do NOT tell students what to do—let them experiment with matching colors.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that animals matching their background are harder to see.\n- Students create a simple habitat where their toy animal is camouflaged or visible, showing understanding of the concept.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize the concept of camouflage and animal survival needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with student observations from Engage/Explore\n- The original photograph (large display)\n- Picture cards of 4–5 camouflaged animals (tiger in tall grass, tree frog on bark, Arctic hare in snow—simple images)\n- Whiteboard and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Return to the original photograph.** Point to where the deer is hidden. *\"Let's solve the mystery. Look carefully. Here is the deer!\"* (trace lightly around the outline).\n\n2. **Explain using simple language:**\n   - *\"The deer is brown. The grass is brown. The dirt is brown. The deer looks like the grass and dirt, so it's hard to see. That helps the deer stay safe!\"*\n\n3. **Introduce the word CAMOUFLAGE** (written on board, underlined):\n   - **Definition for K:** *\"Camouflage means hiding by looking like the place where you live. It's like wearing clothes that match what's around you.\"*\n\n4. **Show 3–4 picture cards of other camouflaged animals.** For each:\n   - Ask: *\"What color is the animal? What color is where it lives? Do they match?\"*\n   - Say: *\"This is camouflage. It helps the animal hide from danger and find food.\"*\n\n5. **Connect to survival:** *\"All animals need to stay safe. Some hide with camouflage. Some run fast. Some make noise. How does your animal stay safe?\"* (Accept all reasonable answers—tie back to camouflage focus of lesson.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Camouflage** | Hiding by looking like the place where you live. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives, like a forest, field, or pond. |\n| **Blend in** | To look the same color or pattern as something nearby so it's hard to see. |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and safe. |\n| **Adapt** | To change or fit perfectly for where you live. (Optional, more advanced) |\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Ask: *\"If a red fox moves to snow, will it hide well? Why not?\"*\n- Show a picture of a tiger. Ask: *\"Does the tiger camouflage in grass or in a red barn?\"*\n- Ask 2–3 volunteers: *\"Tell me one animal and one place where it hides.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word \"camouflage\" or \"blend in\" to describe what they observed.\n- Students can point to an animal in a picture and explain it matches its home.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply camouflage understanding to a new scenario and think about real-world animal safety.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture of a different habitat (forest scene, snowy field, sandy beach—one large image for whole group)\n- Animal picture cards (laminated, 2–3 copies of each: robin, white rabbit, seal, camel, lion, frog)\n- Tape (removable)\n- Chart paper titled \"Which Animals Belong Here?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Show a NEW habitat photo** (different from the original—e.g., a snowy forest or sandy desert).\n\n2. **Display animal picture cards** (5–8 animals, including some that camouflage in this habitat and some that don't).\n\n3. **Challenge the class:** *\"Here's a different place. Which animals can hide here with camouflage? Let's decide together.\"*\n\n4. **For each animal, ask:**\n   - *\"Does this animal match this place?\"*\n   - *\"Would it be safe here, or would enemies see it?\"*\n   - *\"Where does this animal really live?\"*\n\n5. **Place camouflaged animals in the picture; animals that don't match go in a \"different home\" pile.**\n\n6. **Extend thinking:** *\"If a brown rabbit moved to snow, could it camouflage? Why not? What would happen?\"* (Lead to: It would be seen, so it wouldn't be safe.)\n\n**Real-World Connection:** *\"When people change where animals live or take away their forests and grasslands, animals can't hide anymore. That's why we need to protect animal homes!\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide with questions, not answers: *\"Does white match green?\"*\n- Celebrate reasoning: *\"You're thinking like a scientist!\"*\n- Record student logic on chart paper.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students match 3–4 animals correctly to habitats where they camouflage.\n- Students explain a simple reason: *\"The deer is brown, and the forest is brown.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students can observe, describe, and apply camouflage concepts.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation notes** during Explore and Elaborate: Did students notice color matching? Did they use vocabulary?\n- **Listen during discussions:** Can students explain why animals hide?\n- **Review student creations from Explore Part B:** Does the student's camouflaged animal show evidence of color/pattern matching?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (Choose ONE):**\n\n**Option A: Picture Sort (Visual)**\n- Show 3 simple pictures: (1) an animal matching its habitat, (2) an animal contrasting with its habitat, (3) an animal in a neutral setting.\n- Ask: *\"Which animal can hide? Point to it and tell me why.\"*\n- Success: Student points to the matching animal and gives a simple reason (*\"It's brown like the dirt\"* or *\"It blends in\"*).\n\n**Option B: One-on-One Interview**\n- Show a picture of a camouflaged animal (e.g., a toad on soil).\n- Ask three questions:\n  1. *\"What animal is this?\"*\n  2. *\"Can you see it easily?\"* (Yes/No)\n  3. *\"Why is it hard to see?\"* or *\"How does it hide?\"*\n- Success: Student identifies the animal, correctly answers it's hard to see, and gives ANY reason related to color or blending (e.g., *\"Same color\"* or *\"Looks like dirt\"*).\n\n**Option C: Quick Sketch**\n- Give each student a blank paper divided into two boxes.\n- **Box 1:** *\"Draw an animal where it can hide (camouflage).\"*\n- **Box 2:** *\"Draw the same animal where it CANNOT hide.\"*\n- Success: Student's drawing shows color matching or contrast; colors/patterns are intentionally different between boxes.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Meets expectation:** Student can identify a camouflaged animal and explain that it matches its home in simple terms (*\"The color is the same\"*).\n- **Approaching:** Student identifies an animal but needs prompting to explain; uses limited vocabulary.\n- **Below:** Student cannot yet identify color matching or explain hiding strategy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can point to or describe one example of camouflage.\n- 60% of students can explain in simple words why an animal's color helps it hide.\n- All students have engaged with the concept through hands-on and visual activities.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified picture sort:** Use only 2 pictures (one camouflaged animal, one very obviously visible animal in wrong habitat). Ask: *\"Which one hides? Which one doesn't?\"* Reduce vocabulary demands—accept *\"same color\"* or *\"hide\"* instead of *\"camouflage.\"*\n\n2. **Buddy system during Explore:** Pair with a strong observer. Ask the buddy to describe what they see before the student responds, modeling language.\n\n3. **Repeat Explore Station with ONE animal:** If students struggle with multiple stations, repeat the hiding hunt with just one animal and one color match. Build confidence before moving to contrast.\n\n4. **Tactile materials:** Some students may understand better by TOUCHING tan paper next to a brown toy, feeling they are similar. Emphasize sensory matching, not just visual.\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Three-habitat challenge:** Show three different habitats (forest, snow, sand). Ask: *\"Which animals camouflage in MORE than one place? Why?\"* (E.g., rabbits change color seasonally. A white hare hides in snow AND when there's frost on grass.) Introduce the idea that some animals change with seasons.\n\n2. **Design a new animal:** *\"Invent an animal that lives in [a specific habitat]. What colors should it be to hide? Draw it.\"* Ask them to explain their design choices.\n\n3. **Predator-prey game:** Play a simple game where \"predators\" (students) look for \"prey\" (peers wearing matching vs. contrasting colored vests/scarves). Count how many they \"catch\" in 30 seconds. Graph results. *\"Why did we catch fewer animals wearing camouflage colors?\"*\n\n4. **Research extension:** Show pictures of 4–5 animals (chameleon, snow owl, tree frog, armadillo) and ask: *\"How do these animals camouflage? Can you guess where they live?\"* Extend to learned or inferred habitat knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Camouflage Nature Walk:** Take students outdoors to a garden, field, or park area. Slowly walk and search for animals using camouflage (insects on bark, birds in trees, worms in soil—use magnifying glasses). Take digital photos or make quick sketches. Return to class and discuss: *\"What colors helped these animals hide?\"* Create a class book: *\"Camouflage Hunters: Animals We Found.\"*\n\n2. **Camouflage Dress-Up Game:** Bring in colored clothing/scarves (brown, green, white, red, yellow). Set up different habitat areas in the classroom (green sheet = forest, white = snow, brown = dirt, classroom rug = \"regular place\"). Students wear items and stand in habitats. Class guesses if they're camouflaged or visible. Discuss why. Optional: Play hide-and-seek; camouflaged player hides, visible player hides. Which is easier to find?\n\n3. **Paint or Crayon a Camouflaged Animal:** Give students a pre-drawn habitat outline (tree, grass, snow) and a simple animal outline. Students color both so the animal blends in. Title: *\"I Can Camouflage!\"* Display in hallway with labels explaining their habitat choices.\n\n4. **Read-Aloud and Response:** Share a Kindergarten-friendly picture book about animal camouflage (e.g., *Camouflage* by Mary Riskind or *Who Hides in the Wild?* by Marianne Berkes). After reading, ask: *\"Which animal's camouflage surprised you? Why?\"* Have students draw their favorite camouflaged animal.\n\n5. **Family Assignment:** Send home a simple worksheet: *\"Find Camouflage at Home. Look for something that hides because it matches. Draw or take a photo. Tell why it hides.\"* (E.g., a brown toy in a toy pile, a pet blending with the carpet.) Share next class.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Kindergarten attention span:** Keep verbal explanations under 2 minutes. Use the photograph frequently as a visual anchor—return to it often.\n- **Language accessibility:** Use simple, repetitive sentence structures. *\"The deer is brown. The grass is brown. The deer hides.\"*\n- **Safety:** During Explore stations, ensure small toy animals are age-appropriate (no choking hazards). Supervise closely.\n- **Flexibility:** This lesson can be extended across multiple days if students need more processing time. Explore and Elaborate can be split into separate sessions.\n- **Cross-curricular tie:** This lesson connects to ELA (descriptive language, \"How and Why\" questions) and art (color mixing, drawing animals). Consider combining with a short writing activity: *\"My animal hides because...\"*",
