The bird is called a grackle, and it has glossy black feathers that shine with hints of blue and purple in the light. You can see its bright yellow eye and long black beak. The grackle is searching through the grass, looking for insects and seeds to eat.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates foraging behavior and adaptation to urban environments. Grackles are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Their strong, pointed beaks are perfect for probing into soil and grass to find food. Grackles have learned to live successfully near humans, finding food in lawns, parks, and parking lots.
