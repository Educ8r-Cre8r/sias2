Identify and describe how the screech owl's physical features (feathers, eyes, ear tufts) are adaptations that help it survive.\n2. Explain how camouflage helps an animal hide from both predators and prey.\n3. Predict where a screech owl might live based on its appearance and describe why that habitat matches the owl's adaptations.\n4. Model how energy moves from plants → small animals → owls in a food chain.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of a screech owl.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of screech owl (displayed on projector, whiteboard, or printed copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording predictions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph silently** for 30 seconds without any introduction. Ask students to simply observe.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What animal is it?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this owl looks gray and brown with patterns instead of being bright red or yellow?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this owl lives, and why?\"\n   - \"If you were a mouse, would you see this owl easily? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Activation prompt:** \"Look at the owl's position on the light-colored wall. What do you notice about how it matches or blends in? Turn and talk to your neighbor about what you think—is this hiding a good thing for an owl, and why?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper: \"Why does this owl look the way it does?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become detectives and discover the hidden reasons why owls look and act the way they do—and how those features help them survive.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate camouflage and adaptation through hands-on simulation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed \"prey cards\" (small paper squares: 10 white, 10 brown, 10 tan, 10 patterned/speckled) per group\n- Brown or tan poster board or fabric for each group (representing \"tree bark\")\n- Stopwatch or timer\n- Clipboard or paper for recording observations\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Camouflage Investigation (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up in small groups (3–4 students).** Give each group a piece of brown/tan poster board and a bag of mixed \"prey cards.\"\n\n2. **Explain the scenario:** \"You're going to pretend your poster board is tree bark. Scatter all your prey cards on it and see how many seconds it takes someone to spot and pick up each color. This will help us understand why the owl's colors matter.\"\n\n3. **Student steps:**\n   - Scatter all 40 prey cards on the poster board.\n   - Have one student act as the \"owl\" (predator) and try to pick up as many prey as possible in 15 seconds with their eyes open.\n   - Count and record how many of each color were caught.\n   - Switch roles so everyone gets a turn.\n   - Record data in a simple table:\n     | Color | Number Caught |\n     |-------|---|\n     | White | ___ |\n     | Brown | ___ |\n     | Tan | ___ |\n     | Patterned | ___ |\n\n4. **Discuss findings:** \"Which colors were hardest to see? Which were easiest? Why?\"\n\n**Part 2: Connection to the Owl (5 minutes)**\n\n5. **Show the owl photograph again.** Ask: \"The owl in our picture is mostly gray and brown with speckled patterns. Based on what you just learned, why is this the perfect color for a screech owl?\"\n\n6. **Record:** Students sketch the owl and label why its color is an adaptation: \"The owl's feathers are _____ and _____ like tree bark, so predators can't see it easily.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate among groups to ensure fair testing.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Why do you think the patterned ones were harder to catch?\" \n- Do NOT tell students what to think—let them discover through the activity.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \nStudents will discover that colors matching the environment (brown, tan, speckled) are harder to see and catch. They'll make the connection that the owl's coloring is a protective adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and tie exploration to life science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of screech owl (displayed)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms\n- Images of owl habitats (tree bark, rocks, forest floor—can be printed or shown on screen)\n- Student science notebooks or handout\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2–3 groups to share their findings: \"Which colors were easiest/hardest to catch? Why?\"\n   - Record common patterns: \"Brown and speckled colors are harder to see on bark.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   \n   **Adaptation**\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. Adaptations are passed down from parents to babies.\n   - *Connect to photo:* \"The owl's gray and brown feathers are an adaptation. They help it hide.\"\n\n   **Camouflage**\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* When an animal's color, pattern, or shape matches its surroundings so predators or prey can't see it easily.\n   - *Connect to photo:* \"The owl's feathers use camouflage. It blends in with tree bark and rocks.\"\n\n   **Predator**\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* An animal that hunts and eats other animals.\n   - *Connect to photo:* \"The screech owl is a predator. It hunts small animals like mice and insects.\"\n\n   **Prey**\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* An animal that is hunted and eaten by a predator.\n   - *Connect to photo:* \"Mice and insects are the owl's prey.\"\n\n   **Habitat**\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* The place where an animal lives, including the food, water, and shelter it needs.\n   - *Connect to photo:* \"The screech owl lives in habitats with trees, rocks, and brush where its feathers blend in.\"\n\n3. **Check for understanding (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Show me with your thumb: Do you understand what camouflage is?\" (Thumbs up, sideways, down)\n   - Ask 2–3 students to explain adaptation in their own words.\n   - Quick-write: \"Why is camouflage an adaptation that helps the screech owl?\" (Students write 1–2 sentences in their notebooks.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---|\n| **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. |\n| **Camouflage** | When an animal's color or pattern matches its surroundings so it's hard to see. |\n| **Predator** | An animal that hunts and eats other animals. |\n| **Prey** | An animal that is hunted and eaten by a predator. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \nStudents can define and apply camouflage, adaptation, and habitat. They understand that the owl's gray-brown feathers are an adaptation for camouflage in its forest/rocky habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to model energy movement through a food chain.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large index cards or card stock (1 per student)\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- String or yarn (optional, for arranging chains)\n- Images of: grass/plants, insects, mice, screech owl (printed or drawn)\n- Whiteboard or chart paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the food chain concept (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Now we know the owl is a predator. But where does the owl's energy come from? Let's trace it backward.\"\n   - Display simple sequence: **Plant → Insect → Owl** or **Plant → Mouse → Owl**\n\n2. **Model an owl food chain (5 minutes):**\n   - Show images of: grass → grasshopper → field mouse → screech owl\n   - Explain: \"Energy starts with the sun and plants. Plants make their own food. Insects eat plants. Mice eat insects. The owl eats the mouse. Energy moves down the chain!\"\n   - Model NGSS 5-LS2-1 by showing matter (energy, nutrients) moving through the chain.\n\n3. **Student activity: Create a food chain card (7 minutes)**\n   - Give each student an index card and 4 images (or have them draw):\n     - A plant (grass or shrub)\n     - An insect (cricket, moth)\n     - A small animal (mouse, vole)\n     - A screech owl\n   - Students arrange and glue cards in order: **Plant → Insect → Small Animal → Owl**\n   - Under each organism, students label: \"Makes its own food\" OR \"Eats _____\"\n\n4. **Arrange all food chains on the wall in sequence** to show how energy moves. Optional: use string to connect organisms.\n\n5. **Debrief question:** \"What would happen to the owl if there were no insects or mice in the forest? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Model the first food chain so students understand the direction of energy flow.\n- Clarify: \"Energy goes from plants up to animals—the sun provides the energy that plants use.\"\n- Circulate to ensure each student has a correctly sequenced chain.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \nStudents create a visual model showing energy/matter movement from plants through animals to the owl, demonstrating understanding of food chains (5-LS2-1).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of adaptations, camouflage, and food chains.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Are students correctly identifying which colors are harder to see? Do they understand why?\n- **Vocabulary check-in (Explain phase):** Thumb check and quick-write responses.\n- **Food chain accuracy (Elaborate phase):** Do cards show correct energy direction?\n\n**Summative Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with this exit ticket:\n\n---\n\n**Screech Owl Adaptation Exit Ticket**\n\n**Name: __________________ Date: __________________**\n\n**1. Look at the screech owl picture. Name TWO adaptations (body parts) that help this owl survive.**\n   - Adaptation 1: _____________________\n   - Adaptation 2: _____________________\n\n**2. Explain why the owl's gray and brown feathers are helpful. Use the word \"camouflage\" in your answer.**\n   - ____________________________________________________________________________\n   - ____________________________________________________________________________\n\n**3. Draw a simple food chain with the screech owl at the end. Include at least two other living things.**\n   \n   [Space for drawing]\n\n**4. True or False: A screech owl is prey for small mice.** (Circle one.)\n   - Explain your answer: ___________________________________________________________\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies 2+ accurate adaptations (feathers, eyes, ear tufts, talons, nocturnal behavior).\n- ✓ Explanation includes the word \"camouflage\" and describes how the owl blends with its environment.\n- ✓ Food chain shows correct energy direction (plant/food → owl).\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies owl as predator, not prey.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \nMost students will demonstrate understanding of camouflage and adaptation. Food chains may vary in complexity, but should show correct direction of energy. Use responses to identify students needing reteaching of food chains.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Provide a vocabulary anchor chart** with pictures and definitions posted during the lesson. Allow students to reference it during all activities and assessments.\n\n2. **Pre-draw the food chain template** with boxes labeled \"Plant,\" \"Insect,\" \"Small Animal,\" \"Owl.\" Students only need to draw or paste images; the structure is provided.\n\n3. **Partner for Explore activity:** Pair students with stronger readers/observers so they can focus on recording and discussing findings rather than managing materials.\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Provide multiple-choice options or sentence starters:\n   - \"The owl's feathers help it hide because _____.\"\n   - \"The owl eats _____, so it is a _____.\" (predator/prey)\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extend the food chain:** Ask students to create a **food web** showing multiple pathways (e.g., owl eats insects AND mice; mice eat grass AND seeds). Challenge them to predict what happens if one organism disappears.\n\n2. **Research other adaptations:** Have students investigate how screech owls' large eyes, silent flight, or night hunting are also important adaptations. Create a detailed comparison poster: \"Screech Owl Adaptations.\"\n\n3. **Camouflage variation exploration:** Provide images of screech owls in different habitats (rocky cliffs, forest, cactus). Ask: \"Why might owls in different regions have slightly different colors?\" (Regional adaptation/natural selection).\n\n4. **Apply to other animals:** Challenge students to identify camouflage or adaptations in other animals (deer, rabbits, insects) and explain how they function similarly to the owl's coloring.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Owl Observation Field Journal:**\n   - If possible, arrange an evening outdoor time or field trip to listen for owl calls (or show recordings of screech owl vocalizations).\n   - Have students create a field journal entry: \"What I observed about where owls live and what I heard.\"\n   - Connect: Owl calls are also **behavioral adaptations** for territory and mating.\n\n2. **Design a New Animal for a New Habitat:**\n   - Show students an unfamiliar habitat (rainforest floor, desert, tundra).\n   - Challenge: \"Design an animal that would be camouflaged in this habitat. Draw it and explain what color, patterns, or body parts it would have and why.\"\n   - Reinforces that adaptations are matched to specific environments.\n\n3. **Screech Owl Life Cycle & Role in the Ecosystem:**\n   - Create a poster or diagram showing: Screech owl eggs → chicks → adult → hunts prey → competes with other predators.\n   - Research: \"How many baby owls does a screech owl have? How long until they can hunt on their own?\"\n   - Connect to life cycles and population dynamics (foundational for later ecology study).\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Real-world connection:** Many students may be curious about keeping owls as pets. Use this as a teachable moment: \"Owls are wild animals adapted to specific habitats. They need live prey, lots of space, and special care—which is why they belong in nature, not homes.\"\n\n- **Safety note for Explore:** Ensure all \"prey cards\" are made of paper (no small choking hazards for younger fifth graders). Supervise handling of materials.\n\n- **Accessibility:** Have the photograph available in multiple formats (printed, digital, large-print) for students with visual needs.\n\n- **Vocabulary in context:** Use the terms consistently throughout the lesson so students hear them repeated in authentic contexts, not just as definitions.\n\n- **Assessment flexibility:** If students struggle with the exit ticket, use it as a springboard for individual conferences rather than a final grade—use observations throughout the lesson to gauge understanding.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson scaffolds from observable features in the photograph → hands-on discovery of why those features matter → formal vocabulary and concepts → real-world application through food chains → assessment of learning.",
