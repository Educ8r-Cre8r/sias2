  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Grasshopper Survival Needs\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n• **Animals have basic survival needs** – Grasshoppers need plants (food), air, and safe places to live\n• **Animals have body parts that help them survive** – Legs for jumping/climbing, antennae for sensing, strong jaws for eating plants\n• **Animals live in habitats where their needs are met** – Grasshoppers live on plants and grasses where they find food and shelter\n• **Observing animals helps us learn what they need** – Close observation of a grasshopper on a leaf shows us where and how it lives\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\nWhat Does a Grasshopper Need to Stay Alive?\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 30-minute sessions (or three 20-minute sessions spread across a week)\n- **NGSS Standards:** K-LS1-1: Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Observe and name at least 3 body parts of a grasshopper\n- Describe what a grasshopper needs to survive (food, water, shelter, air)\n- Explain where grasshoppers live and why they live there\n- Make a simple drawing or model showing a grasshopper in its habitat with its survival needs labeled\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the grasshopper.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the grasshopper on the leaf (enlarged to at least 8.5\" x 11\" or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Ask students to sit in a circle or carpet area for whole-group discussion.\n\n2. **Show and ask:** \"Boys and girls, look at this picture very carefully. What do you see? What animal is this?\" (Pause for responses. Guide them toward \"grasshopper\" or \"jumping bug.\")\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"Why do you think this grasshopper is sitting on this green leaf?\" (Accept all answers; guide toward: it's eating, it likes green plants, it lives there)\n   - \"What do you see on the grasshopper's head?\" (Antennae—long feelers)\n   - \"How many legs do you think the grasshopper has? Can you count them in the picture?\"\n   - \"If you were a grasshopper, what would YOU need to stay alive? What would make you happy?\" (Food, water, a place to rest, etc.)\n\n4. **Make predictions:** \"I wonder... what does this grasshopper eat? Where does it sleep? Does it need air to breathe like we do?\" Write student wonderings on chart paper—this becomes your \"Wonder Wall.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become grasshopper detectives! We'll look very carefully at grasshoppers and figure out exactly what they need to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what grasshoppers need by observing pictures, videos, or live insects, and discovering connections between body parts and survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Option A (safest for K):** Multiple printed photographs or a video of grasshoppers in different settings (on grass, on leaves, jumping)\n- **Option B (if live grasshoppers available):** 1-2 grasshoppers in clear containers with grass and a damp cotton ball, magnifying glasses (1 per pair or small group), observation clipboards\n- Chart paper divided into 4 sections labeled: \"Head/Antennae,\" \"Legs,\" \"Food,\" \"Home\"\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Large paper for group observation poster\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions (teacher reads aloud or uses picture cards):**\n\n1. \"We are going to be grasshopper scientists. You will look very carefully at the grasshopper and notice things about it.\"\n\n2. **If using photographs/video:**\n   - Show 3-4 different images: grasshopper on leaf, on grass, jumping, close-up of head\n   - Ask: \"What do you notice the grasshopper is doing? What part of its body is it using?\"\n   \n3. **If using live grasshoppers:**\n   - In small groups, students take turns looking at the grasshopper through a magnifying glass for 30-45 seconds\n   - Teacher or aide guides: \"Look at the antennae (long feelers on top). Look at the legs. What is it eating?\"\n\n4. **Class discussion:** Point to the grasshopper/photograph and ask students to name what they see:\n   - \"Show me with your finger: Where is the mouth? The legs? The antennae?\"\n   - \"What is this grasshopper using right now?\" (Mouth to eat the leaf, legs to stand/climb)\n\n5. **Record observations:** As students call out observations, teacher records them on the four-section chart paper:\n   - Head/Antennae: \"Feelers to find food,\" \"Eyes to see\"\n   - Legs: \"Jump away from danger,\" \"Climb on plants\"\n   - Food: \"Eats green leaves and grass\"\n   - Home: \"Lives on plants where it can find food\"\n\n6. **Students draw:** Each student receives a sheet of paper and draws a grasshopper on a leaf, using the photograph as a reference. They can label or color what the grasshopper eats.\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate, ask guiding questions (\"What is your grasshopper eating?\" \"Where does it live?\"), and avoid telling answers—instead, redirect: \"Look closely—what do you see?\" Encourage all students to participate in observation, not just high-skill drawers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify at least 2-3 visible grasshopper body parts\n- Students produce drawings showing a grasshopper with a food source (leaf/grass)\n- Students verbally connect body parts to survival functions (\"Legs help it jump away,\" \"Mouth helps it eat\")\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration. Connect student observations to survival needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with observations from Explore phase\n- Picture cards or word cards: antennae, legs, food, habitat, survive\n- Simple poster or picture book showing grasshopper habitats\n- Whiteboard and markers (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather the class and review the observation chart together. Celebrate observations: \"You were such great scientists! You noticed...\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (teacher explains using the photograph and student observations):\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Antennae:** Special feelers on an insect's head that help it sense (feel and smell) food and danger. \"See these long feelers? The grasshopper uses them like your nose—to find yummy plants!\"\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs. \"A grasshopper's habitat is grassy fields and gardens where there are lots of plants.\"\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy. \"Grasshoppers survive when they have food, water, and a safe place to live.\"\n   - **Legs:** Body parts insects use to walk, climb, and jump. \"A grasshopper has six legs—four to walk with and two big back legs to JUMP!\"\n   - **Food chain (simple):** Grasshoppers eat plants; some birds eat grasshoppers. (Simple concept for K: \"The grasshopper eats the plant. Some animals eat the grasshopper.\")\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Remember that photo? The grasshopper is sitting on a green leaf. That's part of its habitat. The leaf is its food. The plant helps it survive!\"\n   - Point to antennae in photo: \"These feelers help the grasshopper find more leaves to eat.\"\n   - Point to legs: \"These powerful legs help it jump to another plant if danger comes.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding** (use think-pair-share or turn-and-talk):\n   - \"Turn to your partner: What does a grasshopper eat?\" (Plants/leaves)\n   - \"Why do grasshoppers live on plants?\" (That's where their food is)\n   - \"What is one body part the grasshopper uses to survive?\" (Accept any: antennae to find food, legs to jump, mouth to eat)\n\n5. **Create a class poster:** On a large piece of paper, draw or paste a picture of a grasshopper in its habitat. Label: antennae, legs, leaf (food), grass (home). Post in the classroom.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use new vocabulary in simple sentences\n- Students understand that grasshoppers need plants (food) and a place to live (habitat)\n- Students recognize that body parts help animals survive\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by exploring what OTHER animals need to survive and comparing survival needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of 3-4 different animals: bird, rabbit, butterfly, ladybug (printed or from a book)\n- Chart paper: \"What Do Different Animals Need?\"\n- Student worksheets (simple 1-page with 3-4 animals and yes/no checkboxes for: \"Needs Plants?\" \"Needs Water?\" \"Lives Outside?\" \"Has Legs?\")\n- Crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Compare animals:** Show picture cards of other insects or small animals (butterfly, ladybug, bee, ant) or other animals (bird, rabbit, squirrel).\n\n2. **Ask:** \"Does this butterfly need food like the grasshopper does? Does it need a home? Where does it live?\"\n\n3. **Create a simple comparison chart:**\n   - List animal names down the left side\n   - Columns: \"Eats Plants?\" \"Has Legs?\" \"Lives in Habitat?\" \"Needs Air?\"\n   - As a class, check yes or no for each animal\n   - Guide discovery: \"All animals need food, water, air, and a safe place to live. Different animals just have different habitats!\"\n\n4. **Student activity:** Give each student a simple worksheet showing 3-4 animals with checkboxes. Students predict or mark which animals need certain survival items. Go over together.\n\n5. **Extension question:** \"What do YOU need to survive? Food? Water? A home? Air to breathe? Just like grasshoppers!\" (Brief connection to human needs—keeps it relatable.)\n\n**Teacher Role:** Ask questions that guide comparison (\"How is the butterfly like the grasshopper?\" \"How is it different?\"). Validate all observations and help students see patterns.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that multiple animals share similar survival needs\n- Students begin to generalize: \"All animals need food and a home\"\n- Students can name at least 2 survival needs\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of grasshopper survival needs and basic animal needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (used throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student drawings and listen to explanations during Explore phase (\"Tell me about your grasshopper\")\n- Use turn-and-talk responses during Explain phase\n- Note which students use new vocabulary correctly\n\n**Exit ticket/Summative assessment** (choose one based on your class):\n\n**Option A (Drawing + Dictation - best for K):**\n- Show students the original grasshopper photo one more time\n- Ask: \"Draw a picture of what a grasshopper needs to stay alive\"\n- Teacher or aide sits with each student and asks: \"What did you draw? Why does the grasshopper need that?\"\n- Teacher records student's one-sentence explanation (student dictates)\n- **Example:** Student draws grasshopper on leaf; says: \"The grasshopper needs to eat the leaf to stay alive\"\n\n**Option B (Oral Response - quickest):**\n- Ask individual students these questions (in small group or 1-on-1):\n  1. \"What does a grasshopper eat?\" (Answer: Plants, leaves, grass)\n  2. \"Where does a grasshopper live?\" (Answer: On plants/in grass/in the garden)\n  3. \"Name one body part of a grasshopper and tell me what it does.\" (Answer: Legs for jumping, mouth for eating, antennae for sensing)\n\n**Option C (Simple Checklist - for whole class):**\nAsk students to stand or raise hand if they can do the following:\n- ☐ Point to a grasshopper's legs, head, and antennae in a picture\n- ☐ Say one thing a grasshopper needs to survive\n- ☐ Tell me where grasshoppers live\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students can identify at least 2 survival needs of grasshoppers (food and shelter/habitat)\n- Students can name or point to at least 2 body parts of a grasshopper\n- Students can explain in simple words why the grasshopper is on the leaf (to eat it/to find food)\n- Students use vocabulary (antennae, legs, habitat, survive) in context with at least 50% accuracy\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify grasshoppers need food and a place to live\n- Most students can name 2+ grasshopper body parts\n- Students show understanding through drawings, oral responses, or both\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners or ESL students):**\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary with picture cards** during small-group time before the lesson. Point to real pictures and say the word multiple times (antennae, legs, habitat). Have students repeat.\n\n2. **Provide hand-over-hand guidance during live observation.** If using live grasshoppers, sit with the student and gently point: \"Look here—these are the antennae. Feel the texture—rough or smooth?\" Make it multisensory.\n\n3. **Simplify drawing expectations.** Some students may only circle or color the grasshopper instead of drawing it. Accept this. The goal is observation and vocabulary use, not artistic skill. Provide a pre-drawn grasshopper outline and ask: \"Can you color what the grasshopper eats?\"\n\n4. **Use matching activities.** Create a simple card game: grasshopper picture + habitat picture. Student matches them and says, \"The grasshopper lives here.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Expand the habitat investigation.** Ask: \"What other animals live in a grasshopper's habitat? What eats the grasshopper?\" Introduce the concept of a simple food chain: grass → grasshopper → bird. Draw or create a visual with pictures.\n\n2. **Compare multiple insects.** Provide pictures of grasshopper, cricket, locust, and dragonfly. Ask: \"How are these insects the same? How are they different? Do they all need the same things to survive?\" Create a detailed comparison chart.\n\n3. **Predict and plan.** Ask: \"If we wanted to make a grasshopper habitat in our classroom, what would we need to put in it?\" Students brainstorm and sketch their design, labeling food, water, shelter, and air.\n\n4. **Research and present.** Have advanced students find pictures or videos of grasshoppers in different habitats (desert, meadow, rainforest). Discuss: \"Do grasshoppers in different places have the same needs? Why or why not?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Build a Grasshopper Habitat (art + science):**\n   - Provide students with a clear plastic cup or small container, soil, grass or plant clippings, and sticks\n   - Students create a simple grasshopper habitat. Include a label for food, water, and shelter\n   - If live grasshoppers are available and appropriate, place one in the habitat and observe for a day or two (ethically—ensure proper care and release)\n   - Students draw before/after pictures and describe what the grasshopper is doing in its new home\n\n2. **Grasshopper Movement Game:**\n   - Take students outside or to the gym. Play \"Grasshoppers and Hawks\"\n   - Students are grasshoppers; they hop and jump (like grasshoppers use their legs to escape danger)\n   - When the teacher calls \"Hawk!\" students crouch down (hide in habitat)\n   - Discuss after: \"Why did we jump? Why did we hide? Grasshoppers do this to survive!\"\n\n3. **All Animals Need… Picture Sort:**\n   - Create or gather pictures of 8-10 different animals (cat, fish, bird, bee, squirrel, ladybug, cow, butterfly, etc.)\n   - Make cards with survival needs: FOOD, WATER, AIR, SHELTER, LIGHT\n   - Students sort or match: Which animals need food? Which need shelter?\n   - Create a class anchor chart: \"All Animals Need...\" with pictures grouped by need\n   - Extended discussion: \"Do all animals need the same things? Why is that?\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Reflection Note:**\nThis lesson uses the grasshopper photo as a springboard to help kindergarteners observe living things closely and connect body parts to survival. The concrete observation of the photograph and—if possible—a live grasshopper makes the abstract concept of \"survival needs\" tangible and memorable for 5- and 6-year-olds. Repeated use of the photograph during each phase anchors learning and builds vocabulary naturally.",
