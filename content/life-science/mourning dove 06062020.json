Both birds have soft tan and gray feathers with subtle patterns and spots on their wings. One dove is slightly larger - this might be the male. You can see their small heads, dark eyes, and pointed tails. The doves are resting close together in what appears to be someone's backyard. Their colors blend beautifully with the green and brown surroundings.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image likely shows a mated pair of Mourning Doves engaging in pair bonding behavior. Mourning Doves are monogamous - they choose one mate and stay together, sometimes for life! The male and female work as a team: the male gathers twigs and materials, the female builds the nest, both parents take turns sitting on eggs, and both feed the babies \"crop milk\" (a special nutritious liquid they produce).
