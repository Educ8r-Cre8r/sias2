Identify and describe external body structures of animals visible in the photograph and explain how each structure helps the animal survive and meet its needs.\n\n2. Support an argument with evidence that an animal's body structures are connected to how it interacts with its environment and obtains matter (food, water) for energy and growth.\n\n3. Develop a simple model showing how matter (nutrients, seeds, water) moves between an animal and its environment through the animal's life processes.\n\n4. Compare their own body structures to those of the pigeon and explain how different structures reflect different survival needs and environmental roles.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by examining the photograph closely and activating prior knowledge about animal body structures.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed copy of the pigeon photograph (one per student or visible to all)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Magnifying glasses (optional, for closer inspection of printed photos)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Ask students to observe silently for 1-2 minutes, taking in details without talking.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about this bird's body? What parts do you see, and why might each part be important?\"\n   - \"If you were designing an animal to live on city streets like this pigeon, what body parts would it need? Why?\"\n   - \"Look at the bird's feet, beak, and wings. How might each of these help the bird find food, stay safe, or move around?\"\n   - \"Where does this bird get the materials it needs to live? Where does water come from? Where does food come from?\"\n\n3. **Record student predictions and wonderings** on chart paper. Accept all responses without judgment; this is their baseline thinking.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder how this bird's body parts are connected to what it eats and where it lives. Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to become animal structure detectives. You'll examine real animal body parts and models to discover how animals use their bodies to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate animal body structures hands-on and discover how structures support survival and feeding behaviors.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Station 1:** Printed close-up images of: pigeon beak, pigeon feet, pigeon feathers, pigeon eye (provide 8.5\" x 11\" color printouts)\n- **Station 2:** Real or replica animal skulls, beaks, or feet (chicken bone, bird skull if available from science supply, or high-quality images as backup)\n- **Station 3:** Observation cards with statements like \"This bird eats seeds and grain from the ground\" or \"This bird perches on wires and ledges\" or \"This bird flies to escape danger\"\n- **Magnifying glasses (at least 4)**\n- **Student observation sheets** (one per student) with sections:\n  - *Structure I observed:* [blank]\n  - *What it looks like:* [blank lines]\n  - *What it might do:* [blank lines]\n  - *How it helps the bird survive:* [blank lines]\n- **Colored pencils or markers**\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide students into small groups** (3-4 students per group). Rotate groups through three observation stations over 15 minutes (5 minutes per station).\n\n2. **At each station, students:**\n   - Examine the body structures closely using magnifying glasses\n   - Match observation cards to the structures (e.g., \"This is a strong beak for cracking hard seeds\")\n   - Sketch or describe what they observe on their observation sheets\n   - Predict: *How does this structure help the pigeon get food, water, or survive?*\n\n3. **Station 1 (Beak & Mouth Structures):** Students observe that the beak is pointed and hard. They record what types of food this shape might be good for (seeds, insects, small items from the ground). They answer: \"How does a hard beak help the pigeon get food?\"\n\n4. **Station 2 (Feet & Legs):** Students observe the strong, scaly feet with claws. They record: \"These feet have sharp claws and strong muscles. What does the pigeon use them for?\" Prompt them to think about perching, gripping, walking on different surfaces.\n\n5. **Station 3 (Feathers & Wings):** Students observe feather structure and wing size. They record: \"How do wings and feathers help the pigeon survive?\" Discuss insulation, flight, escaping danger.\n\n6. **Connection to the photograph:** At each station, students point to or reference the pigeon image to see these structures in a living animal.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each station, listening to student thinking.\n- Ask guiding questions like: *\"Why might a pigeon need strong feet?\" \"What would happen if the pigeon didn't have wings?\" \"How does the shape of the beak connect to the food it eats?\"*\n- Do NOT tell students the answers; let them reason through the evidence.\n- Record student phrases and ideas to use during the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that specific body structures have specific functions related to survival.\n- Students begin connecting structure to behavior (e.g., beak shape → type of food; feet → perching and movement).\n- Student observation sheets show drawings and descriptions of at least 2-3 structures and initial explanations of their functions.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific explanations, connecting exploration to the bigger picture of how animals interact with their environment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pigeon photograph (displayed again)\n- Vocabulary reference cards or poster\n- Picture cards showing: seed, water source, decomposer (worm, fungus), energy from food\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Invite 3-4 groups to share one structure they observed and their thinking about how it helps the pigeon. Write key phrases on chart paper (e.g., \"beak for cracking seeds,\" \"feet for gripping wire\").\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with student-friendly definitions (8 minutes):**\n\n   - **External structure:** A body part you can see on the outside of an animal that helps it survive and do important jobs (like eating, moving, or staying warm).\n   - **Adaptation:** A special feature or ability an animal has that helps it survive in its environment. Example: A pigeon's hard beak is adapted for eating seeds.\n   - **Matter:** Anything that takes up space and has weight—like food, water, air, and the materials living things are made of.\n   - **Consumer:** A living thing (usually an animal) that eats plants or other animals to get the energy and materials it needs to grow and live.\n   - **Ecosystem:** All the living things (plants, animals, decomposers) and nonliving things (water, soil, air) in an area, and how they interact.\n\n3. **Make explicit connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the pigeon's beak: \"This is an external structure—a body part we can see. It's an adaptation because it's specially shaped to help the pigeon crack open seeds and eat food.\"\n   - Point to the feet: \"These structures are adaptations for perching and gripping. They help the pigeon stay safe on wires and ledges.\"\n   - Hold up a picture of a seed: \"This seed is matter. When the pigeon eats the seed, that matter becomes part of the pigeon's body, giving it energy to fly, move, and grow. The pigeon is a **consumer** because it eats plants.\"\n   - Explain: \"The pigeon eats seeds from the ground, drinks water, and produces waste. The pigeon is part of an ecosystem where matter moves back and forth—from food into the pigeon, and from the pigeon back into the environment.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Who can point to a structure on the pigeon and tell me what it does?\"\n   - Ask: \"Is a pigeon a consumer or a producer? Why?\" (Listen for: *A pigeon is a consumer because it eats plants/seeds; it doesn't make its own food like plants do.*)\n   - Ask: \"What kind of matter does a pigeon need to survive?\" (Water, food, air.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **External Structure** | A body part on the outside of an animal (like a beak, wing, or foot) that helps it survive. |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or ability that helps an animal live and survive in its environment. |\n| **Matter** | Anything that takes up space—like food, water, soil, and air. Living things are made of matter and use matter to grow. |\n| **Consumer** | An animal that eats plants or other animals to get energy and materials to live and grow. |\n| **Ecosystem** | All the living things (plants, animals) and nonliving things (water, air, soil) in an area and how they connect. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define external structures, adaptations, and matter in their own words.\n- Students explain that the pigeon's body parts help it find and eat food (a type of matter).\n- Students understand that the pigeon is a consumer that depends on its environment for matter (food and water).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by developing a simple model of matter movement in an ecosystem and comparing animal structures across species.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheet of poster board or chart paper (one per pair or small group)\n- Pictures or drawings of: pigeon, seeds/grain, water source, soil, decomposer (worm or fungus), sun\n- Colored string or yarn\n- Markers and colored pencils\n- Picture cards or printed images of 2-3 other animals (e.g., hawk, earthworm, rabbit)\n- Chart comparing body structures of different animals (pigeon beak vs. hawk beak vs. rabbit teeth)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Matter Movement Model (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Explain the task:** \"You're going to create a diagram showing how matter moves between the pigeon and its environment.\"\n\n2. **Provide a simple template or guide:**\n   - Draw a pigeon in the center.\n   - Draw arrows showing: \n     - Food (seeds) coming INTO the pigeon\n     - Water coming IN\n     - Energy going OUT (in the form of movement, heat, waste)\n     - Waste (droppings) going back to the ground\n\n3. **Students label each arrow with:** *Where does the matter come from?* *Where does it go?* *What happens to it?*\n\n4. **Teacher guidance:** \"The pigeon eats seeds from the ground. That matter becomes part of the pigeon's body, giving it energy to fly and live. When the pigeon produces waste, that matter goes back into the soil, where plants and decomposers use it. This is called a **cycle**—matter keeps moving in a circle.\"\n\n5. **Students complete and color their diagrams.**\n\n**Part B: Comparing Animal Structures (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display images or pictures of 2-3 other animals** (e.g., a hawk, a rabbit, a duck).\n\n2. **Pose comparison questions:**\n   - \"How is a pigeon's beak different from a hawk's beak? Why might they be different?\" (Pigeons eat seeds; hawks eat meat.)\n   - \"How is a rabbit's mouth different from a pigeon's beak? What does each animal eat?\" (Rabbits have teeth for chewing plants; pigeons have beaks for cracking seeds.)\n   - \"Why do you think different animals have different structures?\" (Because they eat different foods and live in different ways.)\n\n3. **Students fill in a **comparison chart** with columns:\n   - Animal name\n   - What it eats\n   - Key external structures\n   - How structures help it survive\n\n4. **Exit thinking:** \"Animals have different body structures because they need to survive in different ways and eat different foods. These structures are adaptations!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate as students create their matter models, asking: *\"Where is the food coming from? Where does the waste go? Is that part of the ecosystem?\"*\n- Ask probing questions during comparison: *\"Why would a meat-eating bird need a different beak than a seed-eating bird?\"*\n- Celebrate student thinking and display models.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a simple diagram showing at least two ways matter moves between the pigeon and its environment (food in, waste out, water).\n- Students articulate that different animals have different structures because they have different survival needs.\n- Students recognize that adaptations are connected to diet, habitat, and behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal structures, their functions, and the movement of matter in ecosystems.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage and Explore phases; listen for emerging understanding of structure-function relationships.\n- Review student observation sheets and sketches from Explore; note which students correctly identify structure functions.\n- Monitor student responses during Explain discussion; identify misconceptions and clarify in real-time.\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket - administered at end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with the **Pigeon Structures Exit Ticket** (digital or paper). Students respond to the following (adjust format for your students' writing level):\n\n---\n\n**Pigeon Structures Exit Ticket**\n\n**Name:** _________________ **Date:** _________________\n\n**1. Look at the pigeon's beak. Describe what it looks like and explain how it helps the pigeon survive.**\n\n   *What it looks like:* ___________________________________\n   \n   *How it helps the pigeon:* ___________________________________\n\n**2. A pigeon eats seeds from the ground. Explain how the seeds (matter) become part of the pigeon's body and give it energy.**\n\n   ___________________________________________________________________\n   \n   ___________________________________________________________________\n\n**3. Draw or list three external structures you observe on the pigeon. For each one, write ONE way it helps the pigeon survive.**\n\n   | Structure | How It Helps |\n   |-----------|-------------|\n   | _______ | _______ |\n   | _______ | _______ |\n   | _______ | _______ |\n\n**4. True or False: A pigeon is a consumer because it eats seeds and other plants.**\n   \n   ☐ True   ☐ False\n   \n   **Explain your answer:** ___________________________________\n\n**5. Imagine a pigeon's beak was soft and flat instead of hard and pointed. How would that change what the pigeon could eat? How would that affect the pigeon's survival?**\n\n   ___________________________________________________________________\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- **Exemplary (4/4):** Student identifies 3+ external structures, accurately describes their functions, explains matter movement with specific examples (e.g., \"seeds become energy\"), correctly identifies pigeon as a consumer, and predicts realistic consequences of structural changes.\n\n- **Proficient (3/4):** Student identifies 2+ structures with correct functions, explains basic matter movement, correctly identifies consumer, and provides some evidence of understanding structure-function relationships.\n\n- **Developing (2/4):** Student identifies 1-2 structures with some functional explanation, shows partial understanding of matter movement, may need clarification on consumer definition.\n\n- **Beginning (1/4):** Student identifies structures but lacks functional explanations; shows limited understanding of matter and ecosystems.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should demonstrate that they can:\n- Identify external body structures and explain how they help the animal survive.\n- Make a simple argument connecting structure to survival function using evidence (e.g., \"The beak is hard so it can crack seeds, which the pigeon needs to eat\").\n- Recognize that matter (food, water) comes from the environment and supports the animal's growth and movement.\n- Understand that animals interact with their environments in specific ways based on their body structures.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Provide sentence frames during Explain and Elaborate phases:**\n   - \"This body part is called a _______________.\"\n   - \"It helps the pigeon by _______________.\"\n   - \"The pigeon eats _______________, which is a type of _______________.\"\n   - Use these frames on student worksheets and exit tickets to scaffold written responses.\n\n2. **Use visual supports and reduce text load:**\n   - Create a picture-word reference chart showing each structure, its name, and a simple illustration of its function.\n   - Provide the matter model as a partially completed diagram that students finish by adding labels and arrows.\n   - Pair these students with strong readers or provide audio descriptions of the photograph.\n\n3. **Simplify exit ticket questions:**\n   - Replace question 5 with a multiple-choice version: \"If a pigeon's beak was soft, what would happen? A) It could eat rocks. B) It could crack seeds. C) It might break when eating seeds.\"\n   - Reduce the number of structures to identify from 3 to 2.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extend the investigation to food webs:**\n   - Ask: \"A hawk eats pigeons. A pigeon eats seeds. How does matter move through this food chain?\" \n   - Have students create a food web showing pigeon, hawk, seed plant, and decomposer, with arrows showing matter/energy movement.\n   - Connect this to the 5-LS2-1 standard by asking: \"How is the pigeon part of a larger ecosystem where matter constantly moves?\"\n\n2. **Compare human and pigeon structures:**\n   - Provide images of human body parts (hands, mouth, digestive system) and pigeon parts (beak, feet, digestive system).\n   - Ask: \"How are human and pigeon structures similar? Different? Why?\" \n   - Have students write a paragraph: \"Humans and pigeons both need food to survive, but our bodies are adapted for different environments and diets. Compare our structures and explain how each is suited to what we eat.\"\n\n3. **Research and present an animal adaptation project:**\n   - Assign students to research another urban bird (sparrow, crow, dove) or local animal.\n   - Have them create a presentation comparing that animal's structures to the pigeon's, explaining how each is adapted to its specific diet and habitat.\n   - Include a matter cycle diagram for their chosen animal.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n**Activity 1: Pigeon Behavior Observation (Field Investigation)**\n\n**Time:** 20-30 minutes (outdoor or online video observation)\n\n**Materials:** Binoculars (optional), observation notebook, colored pencils, **Pigeon Behavior Observation Guide** (handout)\n\n**Description:**\nTake students outside to observe pigeons (or show a high-quality video of pigeons in an urban environment like a park or city square). Students use the observation guide to record:\n- What structures the pigeon uses when eating (beak, feet, head movements)\n- How the pigeon moves (wing use, leg movement, balance on feet)\n- What the pigeon interacts with in its environment (food sources, water, perches, other pigeons)\n- Predictions about why the pigeon moves or behaves a certain way (e.g., \"It hops on one foot—maybe to stay ready to fly away from danger\")\n\nStudents return to class and discuss: \"What did we see the pigeon's structures doing in real life? How does behavior connect to body structure?\"\n\n**Connection:** Links to 5-LS2-1 by showing how animals interact with their environment; demonstrates that matter (food) is actively obtained by the animal using its body structures.\n\n---\n\n**Activity 2: Design an Alien Bird (Creative Application)**\n\n**Time:** 30-40 minutes\n\n**Materials:** Poster board, markers, colored pencils, images of various animal structures (beaks, feet, wings, eyes)\n\n**Description:**\nChallenge students to design an imaginary bird adapted to a made-up environment. Provide scenarios such as:\n- A bird that lives on an ice planet and eats frozen fish\n- A bird that lives in a dense jungle and eats insects from tree bark\n- A bird that lives in a desert and rarely finds water\n\nStudents sketch their alien bird and label its external structures, then write a paragraph for each structure explaining:\n- What it looks like\n- What environment it's adapted to\n- How it helps the bird survive and find food in that environment\n\nStudents present their designs and justify each structure based on survival needs.\n\n**Connection:** Applies understanding of structure-function relationships to a novel context; reinforces that adaptations are tied to diet and habitat.\n\n---\n\n**Activity 3: Matter in My Stomach (Food Digestion Mini-Lesson)**\n\n**Time:** 20-25 minutes (can be taught in a follow-up session)\n\n**Materials:** Diagram of pigeon digestive system (simplified), picture of what a pigeon eats vs. what it produces, optional: crackers, small bowl, water (for hands-on simulation)\n\n**Description:**\nExtend understanding of how matter is used by the body. Show a simplified diagram of a pigeon's digestive system. Explain:\n- The pigeon swallows seeds whole.\n- Inside its body, the seeds are broken down into smaller and smaller pieces.\n- The useful parts (nutrients) are absorbed to give the pigeon energy and help it grow.\n- The parts the body cannot use become waste (poop).\n\nAsk: \"What happens to the matter inside the pigeon? Where does it go?\" \n\n**Optional hands-on:** Let students crumble a cracker into a small bowl of water to simulate how food breaks down in a digestive system.\n\n**Connection:** Deepens understanding of how matter moves INTO an animal, is processed, and eventually exits as waste—reinforcing the matter cycle from Elaborate phase.\n\n---\n\n**Homework Extension (Optional):**\n\nAssign students to observe and sketch what they eat for dinner that night, then answer:\n- \"What external structures do I use to get and eat this food?\" (Hands to grab, mouth, teeth, tongue)\n- \"Where did this food come from originally?\" (Plant or animal)\n- \"What happens to this matter after I eat it?\" (Digestion, growth, energy, waste)\n\nStudents bring their observations back to discuss how humans, like pigeons, are consumers that interact with their environment to get matter (food) for survival.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis 5E lesson leverages the pigeon photograph to build fifth graders' understanding that external body structures are adaptations for survival, and that animals interact with their environments to obtain matter (food, water) necessary for growth and energy. Through hands-on exploration, formal vocabulary instruction, and application activities, students develop evidence-based arguments connecting structure to function and begin modeling how matter cycles through ecosystems—directly addressing both NGSS standards for this grade level.",
