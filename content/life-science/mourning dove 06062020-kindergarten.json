Green plants and white flowers grow all around the bird in the dirt.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image captures the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of animal habitat selection and foraging behavior. The mourning dove is demonstrating how animals choose specific locations that meet their basic survival needs. The bird has selected this garden location because it provides food sources (seeds from plants), water (likely from garden irrigation), shelter (dense vegetation), and nesting materials (twigs and plant matter). This behavior represents the scientific principle that all living things have basic needs that must be met for survival, and animals actively seek environments that fulfill these requirements.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Living vs. Non-Living:** The bird is a living thing that moves, eats, and grows, while the pot and soil are non-living things that do not move on their own.\n\n2. **Basic Needs of Animals:** All animals need food, water, shelter, and air to survive, just like this bird finding these things in the garden.\n\n3. **Animal Habitats:** Animals live in places that give them what they need, and this garden provides a good home for the bird.\n\n4. **Plants and Animals Together:** Plants and animals help each other - plants give animals food and shelter, while animals can help spread plant seeds.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"I Notice, I Wonder, It Reminds Me Of\" thinking routine when showing this image. This helps kindergarteners make observations before jumping to explanations and connects new learning to their prior experiences.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to share observations by offering drawing, verbal sharing, or acting out what they see. Some students may better express their understanding through movement or art rather than words alone.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** Inside the bird's body, tiny parts called cells work together to help the bird breathe, eat, and move. The bird's heart pumps blood to carry food and air to all parts of its body.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This garden is part of a bigger neighborhood ecosystem where many different animals and plants live together. Birds like this one help connect different areas by flying from place to place, carrying seeds that grow into new plants far away.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"Birds only eat worms and bugs.\"\n   **Clarification:** Many birds, like this mourning dove, mainly eat seeds, fruits, and grains, though some birds do eat insects and worms.\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"Animals live wherever they want to live.\"\n   **Clarification:** Animals must live in places that have everything they need to survive - they cannot choose just any place.\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"All birds build nests in trees.\"\n   **Clarification:** Some birds, including mourning doves, sometimes build nests on the ground or in low bushes.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** K-LS1-1 Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n- **Disciplinary Core Idea:** [[NGSS:DCI:K-LS1.C]] Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms\n- **Crosscutting Concept:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you notice about where this bird chose to sit? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. What things does this bird need to stay alive and healthy? (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n\n3. How is this garden like the bird's home, and how is it different from your home? (Bloom's: Compare | DOK: 2)\n\n4. What would happen if all the plants in this garden disappeared? (Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs to survive.\n* **Survive:** To stay alive by getting food, water, and shelter.\n* **Observe:** To look carefully and notice details about something.\n* **Living:** Something that grows, moves, eats, and can make babies.\n* **Shelter:** A safe place where animals can hide and rest.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- Are You My Mother? by P.D.
