ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the cicada shell and activate prior knowledge about animal growth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of cicada shell and lichen on tree bark (displayed on projector or printed large)\n- Optional: Real cicada shell in a clear container (if available from local collection)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Ask them to sit in a circle or gathering area.\n\n2. **Introduce with wonder:** \"Look at this photo carefully. There's something very special hiding on this tree bark. Can you see a brown, bumpy creature? This is a cicada shell—but here's the mystery: the cicada that left this shell is not inside anymore!\"\n\n3. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What do you think this brown bumpy thing is? Does it look like an animal to you?\"\n   - \"If the cicada is not inside this shell, where do you think it went?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the cicada would leave its shell behind?\"\n   - \"Have you ever gotten too big for your clothes? How do you think that feels for an insect?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to tell you that cicadas shed their shells many, many times while they're growing up—just like you might grow out of your winter coat! Let's figure out why they do this and what happens next.\"\n\n5. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore what happens during a cicada's life and discover why this empty shell tells such an important story.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate cicada growth and compare young and adult cicadas through observation and hands-on discovery.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pictures or printed images of cicada nymphs (young cicadas) and adult cicadas (one set per pair or small group)\n- Magazines or printed insect images for sorting\n- Measuring tape or ruler\n- Chart with three columns labeled \"Baby Cicada,\" \"Shell,\" and \"Adult Cicada\"\n- Crayons, colored pencils, or markers\n- White paper for drawings\n- Tape and glue sticks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Observing and Comparing**\n\n1. **Distribute image pairs** to small groups or pairs. Each group gets pictures of a nymph (young cicada) and an adult cicada.\n\n2. **Guide exploration with these prompts:**\n   - \"Look at both pictures. Point to the baby cicada and the adult cicada. Which one is bigger?\"\n   - \"What body parts do they both have? Do they look the same?\"\n   - \"What looks different between them?\"\n   - \"Why might a baby cicada need to leave its shell and grow?\"\n\n3. **Students record observations** by:\n   - Drawing both the nymph and adult on paper, labeling with \"small\" and \"big\"\n   - Making a simple tally of body parts they see on each (legs, antennae, wings, etc.)\n\n**Part 2: Sorting and Organizing**\n\n4. **Create a classroom chart** with three columns: \"Baby Cicada,\" \"The Shell Left Behind,\" and \"Adult Cicada.\"\n\n5. **Students place or draw pictures** in the correct columns to show the sequence of change.\n\n6. **Measure and compare:** Provide rulers. Students estimate and measure the length of cicada images to see the size difference between nymphs and adults.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups, asking open-ended questions like \"What else do you notice?\" and \"Why do you think that is?\"\n- Listen for student thinking but avoid confirming answers—let them observe and wonder.\n- Encourage students to point to specific details in images.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"Does the baby cicada have the same shape as the adult?\" and \"What would happen if the baby got bigger but stayed in the same shell?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe and document visible differences (size, wings, body shape) between nymphs and adults.\n- Students organize evidence showing a sequence of change (small → sheds shell → grows larger).\n- Students begin forming ideas about why cicadas must shed their shells to grow.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts about cicada life cycles and animal growth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster or slide showing cicada life cycle (egg → nymph → adult, with ecdysis/molting labeled)\n- The cicada shell photograph (original)\n- Picture of empty shed skin for comparison (optional: snake skin or other molted animal example)\n- Chart paper for recording vocabulary\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 2-3 groups to show their charts or drawings and explain what they found. Affirm observations: \"You noticed that the adult is much bigger—excellent observation!\"\n\n2. **Introduce the life cycle concept:**\n   - \"Cicadas have a **life cycle**—that means they go through different stages as they grow from babies to adults.\"\n   - Display the life cycle image and point to each stage.\n   - \"This is a nymph [point]—that's a baby cicada that lives underground.\"\n   - \"The nymph grows bigger and bigger, but its hard outer shell doesn't grow with it.\"\n   - \"When the nymph gets too big for its shell, something amazing happens—it **sheds** or **molts**—it wiggles right out of that old shell!\"\n   - \"That's exactly what we see in our photograph—a shell that a cicada has left behind.\"\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions:\n\n| Vocabulary Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|---|---|\n| **Life cycle** | All the different stages an animal goes through from being born to becoming an adult. |\n| **Nymph** | A young cicada that lives in the ground and hasn't become an adult yet. |\n| **Exoskeleton** | A hard shell on the outside of an insect's body that protects it (like a suit of armor). |\n| **Molt** (or **shed**) | When an animal sheds its old skin or shell because it has grown too big for it. |\n| **Adult** | A cicada that is fully grown and has wings so it can fly and sing. |\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Hold up the image again. \"This shell we saw is proof that a cicada molted here! The cicada crawled right out of this shell and left it behind.\"\n   - \"The cicada inside was growing bigger and bigger until the shell became too tight.\"\n   - \"Just like you outgrow your shoes, the cicada outgrows its shell!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Why do you think the cicada has to leave its shell?\" (To make room to grow bigger)\n   - \"Can the cicada fit back inside this shell?\" (No, because it's getting bigger)\n   - \"What does a cicada do after it sheds its shell?\" (It keeps growing and eventually becomes an adult with wings)\n\n6. **Record vocabulary on chart paper** and keep posted for reference throughout the lesson and year.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that cicadas shed their shells to make room for growth.\n- Students can name the stages of a cicada's life (nymph → adult).\n- Students can explain why an animal leaves its shell behind (it outgrows it).\n- Students use new vocabulary accurately in discussion.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a life cycle model and connecting cicada molting to other animals.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Paper plates or paper circles (4 per student)\n- Crayons, markers, colored pencils\n- Glue sticks and tape\n- Brads or paper fasteners (optional, for spinning wheel)\n- Pre-drawn outlines of cicadas in different stages (optional scaffolds)\n- Picture cards of other molting animals (butterfly, snake, tarantula, lobster)\n\n**Activity Option 1: Cicada Life Cycle Wheel**\n\n1. **Each student receives 4 paper plates or circles** arranged in a line or spiral.\n\n2. **Students label and draw each stage:**\n   - Stage 1: Egg (tiny, in the ground)\n   - Stage 2: Nymph (small, underground, feeding on tree roots)\n   - Stage 3: Molting (cicada climbing out, old shell visible)\n   - Stage 4: Adult (large, with wings, on a tree)\n\n3. **Students color each stage** with crayons or markers.\n\n4. **Optional:** Attach plates with a brad to create a spinning wheel showing the cycle repeats.\n\n5. **Students add labels** (baby, growing, sheds shell, grown-up).\n\n**Activity Option 2: \"Who Else Sheds?\" Connection**\n\n1. **Show picture cards of other animals that molt:** butterfly emerging from chrysalis, snake shedding skin, tarantula molting, hermit crab leaving shell.\n\n2. **Discuss:** \"Cicadas aren't the only animals that shed! Other animals do this too. Why might different animals need to shed?\"\n\n3. **Students draw or write:** \"When I grow too big for my clothes, I need new clothes. When a _____ grows too big, it sheds its _____.\"\n\n4. **Create a classroom chart:** \"Animals That Shed—Just Like Cicadas!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Provide visual supports (pre-drawn cicada outlines) for students needing scaffolding.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What stage comes next?\" and \"What does the cicada do here?\"\n- Celebrate student creativity in their drawings.\n- Connect to student experiences: \"You've outgrown your baby clothes—the cicada outgrows its shell the same way!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students create an accurate visual representation of the cicada life cycle.\n- Students understand that molting is a survival strategy shared by different animals.\n- Students can explain the purpose of shedding in their own words.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of cicada life cycles, molting, and animal growth.\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Observe student responses during Engage discussion questions.\n- Review drawings and charts created during Explore phase for evidence of observation skills.\n- Listen to student vocabulary use during Explain phase group share-out.\n- Check life cycle wheels or drawings for accuracy of stages and sequence.\n\n**Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nDisplay the original cicada shell photograph one final time. Ask students to respond to **one of these** (teacher chooses based on class level):\n\n**Option A (Verbal—for students who need support):**\n1. \"Point to the shell in the picture. Who left this shell behind?\"\n2. \"Why did the cicada leave this shell here?\"\n3. \"Is a cicada that just molted bigger or smaller than before?\"\n\n**Option B (Drawing + Words—for most first graders):**\n\"Draw the cicada before it shed its shell and the cicada after it shed. Label which is bigger.\"\n\n**Option C (Written Response—for advanced readers/writers):**\n\"Why does a cicada need to shed its shell? Write or draw your answer.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Student can identify that the shell belongs to a cicada that has outgrown it.\n\n✓ Student recognizes that molting is a natural part of growth.\n\n✓ Student can sequence life cycle stages in correct order (young → growing → molting → adult).\n\n✓ Student uses vocabulary (molt, nymph, exoskeleton, life cycle) with understanding.\n\n✓ Student makes a connection between cicada shedding and other examples of growth or change in animals.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most first graders will demonstrate understanding that cicadas shed shells to make room for growth.\n- Students will sequence the life cycle with 3+ correct stages.\n- Students will use at least one new vocabulary word accurately.\n- Advanced students will compare cicada molting to other animals or explain deeper reasons for shedding.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Provide pre-drawn or photo-based materials:** Instead of drawing from scratch, students can color and label pre-printed images of each life cycle stage, reducing the demand for fine-motor drawing skills.\n\n2. **Use physical models and manipulatives:** Give students picture cards to arrange in sequence on a mat rather than creating from memory. Repeat sorting multiple times with teacher guidance and questioning.\n\n3. **Pair students for exploration:** During Explore, pair struggling readers/observers with a buddy or small-group teacher instruction where you point out specific details (\"See how the adult has wings but the nymph doesn't?\").\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Research extension:** Provide books or websites about cicada life cycles and ask: \"How many times does a cicada molt before it becomes an adult?\" (Answer: 5-6 times!) Students can create a longer sequence or timeline showing multiple molts.\n\n2. **Comparative analysis:** Ask students to compare cicada molting with metamorphosis in butterflies or frogs: \"How is the way a cicada grows different from the way a butterfly grows? How is it the same?\"\n\n3. **Design challenge:** \"Can you design a protective suit or shell that could grow bigger as you grow? What materials would you use? Draw or build your design.\" (Connects to 1-LS1-1 about mimicking animal structures.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cicada Hunt Outdoors:** Take students outside to look for cicada shells on trees, shrubs, or fences in your school yard or neighborhood (spring/summer months). Collect shells carefully and create a display with labels showing where each was found and approximately how large the cicada was.\n\n2. **Life Cycle Story Writing:** Students draw or dictate a simple story: \"The Life of Cici the Cicada.\" Sequence: \"I was born as an egg → I became a nymph underground → I grew too big → I molted and left my shell → I became an adult and flew away.\"\n\n3. **Compare and Contrast Anchor Chart:** Create a classroom chart comparing \"How Cicadas Grow vs. How Humans Grow\": Cicadas shed shells, humans don't; both start small and get bigger; both eventually become adults. Students add illustrations and ideas.\n\n4. **Sound Investigation:** If available, listen to a recording of cicada sounds. Discuss: \"Only adult cicadas can make this loud buzzing sound. Why might having wings and a bigger body help them make sounds?\" (Connections to animal behaviors and structures.)\n\n5. **Parent-Child Connection Activity:** Send home a simple worksheet: \"Ask a family member: What animals have you seen shed their skin or shells? Draw or write about it and bring it back to share.\" This bridges home-school learning and honors family knowledge.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
