ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the relationship between insects and flowers using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or displayed photograph of the insect on the flower (large enough for whole class to see)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: hand lens for closer inspection\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around printed copies. Give students 30 seconds to quietly observe without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause for student responses after each):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Who can describe the two living things?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this insect is on the flower? What might it be doing there?\"\n   - \"Look at the center of the flower (the yellow part). What do you notice? Could the insect be getting something from the flower?\"\n   - \"If the insect moves to another flower, what might happen?\" (Accept all answers — this activates prior knowledge.)\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \"I wonder if insects help flowers in any way. What do you think? Turn to a partner and share your ideas.\" Jot down 2-3 student predictions on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore how insects and flowers work together — like teammates! Let's investigate.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the concept of pollination through a hands-on model using accessible materials.\n\n**Materials (per small group or pair):**\n- 2-3 craft flowers (made from tissue paper, coffee filters, or simple paper cutouts with yellow centers)\n- Small cup or container filled with yellow powder (flour, cornstarch, or ground-up chalk — the \"pollen\")\n- Pipe cleaner or craft stick (the \"insect\")\n- White paper or paper plate (to catch pollen)\n- Small paintbrush or cotton swab\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Observation sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Place your first flower on the white paper. Dip the end of your pipe cleaner gently into the yellow powder — it will stick like pollen sticks to a real insect.\"\n\n2. \"Now touch the pipe cleaner to the yellow center of the first flower. What happens? Draw or write what you observe on your sheet.\"\n\n3. \"Without adding more powder, move your pipe cleaner to the second flower and touch its center. Look carefully — did any powder come off?\"\n\n4. \"Check the white paper under both flowers. Do you see yellow powder? Where is it?\"\n\n5. \"Try this again with fresh powder on the pipe cleaner. This time, visit the flowers in a different order. Does the powder move differently?\"\n\n**Observation Sheet** (teacher provides or students draw):\n- Draw the first flower and the pipe cleaner. Show where the yellow powder went.\n- Draw what happened when the pipe cleaner visited the second flower.\n- Circle where you see the most powder.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What happened to the powder when you moved the pipe cleaner? Is the powder on the insect? On the flowers? On the paper?\"\n- Avoid telling students what it means; let them discover the pattern.\n- Encourage students to repeat the activity and notice patterns.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that powder sticks to the pipe cleaner and transfers between flowers.\n- Students will observe that the \"pollen\" gets on the pipe cleaner, the flowers, and the surrounding paper.\n- They will recognize a pattern: moving the \"insect\" to different flowers moves the powder around.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect exploration to real pollination in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words written large\n- The original photograph of the insect on the flower (displayed again)\n- Optional: hand lens for students to observe the photograph more closely\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover when you moved the pipe cleaner between the flowers?\"\n   - Record student observations on chart paper. Look for these key ideas:\n     - Powder stuck to the pipe cleaner\n     - Powder moved from flower to flower\n     - Powder also landed on the paper and other places\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Present these terms using student-friendly definitions. Write each on chart paper with a simple drawing or symbol:\n\n   - **Pollen:** A yellow, dusty powder inside flowers that helps make new plants. (Point to the yellow center in the photograph.)\n   - **Pollination:** When pollen moves from one flower to another. This helps plants make seeds.\n   - **Insect:** A small animal with six legs, a body with three parts, and sometimes wings. (Point out the insect's legs and body in the photograph.)\n   - **Pollinator:** An animal (like an insect) that moves pollen from flower to flower while it eats.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the original photograph again.\n   - \"The insect in this picture is a pollinator. See the yellow powder on its body? That's pollen! When this insect visits another flower, some pollen will brush off — just like the powder in our experiment.\"\n   - \"The insect visits the flower because it wants to eat the sweet juice called nectar. While it eats, pollen sticks to its body. Then it helps the flower!\"\n   - \"This helps both the insect (it gets food) and the flower (it gets pollinated so it can make seeds).\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can you show me with your finger where the pollen is in this picture?\" (Point to the yellow center and/or the insect's body.)\n   - \"If this insect flies to another daisy, what might happen?\" (Pollen will move to that flower.)\n   - Use thumbs up/sideways/down: \"Do you understand what pollination is?\" Observe responses to identify who needs more support.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Pollen:** A yellow, dusty powder inside flowers that helps make new plants.\n- **Pollination:** When pollen moves from one flower to another so plants can make seeds.\n- **Insect:** A small animal with six legs, a body with three parts, and sometimes wings.\n- **Pollinator:** An animal that helps move pollen from flower to flower when it visits flowers for food.\n- **Nectar:** The sweet juice inside flowers that insects eat.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that insects visit flowers for food (nectar).\n- Students understand that pollen sticks to insects and moves between flowers.\n- Students can identify pollen in both the photograph and their model.\n- Students grasp the basic concept: insects and flowers help each other.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a model or representation that shows pollination in action.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper (11\" × 14\") or poster board\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Stickers or cutouts of insects, flowers, and bees (optional)\n- Glue sticks\n- Optional: real flower petals, leaves, or pressed flowers to glue on\n- **Model-Building Option:** cups, tissue paper, pipe cleaners, and cotton balls to create a 3D flower and insect model\n\n**Activity: Choice 1 — \"Pollination Picture\" (for students who prefer drawing)**\n\n1. Students create a labeled drawing showing:\n   - A flower with a yellow center (pollen)\n   - An insect visiting the flower\n   - A second flower the insect will visit next\n   - Arrows or lines showing pollen movement\n\n2. Students label the pollen, insect, flowers, and nectar.\n\n3. Students write or dictate a sentence: \"The insect helps the flower by ______.\"\n\n**Activity: Choice 2 — \"Insect and Flower Model\" (for students who prefer hands-on building)**\n\n1. Students build a simple 3D flower using tissue paper petals, a cup as the stem, and a cotton ball dipped in yellow powder as the pollen-filled center.\n\n2. They create an insect using a pipe cleaner, pom-poms, or craft materials.\n\n3. They demonstrate how the insect \"lands\" on the flower and moves pollen.\n\n4. They explain their model to a partner using the vocabulary words.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Where is the pollen? How will the insect help this flower? Can you show me how pollination happens with your model?\"\n- Encourage students to use the vocabulary words (pollen, pollinator, nectar, pollination).\n- Take photos of student models and artwork for assessment purposes.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding by accurately showing the insect-flower relationship.\n- Students use vocabulary terms correctly in explanations.\n- Students show pollen movement between flowers or on the insect's body.\n- Work shows that students grasp the concept of pollination as a two-way benefit.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of insect-flower relationships and pollination.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- Observe student diagrams, models, and explanations during the Elaborate phase.\n- Listen to partner discussions and ask clarifying questions.\n- Use a simple checklist:\n  - ☐ Student can point to/identify pollen in the photograph or model\n  - ☐ Student can explain why the insect visits the flower\n  - ☐ Student can show how pollen moves between flowers\n  - ☐ Student uses vocabulary words correctly\n\n**Exit Ticket (administered at the end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide this as a drawing prompt or verbal question. Students respond on a simple sheet:\n\n1. **\"Draw an insect on a flower. Show where the pollen is.\"**\n\n2. **\"What does the insect get from the flower?\"** (accept: food, nectar, or similar)\n\n3. **\"What does the flower get from the insect?\"** (accept: help to make seeds, pollen moves, or similar)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student identifies the insect and flower but struggles to show pollen or explain the relationship.\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student accurately shows pollen and explains that the insect gets food AND the flower gets help with pollination (with adult support).\n\n✓ **Advanced:** Student independently explains the two-way relationship and uses vocabulary terms (pollen, nectar, pollinator, pollination) correctly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students can identify pollen and insects in the photograph.\n- Most students can explain that insects visit flowers for food.\n- Many students can describe that pollen moves between flowers (though they may not use the word \"pollination\" independently).\n- Advanced students explain the mutual benefit and use precise vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Language Anchor Chart:** Create a chart with picture cards showing:\n   - Insect (photograph of the insect from the lesson)\n   - Flower (picture of the daisy)\n   - Pollen (yellow powder or pom-pom)\n   - Arrow showing movement between flower and insect\n   \n   Point to the chart during discussions. Repeat the sentence frame: \"The insect visits the flower for ___. Pollen moves to the ___.\"\n\n2. **Partner with a Peer:** Pair struggling learners with confident peers during the Explore phase. Assign the peer to explain what is happening with the powder.\n\n3. **Concrete Model Repeated:** Allow students to repeat the pipe cleaner and powder activity multiple times if needed, with teacher narration: \"Watch the powder stick... now it's moving to the next flower... the pollen is helping the flower make seeds!\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research Different Pollinators:** Ask: \"Not all insects are the same. Can you find out about other animals that pollinate flowers? What insects or animals visit flowers in our area?\" Provide picture books or websites (teacher-vetted) to explore. Students can create a \"Pollinator Field Guide\" with sketches and facts.\n\n2. **Investigate Flower Diversity:** Provide students with pictures of different flowers (sunflower, rose, clover, orchid, etc.). Ask: \"Do you think different insects visit different flowers? Why?\" Students observe and hypothesize, then research why flowers have different shapes, colors, and smells to attract certain pollinators.\n\n3. **Extended Model:** Challenge students to create a larger ecosystem model showing multiple flowers, multiple insects, and the flow of pollen. They can add labels and arrows to show how several insects help several flowers.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Outdoor Observation Walk (20-30 minutes):**\n   - Take students outside to observe real flowers and insects (if weather and season permit).\n   - Provide hand lenses and clipboards.\n   - Ask: \"Can you find a real insect on a real flower? What is it doing? Can you see any yellow pollen on it?\"\n   - Students sketch what they observe and label the parts.\n   - This reinforces the real-world connection and meets 2-LS4-1 (observation of plants and animals in habitats).\n\n2. **Flower Dissection and Pollen Observation (30-40 minutes):**\n   - Provide large, simple flowers (tulips, daisies, or lilies work well).\n   - Students carefully peel back petals to reveal the yellow pollen in the center.\n   - They use hand lenses to observe pollen up close.\n   - They discuss: \"This is real pollen! It's so tiny, but it sticks to insects' bodies.\"\n   - Teacher can gently brush a paintbrush over the pollen and show students how easily it transfers.\n\n3. **\"Pollinator Scavenger Hunt\" — Indoor or Outdoor Activity (20 minutes):**\n   - Hide cutouts of different insects around the classroom or playground.\n   - Near each insect, place a flower or flower picture.\n   - Students find insects and match them to flowers, then explain: \"This insect visits this flower because ___.\"\n   - This reinforces habitat relationships and adaptations (2-LS4-1).\n\n4. **Storytime Connection — \"The Bee and the Flower\" or similar narrative (15 minutes):**\n   - Read an age-appropriate picture book about pollination (e.g., *Busy Bee* by Jan Peck or *Up, Up, Up! How a Seed Grows* by Gail Gibbons).\n   - Discuss: \"How is this like what we learned? What did the insect do? How did it help the plant?\"\n\n5. **Class Mural: \"Pollination Garden\" (ongoing, can span multiple sessions):**\n   - Create a large collaborative mural showing flowers in a garden with various insects visiting them.\n   - Students contribute drawn or collaged flowers and insects.\n   - Label pollen, insects, and flowers.\n   - Display in the hallway as a celebration of student learning and a teaching tool for other classes.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
