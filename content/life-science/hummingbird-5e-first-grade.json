ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Large, printed color photograph of the hummingbird and flowers (or display on interactive board)\n  - Real flowers in a vase (optional but highly recommended—zinnias or other bright flowers)\n  - Chart paper or whiteboard for recording predictions\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Display and Introduction:**\n  Display the photograph prominently where all students can see clearly. If possible, also show a real bouquet of bright flowers nearby to create a multi-sensory connection.\n  \n  **Discussion Questions:**\n  1. \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the animal you see?\" (Listen for: small bird, long beak, fast wings, bright colors of the flowers)\n  2. \"What is this bird doing near the flowers? Why do you think it's there?\" (Allow students to hypothesize: eating, drinking, looking for food)\n  3. \"Have you ever seen a bird like this? What makes this bird special or different from other birds you know?\" (Guide them to notice: tiny size, very long beak, fast wings)\n  4. \"If you were this tiny bird, how would your beak help you get food from a flower?\" (Encourage thinking about the shape and length of the beak)\n  \n  **Wonder Prompt:**\n  \"I wonder... what if this bird had a short, round beak like a robin? Could it still drink from these flowers? Turn to a partner and share what you think!\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Let's explore how hummingbirds use their special beaks to find food in flowers. Then we'll try to make our own hummingbird beak and see how hard it is!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Small plastic cups or paper cups (one per student)\n  - Colored water (red or pink food coloring mixed with water) or weak juice in shallow containers\n  - Straws, thin tubes, or rolled paper (various widths—some thin like a hummingbird beak, some thicker)\n  - Small paper flowers cut from construction paper with \"nectar\" (colored water) in the center cup\n  - Paper, crayons, or clipboards for recording observations\n  - Optional: artificial flowers or cut real flowers in small water-filled cups\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Part 1: Observing Real Hummingbird Beak Function (10 minutes)**\n  \n  Show students the photograph again and a detailed close-up if available. Ask: \"Look at the beak. Is it thick or thin? Is it short or long? What shape is it?\"\n  \n  Explain: \"The hummingbird's beak is long and thin, like a needle or a straw. This helps it reach deep into flowers to drink the sweet juice inside, called nectar. The beak is the perfect tool for getting that food!\"\n  \n  **Part 2: Testing Different \"Beaks\" (15 minutes)**\n  \n  Divide students into small groups (3-4 students per group). Provide each group with:\n  - A shallow container with colored water (the \"flower with nectar\")\n  - Several \"beak\" options: thin straws, thick straws, rolled paper of different widths, thin tubes\n  \n  **Student Directions:**\n  1. \"Place your different beaks into the colored water. Try each one.\"\n  2. \"Which beak can suck up water easiest? Which one is hardest to use?\"\n  3. \"Which beak works best—the thin one or the thick one? Why?\"\n  4. \"Draw or write on your paper: Which beak works best like a hummingbird's?\"\n  \n  **Teacher Role:**\n  Circulate among groups. Ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n  - \"What happens when you try the thin straw?\"\n  - \"How is that different from the thick one?\"\n  - \"Which one feels most like a real hummingbird's beak?\"\n  - \"Why do you think the thin beak works better?\"\n  \n  Do NOT tell students the answer; let them discover through testing.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students discover that thin, long beaks (straws) work better than thick ones for reaching into and drinking from narrow spaces.\n  - Students make a connection: \"A thin beak is easier to drink with\" or \"The long thin straw reaches the water better.\"\n  - Each student produces a drawing or written sentence describing which beak works best and why.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper or poster board\n  - Markers\n  - Photograph of the hummingbird (displayed again)\n  - Picture cards or real examples of flowers and hummingbirds (optional)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Share-Out from Explore Phase (5 minutes):**\n  Ask 2-3 groups to share their findings:\n  - \"Which beak worked best?\"\n  - \"Why did the thin straw work better than the thick one?\"\n  - Affirm their observations and connect to the real hummingbird: \"Just like you discovered, the real hummingbird has a thin, long beak that works perfectly for drinking nectar from flowers!\"\n\n  **Key Concepts and Vocabulary Instruction (10-15 minutes):**\n  \n  Create a visual anchor chart as you teach. Use the photograph to point to each part.\n  \n  **Vocabulary:**\n  \n  1. **Beak** – The hard, pointed part of a bird's mouth that it uses to eat and drink. (Point to the hummingbird's beak in the photo. Emphasize: \"The hummingbird's beak is very long and thin.\")\n  \n  2. **Nectar** – Sweet juice inside flowers that animals drink for food. (Show the flowers in the photo. Explain: \"The bright pink flowers have nectar inside. The hummingbird drinks this sweet liquid to get energy to fly.\")\n  \n  3. **Adaptation** – A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and get what it needs. (Use student-friendly language: \"An adaptation is something special about an animal that helps it survive. The hummingbird's long beak is an adaptation because it helps the hummingbird get food from flowers.\")\n  \n  4. **Pollination** – When an animal carries pollen from one flower to another, helping flowers make seeds. (Use simple explanation: \"When the hummingbird's beak goes into the flower, powder called pollen sticks to its head. When it visits another flower, the pollen rubs off and helps the flower make seeds. The hummingbird and flower help each other!\")\n\n  **Connections Back to Photo and Explore Activity (5 minutes):**\n  \n  Point to the photograph and say: \"Remember when you tested different beaks? The thin straw worked best, right? That's why real hummingbirds have such thin, long beaks. It's the perfect adaptation for drinking nectar from flowers. The flower is bright pink and red to attract the hummingbird. The hummingbird sees those bright colors and knows there's food inside!\"\n\n  **Check for Understanding Strategy:**\n  \n  Ask simple yes/no and one-word questions:\n  - \"Is a hummingbird's beak thick or thin?\" (Thin)\n  - \"What do hummingbirds drink from flowers?\" (Nectar)\n  - \"Does the hummingbird's beak help it get food?\" (Yes)\n  - \"Why do you think flowers are so bright and colorful?\" (To attract hummingbirds / So hummingbirds see them)\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students understand that the hummingbird's beak is a special body part (adaptation) that helps it survive.\n  - Students know that hummingbirds drink nectar from flowers.\n  - Students understand that hummingbirds and flowers have a helpful relationship (hummingbird gets food, flower gets help making seeds).\n  - Students can use the word \"adaptation\" correctly in context.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Construction paper or poster board\n  - Markers, crayons, colored pencils\n  - Scissors\n  - Glue sticks\n  - Pre-cut flower shapes or materials to make flowers\n  - Optional: pipe cleaners, straws, pom-poms to create 3D hummingbirds\n  - Picture cards showing different flowers (roses, sunflowers, daisies, zinnias) with different colors\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Real-World Application: Design Your Own Garden**\n  \n  Introduce the task: \"Hummingbirds need bright flowers to visit and drink from. If you were designing a garden to attract hummingbirds, which flowers would you choose? Why?\"\n  \n  **Student Activity – Build a Hummingbird Garden (15-20 minutes):**\n  \n  Provide each student or pair with a piece of poster board to create a \"garden.\"\n  \n  **Directions:**\n  1. \"Cut out or draw bright flowers on your garden. Remember: hummingbirds like bright colors like red, pink, orange, and purple!\"\n  2. \"Make your flowers have different shapes and sizes to show that different flowers attract hummingbirds.\"\n  3. \"Draw or attach a hummingbird visiting the flowers.\"\n  4. \"Label your flowers and the hummingbird. Use the word 'beak' or 'nectar' on your drawing.\"\n  5. \"Tell a partner: Why would a hummingbird visit YOUR garden?\"\n  \n  **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate and ask: \"What color flower did you choose? Why would a hummingbird like that color?\"\n  - Encourage students to explain the connection between the hummingbird's beak and the flowers.\n  - Ask: \"How does your hummingbird use its beak in this garden?\"\n  - Prompt deeper thinking: \"What other animals might visit your garden?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students create a visual representation showing hummingbirds interacting with flowers.\n  - Students demonstrate understanding that hummingbirds are attracted to bright colors.\n  - Students apply the concept of adaptation by explaining why the hummingbird's beak helps it in a garden.\n  - Students communicate their understanding through drawing, labeling, and verbal explanation.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n  - Observation during Explore phase: Did students recognize that thin beaks work better? Did they make connections to the real hummingbird?\n  - Listen to student explanations during share-outs in the Explain phase.\n  - Observe student choices in the Elaborate phase: Did they choose bright colors? Did they show the hummingbird using its beak?\n\n  **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes):**\n  \n  At the end of the lesson, ask each student to respond to one or more of the following (verbally, with drawing, or with one-word/simple answers for early first graders):\n  \n  **Assessment Questions:**\n  1. \"Show me with your finger: Is a hummingbird's beak long or short?\" (Student points and says/shows understanding)\n  2. \"What does the hummingbird drink from flowers?\" (Answer: Nectar / the sweet juice)\n  3. \"Draw a quick picture: Show a hummingbird's beak drinking from a flower.\" (Check for: beak going into flower, flower shown, hummingbird recognizable)\n  4. \"Why do flowers have bright colors like pink and red?\" (Expected answer: To attract hummingbirds / So hummingbirds see them)\n  5. \"If a bird had a short, thick beak, could it drink nectar like a hummingbird does? Why or why not?\" (Expected reasoning: No, because the thick beak wouldn't fit; yes, but it wouldn't work as well)\n\n  **Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n  ✓ Student correctly identifies the hummingbird's beak as long and thin.\n  ✓ Student knows hummingbirds drink nectar from flowers.\n  ✓ Student can explain that the hummingbird's beak helps it get food from flowers (shows understanding of adaptation).\n  ✓ Student recognizes that bright colors attract hummingbirds.\n  ✓ Student makes a connection between the beak and how it works (from Explore activity).\n\n  **Documenting Evidence:**\n  - Collect student drawings and exit ticket responses in student science portfolios.\n  - Take photos of student gardens for documentation.\n  - Record anecdotal notes about student explanations and reasoning during discussions.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Most first graders will demonstrate understanding that hummingbirds have special beaks for drinking nectar.\n  - Students will show understanding that hummingbirds and flowers have a helpful relationship.\n  - Students will begin to use the word \"adaptation\" to describe how the beak helps the hummingbird.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (for Struggling Learners):**\n  1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only \"beak,\" \"flower,\" and \"drink\" for students still developing language. Avoid \"adaptation\" and \"nectar\" initially; use \"long beak helps the bird get food from the flower\" instead.\n  2. **Concrete Comparisons:** Provide real objects to touch: a long straw (hummingbird beak) and a short straw. Let students physically compare them before the water activity. Say: \"This long straw is like the hummingbird's beak. This short straw is NOT like the hummingbird's beak.\"\n  3. **Buddy System:** Pair struggling students with a peer during the Explore phase. The buddy can help try the different beaks and encourage participation. Teacher circulates frequently to ask yes/no questions and affirm observations.\n\n- **Challenge (for Advanced Learners):**\n  1. **Extended Thinking:** Ask: \"What if the flower had its nectar in a different place—not in the center, but high up on the petals? How would that change which birds could drink from it?\" Let students sketch or explain what animals might visit that flower.\n  2. **Research Connection:** Provide picture books or images of different hummingbird species and different flowers. Ask: \"Do all hummingbirds have the same beak? Do all flowers look the same? Why might different hummingbirds visit different flowers?\" Students can match beak shapes to flower shapes.\n  3. **Prediction and Testing:** Ask students to predict: \"If we made an even LONGER straw and an even THINNER straw, would they work better or worse? Let's test!\" Students design their own investigation and record results.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Hummingbird Beak Craft and Role-Play (30 minutes):**\n   Students create a paper \"beak\" by rolling colored paper into a thin cone or tube. They attach it to a headband and use it to drink (\"nectar\") from cups of water with straws. As they do this, they move like a hummingbird, flapping their arms and hovering around the \"flowers.\" Debrief: \"How does it feel to have a long beak like a hummingbird? Was it easy to drink?\"\n\n2. **Write a Simple Pattern Story: \"Hummingbird's Day\" (Homework or Extended Lesson):**\n   Students illustrate and write (with teacher support) a simple repeating pattern story:\n   - \"Hummingbird sees a red flower. Hummingbird drinks nectar. Hummingbird flies to a pink flower. Hummingbird drinks nectar. Hummingbird flies to a purple flower. Hummingbird drinks nectar.\"\n   This connects to 1-LS1-2 (behavior patterns that help animals survive) and reinforces the hummingbird's feeding behavior.\n\n3. **Classroom Flower Garden Display with Observation Station (Ongoing):**\n   Place real bright flowers (zinnias, marigolds, or similar) in water-filled containers around the classroom. Create an observation clipboard where students sketch and record which flowers are the \"brightest\" and which ones a hummingbird would visit first. If possible, position the flowers near a window and watch for real hummingbirds or insects visiting over time. Students record daily observations: \"Today I saw _____ visiting the _____ flower.\"\n\n---",
