Investigating How Animals Find Food\n\n---\n\n## Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Animals eat plants as food** — The grasshopper is consuming a plant bud, demonstrating that animals depend on plants for survival.\n- **Animals have special body parts for eating** — The grasshopper's mouth and legs are adapted for gripping and chewing plant material.\n- **Living things interact in their habitat** — The grasshopper and the hibiscus plant exist together in the same environment; the grasshopper is part of the ecosystem that includes plants.\n- **Different animals eat different foods** — Some animals, like this grasshopper, are herbivores that specialize in eating plants rather than other animals.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**What's for Dinner? How Animals Use Plants for Food**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 40-minute sessions or one 70-minute block\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-LS4-1: Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n  - 2-LS2-1: Plan and conduct an investigation to determine if plants need sunlight and water to grow. *(indirect connection: plants need resources to produce food for animals)*\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Observe and describe** how animals use plants for food in their habitats.\n2. **Identify and compare** the body parts that different animals use to eat plants (e.g., mouths, teeth, beaks, legs).\n3. **Explain** why plants are important to animals that live in the same place.\n4. **Apply their learning** to identify what animals in their local habitat might eat.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how animals find and eat food by examining the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the grasshopper on the hibiscus bud\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Small plastic grasshopper toy or model (for passing around)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen (or show a printed copy). Do NOT immediately tell students what they're looking at.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions** (allow 5-10 seconds of wait time after each):\n   - *\"What do you see in this picture? Who can describe what's happening?\"*\n   - *\"What is this green creature? Have you seen one before?\"* (If students know it's a grasshopper, great; if not, provide the name.)\n   - *\"What is the grasshopper doing with that red flower bud? Why do you think it's holding on so tight?\"*\n   - *\"Do you think the grasshopper likes eating plants, or do you think it wishes it had something else for dinner?\"*\n\n3. **Launch the Wonder:** Say: *\"Grasshoppers have to eat to stay alive and grow, just like you do. But grasshoppers don't go to the grocery store or eat pizza for lunch. They eat plants! Today, we're going to figure out HOW grasshoppers use their bodies to eat plants, and we'll discover why plants are so important to animals.\"*\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper. Accept all responses without judgment (e.g., \"Does it bite?\" \"Can it taste?\" \"What else does it eat?\"). These will guide Explore activities.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Let's become grasshoppers for a little while and try eating the way they do!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how animals' body structures help them eat by conducting hands-on experiments.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Lettuce leaves (or other soft plant material: celery, carrot tops, spinach)\n- Crackers or hard plant-based snacks (optional, for comparison)\n- Student observation sheets (simple, with pictures and lines for drawing/writing)\n- Plastic cups of water\n- Paper plates\n- Pencils and crayons\n- Optional: Magnifying glasses (one per pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Using Your Mouth Like a Grasshopper (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Give each student a small piece of lettuce leaf** on a paper plate. Say: *\"Without using your hands, try to break apart this leaf with just your mouth — the way a grasshopper does. Try biting, chewing, and tearing it. What happens?\"*\n\n2. **Students explore** for 2-3 minutes. Circulate and observe. Ask questions without giving answers:\n   - *\"What's happening to the leaf?\"*\n   - *\"Is it easy or hard to break apart?\"*\n   - *\"What part of your mouth is doing the work?\"*\n\n3. **Transition:** *\"Grasshoppers don't have hands, but they DO have special legs that help them hold on to plants while they eat. Let's try that!\"*\n\n**Part B: Gripping Like a Grasshopper (8-10 minutes)**\n\n4. **Give each student a fresh lettuce leaf** and challenge them to hold it in one hand while eating it with their mouth. Say: *\"Try to hold the leaf the way a grasshopper holds on with its legs. Can you do it? How does it help?\"*\n\n5. **After 1-2 minutes of exploration, ask:**\n   - *\"Was it easier to eat the leaf when you were holding it? Why?\"*\n   - *\"Grasshoppers use six legs to grip their food. We only have two hands. But it's the same idea!\"*\n\n**Part C: Recording Observations (3-4 minutes)**\n\n6. **Students draw or write** on their observation sheets:\n   - *\"Draw how you ate the lettuce leaf. Draw yourself gripping it with your hand like a grasshopper grips with its legs.\"*\n   - *\"Write or draw: What body parts did you use to eat the plant?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions (\"What do you notice?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\").\n- Do NOT tell students the answers; allow them to discover through exploration.\n- Note misconceptions to address in Explain phase.\n- Encourage students to talk to a partner about what they're discovering.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that holding food makes it easier to eat.\n- Students will identify their mouths, teeth, and hands as body parts used for eating.\n- Students will begin to understand why the grasshopper grips the plant bud.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to the grasshopper's real adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Enlarged photograph of grasshopper (or project it again)\n- Chart paper with \"Animal Body Parts for Eating\" title\n- Vocabulary poster or cards with pictures\n- Index cards with animal names (grasshopper, rabbit, bird, squirrel, etc.)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 volunteers to share their drawings and tell the class what they discovered.\n   - Ask: *\"Who used their teeth? Who used their hands? Why did holding the food help?\"*\n   - Affirm all responses.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (7-8 minutes):**\n   Display the photograph again and point to each body part as you introduce terms:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Mouth** — The opening on an animal's face where food goes in. Grasshoppers have a special mouth for chewing plants.\n   - **Legs** — Body parts that help animals move AND grip things (like food!). Grasshoppers use their strong legs to hold onto plants.\n   - **Teeth** — Hard parts inside your mouth that bite and chew food into smaller pieces. Grasshoppers don't have teeth like you, but they have strong jaws that can chew tough plant parts.\n   - **Herbivore** — An animal that only eats plants. Grasshoppers are herbivores. (Hint: *\"herbi\" = plants; \"vore\" = eat*)\n   - **Habitat** — The place where an animal lives and finds food. The hibiscus plant is part of the grasshopper's habitat.\n\n3. **Make Connections (4-5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph: *\"This grasshopper uses its powerful legs to grip the hibiscus bud. Its strong jaws chew the plant. That's exactly what YOU discovered when you held and ate the lettuce!\"*\n   - *\"The grasshopper's body is perfectly designed for eating plants in its habitat.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If you were a grasshopper, what body parts would you use to eat a leaf?\"* (Expected response: mouth, legs, jaws)\n   - Ask: *\"Why does the grasshopper in the picture grip the flower bud so tightly?\"* (Expected response: to hold it still while eating, so it doesn't fall, to eat easier)\n   - Show animal index cards (rabbit, bird, squirrel) and ask: *\"Do you think these animals eat plants or meat? Why?\"* (Guide students to notice that all these animals have mouths and legs, too.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use vocabulary to describe how the grasshopper eats.\n- Students will explain that animals have special body parts for eating.\n- Students will connect their personal experience (holding food, chewing) to grasshopper behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by investigating what OTHER animals eat and how they use their bodies.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of various animals in habitats (grasshopper, rabbit, deer, bird, squirrel, butterfly, snail, cow — at least 1 herbivore per student)\n- Picture cards or photos of plant foods (leaves, seeds, flowers, grass, acorns, nectar)\n- Chart paper with two columns: \"Animal\" and \"What It Eats\"\n- Crayons, colored pencils, or markers\n- Student worksheet or index cards for recording\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Detectives (for visual/kinesthetic learners)**\n\n1. Post picture cards of animals around the classroom (one per wall or table corner).\n\n2. Distribute picture cards of foods. Say: *\"You are a Habitat Detective! Your job is to find an animal that eats YOUR food. Match the food to the animal. Then tell us WHY you think that animal eats that food.\"*\n\n3. Students walk around, match foods to animals, and gather with other students who have the same animal.\n\n4. **Each group presents:** *\"We have a grasshopper, and it eats seeds! Grasshoppers have strong mouths and legs that help them eat hard seeds.\"* (Model this with one example first.)\n\n5. **Record matches on chart** titled \"What Herbivores Eat\" (or simply \"Who Eats What?\").\n\n**Option B: Detective Drawing (for individual workers)**\n\n1. Give each student an animal picture (grasshopper, rabbit, deer, squirrel, butterfly, or cow).\n\n2. Students draw (or write) answers to:\n   - *\"My animal is a __________.\"*\n   - *\"It eats __________.\"* (Pictures provided for non-readers)\n   - *\"Draw the body parts it uses to eat.\"*\n\n3. Share drawings with a partner or the class.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to notice that all the herbivores shown are eating PLANTS (not meat).\n- Ask: *\"How do you know this animal eats plants? What body parts does it have?\"*\n- Encourage students to connect back to the grasshopper: *\"Does this animal have a mouth like the grasshopper?\"*\n- Help students generalize: *\"All animals that eat plants have mouths and strong jaws!\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will match animals to plant foods appropriately.\n- Students will explain their reasoning using vocabulary from Explain phase (mouth, legs, herbivore, habitat).\n- Students will recognize that many different animals eat plants but use similar body structures.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Determine whether students achieved the learning objectives.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing During Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Did students identify body parts used for eating?\n- Listen to student explanations during group share-outs and activity.\n- Review drawings from Explore and Elaborate phases for evidence of understanding.\n- Ask specific questions and listen for vocabulary use.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes)**\n\nDisplay the original grasshopper photograph one more time. Students respond to ONE of the following (teacher-read or written):\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions (choose age-appropriate format):**\n\n1. **Drawing + Label:** *\"Draw a grasshopper eating a plant. Label the body parts it uses: mouth, legs, and jaws.\"*\n\n2. **Sentence Completion:** \n   - *\"The grasshopper eats __________ because it is a __________.\"* \n   - (Answer: plants; herbivore)\n   - *\"The grasshopper grips the flower bud with its __________ so it can eat better.\"*\n   - (Answer: legs)\n\n3. **Simple Question:** \n   - *\"Why do you think the grasshopper's legs are holding onto the flower bud?\"*\n   - (Acceptable answers: to hold it still, to make it easier to eat, so it doesn't fall, to keep it from moving)\n\n4. **Picture Sort:** Show three body parts (mouth, legs, eyes). Ask: *\"Circle the two body parts that help the grasshopper eat a plant.\"* (Expected: mouth and legs)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Identify at least TWO body parts the grasshopper uses to eat (mouth and legs).\n- ✓ Explain WHY the grasshopper grips the plant (to hold it, to eat it easier).\n- ✓ Use the word \"herbivore\" or \"plant\" when describing what the grasshopper eats.\n- ✓ Draw or describe the grasshopper interacting with the plant.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Objectives:**\n\n- **Learning Objective 1** (Observe and describe): Review Explore drawings and Exit Ticket responses. Students should describe the grasshopper eating or gripping the plant.\n- **Learning Objective 2** (Identify and compare body parts): Listen to explanations and review drawings. Students should name mouth, legs, and jaws.\n- **Learning Objective 3** (Explain why plants matter): Ask in Exit Ticket or discussion. Students should indicate that animals need plants for food.\n- **Learning Objective 4** (Apply learning): Review Elaborate activity matches and explanations. Students should correctly match herbivores to plant foods and explain their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"mouth,\" \"legs,\" and \"eat plants\" in early phases. Introduce \"herbivore\" and \"habitat\" after students show understanding of the basics.\n\n2. **Sentence frames for explanations:** Provide frames such as:\n   - *\"The grasshopper uses its __________ to grip the plant.\"*\n   - *\"The grasshopper eats __________ for food.\"*\n   - *\"The legs help the grasshopper by __________.\"*\n\n3. **Visual supports during Elaborate:** Provide picture cards with ONE animal-food pairing already done as an example. Then have students match only 2-3 additional pairs instead of many.\n\n4. **Pair with a peer mentor** during Explore and Elaborate phases to model behavior and thinking.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Compare herbivores and carnivores:** Show picture of a grasshopper and a ladybug (which eats other insects). Ask: *\"This grasshopper eats plants. This ladybug eats insects. How are their mouths different? How are they the same? Why are they different?\"* Guide investigation of how different foods require different adaptations.\n\n2. **Investigate the food chain:** Introduce the concept: *\"Grasshoppers eat plants. But what eats grasshoppers? Let's find out! A bird might eat a grasshopper. So: Plant → Grasshopper → Bird. Can you make a food chain?\"* Provide cards to arrange.\n\n3. **Design a new animal:** *\"Imagine a new animal that eats only seeds. What body parts would it need? Draw and label it. Explain why those body parts would help it eat seeds.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom Herbivore Hunt (15-20 minutes):**\n   Set up a small \"habitat\" in a box with plastic plants (or real clipped plants). Place toy grasshoppers, rabbits, caterpillars, and other herbivores. Students describe how each animal would use its body to eat the plants. Can be done as a center activity or whole group.\n\n2. **\"What Does Our Habitat Have?\" Nature Walk (20-30 minutes):**\n   Take students outside or to a school garden. Have them observe real plants and insects. Ask: *\"Can you find plants that an insect might eat? Can you find any insects eating? What are they eating? What body parts do you see them using?\"* Collect observations on a clipboard and report back to class. Create a class poster of local herbivores and their favorite plants.\n\n3. **Make a Grasshopper Puppet and Re-enactment (25-30 minutes):**\n   Give each student a paper plate, popsicle sticks, and markers to create a simple grasshopper puppet. Act out the \"grasshopper eating\" scene from the photograph. Ask: *\"Show us how your grasshopper would grip and eat a leaf. What body parts are moving?\"* This kinesthetic review reinforces understanding while keeping learning playful and memorable.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Safety reminder:** Ensure students wash hands after handling plant material.\n- **Allergy check:** Confirm no students are allergic to lettuce or other plant materials used in Explore.\n- **Photograph connection:** Return to the original photograph multiple times during the lesson. Each return deepens understanding.\n- **Real grasshoppers:** If possible, observe a real grasshopper in a classroom habitat for 1-2 days. Live observation adds powerful authenticity.\n- **Habitat emphasis:** Throughout, reinforce that the grasshopper and the plant are neighbors in the same place (habitat). This builds toward understanding ecosystems.\n\nThis lesson honors the 5E model by building from curiosity to exploration, then to formal understanding, and finally to application in new contexts. Second graders leave with clear, observable understanding of how animals' bodies are designed for eating—and they discovered it themselves.",
