ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about bird adaptations using the pelican photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the pelican (photograph from prompt)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: live pelican video clip (30 seconds) from YouTube\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen without saying what animal it is. Ask students to observe quietly for 20 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to activate curiosity:\n   - \"What animal do you think this is? What clues help you know?\"\n   - \"What is the most unusual or interesting body part you see? Why is it so big/long?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this animal lives? How can you tell from the water in the background?\"\n   - \"Why might a bird need such a long, flat bill? What job could that bill do?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to tell you this is a pelican. Before we learn more, turn to a partner and predict: How do you think that super-long bill helps the pelican catch food?\"\n\n4. **Record** student predictions on chart paper to revisit later in the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great predictions! Now we're going to explore how a pelican's body is perfectly designed to catch fish. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate pelican body parts and discover how structures help the bird survive through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed picture of the pelican (one per pair or small group)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Magnifying glasses (optional)\n- Index cards (3×5) with labels for body parts\n- Large poster paper for group investigation sheet\n- Optional: Images of other birds (robin, penguin, hummingbird) for comparison\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute materials.** Assign students to pairs or small groups (3-4 students).\n\n2. **Give student directions:**\n   - \"Look very carefully at your pelican picture using the magnifying glass if you have one.\"\n   - \"Find and circle these body parts: **bill, feathers, feet, wings, eyes, neck**.\"\n   - \"For each body part, color it a different color and label it using the index cards we provided.\"\n   - \"Now, think like a detective: **Why might the pelican need this body part?** Write or draw one idea next to each part. For example: 'Big bill = catches fish.'\"\n\n3. **Teacher circulates** and asks guiding questions without giving answers:\n   - \"What do you notice about the size of the bill compared to other birds?\"\n   - \"Those feet look different. What job might webbed feet do in the water?\"\n   - \"How might those dark feathers help the pelican?\"\n   - \"Where are the pelican's eyes? Why might that be important?\"\n\n4. **Students document** their observations on the poster paper in a simple diagram or chart format.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students identify 4-6 body parts of the pelican.\n- Students make initial connections between structures and function (even if imperfect).\n- Each group has a labeled diagram with reasoned ideas about each part's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and cement connections between pelican body structures and survival in water habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n- The original pelican photograph (projected)\n- Optional: Simple diagram of pelican anatomy\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gallery walk or share-out:** Have 2-3 groups share their labeled diagrams. Ask the class: \"Do you agree with their ideas? Why or why not?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly explanations:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and find food in its home. *\"The pelican's long bill is an adaptation for catching slippery fish.\"*\n   - **Inherited Trait:** A body part or characteristic that an animal's parents passed down to it. *\"Pelicans have long bills because their parents had long bills, and they passed this trait to their babies.\"*\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds what it needs to survive. *\"The pelican's habitat is the ocean and coastline where there are lots of fish.\"*\n   - **Survival:** Staying alive and healthy by having what you need. *\"The pelican's webbed feet help it survive in water by helping it swim and catch food.\"*\n\n3. **Revisit the photograph** and connect vocabulary:\n   - Point to the bill: \"This is an **adaptation.** Why? Because the big bill is perfect for scooping fish from the water. The pelican **inherited** this long bill from its parents.\"\n   - Point to the webbed feet: \"These help the pelican **survive** in its **habitat**—the ocean.\"\n   - Point to the waterproof feathers: \"These feathers help the pelican stay dry and warm in water.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:** Ask students to show thumbs up/middle/down for these statements:\n   - \"The pelican's long bill is an adaptation.\" (Should be thumbs up)\n   - \"Pelicans got their long bills because they practiced fishing a lot.\" (Should be thumbs down)\n   - \"The pelican's webbed feet help it survive in water.\" (Should be thumbs up)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students understand that adaptations are body parts that help animals survive.\n- Students recognize that traits like bill shape and webbed feet are inherited from parents.\n- Students connect specific pelican features to its ocean habitat and food-finding behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students deepen understanding by applying knowledge to compare pelicans with other birds and exploring how variation in traits matters.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of 3 other birds (robin, penguin, hummingbird, or duck—one per pair)\n- Comparison chart template (prepared in advance)\n- Colored pencils\n- Optional: Field guide pages or bird fact cards\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Comparative exploration:** Assign each pair or group a different bird image (not a pelican).\n\n2. **Give directions:**\n   - \"Look at your bird. Find and label: **bill, feet, feathers, wings.**\"\n   - \"Compare your bird to the pelican. How are the bills different? How are the feet different? Draw or write your ideas.\"\n   - \"Why do you think your bird's body parts are different from the pelican's? (Hint: Think about where it lives and what it eats.)\"\n\n3. **Examples to guide thinking:**\n   - Hummingbird: tiny, thin bill for sipping nectar from flowers\n   - Duck: flatter bill and webbed feet for swimming and dabbling in shallow water\n   - Robin: smaller, pointed bill for eating worms and insects\n   - Penguin: flipper-like wings for underwater swimming, no webbed feet (legs are at back)\n\n4. **Pair-share and discuss:** Ask 2-3 groups to share their comparisons. Emphasize: *\"Different birds have different body parts because they live in different habitats and eat different foods. These **inherited traits** help them survive.\"*\n\n5. **Transition to design challenge:** \"Now you're going to be animal engineers!\"\n\n6. **Design challenge (optional, if time allows):**\n   - \"Imagine a pelican had to move to a forest to live. What body parts would it need to change to survive? Draw or describe a 'Forest Pelican' with adaptations for catching insects or finding seeds in trees.\"\n   - Students sketch and label at least 2 changes they would make and explain why.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students articulate that different birds have different body structures suited to different habitats.\n- Students recognize that **variation** in traits among bird species reflects adaptation to environments.\n- Students can explain why a pelican's adaptations would NOT work well in a forest (deeper thinking).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of adaptations, inherited traits, and habitat fit.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Are students identifying body parts and making logical connections to function?\n- Thumbs check during Explain phase (see above).\n- Comparison chart accuracy during Elaborate phase: Can students identify differences and explain why?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper or digital form with these questions:\n\n1. **Draw and label** one body part of a pelican. *(Assess: Do they correctly identify a structure?)*\n\n2. **Write one sentence:** \"This body part helps the pelican survive because _______________.\" *(Assess: Can they connect structure to function in a water habitat?)*\n\n3. **True or False:** \"A pelican got its long bill because it practiced fishing every day.\"  **Explain your answer in one sentence.** *(Assess: Do they understand inherited traits vs. learned behaviors?)*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Proficient:** Student correctly labels a pelican body part, explains one realistic function related to water/fishing, and correctly answers the true/false with a reason about inherited traits.\n- **Developing:** Student labels a body part and gives a partially correct explanation or shows confusion about inherited vs. learned traits.\n- **Beginning:** Student struggles to identify parts or make meaningful connections.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate knowledge of at least 2-3 pelican adaptations.\n- Students understand that adaptations are inherited and help animals survive in their habitats.\n- Students show emerging ability to compare organisms based on their body structures.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce complexity:** During Explore, provide a simpler diagram with only 3-4 labeled body parts instead of 6. Use real photos rather than illustrations.\n\n2. **Sentence frames:** Provide sentence starters for written responses:\n   - \"This body part helps because it _______________.\"\n   - \"The pelican's _____________ is an adaptation for _______________.\"\n\n3. **Peer support:** Pair struggling readers/writers with stronger peers during Explore and Elaborate phases. Assign the struggling student the role of \"observer and drawer\" while the partner reads labels and directions.\n\n4. **Vocabulary support:** Provide a visual vocabulary wall with pictures of each term (adaptation, habitat, inherited, survival) posted throughout the lesson.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-habitat investigation:** Ask students to research and sketch how a pelican's body would need to change if it lived in a freshwater lake vs. the ocean. What adaptations would transfer? What would need to change?\n\n2. **Variation within species:** Provide images of multiple individual pelicans and ask: \"Do all pelicans look exactly the same? Find at least two differences in coloring, size, or markings. Why might these variations exist?\" (Connects to 3-LS3-1 on inherited variation.)\n\n3. **Food web connection:** Ask: \"Why is the pelican's ability to catch fish important not just for the pelican, but for the whole ocean ecosystem?\" Have them create a simple food chain showing what eats what.\n\n4. **Biomimicry design:** Challenge students to design a fishing net or swimming tool inspired by pelican adaptations. \"How could engineers copy the pelican's bill or feet to make better fishing equipment?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Pelican Life Cycle Poster:** Students research and illustrate the pelican's life cycle (egg, chick, juvenile, adult). Include labeled diagrams of how body parts develop and change. This extends to 3-LS1-1 on life cycles.\n\n2. **Bird Habitat Diorama:** Small groups create a shoebox diorama of a pelican's coastal habitat, including water, rocks or sand, and drawings of the pelican and other animals that share its habitat. This reinforces 3-LS4-3 on which organisms survive in particular habitats.\n\n3. **Interview a Pelican (Creative Writing):** Students write a short creative piece where they \"interview\" a pelican about its body parts: \"Dear Pelican, why do you have such a long bill? Sincerely, A Curious Student.\" The pelican responds, explaining each adaptation. This reinforces vocabulary in an engaging, low-pressure format.\n\n4. **Comparison Chart Poster:** Create a classroom poster comparing 4-5 birds (pelican, hummingbird, penguin, robin, eagle) with columns for bill shape, foot type, habitat, and food. Display in the classroom as a reference for future animal lessons.\n\n5. **Field Journal Observation:** If possible, visit a local park, zoo, or nature center with water birds. Students sketch and label birds they observe, noting similarities to and differences from the pelican. This connects classroom learning to real-world observation.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Pacing:** This lesson is flexible. You can compress Explore and Elaborate into a single 45-minute session if needed, or spread across two full class periods.\n- **Photo display:** Keep the pelican photograph visible throughout all five phases so students can continuously reference it.\n- **Vocabulary:** Third graders are still building vocabulary. Repeat key terms frequently and use pictures alongside words.\n- **Misconceptions to address:** Students may think adaptations are learned behaviors (e.g., \"The pelican got a long bill by practicing\"). Emphasize inherited traits come from parents, passed down through genes.\n- **Connection to other standards:** This lesson naturally bridges to 3-LS2-1 if you discuss how pelicans form groups/colonies. You can extend with a brief discussion: \"Why might pelicans fish together in groups?\" (Shared food source, safety in numbers.)\n\n---\n\nThis lesson uses the photograph as an authentic springboard for inquiry into real biological adaptation and inheritance—two cornerstones of Third Grade life science.",
