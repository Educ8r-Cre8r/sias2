ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about decomposition and fungi using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of stinkhorn mushroom (or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board without explanation. Let students observe silently for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pose one at a time, allowing 20-30 seconds of think-time before sharing):\n   - \"What is this organism, and where do you think it lives?\"\n   - \"Why do you think it has such a bright orange color? What job might that color help it do?\"\n   - \"If this mushroom is growing on wood chips, what do you think is happening to the wood chips over time?\"\n   - \"What would happen to all the dead leaves, branches, and wood in a forest if nothing broke them down?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... if there were NO mushrooms or fungi in the world, what would happen to all the dead stuff in nature?\" Ask students to turn and talk to a partner, then record 2-3 predictions on chart paper titled \"Our Questions About Decomposers.\"\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become fungal detectives and discover how mushrooms and fungi are nature's recyclers—and why we absolutely need them!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposition firsthand by observing and documenting how organic matter breaks down.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4-5 clear plastic jars or containers (one per small group)\n- Soil from outside or potting soil\n- Dead leaves, twigs, and wood chips (collected from outdoors or from the photograph observation)\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Magnifying glasses (1-2 per group)\n- Paper towels\n- **Student Decomposer Investigation Sheet** (see template below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Set Up the Decomposition Observation** (10 minutes)\n\n1. **Organize students into groups of 3-4.** Assign each group a jar and layer it as follows (provide written steps on a poster or board):\n   - Bottom layer: 2 inches of soil\n   - Middle layer: Dead leaves, small twigs, wood chips (mixed together)\n   - Top layer: 1 inch more soil\n   - Light spray of water (jar should be moist, not soggy)\n\n2. **Explain:** \"We're creating a mini-ecosystem where decomposers will go to work. Your job is to observe what happens to the dead material over time.\"\n\n3. **Each group places their jar in a designated area** (windowsill or shelf with indirect light).\n\n**Part B: Observe Existing Decomposition** (10-15 minutes)\n\n1. **Show students a pre-made decomposition jar** (prepared 2-3 weeks before this lesson) containing partially decomposed material, visible fungi, and mold.\n\n2. **Distribute magnifying glasses** and have groups take turns examining the jar closely. Ask:\n   - \"What do you observe? What changed compared to fresh leaves?\"\n   - \"Do you see anything white, fuzzy, or unusual? What might that be?\"\n   - \"Where do you think the dead leaves went?\"\n\n3. **Each student completes the Decomposer Investigation Sheet** by:\n   - Sketching what they observe in the jar\n   - Recording 3 observations about changes to the materials\n   - Writing 2 questions they have about what's happening\n   - Making a prediction: \"In 2 weeks, I think the dead material will...\" and explaining why\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate among groups, ask guiding questions (\"What do fungi need to survive?\", \"Where do fungi come from?\"), but do NOT explain the process yet. Listen to their ideas and encourage observation-based thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students will observe visible signs of decomposition (smaller pieces, color change, fungal growth) and begin connecting this to the stinkhorn photograph. They will record observations and develop testable questions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration; connect observations back to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Whiteboard or chart paper\n- Markers\n- Photograph of stinkhorn mushroom (displayed again)\n- Simple diagram showing nutrient cycle (teacher-created or provided)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out** (5 minutes)\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share ONE observation from their investigation.\n   - Record findings on chart paper titled \"What We Discovered About Decomposition.\"\n   - Listen for any mention of fungi, changes in size, or materials disappearing.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (8 minutes)\n   - Define and discuss each term using the photograph and student observations:\n\n   | Vocabulary Term | Student-Friendly Definition | Connection to Photo/Explore |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Decomposer** | A living thing that eats dead plants and animals and breaks them into smaller pieces. Fungi (like mushrooms) are decomposers. | The stinkhorn is a decomposer growing on dead wood. |\n   | **Nutrient** | Useful material (like minerals) that living things need to grow and stay healthy. Plants get nutrients from soil. | As fungi break down dead wood, they turn it into nutrients that go back into the soil. |\n   | **Decomposition** | The process of breaking down dead material into smaller and smaller pieces. | What we observed in the jars—the leaves getting smaller and disappearing. |\n   | **Fungi** (plural) / **Fungus** (singular) | Living organisms that are NOT plants or animals. They get food by breaking down dead material. | Mushrooms, mold, and yeast are all fungi. |\n   | **Spore** | A tiny, dust-like piece that fungi make to create new fungi elsewhere. | The stinkhorn's special smell and color help spread spores to new locations. |\n\n3. **Explain the Nutrient Cycle** (5-7 minutes)\n   - Display a simple, labeled diagram:\n     \n     ```\n     PLANTS absorb nutrients from SOIL\n             ↓\n     ANIMALS eat plants (and each other)\n             ↓\n     Dead plants & animals fall to ground\n             ↓\n     DECOMPOSERS (fungi) break down dead material\n             ↓\n     Nutrients return to SOIL\n             ↓\n     [Cycle repeats]\n     ```\n\n   - Point to the stinkhorn photo: \"This mushroom is a decomposer. It's doing the job of returning nutrients to the soil. Without it and other fungi, the cycle would stop, and plants wouldn't get the nutrients they need to grow.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding** (2 minutes)\n   - Ask: \"Turn to a partner and answer this: Why are decomposers important to plants? Use the word 'nutrients' in your answer.\"\n   - Listen to 2-3 pairs share responses. Correct any misconceptions gently.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Decomposer:** An organism that breaks down dead plants and animals, returning nutrients to the soil. (Fungi are decomposers.)\n- **Nutrient:** A substance that living things need to grow, like minerals in soil.\n- **Decomposition:** The breaking down of dead material by decomposers.\n- **Fungi/Fungus:** Living organisms (not plants or animals) that get food by decomposing dead material.\n- **Spore:** A tiny, lightweight piece produced by fungi that can grow into a new fungus.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students understand that decomposers break down dead material, that this returns nutrients to soil, and that plants depend on this process to survive. They recognize the stinkhorn as a decomposer.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by modeling nutrient cycling and exploring adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Nutrient Cycle Model Kit** (per group):\n  - Index cards labeled: \"Plant,\" \"Animal,\" \"Dead Organism,\" \"Decomposer,\" \"Nutrient in Soil\"\n  - Yarn or string\n  - Tape\n  - Diagram template (provided)\n- Chart paper or large paper for drawing\n- Colored markers or pencils\n- Optional: Images of different fungi (mushrooms, mold, yeast)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Nutrient Cycle Model (Hands-On)** — Recommended for most students\n\n1. **Distribute the Nutrient Cycle Model Kit** to each group of 3-4.\n\n2. **Instructions:**\n   - Arrange the five labeled index cards on chart paper to represent the stages of nutrient cycling.\n   - Using yarn, connect the cards with arrows to show HOW nutrients move from one stage to the next.\n   - On the lines/arrows, write or draw WHAT happens at each step (e.g., \"Decomposer breaks down dead material\" → \"Nutrients go into soil\").\n   - Leave space to draw simple pictures of each stage.\n\n3. **Circulate and ask:**\n   - \"Where does the stinkhorn fit in this cycle?\"\n   - \"What would happen if we removed the decomposer card?\"\n   - \"Why do plants need this cycle to keep happening?\"\n\n4. **Group presentations:** 1-2 groups share their models and explain one connection in the cycle.\n\n**Option B: Adaptation Investigation (Higher Challenge)**\n\n1. Show students images of different fungi (morel, puffball, shelf fungus, stinkhorn).\n\n2. **Prompt:** \"Each fungus looks different. Why might the stinkhorn have that bright orange color and smell? How does that help it survive and spread its spores?\"\n\n3. Have students research (with provided images/texts) and create a labeled diagram showing how the stinkhorn's adaptations help it reproduce.\n\n**Teacher Role:** Facilitate group work. Ask probing questions. For Option A, ensure students understand that the cycle is CONTINUOUS (nutrients cycle again and again). For Option B, guide students to think about how organisms attract animals or use senses (smell, sight) to survive.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students create a visual or physical model showing the flow of nutrients through an ecosystem.\n- Students explain verbally or in writing how decomposers fit into the cycle and why plants depend on them.\n- Advanced students identify and explain adaptations of fungi and connect them to survival/reproduction.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of decomposers and nutrient cycling.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage (predictions, discussion contributions)\n- Review Decomposer Investigation Sheets from Explore for evidence of observation skills and question-asking\n- Listen to partner shares during Explain (nutrient explanation check)\n- Assess Elaborate models for understanding of cycle and decomposer role\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nDistribute an index card or digital form with these questions. Students complete individually (5-7 minutes):\n\n1. **\"What is a decomposer? Give an example of a decomposer.\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student correctly defines decomposer as an organism that breaks down dead material AND names fungi/mushrooms as an example.\n\n2. **\"Look at this picture of a stinkhorn mushroom [photo provided]. Explain why decomposers like this are important to a forest.\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student mentions that decomposers break down dead material, return nutrients to soil, and/or help plants get what they need to grow.\n\n3. **\"Draw or describe the path that a nutrient takes as it moves from dead wood → soil → plant → animal. Start and end with 'decomposer.'\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student shows all five steps (or most) in correct order, with decomposer playing the role of breaking down dead material.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students demonstrate understanding of decomposer role and nutrient cycling through written/drawn responses.\n- Most students (80%+) correctly identify decomposers and explain their importance.\n- Students show evidence of understanding the CYCLICAL nature of nutrient movement (not a one-time event).\n- Exit tickets reveal any misconceptions to address in follow-up mini-lessons.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a visual chart with pictures for each vocabulary term (decomposer, nutrient, spore). Keep it displayed throughout the lesson. Allow students to reference it during Explain and Evaluate.\n\n2. **Graphic Organizer for Nutrient Cycle:** Provide a pre-drawn cycle diagram with blanks to fill in (rather than building from scratch). Example:\n   ```\n   Dead leaves → [DECOMPOSER breaks them down] → Nutrients go to [SOIL] → [PLANT] absorbs them...\n   ```\n   Use pictures in addition to words.\n\n3. **Paired Exit Ticket:** Allow struggling students to complete the exit ticket with a partner or with teacher prompting. Accept verbal responses (teacher transcribes) instead of requiring written text.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deep Dive into Adaptations:** Provide research cards or a short video about how different fungi have unique adaptations (smell, color, shape) to spread spores. Ask: \"Why does the stinkhorn smell bad? What animals does that attract? How does that help the stinkhorn?\" Students create an explanation poster.\n\n2. **Compare Decomposers:** Give students images of bacteria, fungi, and earthworms. Task: Research and explain differences in HOW each decomposer breaks down dead material and WHERE they live in an ecosystem. Create a Venn diagram comparing any two decomposers.\n\n3. **Model Extension – Compost Cycle:** Ask: \"What if humans want to speed up decomposition for composting? What conditions would help decomposers work faster?\" Students design a compost system (on paper or with materials) and explain their choices using nutrient cycling knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Start a Real Compost Jar (Ongoing Observation Project)**\n   - Use a clear plastic jar with layers: soil, food scraps (fruit/vegetable only), shredded paper, soil again. Moisten and seal with a lid (poke tiny air holes).\n   - Students observe weekly and record changes over 4-6 weeks. They document when fungi appear, estimate decomposition progress, and photograph the process.\n   - *Connection:* Real-world application of decomposition and nutrient cycling; builds long-term observation skills.\n\n2. **Fungi Hunt & Field Guide**\n   - Take students on a nature walk to identify fungi in your school's outdoor area (mushrooms, mold on logs, etc.).\n   - Photograph or sketch each fungus found (do NOT pick without permission/expertise). Record location and substrate (what it's growing on).\n   - Create a class field guide with descriptions and drawings: \"Fungi We Found in Our School Ecosystem.\"\n   - *Connection:* Ecological observation; understand decomposers in real habitats.\n\n3. **Decomposition Experiment: Compare Materials**\n   - Design a controlled experiment: Place identical dead leaves in jars with DIFFERENT conditions:\n     - Jar A: Moist soil + leaves (ideal for decomposition)\n     - Jar B: Dry soil + leaves (no moisture)\n     - Jar C: Moist sand + leaves (no nutrients)\n   - Hypothesize, observe weekly, and record which jar shows fastest decomposition.\n   - Data chart and conclusion: \"What do decomposers need to do their job?\"\n   - *Connection:* Scientific method, variables in decomposition, deeper understanding of decomposer requirements.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Remind students that wild mushrooms should NEVER be touched or eaten. The stinkhorn is harmless to touch but has a pungent smell—some students may react strongly; prepare them before showing the photo.\n- **Timing:** If you don't have a pre-made decomposition jar ready, use high-quality photos or a short video (30 seconds) showing fungal growth on dead wood as a visual substitute for Explore Part B.\n- **Real-World Connection:** Mention that compost facilities use decomposers on purpose to turn food waste into soil for gardens. This shows relevance to students' lives.\n- **Misconception Alert:** Many students think decomposers \"eat\" nutrients—clarify that decomposers break DOWN dead material and release nutrients back INTO the soil. The nutrients don't disappear; they change form.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly uses the stinkhorn photograph as a springboard for understanding decomposers and nutrient cycling—core 5th-grade life science concepts aligned with NGSS 5-LS2-1. Students move from curiosity (Engage) to observation (Explore) to formal understanding (Explain) to application (Elaborate) to demonstrated mastery (Evaluate).",
