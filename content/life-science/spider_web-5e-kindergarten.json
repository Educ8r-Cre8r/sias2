ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about spiders and how animals meet their needs.\n- **Materials:** \n  - Large printed or projected image of the spider web photograph\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Spider toy or picture of a spider (to show alongside the web image)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  - Display the spider web photograph on the board or projector. Let students observe silently for 20-30 seconds.\n  - Ask: \"What do you see in this picture? What is it?\" (Allow students to identify the web and spider's home.)\n  - Follow with: \"Why do you think a spider would make something like this? What could it use it for?\"\n  - Ask: \"What do spiders need to live? Do they need food? Where does food come from for a spider?\"\n  - Prompt: \"Make a guess—how does a spider use this web to get food and stay alive?\"\n  - Record student ideas on chart paper (accept all reasonable answers).\n\n- **Transition:** Now we're going to explore how spiders use their special skills to build and use webs to get food and survive, just like the picture shows.\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students investigate web-like structures and understand how they catch and hold objects (simulating food capture).\n- **Materials:**\n  - Yarn or string (white or light-colored, cut into 12-18 inch pieces)\n  - Tape (masking tape or painter's tape)\n  - Wooden dowels, pencils, or sticks (one per student or pair)\n  - Small paper balls or pompoms (to represent \"food\" or insects)\n  - Cardboard pieces or foam board (optional, for mounting structures)\n  - Worksheet with simple pictures to draw on\n\n- **Activity:**\n  - Divide students into pairs or small groups.\n  - Give each pair/group a stick/dowel, several pieces of yarn, and tape.\n  - **Student Directions:**\n    1. Use the tape to attach your stick to the center of your cardboard (or hold it upright).\n    2. Stretch pieces of yarn from the stick outward and tape the other ends down—make a web pattern like the picture we saw.\n    3. Make your web sticky by wrapping more yarn around and crossing it, like the web in the photo.\n    4. Now, try to toss your small paper ball (the \"food\") onto your web. Does it stick or get caught?\n    5. If it doesn't work, adjust your web pattern and try again.\n  - **Connection to Photograph:** As they work, point out: \"Spiders build real webs just like you're making now. The spider's web is sticky to catch real insects and bugs for food.\"\n  - **Documentation:** Have students draw a picture of their web on a worksheet and label it with \"web\" and \"food.\"\n  - **Teacher Role:** Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"How is your web like the spider's web in the photo? What happens when the ball touches your strings? Why do you think real spider webs need to be sticky?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** Students create a simple web structure, test how it catches objects, and begin to understand that webs are tools for catching food.\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize concepts about how spiders use webs to survive.\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper with key vocabulary\n  - Spider web photograph (displayed again)\n  - Picture cards of spiders, insects, and food chains (optional)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  - Gather students on the carpet. Display the spider web photo again.\n  - Ask: \"What did you discover when you built your webs? Did they help catch your food?\" (Discuss results.)\n  - Introduce the concept: \"Spiders are animals. All animals need food to survive and grow. Spiders need to eat bugs and insects.\"\n  - Explain: \"A spider has a special body part called a **spinner** (or **spinnerets**) at the end of its body. It makes silk that comes out like a thread. The spider uses this silk to build its web.\"\n  - Point to the photo: \"See how the web is all connected in circles and lines? The spider built it this way so that when a bug flies into it, the bug gets stuck. Then the spider eats the bug. This helps the spider survive!\"\n  - Connect to survival: \"Just like you need food, water, and a safe place to sleep, spiders need food, and their webs help them get food. The web is like a home and a kitchen for the spider!\"\n  - **Check for Understanding:** Ask students to show with thumbs: \"Do you understand that spiders build webs to catch food?\" Then ask: \"Why do spiders need food?\"\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Spider:** A small animal with eight legs that spins webs to catch food\n  - **Web:** A sticky net that a spider builds to catch insects and bugs for food\n  - **Silk:** A thin, strong thread that comes from a spider's body\n  - **Food:** What animals eat to grow and have energy to live\n  - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** Students understand that spiders build webs to catch food, which is something they need to survive.\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding by comparing how different animals meet the need for food in different ways.\n- **Materials:**\n  - Picture cards of different animals (bird with nest, cat with mouth open, rabbit with food, ant with trail, spider with web)\n  - Chart paper labeled \"How Animals Get Food\"\n  - Crayons and paper\n\n- **Activity:**\n  - Display pictures of different animals: a bird, a cat, a rabbit, an ant, and a spider.\n  - Ask: \"These are all animals. How does each one get food? Do they all use webs?\"\n  - Discuss:\n    - **Spider:** Uses a web to catch insects\n    - **Bird:** Uses a beak to pick up seeds and bugs\n    - **Cat:** Uses claws and teeth to hunt\n    - **Rabbit:** Uses teeth to eat plants and vegetables\n    - **Ant:** Walks to find food and carries it home\n  - Create a class chart titled \"How Different Animals Get Food\" with pictures and simple descriptions.\n  - Explain: \"All these animals need food to survive, but they get food in different ways. Spiders use webs. Birds use beaks. Rabbits eat plants. Each animal's body helps it get what it needs.\"\n  - **Activity:** Give each student a piece of paper with an animal picture. Students draw that animal and add a picture of what it eats or how it gets food.\n  - **Teacher Role:** Guide discussion and ask: \"Why do you think this animal eats this food? What part of its body helps it?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** Students recognize that different animals use different body parts and behaviors to get food, and all animals need food to survive.\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of how spiders use webs to meet their survival needs.\n\n- **Activity:**\n  - **Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n    - Observe student participation during the Engage discussion and note which students can identify what spiders eat.\n    - During Explore, watch how students build their web and test it; note if they understand the connection to catching food.\n    - During the Explain vocabulary section, ask students to repeat key words and check for comprehension.\n  \n  - **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n    Ask each student the following questions (one-on-one or as a group, since students are in kindergarten):\n    1. **\"What does a spider use to catch its food?\"** (Expected answer: A web, or \"the web\")\n    2. **\"Why do spiders need food?\"** (Expected answer: To live, to grow, to survive, to have energy)\n    3. **\"Show me with your fingers how a spider makes its web.\"** (Students mime spinning motions)\n    4. **\"What is one thing a spider needs to survive?\"** (Expected answer: Food, water, shelter, or a home)\n  \n  - **Success Criteria:**\n    - Students can identify that spiders build webs\n    - Students understand that webs are used to catch food (insects/bugs)\n    - Students recognize that food is something spiders need to survive\n    - Students can name at least one other animal and explain what it eats\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** Students demonstrate understanding that spiders build webs to catch food, and food is a survival need for all animals. They can explain this in simple words and connect it to their web-building activity.\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n  1. **Simplified Web Building:** Provide pre-cut yarn pieces and show students exactly where to tape them. Use fewer pieces (4-6 strands instead of many), so the task is less overwhelming.\n  2. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:** Focus on two key words only: \"**spider**\" and \"**food**.\" Use pictures and simple sentences: \"Spider needs food. Web catches food.\"\n  3. **One-on-One Questioning:** During Explain and Evaluate, ask simpler yes/no questions: \"Does a spider catch food in its web? Yes or no?\" before open-ended questions.\n\n- **Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n  1. **Web Design Investigation:** Ask: \"Can you make your web catch more food? How could you change your web pattern?\" Let them experiment with different designs and test which works best.\n  2. **Connect to Real Spiders:** Show images of different types of real spider webs (orb webs, funnel webs, sheet webs). Ask: \"Why do you think different spiders build different webs? What kind of insects might they catch?\"\n  3. **Survival Needs Expansion:** Challenge students to name ALL the things a spider needs to survive: food, water, shelter, air. Create a class \"Spider Needs\" poster with drawings for each.\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Spider Web Art Project:** Students use black paint or markers on white paper to create their own artistic version of a spider web. Display alongside the original photo for comparison. Students can label their webs and write/dictate one sentence about why spiders make webs.\n\n2. **Classroom Spider Web Hunt:** Take students on a supervised outdoor walk or look around the classroom/playground to find a real spider web (if safe and available). Use binoculars or a magnifying glass to observe it closely. Ask: \"Is this web like the one in our photo? Can you see the pattern? Is anything caught in it?\" Take a photo to display in the classroom.\n\n3. **Story Time & Acting:** Read a simple picture book about spiders (e.g., *The Very Busy Spider* by Eric Carle or *Spider Spins a Web* by Lynda Jones). After reading, have students act out being spiders building their webs with movement and dance. Connect back to the original photo: \"This is how real spiders move when they spin!\"\n\n4. **Insect Matching Game:** Create picture cards of insects (fly, ant, mosquito, butterfly) and have students match them to different animals that eat them (spider, bird, frog, bat). This reinforces the concept that different animals need different foods to survive.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:** This lesson emphasizes K-LS1-1 by helping students observe and describe what spiders (as animals) need to survive—specifically, food—and how their web-building behavior is an adaptation that meets that need. The photograph serves as the anchor for all activities, and the lesson progresses from concrete exploration to abstract vocabulary and broader animal comparisons, which is developmentally appropriate for kindergarten learners.",
