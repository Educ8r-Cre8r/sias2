ENGAGE (10-12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about animal body parts and habitats using the photograph of white ibises.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed image of white ibises in the wetland\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen without explanation. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds in silence.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about this bird's beak? Why do you think it's so long and curved?\"\n   - \"Look at the bird's legs—are they long or short? Why might a bird need legs like that?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this bird lives? What clues in the picture tell you that?\"\n   - \"How is this bird different from a robin or a chicken you might see in a yard?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations** on chart paper as they respond. Encourage \"I notice...\" and \"I wonder...\" statements without judging accuracy.\n\n4. **Create a class wonder question together:** \"How do the body parts of this bird help it live in this watery, muddy place?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to explore how animals have special body parts that help them live in different homes. Let's become detectives and investigate how this bird's body fits its habitat!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how animal body structures connect to habitats through hands-on exploration and comparison.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of white ibises (one per small group)\n- Picture cards of other animals: robin, duck, penguin, owl, deer, lizard (printed or drawn simple versions)\n- Picture cards of different habitats: wetland, forest, desert, grassland, ocean, mountain\n- Rulers or paper strips (to measure pretend beaks)\n- Shallow pan of water mixed with sand/soil\n- Craft sticks, straws, or plastic tweezers\n- Small pom-poms or beads (to represent food items like insects or small fish)\n- Chart paper for recording\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Physical Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide students into groups of 3-4.\n\n2. **Assign each group one of these tasks:**\n   - **Group 1:** Use a craft stick or straw to poke into the wet sand/soil mixture. Try to find and pick up the hidden pom-poms (representing food). Record: \"What was easy? What was hard?\"\n   - **Group 2:** Try the same task but use a tweezer or short pencil instead. Record: \"What was easier or harder with this tool?\"\n   - **Group 3:** Try using just their fingers to find items in the sand. Record observations about which method worked best.\n\n3. **Teacher facilitates** by asking: \"Which tool worked best for finding food in the wet mud? Why?\" (Do NOT answer—let students discover.)\n\n4. **Reconnect to photo:** \"The ibis's long, curved beak is like one of these tools. Which tool do you think it's most like? Why?\"\n\n**Part B: Habitat Matching (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. Lay out habitat cards (wetland, forest, desert, etc.) on tables.\n\n2. Give each student or pair 2-3 animal cards (ibis, fox, cactus wren, squirrel, penguin, etc.).\n\n3. **Students match** each animal to the habitat where it belongs and explain their thinking: \"This animal lives here because…\"\n\n4. **Teacher circulates and asks probing questions:**\n   - \"Why does the ibis belong in a wetland and not a desert?\"\n   - \"What body parts does this animal have that help it live here?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that long, pointed tools work better for probing in mud than short ones or fingers.\n- Students recognize that different animals have different body parts suited to different habitats.\n- Students produce written or drawn records of their observations.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and concepts observed during exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with ibis photograph\n- Large printed labels or pictures for body parts\n- Habitat comparison chart (template provided below)\n- Vocabulary posters (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 2-3 groups to share what they discovered during the \"tool in the mud\" activity. Guide discussion: \"How is the ibis's beak like the best tool for finding food?\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with student-friendly definitions:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. (Example: \"An ibis has a long beak—that's an adaptation that helps it find food in the mud.\")\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives, with water, food, shelter, and other things it needs. (Example: \"A wetland is the ibis's habitat.\")\n   - **Body structure:** The shape and parts of an animal's body. (Example: \"Long legs and a curved beak are ibis body structures.\")\n   - **Diversity:** Many different kinds of animals and plants living in different places. (Example: \"A forest has different animals than a wetland—that's diversity.\")\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the ibis's beak: \"This long, curved beak is an **adaptation**. It helps the ibis find tiny fish and insects in the shallow **habitat** of the wetland.\"\n   - Point to the legs: \"These long, skinny legs are another **adaptation**. They let the ibis walk through water without getting stuck in the mud.\"\n   - Point to the wetland: \"This **habitat** has shallow water, mud, and plants. This is exactly where an ibis needs to be to survive.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show the ibis picture and ask: \"If we moved this ibis to a desert, would its long beak still help it find food? Why or why not?\" (Students should recognize that the adaptation matches the specific habitat.)\n   - Ask: \"What would a bird that lives in a forest need to be different about to live in a wetland?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the term \"adaptation\" correctly to describe ibis body parts.\n- Students explain that the ibis's beak and legs help it live in water and mud.\n- Students recognize that different animals have different adaptations for different habitats.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to design their own adapted animal or compare real animals across habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Drawing paper or digital drawing tool\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Picture cards of animals from different habitats (optional reference)\n- Chart: \"Animal Adaptation Designer\" (template below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Design an Adapted Animal (recommended for most students)**\n\n1. Present this scenario: \"We're going to invent a new animal that lives in a **rainforest** (wet, dense trees, lots of plants). What body parts does it need to survive there?\"\n\n2. Students draw or sketch a rainforest animal and label 2-3 adaptations:\n   - What kind of beak or mouth does it need? Why?\n   - What kind of feet or legs? Why?\n   - What color or covering helps it survive?\n\n3. **Students write or dictate** a sentence for each adaptation: \"My animal has [body part] because it lives in a [habitat] and needs to [survive/find food/hide/etc.].\"\n\n4. Students share their designs with a partner or small group, explaining the adaptations.\n\n**Option B: Real Animal Comparison (for extended learning)**\n\n1. Show pictures of four real animals: ibis (wetland), woodpecker (forest), roadrunner (desert), penguin (arctic/ocean).\n\n2. Create a comparison chart together:\n   - **Animal Name | Habitat | Body Structures | What the structures help it do**\n\n3. Students identify the pattern: each animal's body is perfectly designed for its specific habitat.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate by asking: \"Why did you give your animal that beak/legs/color?\"\n- Guide students to connect adaptations to specific habitat challenges.\n- Validate all creative designs while reinforcing the adaptation concept.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design an animal with at least 2 adaptations suited to a specific habitat.\n- Students explain the purpose of each adaptation using scientific language.\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding by recognizing patterns across multiple animals.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of adaptations and habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage and Explore phases—are they noticing body parts and connecting them to function?\n- Listen to student explanations during Elaborate—do they use \"adaptation\" and \"habitat\" correctly?\n- Review student drawings and labels for accuracy and reasoning.\n\n**Exit Ticket or Summative Assessment (choose one):**\n\n**Option A: Picture-Based Questions (2-3 minutes)**\n\nDisplay a picture of an ibis again. Ask students to answer orally or with drawings:\n1. \"Point to one body part of the ibis that is an adaptation. How does it help the bird survive in the wetland?\"\n2. \"If we moved an ibis to a desert, would its long beak still be helpful? Why or why not?\"\n3. \"What do we call the place where an animal lives?\" (Student should say \"habitat.\")\n\n**Option B: Short Written/Drawn Response**\n\nProvide a sentence frame:\n- \"The ibis has a long beak because _______________.\"\n- \"The ibis lives in a wetland because _______________.\"\n- \"An adaptation is a body part that helps an animal _______________ in its home.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Students correctly identify at least one adaptation of the ibis.\n\n✓ Students explain how an adaptation connects to the habitat (e.g., \"The long beak helps it find food in the mud\").\n\n✓ Students use the word \"adaptation\" or \"habitat\" accurately in context.\n\n✓ Students demonstrate understanding that different animals have different body parts suited to different places.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will identify the beak and/or legs as adaptations.\n- Most students will explain that these body parts help the ibis find food or move through water/mud.\n- Students will show emerging understanding that habitats and adaptations are connected.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce visual complexity:** Provide close-up photos of just the ibis's beak and legs separately, with labels. Have students focus on one adaptation at a time rather than the whole bird.\n\n2. **Sentence stems for explanation:** Provide fill-in-the-blank sentence starters:\n   - \"The ibis's beak is long because the ibis needs to _____.\"\n   - \"The ibis lives in a _____ where there is water and mud.\"\n\n3. **Concrete matching activity:** Use only 2-3 habitats and 2-3 animals for habitat matching, rather than the full set. Pair students with a stronger partner or provide a labeled reference chart.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-habitat comparison:** Ask students to research or compare how different water birds (ibis, heron, pelican, flamingo) have different beak shapes suited to different ways of eating. Create a comparison chart explaining why each beak shape is an adaptation.\n\n2. **Design a new habitat:** Students design a completely new habitat and draw/describe what kind of animal body parts would be needed to survive there. Challenge them to think of at least 4 adaptations.\n\n3. **Prediction task:** Show students a picture of an unfamiliar animal (e.g., a flamingo, spoonbill, or hummingbird). Ask: \"What habitat do you think this animal lives in? What body parts gave you that clue?\" Students make and justify predictions based on observable features.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Field Journal: Local Bird Observations**\n   - Take students on a nature walk around the school grounds or park. Have them sketch and observe local birds (robins, sparrows, ducks, etc.). For each bird, students draw or list one body part and guess: \"Where does this bird live? What does it eat? Why does it look this way?\"\n   - Create a class book: \"Birds in Our Neighborhood.\"\n\n2. **Habitat Diorama Project**\n   - Students work individually or in pairs to create a small diorama (shoebox, paper plate, or poster board) of a wetland or another habitat. They include the ibis (drawn or from a magazine cutout) and label the habitat features (water, plants, mud). They write 2-3 sentences explaining why the ibis lives there.\n\n3. **Interactive Adaptation Matching Game**\n   - Create a classroom game (digital or physical) where students match animal body parts (long beak, sharp claws, thick fur, webbed feet, etc.) to habitats and survival needs. Examples:\n     - Webbed feet → water habitat (swimming)\n     - Sharp claws → forest habitat (climbing)\n     - Long legs → grassland habitat (running from predators)\n     - Thick fur → cold habitat (staying warm)\n\n4. **Read-Aloud Connection:**\n   - Share a picture book about wetland animals or birds (e.g., *Come Along, Daisy* by Jane Simmons or *In the Swamp* by John Himmelman). Pause to discuss how each animal shown is adapted to the wetland habitat.\n\n5. **Virtual Wetland Exploration:**\n   - Use online resources or videos (e.g., nature documentaries, YouTube, or educational websites) to show students footage of real ibises and other wetland creatures in action. Students record observations about behaviors and adaptations they see.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
