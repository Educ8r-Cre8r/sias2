ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of a grasshopper on a plant leaf.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of grasshopper on plant leaf (displayed on projector/smartboard or printed large format)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without any introduction or labels. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about the color of this animal? Why do you think it might be green?\"\n   - \"Look at those long back legs. What do you think this animal uses them for?\"\n   - \"What do you see those long, thin things sticking out of its head? What might those be used for?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this animal lives, and what do you think it eats?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate prediction:** Ask students to turn and talk: *\"If this grasshopper eats only plants, how is it connected to the plant it's sitting on? Is it just eating the plant, or is something else happening?\"* Invite 2-3 pairs to share their thinking.\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper under \"What We Think We Know About Grasshoppers.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to discover how grasshoppers are perfectly designed for their habitat and how they're connected to the plants and animals around them in ways you might not expect.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate grasshopper external structures and develop understanding of how body parts function for survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Live grasshoppers in clear containers (3-4 for whole class observation) OR high-quality photographs/video clips of grasshoppers (if live specimens unavailable)\n- Hand lenses (1 per pair of students)\n- Observation recording sheets (provided template)\n- Rulers\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **In pairs,** you will observe a grasshopper carefully for 5 minutes. Use your hand lens to look closely.\n\n2. **On your observation sheet,** draw the grasshopper and label these parts as you find them:\n   - Antennae (the long, thin feelers on its head)\n   - Eyes (small dots on the side of the head)\n   - Front legs (shorter pair near the head)\n   - Middle legs (middle pair)\n   - Back legs (the longest pair — these are special!)\n   - Abdomen (the rear section of the body)\n\n3. **Measure** the length of the grasshopper's back legs using a ruler. Write down the measurement. *How does this compare to the grasshopper's total body length?*\n\n4. **Move the container gently** to observe how the grasshopper moves. On your sheet, write: *What does this animal do with those long back legs? Why would that be helpful if it lived on plants?*\n\n5. **Observe the antennae** closely. *How might the grasshopper use these? What might it be \"feeling\" or \"sensing\"?*\n\n6. **Color observations:** Why do you think this grasshopper is green and brown? *Where does it live? How does its color help it?*\n\n**Connections to the Photograph:**\nStudents note that the grasshopper in the photo is positioned on a leaf and ask: \"Is the grasshopper hiding? What could it be hiding from? What else might eat a grasshopper?\"\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Labeled diagram of grasshopper with measurements\n- Written predictions about what each body part does\n- Notes about movement and how it relates to its environment\n- Color observations and camouflage discussion\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"What does that body part remind you of? Have you seen anything similar?\"* and *\"How might that help the grasshopper survive?\"*\n- Do not provide direct answers; encourage careful observation and inference.\n- Manage live specimens safely; ensure students handle containers gently.\n- For classes without live grasshoppers, facilitate close observation of high-quality images or videos, asking the same guiding questions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents produce detailed observations connecting body structures to function and recognize the grasshopper's adaptations to life on plants. They begin to infer that external structures are related to survival needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts, connecting observations to ecosystem roles and matter movement.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary definitions\n- Photograph of grasshopper\n- Simple food chain diagram (drawn on board or chart)\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations:** Invite 3-4 pairs to share their labeled diagrams and what they discovered about grasshopper body parts. Use a document camera or have students hold up their work.\n\n2. **Introduce and define key vocabulary:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and thrive in its environment. Example: A grasshopper's long legs are an adaptation for jumping away from danger.\n   - **External structure:** A body part you can see on the outside of an animal that has a specific job. Example: Legs, antennae, and eyes are external structures.\n   - **Camouflage:** Coloring or patterns that help an animal blend in with its surroundings so it is harder to see. Example: The grasshopper's green and brown colors match plant leaves, providing camouflage.\n   - **Consumer:** An animal that eats plants or other animals to get energy. Example: A grasshopper is a consumer because it eats plants.\n   - **Producer:** A plant that makes its own food using sunlight, air, and water. Example: Grass and plant leaves are producers.\n\n3. **Draw connections to ecosystems:**\n   - \"The grasshopper's structures help it do three big things: **find food, move safely, and hide from predators.** But there's something else important — the grasshopper connects the plant to the rest of the ecosystem.\"\n   - Draw a simple food chain on the board: **Plant (Grass Leaf) → Grasshopper → Bird**\n   - \"The plant takes energy from the sun and makes food. The grasshopper eats the plant and takes that energy. When a bird eats the grasshopper, energy moves again. Matter (the stuff that makes up the plant) also moves through this chain.\"\n\n4. **Refer back to the photograph:** \"Look at our original picture. That grasshopper is standing on a leaf. It's not just sitting there randomly — it's part of a whole system where energy and matter keep moving.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why are the grasshopper's back legs so long and powerful?\" (Students should answer: to jump away from danger, to move across plants, etc.)\n   - Ask: \"What would happen to the bird population if all the grasshoppers disappeared?\" (Students should begin to think about interconnected food chains.)\n   - Ask: \"Where does the grasshopper get the energy it needs?\" (From plants, which get energy from the sun.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents understand that grasshopper structures are adaptations for survival, and they can explain the grasshopper's role in an ecosystem where energy and matter flow from plants through consumers.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by creating and analyzing models of food chains and ecosystem relationships.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Food chain card sets (pictures of: sun, grass, grasshopper, bird, fox, decomposer)\n- Large paper or poster board\n- Glue sticks and scissors\n- Markers\n- \"Energy Flow\" worksheet with diagram outline\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Build a food chain model:** In small groups, students receive a set of organisms including the grasshopper. They arrange the cards in order showing how energy flows from the sun through the food chain.\n\n2. **Create a visual representation:** Students glue cards onto poster board and draw arrows showing the direction of energy flow. They label: Producer, Consumer, and the role of the sun.\n\n3. **Extend thinking with a scenario:**\n   - Present: *\"A farmer wants to remove all grasshoppers from a field to protect his crops. Based on what you now understand about food chains and matter movement, what do you think might happen to the bird and fox populations? Why would this affect the ecosystem?\"*\n   - Students discuss in groups and record predictions with reasoning.\n\n4. **Connect to 5-LS2-1 (movement of matter):**\n   - Ask: \"When a grasshopper eats a leaf, where does the matter (the stuff) from the leaf go? Does it disappear or transform?\" Guide students to understand that matter changes form but doesn't disappear — it becomes part of the grasshopper's body, which can then be eaten by a bird, and eventually returns to soil as decomposers break down dead organisms.\n   - Students sketch a diagram showing: Plant matter → Grasshopper body → Bird body → (Death) → Decomposer → Back to soil\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group discussions with questions like: \"What would the grasshopper's population depend on?\" and \"Why is the sun important to this entire chain?\"\n- Challenge students to think beyond linear food chains: \"Real ecosystems have multiple food chains connected. Can you draw a food web?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents produce a visual model showing energy and matter movement through an ecosystem with the grasshopper as a key consumer, and they can explain cause-and-effect relationships in food chains.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of grasshopper adaptations, ecosystem roles, and matter/energy movement.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n- Observation of student diagrams and annotations during Explore phase\n- Listen to pair and group discussions in Engage and Elaborate for evidence of thinking\n- Monitor during Explain for student responses to check-for-understanding questions\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (Provide at end of Session 2):**\n\nStudents answer the following questions (written or verbally recorded):\n\n1. **Look at the photograph of the grasshopper one more time.** Describe two external structures you can see and explain how each one helps the grasshopper survive.\n\n2. **Draw a simple food chain** that includes the grasshopper. Label the producer, consumer, and show the direction energy flows.\n\n3. **Explain** why it is important that grasshoppers eat plants. (What happens because of this? How does matter move?)\n\n4. **Challenge question:** If an insecticide (poison) killed all the grasshoppers in a field, predict what would happen to the birds that eat grasshoppers and the plants in the field.\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Students demonstrate mastery if they:**\n- Correctly identify at least 2 grasshopper external structures and link them to survival functions (adaptation concept)\n- Create or describe a food chain with the grasshopper in the correct position\n- Explain that plants are producers and grasshoppers are consumers that eat producers\n- Make a logical prediction about ecosystem changes based on food chain disruption\n- Use vocabulary correctly (adaptation, external structure, consumer, producer, food chain)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents provide evidence that they understand grasshopper adaptations, can model energy/matter flow in food chains, and recognize the grasshopper's ecological role.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified observation template:** Provide a graphic organizer with pictures of grasshopper parts pre-labeled. Students only need to fill in what each part does, rather than drawing from scratch.\n\n2. **Guided food chain:** Provide a partially completed food chain (Sun → Grass → ?) and ask students to identify what comes next. Use picture cards rather than requiring students to draw or write.\n\n3. **Sentence starters for explanations:** Provide frames such as:\n   - \"The grasshopper's _______ helps it _______ because _______.\"\n   - \"Energy flows from the sun to the plant, then to the _______, then to _______.\"\n   - \"If there were no grasshoppers, the birds would _______.\"\n\n4. **Pair with a peer mentor** during Explore to ensure full engagement and confidence in observation.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Design a complete food web:** Instead of a linear food chain, challenge students to research and create a food web showing multiple food chains in a grasshopper's ecosystem (include multiple plants, predators, and decomposers). Require them to label and explain at least 5 connections.\n\n2. **Investigate population dynamics:** Ask: \"If the grasshopper population doubled because of perfect weather, how might that affect the bird population over time? Sketch a graph showing your prediction.\" Introduce the concept of carrying capacity and population cycles.\n\n3. **Research and present:** Assign students to research a different insect (cricket, locust, beetle) and compare its adaptations to the grasshopper. Create a Venn diagram showing similarities and differences in how external structures relate to habitat and diet.\n\n4. **Mathematical analysis:** Provide data on energy transfer (e.g., \"A plant produces 1,000 units of energy. A grasshopper that eats the plant gets 100 units. A bird that eats the grasshopper gets 10 units.\"). Have students calculate percentages and explain why energy decreases at each level.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grasshopper Life Cycle Investigation:** \n   - Show images or video of grasshopper life stages (egg, nymph, adult). Have students create a labeled diagram of the complete life cycle and research how each stage relates to the environment and plant life cycles. This connects to understanding organisms' roles in ecosystems over time.\n\n2. **Design a Grasshopper Habitat:**\n   - Provide materials (soil, plants, containers, water, etc.) and challenge students to design and build a habitat where grasshoppers could survive. They must justify their choices based on what they learned about grasshopper needs and adaptations. Have them predict what would happen if one key element (light, plants, water) were removed.\n\n3. **Food Chain Game/Simulation:**\n   - Create a kinesthetic activity where students take roles as plants, grasshoppers, birds, and decomposers. Use movement and props to simulate energy and matter transfer. This reinforces 5-LS2-1 by making the abstract concept of matter movement tangible and memorable.\n\n4. **Comparative Adaptation Study:**\n   - Provide photographs of other animals (dragonfly, cricket, beetle, butterfly) and have students compare external structures. Create a chart showing how different animals' adaptations reflect their specific habitats and diets.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
