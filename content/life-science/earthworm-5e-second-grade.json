(earthworms and soil health connection)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Describe where earthworms live and what their habitat looks like using words and drawings.\n- Observe and record at least two ways that earthworms are different from other animals they know.\n- Explain why earthworms need soil, moisture, and darkness to survive.\n- Identify earthworms as helpful animals that live in soil habitats.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about earthworms and where they live.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph of earthworm on grass (the provided image)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small container with moist soil visible on display table (not yet opened)\n\n**Activity:**\n\nDisplay the photograph of the earthworm on the grass large enough for all students to see clearly. Ask students to sit in a circle or gathering area.\n\n**Discussion Questions (calibrated for second grade):**\n1. \"What is this animal? Have you ever seen one before? Where did you see it?\"\n2. \"Look closely at the photo. What do you notice about this animal's body? What does it look like?\"\n3. \"Why do you think this earthworm might be on top of the grass? Where do earthworms usually live?\"\n4. \"What do you wonder about this earthworm? What would you like to learn?\"\n\n**Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n\"I wonder what an earthworm's home looks like underground. Let's predict: Do you think an earthworm lives alone or with other earthworms? What does a worm need to be happy and healthy?\"\n\nCreate a class wonder chart on chart paper: \"What We Want to Learn About Earthworms.\" Record student questions and observations.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become earthworm scientists and learn all about where earthworms live and why they're so special!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate earthworm habitats and behavior through hands-on observation and experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 clear plastic container or cup (at least 4 inches tall)\n- Moist soil (enough to fill 3/4 of the container)\n- 1-2 live earthworms (obtained from a local bait shop or collected responsibly; sources: www.WormForum.com or local garden centers)\n- Shredded newspaper or leaf litter\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Dark cloth or paper to drape over the container\n- Magnifying glass\n- Observation sheet or journal with pictures to label\n- Pencil\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. Carefully pour moist soil into your container until it's about 3/4 full. Gently mix in some shredded newspaper and leaves.\n\n2. Predict: \"Will the earthworm burrow into the soil right away, or stay on top? Draw your prediction.\"\n\n3. Gently place one earthworm on the surface of the soil. Observe for 2-3 minutes without touching it. Use the magnifying glass to look closely at its body.\n\n4. Record on your observation sheet: \n   - How does the earthworm move?\n   - What does its body look like? (Is it smooth? Bumpy? One color?)\n   - Does it burrow into the soil?\n\n5. Now drape the dark cloth over the container so the earthworm can't see light. Wait 1-2 minutes, then carefully peek.\n\n6. On your sheet, draw or write: Did the earthworm burrow? Did the darkness help?\n\n7. Gently remove the cloth. Spray the soil lightly with water from the spray bottle.\n\n8. Observe again. Does the earthworm seem more active or less active now?\n\n9. Create a simple drawing showing what the earthworm's habitat looks like.\n\n**How the Activity Connects to the Photograph:**\nThe photograph showed us an earthworm in a natural outdoor habitat. Now students are creating a mini-habitat in the classroom to see how earthworms behave in soil, just like they do in the photo.\n\n**What Students Should Record or Document:**\n- Drawings of the earthworm's body showing its segments\n- Predictions and observations about burrowing\n- Notes on whether the worm liked light or darkness, wet or dry soil\n- A labeled diagram of the earthworm habitat showing soil, leaves, and the worm\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nCirculate among groups. Ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about how the worm is moving? Why do you think it went into the soil?\" Resist the urge to tell; instead, prompt observation. Help students handle worms gently. Ensure containers are kept moist and in a cool spot.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents will observe that earthworms burrow into soil, prefer darkness, and need moisture. They will document these observations through drawings and simple written or verbal descriptions.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts based on student observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n- The earthworm habitat containers from Explore (still visible)\n- Photographs or diagram of earthworm external anatomy (segments, mouth end)\n- Picture cards showing different soil habitats\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out from Explore Phase:**\nInvite 2-3 groups to share their observations. Ask:\n- \"What surprised you about how the earthworm moved?\"\n- \"Did the worm like being in the light or the dark?\"\n- \"What happened when you added water?\"\n\nCreate a simple shared chart on paper titled \"What Earthworms Need\" and record student findings.\n\n**Key Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n1. **Habitat** - A habitat is the home of an animal. It has everything the animal needs to live, like food, water, and a safe place to rest. Earthworms' habitat is soil.\n\n2. **Segment** - Earthworms' bodies are made of many small rings or bands called segments. These help the worm move and bend.\n\n3. **Burrow** - To burrow means to dig down into the ground and make a tunnel or hole. Earthworms burrow into soil using their body.\n\n4. **Decompose** - When things decompose, they break down slowly into smaller pieces. Earthworms help dead leaves and plant parts decompose by eating them and breaking them into tiny pieces.\n\n5. **Moisture** - Moisture means water or wetness. Earthworms need moisture because their skin must stay wet to breathe.\n\n**Connections Back to the Photograph and Explore Activity:**\n\"In our photo, we saw an earthworm on grass. That grass is part of the earthworm's habitat. Underground, where the worm burrows, there's soil, water, and pieces of dead leaves. In our containers, we created a small version of the earthworm's real home. The segments we saw help the worm squeeze through soil, just like you saw it doing!\"\n\n**Check for Understanding Strategy:**\nUse a \"Show Me\" technique: Hold up picture cards showing different habitats (desert, forest floor, pond, garden soil). Ask students to point to where earthworms would live and say why. Observe their responses and clarify as needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents understand that earthworms live in soil habitats, have segmented bodies that help them move, need moisture, and help soil stay healthy by decomposing dead plant material.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by comparing earthworms to other organisms and exploring how they help different habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large floor space or table\n- Picture cards of various soil animals (ant, beetle, centipede, millipede, sowbug, earthworm)\n- Chart paper with a \"Venn diagram\" template drawn (or use an interactive anchor chart)\n- Colored markers\n- Optional: soil sample collection boxes and magnifying glasses for outdoor exploration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Diversity Comparison Activity**\n\n1. Show students picture cards of different animals that live in soil habitats: earthworm, ant, beetle, centipede, millipede.\n\n2. Ask: \"These animals all live in soil like earthworms. What's the same about them? What's different?\"\n\n3. Create a class chart:\n   - Column 1: \"Lives in Soil\" (all animals)\n   - Column 2: \"Has Segments Like Earthworm\"\n   - Column 3: \"Helps Decompose Plants\"\n   - Column 4: \"Needs Moisture Like Earthworm\"\n\n4. Work together to place animal pictures in the correct columns, discussing why.\n\n5. Conclude: \"Even though these animals live in the same habitat, they're all different! That's called biodiversity. It helps the soil stay healthy.\"\n\n**Option B: Earthworm's Helpful Role**\n\n1. Show students a container of soil. Say: \"Earthworms are like tiny helpers for plants and soil.\"\n\n2. Explain with a simple drawing on paper:\n   - Earthworms burrow → creates air pockets in soil\n   - Earthworms eat dead leaves → breaks them into smaller pieces\n   - Earthworm waste (droppings) → adds nutrients back to soil for plants to use\n   - Plants grow better → more food for other animals\n\n3. Have students draw or dictate: \"How does an earthworm help a garden?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nFacilitate discussions by asking, \"Why do you think that?\" and \"How does that help the plant?\" Guide students to see the connection between organisms and their habitats. Keep energy positive and hands-on.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents recognize that earthworms are one organism among many in soil habitats and understand that earthworms play an important role in keeping soil healthy for plants to grow.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of earthworm habitats and adaptations.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n- Observe students during the Explore phase: Can they describe what the earthworm needs? Do they notice the segments? Can they predict behavior?\n- Listen to student responses during group share-out: Do they use the word \"habitat\"? Can they explain why darkness or moisture mattered?\n- Monitor the Elaborate activity: Do students compare organisms accurately? Can they explain why earthworms are helpful?\n\n**Exit Ticket or Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with a simple sheet (can be written by teacher or student-drawn) with these prompts. Students respond through drawings, words, or a combination:\n\n1. **Draw an earthworm's habitat.** Label: soil, water, leaves, earthworm.\n\n2. **Write or say: Why is soil a good home for earthworms?** (Provide word bank if needed: dark, wet, food, safe)\n\n3. **True or False with a picture:**\n   - Earthworms live on top of grass in sunlight. (False — show soil instead)\n   - Earthworms need moisture to survive. (True — show wet soil)\n   - Earthworms help decompose dead plants. (True — show worm in soil with leaves)\n\n4. **My Question:** \"What do you still want to know about earthworms?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Students can identify soil as the earthworm's habitat.\n- ✓ Students can name at least two things earthworms need (moisture, darkness, soil, food).\n- ✓ Students can describe one way earthworms are different from other animals.\n- ✓ Students show an understanding that earthworms are beneficial to soil and plants.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents demonstrate they can identify earthworm habitats, explain why earthworms need specific conditions to survive, and recognize earthworms as important organisms in soil environments.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a pre-drawn picture with labels for students to check off rather than draw from scratch. Example: \"Put a ✓ if the earthworm burrowed. Put a ✓ if it stayed wet.\"\n\n2. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair students with stronger observers. The partner can model how to use the magnifying glass and describe what they see aloud.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Picture Cards:** Create or provide picture cards for habitat, segment, burrow, and moisture. Use these throughout the lesson so students hear and see words repeatedly. Let students match pictures to words during Explain phase.\n\n4. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Offer students only 2 items instead of 4. Focus on: \"Draw where earthworms live\" and \"Name one thing earthworms need.\"\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Research Extension:** Ask advanced students to investigate a follow-up question: \"How do earthworms move without legs? Can you draw or describe the muscles in their body?\" Provide a diagram of earthworm anatomy to study.\n\n2. **Comparative Habitat Study:** Invite students to research and create a comparison poster: \"Earthworm Habitats vs. Ant Habitats\" or \"What Lives in Soil vs. What Lives in Trees?\" Use classroom books or teacher-selected websites.\n\n3. **Design Task:** \"Design the perfect earthworm habitat container. What would you include and why?\" Students sketch and label their design, explaining their choices using scientific reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Worm Composting Project (Multi-Week):** Set up a small vermicomposting bin in the classroom. Students observe over 2-3 weeks how earthworms break down fruit scraps, paper, and leaves. Keep a observation journal and measure how much the waste reduces. This connects to 2-LS2-1 (decomposition supports plant growth).\n\n2. **Outdoor Soil Exploration:** Take students outside after rain to carefully observe soil organisms in a small area. Use hand lenses and compare what they find. Create a field guide: \"Who Lives in Our School Garden Soil?\" Draw or photograph organisms and label them.\n\n3. **Earthworm Life Cycle Story:** Create a simple illustrated book or comic strip showing the earthworm's life: \"From Cocoon to Grown-Up Worm.\" Have students draw and write captions explaining each stage. Connect to concepts that organisms grow and change.\n\n4. **Plant-Worm Connection Experiment:** Plant two identical seeds in containers—one with earthworms in the soil and one without. Observe over 3-4 weeks which plant grows taller or healthier. Record data and discuss: \"Why did this plant grow better?\" (Connects to 2-LS2-1 about earthworms aerating soil for plant growth.)\n\n5. **Guest Speaker or Video:** Invite a local gardener or compost expert to discuss the role of earthworms, or watch a short age-appropriate video (2-3 minutes) showing earthworms in their natural habitat and their benefits to soil.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\n- Obtain earthworms 1-2 days before the lesson so students can observe live organisms. Bait and tackle shops, garden centers, or online suppliers are reliable sources. Keep worms cool and moist until use.\n- After the lesson, release earthworms back outdoors in a shaded, moist area of the school grounds, or donate them to a local school garden.\n- If live worms are unavailable, substitute with a high-quality video of earthworms in soil (search \"earthworm burrowing\" on YouTube) and use realistic plastic models for the Explore phase. Learning objectives can still be met through careful observation and illustration.\n- Emphasize gentleness: \"Earthworms are living creatures we must treat with kindness.\"\n- Reinforce the wonder and amazement at each phase: These small creatures do big work underground!",
