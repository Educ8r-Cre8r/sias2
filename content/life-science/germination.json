    "firstgrade": "# First Grade Science Lesson: Plant Germination\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a tiny green plant sprouting from the soil with small seed shells still attached at the top. The green stem is growing upward, and you can see another seed shell at the bottom of the plant. This is what happens when a seed starts to grow into a new plant!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon: Seed Germination**\n\nThis image captures **germination**—the process where a seed begins to grow into a plant. Scientifically, germination occurs when a seed receives the right conditions: warmth, water, and sometimes light. The seed contains a baby plant (embryo) and stored food inside. When water is absorbed, the seed \"wakes up,\" cells begin to divide and grow, and the first root pushes downward while the stem pushes upward toward sunlight. This is a fundamental life process that demonstrates how living things grow and change.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Growth and Change:** Seeds grow into plants over time. We can observe the changes by watching the plant get bigger and taller.\n\n* **Needs for Life:** Plants need water, soil, warmth, and light to grow. Without these things, seeds will not germinate.\n\n* **Life Cycles:** Every plant starts as a seed, grows, makes flowers or new seeds, and eventually dies. This pattern repeats in nature.\n\n* **Observable Structures:** Seeds have different parts (seed coat, embryo) that help them grow into plants with roots, stems, and leaves.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFor First Graders, use repetitive observation language like \"I notice... I see... I observe...\" when discussing the image. This builds vocabulary and encourages careful observation skills. Consider creating a class anchor chart with observable words students can use when describing plant growth.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple means of representation: Use real seeds, photos, and drawings together so students with different learning preferences can engage. Allow kinesthetic learners to use their hands to gently manipulate a sprouted seed to feel the different parts (root, stem, seed coat). Offer sentence frames for students who need language support: \"I see a ___. It is ___.\"\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** \n1-LS1-1: Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and animals use their external parts to help them grow, survive, and meet their needs.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-LS1.A]] Structure and Function—External parts of plants help them grow and survive\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-LS1.B]] Growth and Development of Organisms—Plants grow and change over time\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] Plants follow patterns of growth and development\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] Water and warmth cause seeds to sprout and grow\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think is happening to this seed?

Why?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2-3)\n\n4. **How is this baby plant different from the seed it came from? What parts do you see?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Seed:** A small object that contains a baby plant and food, which grows into a new plant when it has water and warmth.\n\n* **Germination:** The process of a seed starting to grow into a plant.\n\n* **Sprout:** A young plant that is just beginning to grow from a seed.\n\n* **Root:** The part of the plant that grows down into the soil and drinks water.\n\n* **Stem:** The green part of the plant that grows upward and holds up the leaves.\n\n* **Soil:** The dirt or ground where plants grow and get food and water from.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Sprouting Experiment:** Give each student a clear cup with wet paper towels and a bean seed. Have them place it against the side of the cup so they can watch the root grow down and stem grow up over 1-2 weeks. Students can draw observations every few days. *Safety note: Ensure students do not eat seeds and wash hands after handling.*\n\n2. **Seed Hunt and Sort:** Take students on a nature walk to collect different types of seeds (acorns, pine cones, dandelion seeds). Return to class and sort seeds by size, shape, and color. Discuss how different seeds look different but all grow into plants.\n\n3. **Plant Needs Investigation:** Set up three cups with bean seeds under different conditions: one with water and light, one with water only (in a dark bag), and one with light only (no water). Over two weeks, observe which sprouts grow best and discuss what plants really need.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle (Caldecott Honor; teaches seed growth and life cycles)\n- *A Seed is Sleepy* by Dianne Hutts Aston, illustrated by Sylvia Long (shows seed germination with beautiful illustrations)\n- *From Seed to Plant* by Gail Gibbons (simple, clear non-fiction with labeled diagrams)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"Seed Germination in Fast Motion\"** – National Geographic Kids (1:30 min) — Shows a bean seed sprouting in real time; visually engaging for young learners.

    "secondgrade": "# Second Grade Science Lesson: Plant Germination\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a sprouting seed with a green stem growing upward and brown seed coats at the top and bottom. You can see the seed has split open, and a tiny green plant is pushing out to grow. This is what happens when a seed wakes up and starts to become a bigger plant!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Seed Germination\n\nThis image captures **germination**—the process where a dormant seed activates and begins to grow into a plant. Scientifically, germination occurs when a seed receives the right conditions: adequate water, warmth, and sometimes light. Water triggers cellular growth, enzymes activate stored nutrients in the seed, and the embryonic plant (radicle, then shoot) emerges through the seed coat. The green stem grows upward toward light (phototropism), while roots grow downward into soil. This is a fundamental life cycle process that demonstrates how plants grow from seeds.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Life Cycles:** Seeds are the beginning of a plant's life cycle. Seeds contain a baby plant inside a protective coat that waits for the right conditions to grow.\n\n2. **Growth and Change:** Plants change and grow over time. When seeds germinate, they get bigger and develop roots and stems in response to their environment.\n\n3. **Plant Structure:** Germinating seeds show us how plants are organized—seeds contain stored food, and new plants develop roots (grow down) and shoots (grow up).\n\n4. **Conditions for Life:** Seeds need water, warmth, and sometimes light to germinate. Without these conditions, seeds stay dormant (asleep).\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nUse real seeds and germination experiments in your classroom! Students learn best through direct observation. Have them plant seeds in clear cups so they can watch daily changes. This concrete experience makes abstract concepts like \"growth\" and \"life cycles\" tangible and memorable. Keep a simple observation journal where students draw what they see every 2-3 days.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple means of representation: Use actual germinating seeds (tactile), photos/videos (visual), and teacher descriptions (auditory). Allow students to draw, write, or verbally describe what they observe about the seed's changes. For students with fine motor challenges, provide pre-drawn diagrams to label rather than requiring detailed drawings. Create a word wall with seed-related vocabulary and images to support all learners.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** \n2-LS2-1: Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS2.A]] Plants need water and air; plants get materials from soil\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS2.B]] Plants depend on water and light to grow\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] Water and warmth cause seeds to germinate\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] Seed structures (coat, embryo) have specific jobs in germination\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think will happen to this seed in the next few days?** (Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why do you think the green part is growing up instead of down, and the brown root-like part is growing down?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **What do you think this seed needed to start growing?

Have them plant the seed and observe it daily for 2-3 weeks. Students draw pictures and write simple sentences about what they see each week. They can compare which seeds grow fastest, tallest, or healthiest based on different conditions (sunlight, water, temperature).\n\n2. **Seed Hunt and Sorting:** Take students on a nature walk to collect different seeds (acorns, seeds from flowers, pods, etc.). Back in the classroom, have students sort seeds by size, shape, color, and texture. Discuss why different plants have different seeds and predict which ones might grow quickly or slowly.\n\n3. **Germination in a Bag:** Place a bean seed in a damp paper towel inside a ziplock bag and hang it on a sunny window. Students can see the root and shoot grow right through the plastic without opening the bag. This is perfect for tracking growth and discussing why roots grow down and shoots grow up.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle (beautiful story about seed travel and germination)\n- *From Seed to Plant* by Gail Gibbons (clear illustrations of plant life cycles)\n- *A Seed Is Sleepy* by Dianna Hutts Aston (poetic introduction to seeds and germination)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"Seed Germination Time Lapse\"** by National Geographic Kids — Shows a bean seed germinating and growing into a plant over several days in fast motion (3 minutes).

    "thirdgrade": "# Third Grade Science Lesson: Plant Germination\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a small green plant sprouting from soil with two seed coats (the brown shells) still attached—one at the base and one at the top. The green stem is growing upward, and you can see the beginning of the plant's life cycle as it breaks out of its protective seed covering. The seeds are cracking open because a new plant is growing inside and needs to push its way out into the world.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Seed germination—the process where a seed breaks open and begins to grow into a plant.\n\n**Why It Happens (Scientific Explanation):** Seeds are dormant (sleeping) packages containing a baby plant and stored food. When seeds get the right combination of water, warmth, and oxygen, they \"wake up.\" The baby plant (embryo) absorbs water, swells inside the seed coat, and eventually cracks it open. The plant then uses the stored food in the seed to grow roots downward and a stem upward. This is nature's way of ensuring plants grow only when conditions are favorable for survival.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Seed Structure:** Seeds have protective outer coats, stored food for the baby plant, and an embryo (the tiny plant inside). The seed coat keeps the baby plant safe until it's ready to grow.\n\n* **Conditions for Growth:** Seeds need three main things to germinate: water (to activate growth), warmth (to speed up the process), and oxygen (for the plant cells to function). Without these, seeds stay dormant.\n\n* **Life Cycles:** Plants go through different stages of life—seed, sprout, seedling, mature plant, and reproduction. Germination is the beginning stage where a seed becomes a visible plant.\n\n* **Energy Transfer:** Seeds store energy (food) inside them that the baby plant uses to grow before it can make its own food through photosynthesis once its leaves develop.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nStudents at this age are concrete thinkers and learn best through direct observation. Rather than just showing this photo, consider planting bean seeds in a clear cup so students can watch germination happen over 1-2 weeks. They can draw daily observations and measure growth with a ruler. This transforms the photo from a static image into a personal discovery experience where they become scientists tracking real change.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nTo support diverse learners: (1) Provide a labeled diagram of seed parts alongside the photograph for visual learners; (2) Allow kinesthetic learners to manipulate a large seed model or actual soaked bean seeds to feel the softening seed coat and locate the embryo; (3) Create audio descriptions or use think-aloud protocols so students can hear scientific language modeled; (4) Offer a graphic organizer showing the germination sequence for students who need structured note-taking.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 3-LS1-1 Develop models to describe that organisms have unseen parts that help them survive, grow, and produce offspring.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n* [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS1.B]] Growth and Development of Organisms—Plants require water, air, and energy to grow\n* [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS3.A]] Inheritance of Traits—Individual traits vary and some traits are inherited from parents (seeds contain genetic information)\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] The patterns of germination occur when specific conditions are met\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] Water and warmth cause dormant seeds to germinate\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think is happening to the seed in this picture, and why do you think the seed coat is cracking open?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **What do you predict this plant will look like in two weeks?

What problem do they solve?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **If we kept a seed completely dry in a sealed bag, would it germinate? Explain your thinking.** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Germination:** When a seed wakes up, absorbs water, and begins to grow into a plant.\n\n* **Seed Coat:** The tough, protective outer shell of a seed that keeps the baby plant safe.\n\n* **Embryo:** The tiny baby plant living inside a seed.\n\n* **Dormant:** In a sleeping or resting state; seeds are dormant until conditions are right for growth.\n\n* **Sprout:** The first visible shoot that emerges from a germinating seed.\n\n* **Oxygen:** A gas in the air that living things, including sprouting seeds, need to survive.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Germination Observation Lab:** Give each student a clear plastic cup with moist soil and a bean seed planted 1 inch deep. Have students observe and sketch the germination process daily for 2-3 weeks, measuring stem and root growth with a ruler. Create a class graph showing how fast different seeds germinate under identical conditions.\n\n2. **Seed Dissection & Discovery:** Provide soaked bean or sunflower seeds (soaking softens the coat). Students carefully open seeds with a plastic knife, locate the embryo, seed coat, and stored food, and match their findings to labeled diagrams. This hands-on exploration helps them understand hidden internal structures.\n\n3. **Germination Condition Experiment:** Set up three identical cups with seeds but vary one condition in each: (1) keep moist and warm; (2) keep dry in sunlight; (3) keep moist but in a cold location. Students predict which will germinate fastest and check daily. This teaches the scientific method and the importance of variables.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle—A story following a tiny seed's journey through seasons until it finally germinates and grows into a beautiful flower.\n* *From Seed to Plant* by Gail Gibbons—A non-fiction picture book with clear, labeled diagrams showing each stage of plant growth from seed to mature plant.\n* *How a Seed Grows* by Helene J.

    "fourthgrade": "# Fourth Grade Science Lesson Guide: Seed Germination\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\nThis image shows a seed sprouting into a young plant. You can see a green stem growing upward with a brown seed coat still attached at the top. Below the green stem, another seed with its protective covering sits on moist soil. This is the beginning stage of a seed transforming into a living plant.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Seed Germination\n\nSeeds contain a tiny living plant (called an embryo) and stored food inside a protective seed coat. When seeds get the right conditions—water, warmth, and oxygen—they \"wake up\" and begin to grow. The seed coat softens and splits, allowing the root to grow downward into the soil and the stem to push upward toward light. This process is called **germination**, and it's how new plants begin their lives.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Life Cycles:** Seeds are part of a plant's life cycle. Seeds grow into plants, which produce flowers and make new seeds, starting the cycle again.\n\n* **Growth and Development:** Plants grow and change over time. A seed develops roots, stems, and leaves as it matures into an adult plant.\n\n* **Needs of Living Things:** Seeds need specific conditions to germinate—water, appropriate temperature, and oxygen. Without these, seeds remain dormant (sleeping).\n\n* **Structures and Functions:** Different plant parts have different jobs. Roots absorb water and nutrients from soil, while stems support the plant and carry water upward.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nUse this image as a **\"slow reveal\"** strategy. Show only the green stem first and ask students to predict what it is. Then gradually reveal the seed coat and soil. This builds curiosity and engages students in active observation before introducing vocabulary.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Provide both the photograph AND a labeled diagram showing seed parts (seed coat, embryo, root, stem). Some students benefit from visual labels paired with the realistic image. **Multiple Means of Engagement:** Connect germination to students' prior experiences—planting seeds in pots at home or observing bean sprouts in the cafeteria. Personal relevance increases motivation and comprehension.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**  \n4-LS1-1: Use evidence to construct an explanation for how the structures of seeds and plants (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits) are related to growth, survival, survival in the environment, and reproduction.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-LS1.A]] (Structure and Function)\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-LS1.B]] (Growth and Development of Organisms)\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] — Plant parts (roots, stems) have specific structures that allow them to perform life functions.\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] — Water, warmth, and light CAUSE seeds to germinate and plants to grow.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think will happen to this seed in the next few weeks?** (Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **Why do you think the root grows downward into the soil instead of upward like the stem?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n3. **If we removed this sprouting seed from the soil and kept it in a dark, dry place, what would happen to its growth?

Students observe and sketch the seed daily for 2-3 weeks, recording when the root emerges, when the stem appears, and when leaves develop. This hands-on experience deepens understanding of the sequence of growth.\n\n2. **Conditions for Germination Experiment:** Set up four identical cups with bean seeds, but vary ONE condition in each: (A) water + light + warmth, (B) NO water (dry), (C) water but NO light (in a dark box), (D) water + light but cold (refrigerated). Students predict which will germinate fastest and compare results over time, discovering which conditions are essential.\n\n3. **Plant Part Sorting Game:** Provide pictures or real examples of different plant parts (roots, stems, leaves, seeds, flowers). Students sort them by function—which parts absorb water? Which make food? Which make new seeds? This reinforces the structure-function relationship.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle — A beautifully illustrated story following a tiny seed's journey and growth into a flower.\n- *From Seed to Plant* by Gail Gibbons — Clear diagrams and text explaining the plant life cycle from germination to seed production.\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"Seed Germination Time Lapse\"** by National Geographic Kids — A stunning 2-minute video showing seed germination in fast-forward.

    "fifthgrade": "# Fifth Grade Science Lesson: Seed Germination\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a sprouting seed at the beginning of its life cycle. A small green stem has emerged from a seed coat, and you can see both the seed itself (with its tan and brown protective covering) and the tender green shoot growing upward. There is also another seed visible at the base, showing what seeds look like before they sprout.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Seed germination—the process by which a dormant seed begins to grow into a new plant.\n\n**Why This Happens (Scientific Explanation for Teachers):**\nGermination occurs when environmental conditions are right: adequate moisture, appropriate temperature, and oxygen. The seed absorbs water, which activates enzymes and allows stored nutrients within the seed to fuel growth. The embryonic plant inside the seed coat begins to develop. The root typically emerges first to anchor the plant and absorb water, followed by the shoot (stem and leaves) growing upward toward light. This is a critical life process demonstrating how plants begin their life cycles and reproduce.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Life Cycles:** Plants, like all living things, go through predictable stages of growth and development. Germination marks the beginning of a plant's life cycle.\n\n* **Plant Structures and Functions:** Seeds contain an embryo (baby plant), stored food, and a protective seed coat. The root grows downward to absorb water and nutrients; the shoot grows upward to access sunlight.\n\n* **Conditions for Growth:** Living things need specific environmental conditions to survive and grow. Seeds require water, warmth, and oxygen to germinate successfully.\n\n* **Energy and Growth:** Plants use stored energy in the seed to grow until they can make their own food through photosynthesis using sunlight and water.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching germination, create a \"germination station\" where students can observe real seeds sprouting in clear containers over 1-2 weeks. This direct observation is far more impactful than pictures alone. Have students sketch their observations daily to build observational skills and reinforce the concept of change over time.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple means of representation: Use diagrams, photographs, and actual seeds for tactile learners. Label diagrams clearly with simple language. For English Language Learners, pair vocabulary words with images and allow students to use their home language to discuss concepts before responding in English. Offer both written and oral options for recording observations.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n5-LS1-1: Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS1.A]]: Plants require water and light to grow\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS1.C]]: Plants obtain energy from the sun through photosynthesis\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]: Plant life cycles follow predictable patterns\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]]: Seeds contain systems (root, shoot, cotyledons) that work together\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think is happening inside the seed before the green shoot appears?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why do you think the root grows down into the soil while the shoot grows up toward the light?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If a seed had water and warmth but no oxygen (sealed in a plastic bag), would it germinate? Use evidence to explain your thinking.** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **How is a germinating seed similar to a newborn animal, and how is it different?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Germination:** The process by which a seed begins to grow into a new plant.\n\n* **Seed Coat:** The tough, protective covering on the outside of a seed.\n\n* **Embryo:** The tiny baby plant inside a seed that will grow into a mature plant.\n\n* **Root:** The part of a plant that grows downward into soil to absorb water and nutrients.\n\n* **Shoot:** The part of a sprouting seed that grows upward and becomes the stem and leaves.\n\n* **Dormant:** In a resting or inactive state; seeds are dormant until conditions are right for germination.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Germination Experiment:** Provide students with lima beans or sunflower seeds, clear plastic bags, and paper towels. Have them soak seeds, place them in bags with moist paper towels, and tape them to a classroom window. Students observe and sketch daily changes over 2 weeks, measuring root and shoot growth with rulers. This builds data collection and graphing skills.\n\n2. **Comparing Germination Conditions:** Set up three identical containers with seeds, but vary ONE condition: one with water and light (control), one without water, and one in darkness. Students predict which will germinate best and observe daily to test their hypotheses. This introduces experimental design and the concept of variables.\n\n3. **Seed Dissection and Discovery:** Carefully open soaked lima beans so students can gently separate the cotyledons (seed leaves) and identify the embryo root and shoot using hand lenses. Students draw labeled diagrams and discuss what each part will do as the plant grows.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle (engaging picture book about a seed's journey)\n- *From Seed to Plant* by Gail Gibbons (informative illustrated guide with clear diagrams)\n- *Up in the Garden and Down in the Dirt* by Kate Messner (explores growth from multiple perspectives)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"Seed Germination Timelapse\"** – National Geographic Kids\n  Shows seeds sprouting over several days in fast-forward, making growth visible in seconds.\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-0D0gqjE7E\n\n- **\"How Plants Grow From Seeds\"** – Crash Course Kids\n  Clear, engaging explanation of germination and plant growth with animations.\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I8P4pEG5pA"
