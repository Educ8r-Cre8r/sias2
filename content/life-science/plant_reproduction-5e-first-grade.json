Seeds are the parts of plants that can grow into new plants, helping plants make copies of themselves.\n- **Plant Reproduction:** This photograph demonstrates how plants produce seeds inside fruits, which is a way plants make new plants (reproduction).\n- **Internal Plant Structures:** The seeds, seed cavity, and fibrous tissue visible inside the squash represent internal structures that support a plant's ability to survive and reproduce.\n- **Parent and Offspring Relationship:** Seeds from a parent plant grow into offspring plants that look similar to their parents but may have some differences.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Seeds Inside: Discovering How Plants Make Baby Plants**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 35-40 minute sessions (or three 25-30 minute sessions if extended)\n- **NGSS Standards:** 1-LS1-2, 1-LS3-1\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Make observations about seeds and describe what they see inside a squash or similar fruit.\n- Identify that seeds grow inside plants and help plants make new baby plants.\n- Explain that baby plants grown from seeds look like their parent plants but may have some small differences.\n- Use observations to construct a simple explanation of how plants reproduce using seeds.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about seeds and plant babies using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image or printed photograph of the squash halves with visible seeds\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Real squash or similar fruit (pumpkin, melon, or zucchini) to hold up\n\n**Activity:**\n\nDisplay the photograph on the board or pass around a real squash half (if available). Ask students to look carefully at the image.\n\n**Discussion Questions (calibrated for first grade):**\n1. \"What do you see inside this squash? What does it look like?\" (Guide students to notice the seeds and the bumpy, stringy stuff around them.)\n2. \"Have you ever seen seeds before? Where? What were they like?\" (Accept all answers—apple seeds, watermelon seeds, sunflower seeds, etc.)\n3. \"Why do you think there are so many seeds inside this one fruit? What could these seeds become?\" (Prompt thinking: \"Could they grow into new squash plants?\")\n4. \"If we planted one of these seeds in soil, what do you think would happen?\" (Encourage predictions about growth.)\n\n**Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** \n\"I wonder... if we planted these seeds, would the new squash plants look exactly like this parent squash, or might they look a little different? Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore real seeds and learn how plants make baby plants using seeds. First, let's take apart our own fruit to see what's inside, just like in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate seeds and internal plant structures through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1-2 whole squashes, pumpkins, or large gourds per small group (or have students work in pairs/groups of 3-4)\n- Plastic spoons or craft sticks for scooping\n- Paper plates or trays to contain seeds\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Hand-washing supplies\n- Observation worksheet or drawing paper with the prompt: \"What we found inside our fruit\"\n- Crayons, colored pencils, or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Look at your fruit. What does the outside look like? Feel it. Is it hard or soft?\"\n2. \"Your teacher has already cut your fruit in half. Now, use your spoon to carefully scoop out the seeds and stringy parts inside.\"\n3. \"Place all the seeds on your plate. Count them if you can. Are there a lot of seeds or just a few?\"\n4. \"Look at the seeds closely. What color are they? What shape are they? Are they big or small? Tell a partner what you notice.\"\n5. \"Collect some of the stringy, bumpy stuff around the seeds too. This is called the seed cavity. It protects the seeds. Feel it. Is it wet or dry?\"\n6. \"Draw or write what you found inside your fruit on your observation sheet. You can draw the seeds, the stringy stuff, and anything else you noticed.\"\n\n**How the Activity Connects to the Photograph:**\nStudents are replicating what they see in the photograph—opening a fruit and discovering seeds inside. They'll notice the same yellow/orange flesh, the oval center cavity, and the many seeds.\n\n**What Students Should Record or Document:**\n- Drawings of seeds and the inside of the fruit\n- Observations written in simple words or drawings (color, size, quantity, texture)\n- A simple count of seeds (if developmentally ready)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nCirculate among groups, asking open-ended questions (\"What do you notice about the shape of the seeds?\" \"How many did you find?\" \"What do you think could happen if we planted one?\"). Do not give direct answers. Encourage students to observe and describe without judgment. Help with fine-motor tasks if needed. Facilitate cleanup.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents will discover that many seeds are inside the fruit, observe their physical characteristics (color, shape, size, texture), and begin to understand that seeds are inside fruits and plants.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the role of seeds in plant reproduction using observations from the Explore phase.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Completed student observation sheets (from Explore)\n- Real seeds or projected close-ups for reference\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\nGather students in a circle. Show 2-3 student observation sheets or ask 3-4 students to share what they found. Ask:\n- \"Who found seeds? How many?\"\n- \"What did the seeds look like?\"\n- \"What was around the seeds?\"\n\nValidate all observations and affirm that they noticed the same things in their fruits as in the photograph.\n\n**Key Vocabulary Instruction (Introduce 3-4 terms with student-friendly definitions):**\n\n1. **Seed:** A tiny part of a plant that can grow into a new plant. Seeds have a hard outside shell to keep the baby plant safe inside.\n   - *Simple example:* \"The seeds inside the squash are like babies waiting to grow into new squash plants.\"\n\n2. **Reproduce (or Make Baby Plants):** When a parent plant makes new, baby plants. One way plants do this is by making seeds.\n   - *Simple example:* \"Plants don't have babies like animals do, but they make seeds. Those seeds can grow into new baby plants.\"\n\n3. **Parent Plant:** The big, grown-up plant that made the seeds.\n   - *Simple example:* \"The squash plant that grew this squash is the parent plant. The new squash that grows from these seeds will be a baby plant.\"\n\n4. **Offspring (or Baby Plant):** A new, young plant that grows from a seed made by a parent plant.\n   - *Simple example:* \"If we plant these seeds, the new squash plants that grow will be offspring, or baby plants.\"\n\n**Connections Back to the Photograph and Explore Activity:**\n\"When we opened our squash today, we found many seeds inside, just like in this picture. These seeds are how the parent squash plant makes new baby squash plants. If a farmer planted these seeds, they would grow into new squash plants. The baby plants would look like the parent squash, but they might have a few small differences.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding Strategy:**\nAsk simple comprehension questions:\n- \"What did we find inside the squash?\" (Seeds.)\n- \"What can these seeds grow into?\" (New squash plants.)\n- \"What do we call the big squash plant that made these seeds?\" (The parent plant.)\n- \"What will the new plants be called?\" (Baby plants or offspring.)\n\nIf students struggle, show the photograph again and point to the seeds, saying, \"These little things are seeds. Seeds grow into new plants.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Seed:** A small, hard object inside a fruit that can grow into a new plant.\n- **Reproduce:** To make new plants (baby plants).\n- **Parent Plant:** The grown-up plant that made the seeds.\n- **Offspring:** A new baby plant that grows from a seed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents understand that seeds are inside fruits, that seeds grow into new plants (reproduction), and that baby plants come from parent plants.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of seeds and plant reproduction to a new context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Seeds from the exploration (cleaned and dried, or fresh seeds from another fruit if available)\n- Small pots or paper cups with drainage holes (or recycle containers)\n- Potting soil or classroom compost\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Labels and markers\n- A sunny classroom windowsill or grow light\n- Optional: Images or books showing different fruits and their seeds\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Plant a Seed (Hands-On Application)**\n\nGuide students to plant one seed from their squash (or provide pre-cleaned seeds if the squash seeds are too large/difficult to handle).\n\n**Step-by-Step Directions:**\n1. \"Fill your cup with soil about halfway.\"\n2. \"Make a small hole in the soil with your finger, about as deep as your knuckle.\"\n3. \"Drop one seed into the hole. Cover it gently with soil.\"\n4. \"Spray the soil lightly with water. It should feel moist, not soaking wet.\"\n5. \"Place your cup in the sunny spot. We'll water it a little bit every few days.\"\n6. \"Make a label for your pot with your name and draw a picture of what you think will grow.\"\n\n**Part B: Compare Different Seeds (Extensions for Deeper Understanding)**\n\nShow images or real examples of seeds from other fruits (apple seeds, watermelon seeds, pumpkin seeds, beans, etc.). Ask:\n- \"These seeds come from different plants. Are all seeds the same size?\" (No.)\n- \"Are they the same color?\" (No.)\n- \"What do you think will grow from the apple seeds? From the watermelon seeds?\" (New apple trees, watermelon plants, etc.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nProvide step-by-step physical support as needed. Ask questions that prompt students to think about what will happen: \"What do you think your seed needs to grow?\" (Soil, water, sunlight.) \"What will your baby plant look like when it grows?\" (Like the parent plant, but maybe a little different.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents can plant a seed, explain that it will grow into a new plant similar to the parent plant, and make predictions about growth over time. They understand that different seeds grow into different plants but all seeds start the process of reproduction in a similar way.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of seeds, plant reproduction, and parent-offspring relationships.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observation of student engagement and language use during Engage and Explore phases\n- Quality of student observation drawings and descriptions during Explore\n- Participation in group discussion during Explain phase\n- Ability to follow directions and correctly plant a seed during Elaborate phase\n- Responses to comprehension questions during Explain phase\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n\nPresent students with a simple exit ticket with 2-3 questions and/or drawing prompts (adjust for first-grade literacy/writing):\n\n1. **Drawing Prompt:** \"Draw the inside of the squash. Show where the seeds are.\"\n   - **Success Criterion:** Student draws seeds inside a fruit shape.\n\n2. **Question (asked aloud by teacher, student responds verbally or with a simple drawing/word):** \"If I plant this seed in soil and water it, what will grow?\"\n   - **Success Criterion:** Student responds, \"A new squash plant\" or \"A baby squash plant\" or similar.\n\n3. **Question:** \"Will the new plant look exactly like the parent squash, or might it be a little different?\"\n   - **Success Criterion:** Student says, \"A little different\" or \"Same but different\" or similar (indicating understanding that offspring are similar but not identical).\n\n**Observation Checklist (Teacher Use):**\n- ☐ Student observed and described seeds and their location inside the fruit.\n- ☐ Student understands that seeds grow into new plants.\n- ☐ Student recognizes that baby plants come from parent plants.\n- ☐ Student can explain (in simple words) that baby plants are like but not exactly like their parents.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nIf students meet the success criteria, they have achieved the learning objectives. Most first-graders should be able to identify seeds, describe their location inside a fruit, and explain that seeds grow into new plants. Understanding the subtle concept of similarity-with-variation may be emerging for some students and can be revisited in future lessons.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Hands-on model:** Provide a pre-cut fruit or a plastic model of a fruit to students who have difficulty opening or handling the real fruit. Allow them to explore the seeds without the fine-motor challenge.\n\n2. **Visual aids and repetition:** Use the photograph repeatedly throughout the lesson as a reference. Point to the seeds, say \"seeds,\" and have students repeat. Use gesture and visuals more than language.\n\n3. **Simplified vocabulary:** Focus on one key term at a time. Use \"seeds,\" \"baby plants,\" and \"grow\" repeatedly in simple sentences: \"Seeds grow into plants.\" Do not introduce \"reproduce\" or \"offspring\" until students are comfortable with the core concept.\n\n4. **Peer support:** Pair struggling students with a stronger peer during Explore and Elaborate. The peer can model observation and description.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Prediction and hypothesis:** Ask advanced students to predict how long the seed will take to sprout, measure the height of seedlings as they grow, and create a graph of growth over weeks. Connect to data collection skills.\n\n2. **Plant comparison:** Challenge students to compare seeds from multiple fruits (squash, pumpkin, watermelon, apple). Create a chart showing size, color, shape, and number. Ask, \"Why do you think different plants have different seeds?\"\n\n3. **Plant needs investigation:** Have advanced students design a simple experiment to test what seeds need to grow: sunlight, water, or soil. Create two conditions (one with water, one without, for example) and observe which seed sprouts first.\n\n4. **Research and communication:** Provide picture books or simple texts about how seeds disperse (wind, water, animals). Have students discuss how their squash plant spreads its seeds. Can they explain why there are so many seeds inside one fruit?\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grow and Document:** Over several weeks, students water their planted seeds, observe sprouting, and document growth with drawings or photos. Create a classroom \"seed journey\" bulletin board showing seedlings at different stages. Connect to 1-LS3-1 by comparing how each student's plant grows and noting small differences in color, size, or leaf shape among the baby plants.\n\n2. **Seed Hunt and Collection:** Take students on a nature walk around the school or park to find and collect seeds from real plants (dandelion seeds, acorn caps, pine cones, seed pods). Discuss how different plants spread their seeds. Sort seeds by size, color, or type. This extends understanding of plant diversity and seed structures.\n\n3. **Fruit and Seed Sorting Game:** Create a matching activity where students match pictures of fruits to pictures of seeds (e.g., apple image → apple seed image, watermelon → watermelon seed, etc.). Add a simple reading component with words like \"apple seed,\" \"pumpkin seed,\" and \"bean seed.\" This reinforces the parent-offspring relationship and builds vocabulary.\n\n---",
