Identify fungi as living organisms that grow in specific habitats (like damp wood and mulch).\n2. Explain that fungi have a life cycle including growth and changes over time, similar to other living things.\n3. Describe how fungi help break down dead material in nature and create conditions where they can survive.\n4. Observe and record different traits of fungi (size, shape, color) and explain how their environment influences these traits.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph to spark wonder about fungi.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (fungi02.jpeg) printed large (11x14\") or projected on screen\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: hand lenses (one per pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** in the center of the classroom on chart paper or via projector. Do NOT immediately label what the mushrooms are—let students discover.\n\n2. **Pose initial observations** without leading language:\n   - \"Turn to a partner and describe what you see in this picture. Use as many details as you can.\"\n   - Allow 2 minutes of partner talk.\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (write them on chart paper as you ask):\n   - \"What color are these living things, and why do you think they might be that color?\"\n   - \"Where are these growing? What do you see around them?\" (Guide them to notice the dark, broken-up wood/mulch.)\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this in your yard, a garden, or the forest? Where? What was around it?\"\n   - \"These organisms are alive. What makes you think they're living things?\" (Listen for: they grow, they change, they appear in groups, etc.)\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:**\n   - \"I'm wondering... Why would a living thing choose to grow on old, broken wood instead of in soil like plants do? What do you think?\"\n   - Record student predictions on chart paper: \"Our Fungi Predictions.\"\n\n5. **Display a student-friendly provocative statement:**\n   - \"These organisms are nature's cleanup crew. They have a very important job in our world, and we're going to discover what that job is!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become detectives and do a hands-on investigation to learn more about these mysterious organisms.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposition and fungal growth through a concrete, tactile activity.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- 2-3 pieces of fresh wood or untreated wood chips (about 2-3\" long, gathered from outdoors or a garden center)\n- 1 small piece of old, crumbly, dark wood or rotted log (pre-collected by teacher or purchased)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Water in small spray bottles\n- Paper towels\n- Observation sheets (pre-printed template with labeled sections for drawings and notes)\n- Ziplock bags (small, quart-size) for storage\n- Labels and permanent markers\n\n**Activity (Teacher-Directed Steps):**\n\n1. **Distribute materials to each pair.** Say: \"You're going to compare fresh wood with very old, decomposing wood. This will help us understand where fungi like to live.\"\n\n2. **Part A – Observation & Comparison (8 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at your fresh wood pieces first. Use your hand lens. What do you notice about the color, texture, and hardness? Try to scratch it gently with your fingernail. Draw what you see on your observation sheet under 'Fresh Wood.'\"\n   - Students draw and write (or dictate to a partner) 2-3 observations.\n   - **Transition:** \"Now look at your old, decomposing wood.\"\n   - \"What do you notice about this wood? Is it the same color? Does it feel the same? Is it harder or softer? Can you see anything growing on it or in it? Draw and record what you observe under 'Old Wood.'\"\n   - Circulate and listen for observations: color differences, softness, visible organisms, smell, moisture.\n\n3. **Part B – Predicting Growth (5 minutes):**\n   - Provide each pair with a ziplock bag and water spray.\n   - \"We're going to simulate a moist habitat. Place both the fresh and old wood in your bag. Spray both lightly with water—just enough to make them damp, like forest ground after rain.\"\n   - \"On your observation sheet, draw and write: Where do you predict fungi will grow? The fresh wood, the old wood, or both? Why?\"\n   - Discuss predictions as a group for 1-2 minutes.\n\n4. **Part C – Setting up for observation (3-4 minutes):**\n   - \"We're going to keep these bags in a warm, dark place (inside a cabinet or under a table with a cloth) for the next few days. Real fungi need moisture and darkness. You'll observe them again in 2-3 days.\"\n   - Label each bag with the group's name and date.\n   - Explain: \"Over time, if conditions are right, fungi will begin to grow on the decomposing wood. We'll watch and see what happens!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each pair, asking open-ended questions: *\"What do you notice about the texture? Why might fungi prefer old wood? What does the old wood smell like?\"*\n- Do NOT provide answers; instead, redirect: *\"What do you think is happening to the old wood? What makes you say that?\"*\n- Ensure students handle materials gently and spray water lightly (not drowning the wood).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students record 3-4 observations comparing fresh and old wood (color, texture, softness, visible changes).\n- Students make a prediction about where fungi will grow and provide a reason.\n- Students recognize that decomposing wood is different from fresh wood.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and synthesize exploration findings with the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original photograph (projected or large print)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Vocabulary cards with images (see Vocabulary section below)\n- Optional: a real mushroom or high-quality image of the same fungi species, if available\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Let's talk about what you discovered. Who found a difference between fresh and old wood?\"\n   - Call on 2-3 pairs to share one observation.\n   - Chart their responses: \"Old wood was softer / darker / felt wet / had a smell / had tiny holes.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the old wood was different?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Fungi Vocabulary (7-8 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again prominently.\n   - \"The organisms in this picture are called **fungi** (one is a fungus; many are fungi). They are living things, just like plants and animals, but they are very different from both.\"\n   - Introduce each term with a student-friendly definition and visual reference:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Fungi:** Living organisms that do not make their own food from sunlight (like plants) but instead eat dead or living material around them. They help break things down.\n   - **Decompose/Decomposition:** The process of breaking down dead plants, animals, and wood into smaller and smaller pieces. Fungi are decomposers.\n   - **Decomposer:** A living thing that breaks down dead material and turns it into soil. Fungi are decomposers.\n   - **Habitat:** The special place where a living thing lives and finds food, water, and everything it needs to survive.\n   - **Spore:** A tiny, tiny seed-like part that fungi make to create new fungi. Spores float in the air (like pollen).\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (4-5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the mushrooms: \"These mushrooms are growing on wood chips and mulch, which is dead plant material. This is the perfect habitat for fungi because there's plenty of food—the decomposing wood.\"\n   - Point to different mushrooms: \"Do you notice these fungi are different sizes? Some are big, some are small. Some are clustered together, some are alone. Even though they're the same kind of fungus, they look a bit different. We call those differences **traits.** Their environment—how wet it is, how warm, how much space they have—influences what they look like.\"\n   - \"In a few days, if our wood stays moist and cool, fungi will start to grow on the old wood in our bags, just like these in the picture!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask students to turn and talk: *\"Tell your partner: What do fungi eat? Where do they live? Why are they important?\"*\n   - Listen to 2-3 pairs sharing with the group.\n   - Correct gently if needed: *\"Great thinking! Fungi eat dead wood and plants, not live animals like we do. That's what makes them decomposers.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name fungi as living organisms and explain (in simple terms) that they break down dead material.\n- Students understand that fungi need certain conditions (moisture, darkness, dead material) to grow.\n- Students recognize that traits of fungi can vary based on their environment.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of fungi and habitats to a new scenario and deepen their thinking about life cycles and survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large index cards or paper (one per small group)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Printed \"Habitat Scenario Cards\" (3 different scenarios—see below)\n- Chart paper for recording group conclusions\n- Optional: samples of different types of mulch, wood chips, or soil to examine\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A – Habitat Match Game (8-10 minutes):**\n\n1. **Divide the class into three small groups** and assign each group one \"Habitat Scenario Card\":\n\n   **Scenario 1 – The Damp Forest Floor:**\n   - *Habitat description:* A shaded forest floor with lots of fallen logs, leaf litter, high moisture, and cool temperature.\n   - *Question:* \"Where would fungi thrive here? Where could they survive less well? Why?\"\n\n   **Scenario 2 – The Sunny Garden Bed:**\n   - *Habitat description:* A sunny, dry garden with sandy soil, little shade, and low moisture (unless you water it).\n   - *Question:* \"Would fungi survive here? Why or why not? What would they need to survive?\"\n\n   **Scenario 3 – The Basement:**\n   - *Habitat description:* A cool, dark, damp basement with cardboard boxes and wood.\n   - *Question:* \"Fungi are found in basements sometimes. Explain why this habitat might be good for fungi.\"\n\n2. **Group Task (6-8 minutes):**\n   - \"Your group has a habitat. Draw a picture of the habitat and label the things fungi would need to survive there.\"\n   - \"Then write or draw: *Can fungi survive here? Why or why not?*\"\n   - Provide colored pencils, paper, and markers.\n   - Circulate and prompt: *\"What do fungi need? Does this habitat have those things? How do you know?\"*\n\n3. **Gallery Walk & Share-Out (4-5 minutes):**\n   - Groups post their drawings.\n   - Each group shares their conclusion in 1-2 sentences.\n   - Teacher asks: *\"Why is a damp, shady place better for fungi than a dry, sunny place?\"* (Guide them to note moisture + darkness = good fungal habitat.)\n\n**Part B – Life Cycle Discussion (5-7 minutes):**\n\n1. **Return to the photograph and discuss the mushroom life cycle:**\n   - \"Look at these mushrooms. Some are big, some are small. Some are just starting to grow, some are fully grown.\"\n   - \"Just like plants and animals, fungi have a life cycle. They are born (or grow from a spore), they grow bigger, they make spores to create new fungi, and eventually they break down.\"\n   - \"Why do you think the mushroom in the middle is bigger than the others?\" (It's older; it's had more time to grow; it had good conditions.)\n   - \"Can you see a tiny mushroom starting to grow? What do you think will happen to it over the next week?\" (It will grow bigger if conditions are right.)\n\n2. **Create a simple life cycle diagram on chart paper:**\n   - Draw 4 boxes: \"Spore Lands\" → \"Growing\" → \"Full-Grown Mushroom\" → \"Breaks Down and Makes New Spores\"\n   - Have students add labels or drawings to each stage.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students explain that fungi thrive in moist, dark habitats with dead material.\n- Students recognize that the same organism (fungi) survives well in some habitats and poorly in others.\n- Students connect observation (different-sized mushrooms) to the concept of life cycles and growth over time.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fungi as living organisms with specific habitat needs and life cycles.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n- Observation checklists during Explore phase: Did students accurately compare fresh and old wood? Did they make reasonable predictions?\n- Listen-in during Turn & Talk moments: Can students explain what fungi eat? Where they live? Why they're important?\n- Review observation sheets and drawings: Do they show understanding of decomposition and habitat?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) – Three-Question Format:**\n\nAdminister this at the end of Session 2 (can be oral for students who are emerging readers, or written with pictures):\n\n1. **\"Look at this photograph of mushrooms. What do these organisms need to survive? List or draw 2-3 things.\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student identifies at least 2 of the following: moisture/water, dead wood/plant material, darkness or shade, cool temperature.\n\n2. **\"We found that old wood was softer and darker than fresh wood. Explain: Why do fungi like to grow on old, soft wood instead of fresh, hard wood?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student indicates that fungi eat/decompose dead/dying material, OR that old wood is easier to break down, OR that decomposing wood is their habitat/home.\n\n3. **\"Draw or write: Show the life cycle of a mushroom with 3 stages. What happens at each stage?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student identifies any three stages (e.g., spore, small mushroom, large mushroom, breaks down) and explains growth or change.\n\n**Alternative Exit Ticket Format (Visual/Tactile for Younger Readers):**\n- Provide a simple illustration of a mushroom, fresh wood, and old wood.\n- Students use colored dots or stickers to mark: \"Where fungi like to live\" (the old wood/decomposing material).\n- Students draw an arrow showing what fungi eat.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes (Success Indicators):**\n- Students identify at least two habitat requirements for fungi (moisture + dead material).\n- Students explain the connection between decomposing wood and fungal growth.\n- Students recognize that organisms have life cycles with stages of growth.\n- Students use vocabulary correctly: fungi, decomposer, habitat, spore, decompose.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for students still developing understanding):\n\n1. **Sentence Stems & Word Banks:**\n   - Provide pre-written sentence starters for exit tickets and observations:\n     - \"Fungi live in _______.\"\n     - \"Fungi eat _______.\"\n     - \"Old wood is _______ because _______.\"\n   - Include a visual word bank with pictures: habitat, decompose, moisture, spore, fungi.\n\n2. **Paired Observation Activity:**\n   - Pair emerging readers/writers with strong readers during Explore phase.\n   - The stronger reader scribes while the emerging reader directs observations: *\"You tell me what you see, and I'll write it down.\"*\n\n3. **Simplified Exit Ticket:**\n   - Offer a multiple-choice or matching version: \"Fungi like places that are: (a) hot and dry, (b) cool and wet, (c) sunny.\"\n   - Use pictures instead of words wherever possible.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Research Project – Fungal Diversity:**\n   - \"There are MANY different kinds of fungi besides mushrooms (molds, yeasts, puffballs). Research one type and draw a picture. Where does it live? What does it eat?\"\n   - Students present findings to a small group or class.\n\n2. **Problem-Solving Extension:**\n   - Present a scenario: \"A farmer finds mold growing on hay stored in a damp barn. The farmer wants the hay to last longer. What could they do to stop the mold?\"\n   - Students brainstorm solutions based on what they learned about fungal habitat needs (reduce moisture, increase light, improve air flow).\n   - Have them draw or write a plan.\n\n3. **Deeper Life Cycle Exploration:**\n   - Challenge students to observe the actual fungi growing in their bags over 5-7 days and photograph or draw the changes.\n   - Graph the growth over time (height, number of mushrooms) or create a detailed life cycle comic strip with 4+ panels showing stages.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Follow-Up Observation Project (2-3 Days Later):**\n   - Check the bags with fungi/wood. Observe how fungi have grown or begun to grow on the decomposing wood.\n   - Students re-examine their predictions and compare to actual results: *\"What happened? Did fungi grow where you predicted? Why or why not?\"*\n   - Take photos of mushroom growth stages and create a classroom photo timeline on the bulletin board.\n   - Discuss: \"Were our conditions (moisture, darkness, dead wood) correct for fungi to grow?\"\n\n2. **Fungi in Your Home & Community Hunt:**\n   - Assign a homework exploration: \"Look for fungi in your home, yard, or neighborhood. Where did you find them? Take a picture or draw it. What was growing near them?\"\n   - Students share findings the next day; create a class map or chart of \"Places We Found Fungi.\"\n   - Discuss: \"Do our findings match what we learned about fungal habitats?\"\n\n3. **Decomposition & Soil Creation Experiment:**\n   - Extend to a longer-term project: \"Fungi help turn dead wood into rich soil. Let's create a small compost container (or use a clear plastic bag with layers of dead leaves, food scraps, and soil).\"\n   - Over several weeks, students observe decomposition and the role fungi play.\n   - Connect to gardening: \"Gardeners use compost (decomposed material) to help plants grow. Fungi made that compost possible!\"\n\n4. **Virtual Field Trip or Invited Expert:**\n   - If available, arrange a virtual tour of a local mushroom farm or composting facility where fungi are actively working.\n   - Or invite a local mycologist (fungi scientist) or gardener to discuss fungi in their work.\n\n5. **Art Integration – Spore Print Activity:**\n   - Collect real edible mushrooms (or use the grown fungi, if safe).\n   - Press caps on black paper overnight to create spore prints—beautiful, radial patterns made by millions of spores.\n   - Display prints and discuss: \"These tiny spores float in the air and can start new fungi when they land in the right habitat.\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Classroom Management\n\n1. **Safety & Cleanliness:**\n   - Do NOT allow students to taste or handle wild mushrooms; some are poisonous.\n   - If using real mushrooms for spore prints, use only store-bought edible varieties.\n   - Provide hand sanitizer after handling decomposing wood and fungi.\n   - Use untreated wood only (avoid pressure-treated or painted wood).\n\n2. **Preparation:**\n   - Collect old, decomposing wood pieces or purchase untreated wood chips from a garden center 1-2 weeks before the lesson.\n   - Pre-cut fresh wood pieces to 2-3\" lengths.\n   - Prepare ziplock bags and observation sheets in advance.\n   - Print and laminate vocabulary cards for reusability.\n\n3. **Timing & Flexibility:**\n   - The fungal growth in bags may take 3-7 days depending on conditions. Keep bags in a warm (68-72°F), dark place (closet, cabinet, under a table with a cloth) to speed growth.\n   - If growth is slow, have backup photos of fungi growth stages to show during follow-up observations.\n   - Adjust the timeline if needed—the lesson is valid even if fungi don't visibly grow during the lesson window; the predictions and habitat discussion are the key learning.\n\n4. **Engagement Strategies:**\n   - Use mystery and discovery language: \"detectives,\" \"uncovering nature's secret,\" \"cleanup crew.\"\n   - Make the photograph the anchor throughout all five phases; return to it repeatedly.\n   - Celebrate observations, even unconventional ones: \"Great noticing! Yes, that hole in the wood was probably made by an insect, AND fungi also helps soften the wood.\"\n\n---\n\nThis 5E lesson plan transforms student curiosity about fungi into deep understanding of decomposition, habitat, and life cycles through hands-on exploration and age-appropriate inquiry.",
