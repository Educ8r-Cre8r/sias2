ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by observing the lizard photograph and wondering about how it lives.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed copy of the lizard photograph (one per student or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Optional: live or realistic model lizard (if available for students to observe)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the screen or projector. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions** (write them on chart paper as you discuss):\n   - \"What do you notice about this lizard's skin? What does it look like up close?\"\n   - \"Look at the lizard's feet and legs. What are they like? Why might the lizard have claws and bumpy feet?\"\n   - \"What color is this lizard? Where is it sitting? Why might being brown and tan be helpful here?\"\n   - \"If you were this lizard, what would you need your body to do to stay safe and find food?\"\n\n3. **Generate predictions:** Have students complete this sentence on a sticky note or in their science journal: *\"I think this lizard's [body part] helps it survive because…\"* Collect these predictions to revisit at the end of the lesson.\n\n4. **Create a class \"Wonder List\"** on chart paper. Ask: \"What do you wonder about how this lizard's body helps it live?\" Record 4-5 student wonderings (e.g., *Can it climb? Does it hide? How does it hunt?*).\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore the lizard's amazing body parts and discover how each one is like a special tool that helps the lizard survive. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate adaptations through hands-on exploration using models and role-play.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards or cardstock with 4 different \"body feature cards\" (each featuring: feet/claws, skin texture, color/camouflage, tail)\n- Small toy lizards or clay lizards (optional; one per pair of students)\n- Textured materials (sandpaper, bumpy bubble wrap, smooth plastic, tree bark sample)\n- Brown, tan, and green construction paper or fabric pieces\n- Picture cards showing different habitats: rainforest, desert, rocky mountain, grassy field\n- Scissors, tape, glue\n- Observation recording sheets (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Body Feature Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into 4 pairs.** Assign each pair one \"body feature\" (claws/feet, bumpy skin, color, tail).\n\n2. **Provide each pair with:**\n   - A body feature card showing that lizard part in close-up\n   - Related tactile materials to explore (e.g., the \"skin texture\" group gets sandpaper and bubble wrap)\n   - An observation sheet with prompts:\n     - *\"Draw what you see on the body part card.\"*\n     - *\"Touch the materials. Which feels most like a lizard's skin? Why?\"*\n     - *\"How might this body part help a lizard survive?\"*\n\n3. **Have each pair spend 5 minutes exploring** their assigned body part. Circulate and ask follow-up questions without giving answers: *\"What does that feel like? What could a lizard do with claws like these?\"*\n\n4. **Bring the class together for a 2-minute quick share.** Each pair shows their body part card and answers: *\"One thing we discovered is…\"* (Do not correct; just record observations.)\n\n**Part B: Camouflage and Habitat Match (8 minutes)**\n\n5. **Display habitat pictures** (rainforest, desert, rocky place, grass field).\n\n6. **Show students pieces of brown, tan, and green paper.** Ask: *\"If you were designing a lizard for each habitat, which color would you choose for the rocky place? For the rainforest?\"*\n\n7. **Have pairs place their colored paper samples** against each habitat picture and observe which color is hardest to see.\n\n8. **Record observations:** Students draw or write their habitat color matches on their recording sheet.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate to each group, asking open-ended questions: *\"What did you discover?\" \"Why do you think that?\"*\n- Avoid telling students answers; instead, redirect: *\"What do you notice when you hold the brown paper next to the tree bark?\"*\n- Model observing carefully without judging.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that bumpy, textured skin provides grip and protection.\n- Students observe that claws help with climbing and gripping.\n- Students discover that color helps an animal hide in its environment.\n- Students begin to make connections between body features and survival needs.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce key vocabulary and formalize concepts discovered during exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the lizard (projected or printed)\n- Body feature reference chart (poster or digital)\n- Sentence frames written on chart paper\n- Student journals or paper for note-taking\n- Whiteboard/markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):** Call students back to the carpet. Ask each pair to briefly report one discovery from their body feature investigation. Record key words on a growing chart labeled *\"How Lizards Survive.\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):** Point to the lizard photograph and teach these five terms:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home.\n   - **Camouflage:** Colors or patterns that help an animal hide by blending in with its environment.\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter.\n   - **Scales:** Small, hard, overlapping pieces that cover a lizard's skin and protect it.\n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts other animals for food.\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph:** Point to specific parts and use the new words:\n   - *\"This lizard's brown and tan **scales** are an example of **camouflage.** They help it blend with the tree bark in its **habitat.** This adaptation keeps it safe from **predators** that might want to eat it.\"*\n   - *\"The bumpy texture of its skin is an **adaptation** that helps it grip branches and climb.\"*\n\n4. **Sentence Frames (5 minutes):** Provide sentence starters and have students complete them in their journals:\n   - \"The lizard's claws are an adaptation because…\"\n   - \"Camouflage helps the lizard survive by…\"\n   - \"In a rocky habitat, a lizard with brown skin survives well because…\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"Show me with your thumb—do you understand what an adaptation is?\"* (Thumbs up/middle/down)\n   - Call on 2-3 students to explain an adaptation in their own words.\n   - Listen for key ideas: *helps the animal survive, body part or behavior, fits the habitat.*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary correctly in sentences.\n- Students can identify the lizard's bumpy skin, claws, color, and tail as adaptations.\n- Students understand that adaptations help animals survive in their habitats.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of adaptations to new scenarios and deepen thinking about survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Habitat scenario cards (4 different environments, printed)\n- Design paper or half-sheet cardstock\n- Colored pencils, markers, crayons\n- Dice or spinner (optional, for random habitat assignment)\n- Picture reference cards of actual lizard species in different environments (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Habitat Survival Challenge (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Present four habitat scenario cards:**\n   - Scenario A: A hot, sandy desert with few plants or trees\n   - Scenario B: A dark, damp jungle with tall trees and thick plants\n   - Scenario C: An icy, cold mountain with snow and rocks\n   - Scenario D: A smooth, grassy field with no trees or rocks\n\n2. **Assign or have students draw a habitat** (or do this as a whole class first, then repeat with different habitats).\n\n3. **Challenge:** *\"The lizard in our photograph lives on rocky, tree-filled land. Now imagine a lizard living in [Scenario A/B/C/D]. What body parts would help it survive there? Draw and label your 'new lizard' designed for that habitat.\"*\n\n4. **Students design and draw** a lizard suited to their assigned habitat, labeling at least 3 adaptations:\n   - **Desert lizard:** Might have light-colored skin to reflect heat, shorter limbs to stay low, skin that retains water.\n   - **Jungle lizard:** Might be green for camouflage, have longer limbs to jump between trees, brighter colors for communication.\n   - **Mountain lizard:** Might have thick, dark skin, strong legs for climbing rocks.\n   - **Field lizard:** Might be tan/brown, fast-moving legs, streamlined body.\n\n5. **Gallery walk** (optional, if time allows): Post designs around room. Students view and leave sticky-note observations: *\"I noticed your lizard has [adaptation] to help it [survive in that habitat].\"*\n\n**Part B: Reflection & Discussion (3 minutes)**\n\n6. **Gather and discuss:**\n   - *\"Why is the same lizard body not perfect for every habitat?\"*\n   - *\"If we moved our tree-bark lizard to the desert, how would it survive? What problems might it have?\"*\n   - Record responses: *\"Some animals survive well in some habitats, but not in others.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate while students design, asking: *\"Why did you choose that color?\" \"How would that body part help in that habitat?\"*\n- Validate creative thinking while gently guiding toward biological reasoning.\n- Encourage students to reference the vocabulary from the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply the concept of adaptation to a new situation.\n- Students recognize that different habitats require different body features.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that organisms fit their environments.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students met the learning objectives using formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Exit ticket template (printed or digital)\n- Lizard photograph\n- Student journals/work samples from all phases\n- Observation notes from Engage and Explore phases\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing):**\n- Monitored student responses during Engage (predictions on sticky notes).\n- Observed group work quality during Explore; noted which students identified connections between body parts and survival.\n- Listened to sentence completions during Explain to check vocabulary understanding.\n- Reviewed design choices during Elaborate for evidence of adaptation reasoning.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative, 5-7 minutes):**\n\nProvide students with this template (options for differentiation in italics):\n\n---\n\n**\"Lizard Survival Exit Ticket\"**\n\n**Name: ___________________     Date: _______________**\n\n**1. Look at the photograph again. Point to one body part of the lizard and explain how it helps the lizard survive.**\n   - *Example: The lizard's _____ helps it survive because _____.*\n\n**2. If this lizard moved to a place with smooth sand and no trees, what problem might it have? Why?**\n   - *Example: The lizard would have trouble _____ because _____.*\n\n**3. What is one way the lizard's color helps it stay safe?**\n   - *Answer: ___________________*\n\n---\n\n**Scoring Rubric for Understanding:**\n\n| Evidence Level | Indicators |\n|---|---|\n| **Strong** | Student identifies 2+ adaptations with clear survival reasoning; explains habitat mismatch; uses vocabulary (adaptation, camouflage, habitat). |\n| **Developing** | Student identifies 1 adaptation; gives partial explanation of survival or habitat; uses 1-2 vocabulary terms correctly. |\n| **Beginning** | Student identifies a body part but struggles to explain survival value; limited reasoning; vocabulary use inconsistent. |\n\n**Check for Understanding Strategy:**\n- Collect exit tickets and sort into the three categories above.\n- Use data to identify students who need reteaching, conferencing, or challenge work.\n- Use student work samples (Explore sheets, Elaborate designs) as evidence of learning growth from Engage to Evaluate.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should demonstrate:\n- Ability to name at least 2 lizard adaptations (claws, bumpy skin, color, tail).\n- Understanding that adaptations help organisms survive in their habitats.\n- Recognition that the same body features don't work for all environments.\n- Use of at least 2 vocabulary terms correctly (adaptation, camouflage, habitat, predator, scales).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide visual sentence frames** with fill-in-the-blank options during Explain and Evaluate:\n   - *\"The lizard's bumpy skin is an adaptation. It helps the lizard ☐ grip ☐ swim ☐ hide.\"*\n   - Use pictures alongside words on vocabulary cards.\n\n2. **Pair students strategically** during Explore; pair a student who struggles with a stronger peer.\n   - Assign the \"color\" body feature (most concrete) to students who need concrete examples.\n   - Use tactile materials (bump wrap, sandpaper) for kinesthetic learners.\n\n3. **Reduce the Elaborate challenge:** Instead of designing a new lizard, ask students to **match** pre-drawn lizards to habitats (multiple choice format).\n   - *\"Which lizard would survive best in the desert? A, B, or C? Why?\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deep dive into predator-prey relationships:**\n   - Research assignment: *\"Find another animal that shares the tree-bark lizard's habitat. How are their adaptations similar or different? What about their predators?\"*\n   - Create a habitat food web diagram showing the lizard as both hunter and hunted.\n\n2. **Comparative adaptation analysis:**\n   - Compare the tree-bark lizard to a real desert lizard or ocean lizard (marine iguana).\n   - Create a Venn diagram or chart: *\"Same Adaptations\" / \"Different Adaptations.\"*\n   - Write a short explanation: *\"Why do these two lizards look different if they're both lizards?\"*\n\n3. **Design a new habitat:**\n   - *\"Imagine a planet with no gravity and water everywhere. Design a lizard that could survive there. Label at least 4 adaptations.\"*\n   - Presentation or poster explaining reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Adaptation Detective\" Field Observation:**\n   - Take students on a short outdoor walk or use a video of a local park/nature area.\n   - Task: Find 3 animals (visible or photographed/video) and identify one adaptation each (e.g., bird's sharp beak, squirrel's bushy tail).\n   - Create a class poster: *\"Adaptations We Found.\"*\n   - Connections: Real-world observation reinforces that adaptations exist everywhere.\n\n2. **Design Challenge: \"Save the Lizard\":**\n   - Present a scenario: *\"The forest where the tree-bark lizard lives is being cut down. The lizard must move to a new habitat. Your job is to design a new habitat (or an animal shelter) where this lizard could survive. Draw it, label it, and explain how each feature helps the lizard.\"*\n   - Students use their understanding of habitat and adaptation in a creative, problem-solving context.\n   - Can be done individually or in small groups; extend with a presentation or museum walk.\n\n3. **Life Cycle Connection: Growing Up as a Lizard**\n   - Return to 3-LS1-1 (life cycles).\n   - Research or read-aloud: \"How does a baby lizard develop?\" or \"Do lizards care for their young?\"\n   - Activity: Create a \"Lizard Life Cycle\" poster showing egg → baby → adult, labeling how adaptations develop or change (e.g., baby has same camouflage but smaller size, young may climb differently).\n   - **Bridges to:** Life cycles of organisms; development over time.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Pacing:** This lesson is designed for two 45-minute sessions. Session 1 covers Engage–Explore; Session 2 covers Explain–Elaborate–Evaluate. Adjust timing based on your class.\n- **Real-world connection:** Discuss with students that understanding animal adaptations helps scientists protect habitats and endangered species.\n- **Pre-lesson preparation:** Have all materials cut and sorted before class begins. Pre-print exit tickets and observation sheets.\n- **Safety note:** If using a live lizard for observation, ensure proper handling, classroom safety protocols, and appropriate care.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson transforms a striking photograph into deep exploration of how organisms are shaped by and suited to their environments—a cornerstone concept in Third Grade life science.",
