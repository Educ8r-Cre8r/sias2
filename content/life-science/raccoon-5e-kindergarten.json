ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about raccoons and activate prior knowledge about animal needs using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of the raccoon (or projected on screen/interactive board)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: stuffed raccoon or raccoon puppet to hold attention\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Introduction (2 minutes):** Show the photograph to the class. Hold it up or project it large enough for all students to see. Alternatively, show a raccoon puppet and say, \"Look! We found a mystery visitor today!\"\n\n2. **Initial Observation Questions (5-7 minutes):** Ask students these questions in order, pausing for 2-3 responses each:\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? What is it called?\" (Point to the raccoon if students struggle.)\n   - \"What does the raccoon look like? Can you describe its color, fur, or the special marking on its face?\" (Accept simple descriptors: gray, black, eyes, mask, tail.)\n   - \"Where is the raccoon in this picture?\" (Guide them to notice the water, logs, plants, trees.)\n   - \"What do you think the raccoon is doing here?\" (Accept predictions: playing, looking for food, resting, exploring.)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt (3-5 minutes):** Ask: \"What do **you** need to stay healthy and alive? Think about it. What do we need?\" Pause for answers (food, water, sleep, etc.). Then ask: \"Do you think raccoons need the same things? Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Create a Wonder Chart:** Write on chart paper: \"What Do Raccoons Need?\" Leave it visible for the rest of the lesson. This becomes a running record students will add to.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Now we're going to explore a special habitat to discover what raccoons really need to survive, just like we need food, water, and a safe place to sleep.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover what animals need by building and exploring a model habitat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large plastic bins or shallow boxes (one per small group of 3-4 students)\n- Soil or potting mix\n- Small branches, twigs, and bark pieces\n- Artificial plants, green tissue paper, or real (non-toxic) plant clippings\n- Blue fabric, blue paper, or blue plastic sheeting (to represent water)\n- Small plastic cups\n- Cotton balls or craft moss\n- Pictures of raccoon food (fish, frogs, berries, insects, garbage) printed on cards or drawn\n- Observation sheets (simple picture sheets with three labeled boxes: Food, Water, Shelter)\n- Pencils and crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions (teacher leads small groups or whole class):**\n\n1. **Set Up (5 minutes):** \"Today, we're going to build a home for a pretend raccoon. Let's create the place where raccoons live — it's called a habitat. A habitat is a home that gives animals everything they need.\"\n\n2. **Build the Habitat (10-12 minutes):** Provide each group with a bin. Guide them through these steps:\n   - \"First, put soil at the bottom of your box. This is the ground.\"\n   - \"Now, add branches and twigs. Raccoons like to hide under logs and roots!\"\n   - \"Add green plants around the edges. Raccoons live near trees and bushes.\"\n   - \"Here's blue fabric or paper — this is water! Raccoons live near ponds and streams. Spread it in one area.\"\n   - \"Finally, let's add a shelter — use bark, a small cup turned upside down, or cotton balls for a cozy den where a raccoon might sleep.\"\n\n3. **Explore and Observe (5 minutes):** \"Now, let's look at what we built. Point to the water. Where could a raccoon find food? Where could it hide? Where might it sleep?\" Encourage students to gently explore the habitat with their fingers.\n\n4. **Record Observations:** Provide observation sheets with three simple boxes labeled:\n   - 🏠 **SHELTER** (Where the raccoon sleeps/hides)\n   - 💧 **WATER** (Where the raccoon drinks)\n   - 🍽️ **FOOD** (Where the raccoon finds food)\n   \n   Students draw or color in each box to show what they see in their habitat.\n\n5. **Add Food Cards:** Place picture cards of raccoon food (fish, berries, insects, etc.) around the habitat. Ask: \"If a raccoon lived here, what could it eat? Let's find these foods in nature.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between groups; ask guiding questions without answers: \"What do you notice about the water?\" \"Where do you think the raccoon would rest?\"\n- Encourage all students to touch and explore the habitat.\n- Help students connect what they built to what they saw in the photograph: \"Remember the picture? It looked like this habitat, didn't it?\"\n- Validate observations rather than judge accuracy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully identify three distinct areas in their habitat (water, food sources, shelter).\n- Students use simple language to describe what they see: \"We made water here,\" \"The logs are hiding spots,\" \"Berries are food.\"\n- Students complete observation sheets by drawing or coloring the three elements.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to the raccoon's real needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with \"What Do Raccoons Need?\" heading (from Engage phase)\n- Three large picture cards or illustrations: Water, Food, Shelter\n- The original raccoon photograph (displayed again)\n- Markers\n- Optional: simple diagram of a raccoon labeling ears, paws, tail, eyes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):** \n   - Invite 2-3 groups to show their habitat and describe one thing they noticed.\n   - Listen actively and validate responses: \"You found a place for water! That's important. Raccoons need to drink.\"\n   - Record student observations on the \"What Do Raccoons Need?\" chart using pictures and simple words.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (6-8 minutes):**\n   Display the three picture cards and teach these terms:\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Habitat** | A place where an animal lives that has everything it needs: food, water, and shelter. |\n   | **Food** | Plants or other animals that give energy and help the body grow strong. |\n   | **Water** | A drink that all animals need to stay healthy and alive. |\n   | **Shelter** | A safe place to rest, hide, and stay warm — like a home. |\n   | **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy. |\n\n   Say each word aloud and have students repeat. Use gestures and point to the photograph to show examples.\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Show the raccoon picture again: \"Look! This raccoon is in a real habitat. There's water behind it — see? There are plants and logs where it can find food and hide. Nature gave this raccoon everything it needs to survive!\"\n   - Point to each element: \"Water here. Plants and shelter here. Food to find here.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   Ask quick \"thumbs up/thumbs down\" questions:\n   - \"Does a raccoon need water? Thumbs up if yes!\" (Expect all thumbs up.)\n   - \"Can a raccoon live without shelter? Thumbs down if no!\" (Expect all thumbs down.)\n   - \"Does a raccoon need food to survive? Thumbs up!\" (Expect all thumbs up.)\n\n5. **Make a Class List:**\n   Finalize the chart by writing clearly:\n   - **Raccoons need: FOOD, WATER, and SHELTER**\n   - Add simple drawings or icons next to each word.\n\n**Vocabulary List (for your reference and student materials):**\n- **Habitat** — A home for an animal with food, water, and shelter.\n- **Food** — Things animals eat to grow and have energy.\n- **Water** — A liquid all animals need to drink to stay healthy.\n- **Shelter** — A safe, cozy place where an animal rests and hides.\n- **Survive** — To stay alive and be healthy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students verbally identify the three basic needs: food, water, shelter.\n- Students point to or describe examples in the photograph or their habitat model.\n- Students use new vocabulary in simple sentences: \"Raccoons need shelter,\" \"The water keeps them alive.\"\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by comparing animal needs to human needs and exploring how different animals survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper split into two columns: \"What Raccoons Need\" | \"What We Need\"\n- Pictures of other animals (squirrel, duck, bear, fish) — simple drawings or printed images\n- Observation worksheet: \"All Animals Need…\" with pictures of food, water, shelter\n- Crayons and markers\n- Optional: playdough or modeling clay\n\n**Activity:** (Choose one or both, depending on time and student engagement)\n\n**Option A: Comparison Chart (12-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Revisit Human Needs:** Ask students, \"Remember at the beginning we talked about what YOU need? Let's list them.\" Create a two-column chart on paper or board:\n   - Column 1: \"What Raccoons Need\"\n   - Column 2: \"What We Need\"\n\n2. **Compare Together:** \n   - Write \"FOOD\" in the raccoon column. Ask: \"Do we need food too?\" (Yes.) Write \"FOOD\" in the human column.\n   - Repeat for \"WATER\" and \"SHELTER.\"\n   - Discuss: \"Are they the same? What kind of food do raccoons eat? What food do we eat? Our shelter is different — we live in houses, but raccoons live in nature!\"\n\n3. **Conclude:** \"All animals — raccoons and people — need the same three things: food, water, and a safe place to live. But how we get them is different!\"\n\n4. **Student Work:** Give each student a worksheet showing three boxes (Food | Water | Shelter). Have them draw or color to show what **they** need vs. what raccoons need. Simple pictures are fine.\n\n**Option B: Other Animals Exploration (12-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce Other Animals:** Show pictures of 2-3 other animals (duck, squirrel, fish, or bear).\n\n2. **Ask Wonder Questions:** \n   - \"Does a duck need food? Where does a duck find it?\" (In water and on land.)\n   - \"Does a squirrel need shelter? Where does it live?\" (In trees.)\n   - \"What does a fish need?\" (Water, food, shelter on the bottom.)\n\n3. **Discovery Discussion:** Help students see that **all animals need the same three things**, but where and how they find them depends on their habitat.\n\n4. **Student Activity:** Using an \"All Animals Need…\" worksheet, students draw an animal and label its food, water, and shelter sources.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"Why do you think this animal needs shelter?\" \"Where would a duck find water?\"\n- Accept all logical answers without over-correcting.\n- Help students see patterns: \"What do ALL these animals have in common?\"\n- Encourage students to draw connections to the raccoon photograph.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students articulate that all animals — raccoons, humans, and others — need food, water, and shelter.\n- Students recognize that the **type** of food, water source, and shelter differs by animal and habitat.\n- Students begin to understand adaptation (implicitly): \"That animal lives in water, so it finds food there.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students understand that animals need food, water, and shelter to survive.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing Throughout Lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Observe which students correctly identify water, food sources, and shelter in their habitat model. Note students who struggle with the concept.\n- **During Explain:** Listen to responses during vocabulary checks and photograph observations. Use thumbs up/down for quick feedback.\n- **During Elaborate:** Review student drawings and listen to comparisons. Can students name at least two of the three needs?\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket — 5-10 minutes at end of Session 2):**\n\nUse one or both of these methods:\n\n**Method 1: Picture Sort (Non-Reader Friendly)**\n- Show students three pictures: a water bottle, an apple, and a bed/shelter.\n- Ask: \"Which of these do raccoons need to survive?\" \n- Have students point to or circle all three, or place them in a \"raccoon needs\" category.\n- **Success Criteria:** Student correctly identifies all three items as things raccoons need.\n\n**Method 2: Simple Question and Answer**\n- Ask each student individually or in small groups: \"Tell me one thing a raccoon needs to stay alive.\"\n- Accept responses: \"Water,\" \"Food,\" \"A home,\" \"Shelter,\" \"A safe place.\"\n- Ask a follow-up: \"Where does a raccoon find [water/food/shelter]?\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student names at least one need (food, water, shelter) and shows understanding of where/how it's found in their habitat.\n\n**Method 3: Draw and Label (If Writing is Introduced)**\n- Provide a simple outline of a raccoon.\n- Ask: \"Draw three things a raccoon needs: food, water, and shelter. Label them if you can.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student draws or labels at least two of the three needs clearly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n✅ **Achieved Learning Objectives if students can:**\n- Identify food, water, and shelter as basic animal needs.\n- Point to or describe these elements in the raccoon habitat or photograph.\n- Make a simple comparison between what raccoons need and what humans need.\n- Answer: \"What does a raccoon need?\" with at least one or two correct responses.\n\n⚠️ **Partially Achieved if students can:**\n- Name one or two of the three needs.\n- Show understanding with heavy teacher prompting.\n- Describe the habitat but confuse which element is which.\n\n❌ **Not Yet Achieved if students:**\n- Cannot identify any basic animal needs independently.\n- Do not engage with the habitat exploration activity.\n- Show no connection between the photograph and the concept of survival needs.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Habitat:** Provide a pre-built or partially built habitat where students only need to add one or two elements (e.g., water and a shelter structure). This reduces cognitive load while maintaining engagement with the core concept.\n\n2. **Verbal Scaffolding:** During discussions, provide sentence starters:\n   - \"This is _____ (food/water/shelter).\"\n   - \"Raccoons need _____ to stay alive.\"\n   - Repeat vocabulary words multiple times and use the same words consistently (not synonyms).\n\n3. **Pair with Peer Buddy:** Pair struggling learners with more confident peers during Explore. The buddy can model habitat building and observation. Assign the struggling learner a specific role, such as \"Water Manager\" or \"Plant Adder,\" to ensure active participation.\n\n4. **Shorter Exit Ticket:** Instead of a full assessment, use a single picture-point task: Show one image (water, food, or shelter) and ask, \"Does a raccoon need this?\" Repeat for each of the three.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Habitat Elaboration:** Ask advanced students to add details to their habitat:\n   - \"What specific animals might live near a raccoon? Add them to your habitat.\"\n   - \"Draw the different times of year this habitat might look different. What changes?\"\n   - \"How would this habitat change if there was no water? Could a raccoon live here?\"\n\n2. **Adaptation Exploration:** Introduce the concept of body parts as adaptations:\n   - \"Why does a raccoon have a mask-like face? Why are its paws special?\" (Teacher explains: masks help them see at night; paws help them catch slippery food.)\n   - Have them draw or label the raccoon's special features: paws, tail, eyes, ears, and explain what each helps it do.\n\n3. **Compare Multiple Habitats:** Provide pictures of different habitats (forest, desert, ocean, grassland) and ask:\n   - \"Which habitats would raccoons live in? Why?\"\n   - \"What animals live in this habitat? What do they need?\"\n   - Challenge them to draw another animal's habitat and label food, water, shelter.\n\n4. **Research Extension:** Provide picture books or internet images (teacher-curated) showing raccoons in different scenarios:\n   - Raccoon in a tree (where does it find water?)\n   - Raccoon in a city (what does it eat?)\n   - Ask: \"How do raccoons adapt their behavior based on where they live?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Raccoon Mask Craft & Movement Activity (30-45 minutes)**\n   - Students create paper raccoon masks with the distinctive black eye mask and whiskers.\n   - After wearing masks, lead a guided movement activity: \"Let's move like raccoons! We're looking for food by the water. Let's hide in our shelter. Let's drink water.\"\n   - Connect back to learning: \"Raccoons use their strong paws and eyes to find food. Their mask helps them see at night!\"\n\n2. **Animal Needs Scavenger Hunt (25-30 minutes)**\n   - Create picture cards of food, water, and shelter items.\n   - Hide them around the classroom or outdoor area.\n   - Give students a checklist: \"Find one food, one water source, and one shelter.\"\n   - Sort and discuss: \"Would a raccoon eat this? Would it drink from this? Could it hide here?\"\n   - Extend: Identify which items are \"natural\" (things in nature) vs. \"human-made.\"\n\n3. **Class Book: \"What Do We Need?\" (2-3 sessions, 30 minutes per page)**\n   - Create a collaborative big book with students.\n   - Each page features a different animal and its needs (raccoon, squirrel, fish, bird, etc.).\n   - Students draw or color their assigned animal and its habitat.\n   - Teacher writes simple labels or sentences under each illustration.\n   - Read aloud as a class and place in the classroom library.\n   - This reinforces that **all animals have the same basic needs**, a foundational concept for future grade levels.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Implementation Tips\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson is designed for two 45-60 minute sessions or three 40-minute sessions. Adjust based on your schedule.\n- **Habitat Materials:** Use recyclable and natural materials when possible (leaves, branches, soil). Contact a local nursery for free plant cuttings.\n- **Photograph Use:** Print the raccoon image in color if possible. Laminate for durability. Display it throughout the lesson for reference.\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Kindergarteners need 10+ exposures to new words. Use the terms \"food,\" \"water,\" \"shelter,\" and \"habitat\" consistently throughout and in future lessons.\n- **Safety:** Ensure all natural materials are non-toxic and age-appropriate. Supervise hands-on exploration closely.\n- **Inclusion:** This lesson supports multiple learning modalities: visual (photograph, drawings), kinesthetic (building habitat), and auditory (discussion, vocabulary). Students can participate at their own level.\n\n---\n\n## NGSS Alignment Summary\n\n**K-LS1-1: Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.**\n\n| **5E Phase** | **How Standard is Addressed** |\n|---|---|\n| **Engage** | Students observe the photograph and begin describing where raccoons live and what they might need. |\n| **Explore** | Students build a habitat and directly observe where food, water, and shelter are located—making the pattern concrete. |\n| **Explain** | Teacher introduces vocabulary (habitat, food, water, shelter, survive) and students describe patterns: \"All animals need these three things.\" |\n| **Elaborate** | Students compare animal needs to human needs, recognizing a broader pattern that all living things need the same three things. |\n| **Evaluate** | Students demonstrate understanding by identifying and explaining the three needs of raccoons and other animals. |\n\nThis lesson provides multiple entry points for students to observe, describe, and understand the universal pattern that animals (including raccoons and humans) need food, water, and shelter to survive—the core of K-LS1-1.",
