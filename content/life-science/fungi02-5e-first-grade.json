ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of the mushroom cluster on wood chips (or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: hand lens or magnifying glass to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** where all students can see it clearly. Keep the image visible throughout this phase.\n\n2. **Begin with a wondering prompt:**\n   - \"Boys and girls, look at this picture. What do you see growing on the old wood? Have you ever seen something like this before?\"\n\n3. **Ask these discovery questions (one at a time, allowing thinking time):**\n   - \"What color are these? What shape are they? Do they look like anything you know?\"\n   - \"Where is this happening? What is the mushroom growing on? Why do you think it's there and not somewhere else?\"\n   - \"Do you think these are alive? Why or why not? What makes you think that?\"\n   - \"If something is alive, what does it need to stay healthy? Does this mushroom have those things here?\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper (use pictures and words). Say: *\"You are making great observations! Let's find out more about these special living things.\"*\n\n5. **Preview:** *\"Today, we're going to be nature detectives. We're going to explore how mushrooms live and grow, just like we do!\"*\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's go investigate mushrooms up close using our senses and some special materials.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Real mushrooms (fresh button mushrooms from a grocery store) — approximately 2-3 per group\n- Small paper plates\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Drawing paper or science notebook pages\n- Spray bottle with water (to show moisture needs)\n- Optional: old wood chip samples or bark in a small container\n- Paper towels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Observation Setup (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Each group gets a mushroom to explore. Place it on your paper plate so it doesn't roll away.\"\n   - \"Use your eyes first—don't touch yet. What do you see?\"\n\n2. **Sensory Exploration (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Now, let's use our senses carefully. You may touch the cap—is it smooth or bumpy? Soft or hard?\"\n   - \"Gently feel the stem. What does it feel like?\"\n   - \"Does it smell like anything? Write or draw what you notice.\"\n   - \"Teacher will spray a tiny bit of water on the mushroom. Watch what happens. Does the cap get wet easily? Why do you think that matters?\"\n\n3. **Part Identification (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Every mushroom has parts, just like you have parts. Show me the cap (the umbrella top).\"\n   - \"Now show me the stem (the stick part holding it up).\"\n   - \"Underneath the cap, there are very tiny lines called gills. Can you see them? They help the mushroom make babies called spores.\"\n   - Students draw and label the cap and stem on their paper.\n\n4. **Habitat Connection (5 minutes):**\n   - Show students the wood chip or bark sample. Say: *\"In nature, mushrooms grow on dead wood, just like in our picture. Why? Because mushrooms eat the dead wood to grow! They're nature's cleanup crew.\"*\n   - \"Where do you think mushrooms need to live to stay healthy? Why the dark, wet places?\"\n\n5. **Recording (3 minutes):**\n   - Students complete a simple **observation sheet** with:\n     - Picture of their mushroom (cap, stem labeled)\n     - Two things they noticed (using words or pictures)\n     - One question they still have\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between groups, asking open-ended questions: *\"What did you discover? How is that part helpful to the mushroom?\"*\n- Resist answering questions; instead redirect: *\"What do you think? Why might that be?\"*\n- Help students with labels and encourage careful observation language: *\"Is it smooth or bumpy? Hard or soft?\"*\n- Ensure safety—remind students to wash hands after handling mushrooms.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify and label the cap and stem\n- Students record 2-3 observable characteristics (color, texture, shape, moisture response)\n- Students ask or wonder about why mushrooms grow in certain places\n- All students complete an observation recording with drawings and/or words\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled mushroom diagram\n- Original photograph from Engage\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n- Picture cards showing: mushroom, plant, animal, decomposition (optional visual aids)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 groups to share one observation from their exploration.\n   - Record key words on a new chart: *cap, stem, smooth, damp, umbrella-like, small, growing*\n   - Ask: \"Did all the mushrooms look the same or different? How?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   \n   Present each term with a student-friendly definition and point to examples in the photograph and student observations:\n\n   - **Mushroom:** A living thing that grows in damp, dark places. It's not a plant and not an animal—it's a fungus. *[Point to photograph]*\n   \n   - **Fungus (Fungi = more than one):** Living things that eat dead plants and wood to grow and survive. They're like nature's recycling team. *[Point to wood in photo]*\n   \n   - **Cap and Stem:** The parts of the mushroom. The cap is like an umbrella at the top. The stem holds it up. *[Point to mushroom diagrams and student drawings]*\n   \n   - **Habitat:** The place where a living thing lives and finds what it needs (food, water, air, right temperature). *[Explain: \"Mushrooms' habitat is dark, damp places with dead wood.\"]*\n   \n   - **Decompose/Breaking Down:** When dead things slowly turn into soil and nutrients. Mushrooms help this happen. *[Use photo: \"See the wood breaking apart? Mushrooms are helping!\"]*\n\n3. **Make Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Return to the original photograph. Say: *\"Remember our mushroom picture? Now we know these mushrooms are living things. They have a cap and a stem that help them survive. They live on dead wood because that's their food and habitat. They break down the wood into soil to help new plants grow!\"*\n   - Comparison question: *\"Are mushrooms like plants? They don't have leaves or roots. Are they like animals? They don't move or have legs. Mushrooms are their own special living thing called fungi!\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask yes/no questions with think-pair-share:\n     - *\"Is a mushroom alive? Turn and tell a partner why you think so.\"*\n     - *\"Do mushrooms need water? How do you know?\"*\n     - *\"Can a mushroom live on a sunny, dry rock? Why or why not?\"*\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Mushroom** | A living thing with a cap and stem that grows in wet, dark places |\n| **Fungus** | A special kind of living thing (not a plant, not an animal) that eats dead wood and stuff to grow |\n| **Cap and Stem** | Body parts of a mushroom—the cap is on top like an umbrella, the stem holds it up |\n| **Habitat** | The special place where a living thing lives and finds food and water |\n| **Decompose** | When dead things slowly break down into soil |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the vocabulary terms in simple sentences with teacher support\n- Students can point to and name the cap and stem on a mushroom picture\n- Students explain (in their own words) that mushrooms are living things that need certain habitats\n- Students understand that mushrooms help break down dead wood\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Art paper or construction paper\n- Markers, crayons, colored pencils\n- Pre-drawn habitat diagrams (or blank paper for student creation)\n- Optional: small branches, leaves, or bark pieces for a tactile collage\n- Glue sticks and scissors\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**\"Design a Mushroom Habitat\"**\n\n1. **Explain the challenge (2 minutes):**\n   - *\"Mushrooms need a special place to live and grow. Your job is to design or draw the perfect habitat for a mushroom. What does it need? Dark? Wet? Dead wood? Old leaves?\"*\n\n2. **Student Task (12 minutes):**\n   - Students create a drawing or collage showing where a mushroom would live best\n   - They should include:\n     - A mushroom (drawn or labeled)\n     - Dead wood, leaves, or bark (drawn or glued)\n     - Something to show water (raindrops, puddles, dark/damp colors)\n     - A label: *\"This is a good habitat for mushrooms because...\"* (teacher scribes or students draw)\n\n3. **Optional collaborative version:**\n   - Create a large class habitat scene on bulletin board paper where students add individual mushrooms and habitat features\n\n4. **Gallery Walk (3 minutes):**\n   - Display all habitats. Ask students: *\"Which habitats look the best for mushrooms? Why?\"*\n   - Celebrate varied but logical choices: *\"I see mushrooms in the shade—that's smart! I see one near fallen leaves—good thinking!\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate by asking clarifying questions: *\"Why did you choose that spot? What does your mushroom need?\"*\n- Help students connect back to Explore observations: *\"Remember how the mushroom felt damp? Your habitat shows that, doesn't it!\"*\n- Scribe language for students who need support writing the explanation\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation of a mushroom habitat that includes necessary conditions (moisture, dark/shaded area, decomposing material)\n- Students explain (verbally or with teacher scribing) at least one reason their habitat is good for mushrooms\n- Students demonstrate understanding that habitat design is based on organism needs\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of learning objectives.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- **Engage phase:** Listen to student predictions and ideas; record on chart paper to assess prior knowledge\n- **Explore phase:** Observe student observations, questions, and ability to identify mushroom parts; check observation sheets for detail and labels\n- **Explain phase:** Listen to think-pair-share responses and ability to use vocabulary in context\n- **Elaborate phase:** Assess drawings/collages for accurate habitat features and listen to student explanations\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket or Closing Activity (5–7 minutes)**\n\nChoose one option based on your class:\n\n**Option A: Picture + Sentence (for emerging writers)**\n- Show students three pictures: a mushroom on damp wood, a mushroom on a sunny windowsill, a mushroom in a dark, wet cave area\n- Ask: *\"Which picture shows the best home for a mushroom? Draw a circle around it. Why? Tell me one reason.\"* (Teacher or aide scribes response)\n\n**Option B: Three-Question Quick Check (oral or written)**\n1. *\"What are the two main parts of a mushroom?\"* (Cap and stem)\n2. *\"Is a mushroom alive? How do you know?\"* (Yes—it grows, needs water, lives in a habitat)\n3. *\"Why do mushrooms live on dead wood?\"* (Because that's their food; they break it down)\n\n**Option C: Draw and Label**\n- Provide a blank circle (mushroom cap shape). Students draw a mushroom and label the cap and stem, then write or dictate one thing mushrooms need to live.\n\n**Success Criteria (how to know students met the learning objectives):**\n- ✓ Students correctly identify cap and stem on a mushroom\n- ✓ Students recognize mushrooms as living organisms that need specific habitats\n- ✓ Students explain that mushrooms grow on wood or damp, dark places\n- ✓ Students use at least 2 vocabulary terms correctly (mushroom, cap, stem, habitat, fungus, or decompose)\n- ✓ Students can describe one way a mushroom's body helps it survive (cap sheds water, stem holds it up, grows in dark places)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify mushroom parts\n- 75% of students recognize that mushrooms are alive and need specific habitats\n- Most students can explain at least one reason mushrooms live where they do\n- Students retain and use vocabulary with support\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary and Sentence Stems:**\n   - During Explain and Elaborate, provide sentence frames: *\"A mushroom has a ___. The ___ holds it up. Mushrooms like ___ places.\"*\n   - Use only 2-3 vocabulary words instead of all five; focus on cap, stem, and habitat\n\n2. **Partner or Small-Group Exploration:**\n   - Pair struggling students with a peer buddy during Explore phase\n   - Provide hand-over-hand support for drawing/labeling with a classroom aide or volunteer\n   - Use picture cards instead of writing for exit ticket (student points to correct picture and you record response)\n\n3. **Concrete, Tactile Materials:**\n   - Pre-label mushroom diagrams with blanks to fill in instead of drawing from scratch\n   - Provide real mushroom pieces (cap, stem) in separate containers for students to match and touch\n   - Use a larger mushroom specimen that's easier to observe details on\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Investigation: Life Cycle and Spores**\n   - Provide magnifying glasses for advanced students to look closely at gills and discuss: *\"What do you think comes out of these tiny lines? Let's learn about spores—that's how mushrooms make babies!\"*\n   - Task: Research or draw the mushroom life cycle (spore → baby mushroom → adult mushroom)\n\n2. **Comparative Organism Study:**\n   - Challenge students to compare three organisms (mushroom, plant, animal) in a simple Venn diagram: *\"How are mushrooms like plants? Different? How are they like animals? Different?\"*\n   - Introduce concept: Mushrooms are their own kingdom, not plants or animals\n\n3. **Real-World Problem-Solving:**\n   - Scenario: *\"A gardener wants to grow mushrooms. She has three places: a sunny, dry windowsill; a dark, damp basement corner; or a bright, wet patio. Where should she grow them and why?\"*\n   - Have them create a letter or poster explaining their choice using vocabulary and reasoning\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Mushroom Growth Observation Over Time**\n   - Plant mushroom kits (inexpensive, available online) in the classroom or send home with families\n   - Have students draw and describe the mushroom at different stages (day 1, 3, 5, 7) to observe growth and change\n   - Create a class book: *\"The Life of Our Mushroom\"* with student observations and drawings\n\n2. **Fungi in Our Community: Nature Walk**\n   - Take students on a safe, supervised nature walk to find fungi in their outdoor environment (under bark, on logs, in wet areas)\n   - Have them photograph or sketch fungi they find and create a classroom display: *\"Fungi We Found!\"*\n   - Discuss: Why did they find mushrooms in *those* spots? (dark, damp, on dead material)\n\n3. **Recipe or Sensory Art: Mushroom Sensations**\n   - Sensory science: Have students who are comfortable with it handle and describe real mushrooms (texture, smell, shape) without tasting\n   - Create a class \"Mushroom Sensory Poster\" with labeled pictures: smooth, bumpy, damp, firm, brown, tan, etc.\n   - Extension: Cook (with appropriate allergen checks) and taste mushrooms; discuss: Does it feel or taste the same as the raw one?\n\n4. **Myth-Busting: Are Mushrooms Plants?**\n   - Read a simple book like *\"Up in the Garden and Down in the Dirt\"* by Kate Messner (which mentions decomposers)\n   - Create a class chart: *\"Mushrooms are NOT plants because...\"* and *\"Mushrooms ARE like living animals because...\"*\n   - Introduce the idea of kingdom (plants, animals, fungi) in simple terms\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Remind students not to pick or eat wild mushrooms. Use only grocery store or cultivated mushrooms for this lesson.\n- **Timing:** This lesson can be taught in two 40-minute sessions (Engage/Explore on Day 1; Explain/Elaborate/Evaluate on Day 2) or condensed to one longer session if needed.\n- **Real Objects Matter:** Using actual mushrooms instead of just photos significantly increases engagement and sensory learning for First Grade.\n- **Habitat Connection:** This lesson lays groundwork for understanding ecosystems and decomposition—key concepts for upper elementary grades.\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Refer back to the photograph and student observations whenever introducing new terms to anchor learning in concrete observations.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
