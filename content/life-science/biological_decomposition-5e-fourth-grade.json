ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the hollow tree.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital display of the hollow tree photograph (large enough for whole class to see)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Allow 30-45 seconds of silent observation before asking any questions.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you notice about this tree? Is anything unusual or surprising about it?\"\n   - \"How do you think this hole got inside the tree? What could have caused it?\"\n   - \"Even though there's a big hollow space inside, do you think this tree is still alive? What makes you say that?\" (Hint: Point out the bare branches with new growth potential visible in the photo.)\n   - \"Who or what might live inside or visit this hollow space? Why would they go there?\"\n\n3. **Use a wonder prompt:** Ask students to turn to a partner and complete this sentence: *\"I wonder why...\"* related to the hollow tree. Collect 4-5 responses on chart paper.\n\n4. **Record student observations and questions** on chart paper—these will be revisited during Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become tree detectives and discover what's really happening inside this tree, and how trees can survive even when they're damaged on the inside.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate tree structures and decomposition through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small pieces of dead wood, bark chips, or twigs (collected from outside or purchased; about 3-4 per student pair)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per pair)\n- Paper towels\n- Moist paper towels or small containers with water\n- Observation sheets (provided template below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: actual fungal growth samples or photographs of wood fungi (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Examining Dead Wood (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute dead wood samples, hand lenses, and observation sheets to student pairs.\n\n2. **Direct students:** \"Look closely at your piece of dead wood using the hand lens. What do you see on the surface? Can you find any holes, tunnels, or soft spots? Draw what you observe. Label anything that looks like it was made by an animal or organism.\"\n\n3. Circulate and ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n   - \"What textures do you feel on the bark?\"\n   - \"Do you see any pathways or channels? What might have made those?\"\n   - \"Is the wood solid or does it crumble easily? What does that tell you?\"\n\n4. Have pairs share one observation with the class (1-2 minutes).\n\n**Part 2: Simulating Decomposition (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute moist paper towels and explain: \"When wood gets wet from rain and stays damp, tiny organisms like fungi and bacteria move in. Let's see what happens when we keep our wood moist—this simulates what happens inside a hollow tree.\"\n\n2. **Student directions:** \"Place your wood sample on a moist paper towel. Keep it in a sealed bag or container in a warm, dark place. Over the next week, observe it every 2-3 days. Record any changes you see—color changes, softening, growth on the surface, or new organisms appearing.\"\n\n3. Display observation sheet so students know what to record: date, appearance, texture, any visible organisms.\n\n4. **Document the starting condition:** Have students sketch and describe their wood sample's condition on Day 1 of their observation sheet.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without revealing that fungi/bacteria are the decomposers yet.\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you think *might* happen to this wood? Why?\"\n- Encourage close observation and detailed recording.\n- Collect wood samples in labeled containers for monitoring.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify surface features on dead wood (holes, soft spots, color variations).\n- Students make predictions about what will happen to moist wood over time.\n- Students begin systematic observation and recording habits.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts; connect exploration to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Diagram of tree cross-section (trunk showing bark, heartwood, sapwood, and possible hollow cavity) – draw or print ahead of time\n- Photographs or samples of fungi, mold, or insects that decompose wood (optional but helpful)\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Ask 2-3 student pairs to describe what they observed on their wood samples. Record observations on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):** Use the diagram of a tree cross-section to teach these terms:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Bark:** The tough outer layer of a tree that protects the wood inside, like tree skin. It keeps out pests and disease.\n   - **Sapwood:** The living layer of wood just under the bark that carries water and nutrients from the roots up through the tree.\n   - **Heartwood:** The dead wood in the center of the tree that provides structure and support, even though it's no longer alive.\n   - **Decomposers:** Tiny organisms (like fungi, bacteria, and insects) that break down dead plant material into smaller pieces and return nutrients to the soil.\n   - **Decomposition:** The process of dead material being broken down by decomposers.\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph (4-5 minutes):**\n   - Project the hollow tree image again.\n   - Explain: \"This hollow space formed over many years because decomposers—fungi, bacteria, and wood-eating insects—broke down the heartwood inside the tree. The tree's outer bark and sapwood are still healthy, so the tree can still get water and nutrients. That's why it's still alive!\"\n   - Point out on the photograph: the bark (still intact), the hollow cavity (where heartwood was decomposed), and the branches with new growth (showing the tree is still living).\n\n4. **Check for understanding:** Ask students:\n   - \"If the hollow space was caused by decomposers, what do you think those tiny organisms were *doing* inside the tree?\" (Breaking down dead wood, getting food.)\n   - \"Why is it okay for a tree to have a hollow center and still survive?\" (Because the living layers—bark and sapwood—are still there to carry water and nutrients.)\n   - \"What do decomposers get out of eating dead wood?\" (Food and energy to live.)\n\n5. **Return to wonderings:** Revisit the chart from Engage. Answer 2-3 of the student-generated questions using the vocabulary and concepts just introduced.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand the internal and external structures of a tree and their functions.\n- Students recognize that decomposers are organisms that feed on and break down dead material.\n- Students can explain why the tree in the photograph is still alive despite the hollow cavity.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by modeling tree structures and decomposition in a new context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-printed tree structure diagram templates (or whiteboard)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Paper plates or craft foam circles (to represent tree cross-sections)\n- Markers\n- Optional: small craft materials (tape, paper, clay) for 3D model-building\n- **New scenario cards** (printed, one per pair):\n  - *Card 1: \"Your tree has bark damage from a storm, but the heartwood is fine. Will it survive?\"*\n  - *Card 2: \"Decomposers are breaking down the heartwood of your tree. Will the tree die? Why or why not?\"*\n  - *Card 3: \"A tree is completely hollow inside, but its bark and sapwood are healthy. What structures are still helping it survive?\"*\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Tree Structure Drawing and Labeling (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute diagram templates showing a tree trunk cross-section (circle with rings).\n\n2. **Direct students:** \"Label the parts of a tree we learned about: bark, sapwood, heartwood, and the hollow area (if present). Color each part a different color. Then, add arrows or notes explaining the job of each part.\"\n\n3. Students sketch decomposers (fungi, bacteria, insects) on or near the hollow area to show what causes decomposition.\n\n4. Pairs share their diagrams and explain each labeled part to the class (2-3 minutes).\n\n**Option B: Scenario Analysis and Argument Construction (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Assign each pair a scenario card.\n\n2. **Direct students:** \"Read your scenario. Decide: Will the tree survive? Why or why not? Use what you know about tree structures to build your argument. You can draw, write, or both.\"\n\n3. Provide a sentence frame on the board:\n   - \"The tree will/will not survive because ___. The [bark/sapwood/heartwood] is important because ___.\"\n\n4. Pairs present their reasoning to the class in 1-2 sentences each.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Which tree structures are still healthy in your scenario? What do they do?\"\n- Prompt students to use vocabulary: \"What role do decomposers play here?\"\n- Challenge advanced students: \"What would happen if both the bark AND sapwood were damaged?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create labeled diagrams showing understanding of tree structures and their functions.\n- Students construct evidence-based arguments about tree survival based on structure integrity.\n- Students recognize that decomposers are necessary for the natural recycling of dead material.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of tree structures, decomposition, and organism roles.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing):**\n- Observe student diagrams and scenario arguments for accurate labeling and reasoning.\n- Listen to pair discussions and whole-class sharing for use of vocabulary and understanding.\n- Review observation sheets from Explore phase for systematic recording and predictions.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with a small card or half-sheet and ask them to respond to **one of the following** (choose based on your class level):\n\n**Prompt Option 1 (Concrete):**\n\"Look at this picture of the hollow tree again. Draw or write: What helped make the hollow space? (Hint: Think about decomposers.) How is the tree still alive?\"\n\n**Prompt Option 2 (More Abstract):**\n\"A tree has a hollow center because decomposers broke down its heartwood. Is this tree healthy? Explain your answer using what you know about tree structures.\"\n\n**Prompt Option 3 (Application):**\n\"If you found a tree like this one, what could you tell someone about why it's still alive and growing new branches?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student identifies that decomposers (organisms) caused the hollow space.\n- ✓ Student explains that the tree is still alive because bark and/or sapwood are intact and functioning.\n- ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary term correctly (bark, sapwood, heartwood, decomposer, decomposition).\n- ✓ Student shows evidence of understanding that internal and external structures have different functions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that plants have structures that protect and support them.\n- Students recognize that animals/decomposers interact with their environment by breaking down dead material.\n- Students can construct a simple argument about tree survival based on structural integrity.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and sentence frames:**\n   - Provide pre-written sentence starters with blanks: \"The bark protects the tree by ___.\" \"Decomposers are ___ that eat dead ___.\"\n   - Use picture cards with labels to reinforce vocabulary during Explain phase.\n\n2. **Scaffolded observation:**\n   - Pair struggling students with stronger observers during Explore phase.\n   - Provide a simplified observation sheet with illustrations and checkboxes instead of open-ended drawing: \"Circle what you see: holes / soft spots / color changes.\"\n\n3. **Concrete model reference:**\n   - Keep a labeled diagram of a tree cross-section visible throughout the lesson.\n   - Use a real tree cross-section (tree ring section) or large-scale model so students can physically point to bark, sapwood, and heartwood.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Investigate decomposition rates:**\n   - Have advanced students compare decomposition of different materials (wood, leaves, paper) under moist conditions over 2-3 weeks. Ask: \"Which decomposes faster? Why?\"\n   - Challenge them to research and present on specific decomposers (fungi species, insects) found in local forests.\n\n2. **Extended scenario analysis:**\n   - Present a complex scenario: \"A tree is 70% hollow, but it's still producing new leaves. How is this possible? What structures are doing the work?\" \n   - Ask students to predict what would happen if the hollow space grew larger and eventually reached the bark.\n\n3. **Ecosystem connection:**\n   - Have advanced students research or create a food web showing decomposers and their role: \"What eats the decomposers? How does energy flow through a decaying tree?\"\n   - Challenge: \"If we removed all the decomposers from a forest, what would happen to dead trees?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Local Tree Exploration Walk:**\n   - Take students on a 20-30 minute outdoor walk to find evidence of decomposition, hollow trees, or dead wood in the schoolyard or nearby park.\n   - Have students photograph or sketch findings and label structures: bark, decomposition signs, organism evidence.\n   - Create a class \"Decomposition Evidence\" display board back in the classroom.\n\n2. **Decomposition Jar Experiment (Multi-week):**\n   - Fill clear glass jars with layers: soil, dead leaves, twigs, and dampened sand.\n   - Seal and observe weekly for 4-6 weeks.\n   - Document changes with photos and drawings.\n   - Discuss: \"What decomposed first? What's left? Where did the matter go?\" (Introduction to nutrient cycling.)\n\n3. **Comparative Tree Structures Art and Writing:**\n   - Provide images of healthy trees, hollow trees, and diseased trees.\n   - Have students create a compare/contrast poster or written analysis: \"How are the structures different? How does each tree survive (or not)?\"\n   - Extension: \"What structures would help a tree survive best in your local climate?\"\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
