ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by using the photograph to spark curiosity about seeds and germination.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of germinating seed (large enough for whole class to see)\n- Document camera or projector (if available)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Real seeds in small dishes (dried beans, sunflower seeds, or pumpkin seeds)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph on the board or projector. Ask students to look carefully without talking for 10 seconds.\n2. Ask these discussion questions to spark curiosity:\n   - **\"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about the different colors and shapes.\"** (Students identify the green stem, the brown/tan seed coat at the top, and the darker soil or material below.)\n   - **\"Where do you think this green part came from? Was it always there?\"** (Encourage students to hypothesize; many will guess it grew from the seed.)\n   - **\"Why do you think the seed is in the ground? What might the seed need from the dirt?\"** (Guide thinking toward water, food, and support.)\n   - **\"If you planted a seed, what do you think would happen to it? What would it need to grow big?\"** (Activate prior knowledge about growth and plant needs.)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what's inside that hard, brown seed coat at the top. I wonder what helps the green part know to grow upward. Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be seed scientists. We'll observe real seeds, plant some, and watch them grow like the one in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate seeds and plant them in a growing medium, discovering firsthand how seeds germinate and what they need to grow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Dried beans or seeds (one per student, plus extras)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Small paper cups or clear plastic cups (one per student)\n- Potting soil or seed-starting mix\n- Water in cups or spray bottles\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Observation journals or paper for drawing\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- Labels for cups (name, date, \"Germination Watch\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Seed Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Give each student a dried seed and a hand lens.\n2. Direct students: \"Look very closely at your seed. Describe what you see. What color is it? Is it smooth or bumpy? Is it hard or soft? Draw your seed in your observation journal. Label any parts you notice.\"\n3. Ask: \"Do you see a little line or crack on your seed? This is called a seam. That's where the seed will split open when it's ready to grow. Can you find it?\"\n4. Pass around the photograph again or show it on screen. Ask: \"Does your seed look anything like the seed in the picture before it started growing?\"\n\n**Part B: Planting Seeds (12-15 minutes)**\n\n1. Guide students to fill their paper cup about three-quarters full with moist potting soil.\n2. Direct: \"Make a small hole in the soil with your finger, about as deep as your thumbnail. Now gently place your seed into the hole and cover it lightly with soil.\"\n3. Ask: \"Why do you think we're putting the seed in the soil instead of leaving it on the desk?\" (Connect to the photograph—soil provides water, nutrients, and darkness for germination.)\n4. Have students water their seed gently with a cup of water or spray bottle.\n5. Guide students to label their cup with their name, the date, and \"Germination Watch.\"\n6. Place all cups in a warm, sunny windowsill.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to ensure students handle seeds gently and plant them correctly.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What do you think your seed needs to grow? How long do you think it will take? What will we see first—roots or leaves?\"\n- Do not provide answers; encourage prediction and wonder.\n- Help students connect their observations to the photograph: \"In the picture, we saw the green part already growing. Your seed hasn't done that yet, but it will start soon.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe and record the external features of seeds (color, texture, size, seam).\n- Students compare their seed to the one in the photograph.\n- Students plant seeds and make predictions about what will happen next.\n- Students recognize that seeds are planted in soil and need water to grow.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and concepts after exploration; connect observations to plant structures and germination.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photographs or illustrations of seed parts (seed coat, root, shoot, stored food)\n- Simple diagram showing seed germination stages\n- The original germinating seed photograph\n- Students' observation journals and planted seeds\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you observe about your seed? What did it look like up close?\"\n   - Ask: \"Where did we plant our seeds? Why did we choose that spot?\" (Warm, sunny, with access to water.)\n   - Ask: \"What do you predict will happen in the next few days?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary and Concepts (10 minutes):**\n\n   Use the photograph and student observations to teach these terms:\n\n   - **Seed coat:** \"This is the hard, brown outside of the seed. It's like a jacket that keeps the baby plant safe and dry inside.\"\n   - **Germination:** \"This is when a seed starts to grow. It drinks in water, wakes up, and sends out roots and a shoot. In the picture, we can see the seed is germinating—it's growing!\"\n   - **Root:** \"This is the part that grows downward into the soil. Roots drink water and food from the dirt. They also hold the plant in place so it doesn't fall over.\"\n   - **Shoot (or seedling):** \"This is the green part that grows upward. It becomes the stem and leaves. It wants to grow toward the sunlight!\"\n   - **Embryo:** \"Inside every seed, there's a teeny, tiny baby plant called an embryo. When the seed gets water and warmth, the embryo starts to grow.\"\n\n3. **Explain with the Photograph (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again. Point to each part: \"Look! In this picture, we can see the seed coat at the top—it's split open because the seed is germinating. We can see the shoot starting to grow. Soon, if we looked below the soil, we'd see roots growing down.\"\n   - Connect to their activity: \"Just like the seed in the picture, your seeds are now in the soil with water. Soon they will germinate, too!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"What does a seed need to germinate?\" (Water, warmth, and darkness initially, then light for growth.)\n   - Ask: \"Which way do roots grow?\" (Down, into the soil.)\n   - Ask: \"Which way does the shoot grow?\" (Up, toward the light.)\n   - Show pictures or the photograph and have students point to and name the seed coat, root, and shoot.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Seed coat** | The hard, brown outside of a seed that protects the baby plant inside. |\n| **Germination** | When a seed starts to grow by drinking water and waking up. |\n| **Root** | The part of a plant that grows down into the soil to drink water and food. |\n| **Shoot** | The green part of a growing seed that becomes the stem and leaves; it grows upward. |\n| **Embryo** | The teeny, tiny baby plant sleeping inside a seed. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that seeds have protective coverings and internal structures.\n- Students know that germination is the process of a seed beginning to grow.\n- Students can identify roots, shoots, and seed coats.\n- Students recognize that roots and shoots grow in different directions for different reasons.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts by comparing seeds and parent plants, and by designing a care plan to help their seeds grow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Planted seeds from Explore phase\n- Pictures of parent plants (bean plants, sunflower plants, pumpkin plants—matching students' seeds, if possible)\n- Chart paper or a large Venn diagram template (drawn on paper or whiteboard)\n- Markers\n- A simple \"Seed Care Plan\" worksheet or template with pictures (watering can, sun, thermometer)\n- Observation journals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Comparing Baby Plants (Seeds) and Parent Plants (7-10 minutes)**\n\n1. Show students pictures of mature plants (beans, sunflowers, etc.) that match their seeds.\n2. Explain: \"This is what a grown-up bean plant (or sunflower plant) looks like. Your seed came from a plant like this one. Now we're going to compare the baby and the grown-up.\"\n3. Create a simple comparison chart on the board or use a Venn diagram:\n   - **\"How is a seed like a grown-up plant?\"** (Both have roots, both need water, both are alive, both grew from a smaller seed.)\n   - **\"How is a seed different from a grown-up plant?\"** (Seeds are tiny and hard; grown-up plants are big and have leaves; you can see the roots and shoot in the plant but not in the seed yet.)\n4. Draw or display pictures to help students visualize.\n5. Emphasize: \"Baby seeds are not exactly like their parent plants, but they will grow to look very similar!\"\n\n**Part B: Design a Seed Care Plan (8-10 minutes)**\n\n1. Ask students: \"What do we need to do to help our seeds grow into plants like the ones we just saw?\"\n2. Guide students to create a simple care plan by choosing pictures or drawing:\n   - **Water:** How often should we water? (Daily or every other day, lightly.)\n   - **Sunlight:** Where should we put our cups? (On a sunny windowsill.)\n   - **Temperature:** What kind of place is warm? (Inside the classroom, away from cold drafts.)\n3. Have students draw or write their plan in their observation journals or on a worksheet.\n4. Display care plans on a bulletin board with the title \"Our Seed Care Plans\" so students feel invested in the process.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate comparison by asking guiding questions rather than giving answers.\n- Help students see that baby seeds and adult plants are related but not identical.\n- Support creation of care plans by asking: \"What will help your seed grow? What did we learn seeds need?\"\n- Emphasize that caring for the seed is a way of helping it use its external structures (roots) and internal parts (embryo) to survive and grow.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students articulate similarities and differences between seeds and mature plants.\n- Students understand that seeds will grow into plants similar to their parents.\n- Students create a practical care plan and take ownership of helping their seeds germinate and grow.\n- Students recognize the connection between seed structures and their functions (roots for water, seeds for protection).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of seed structure, germination, and plant growth through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n\n- **Observation of seed descriptions:** During Explore, listen to how students describe their seed. Do they notice color, texture, size, and the seam?\n- **Questioning during Explain phase:** Ask individual students to identify seed parts, explain germination, and predict growth direction.\n- **Care plan quality:** Review whether students' care plans reflect understanding of seed needs (water, warmth, light).\n- **Comparison thinking:** Listen during Elaborate—do students recognize that seeds are babies of parent plants?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of Lesson 2, after seeds have begun to germinate, if time allows, or at start of next day):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple illustration showing a seed in soil with the shoot beginning to grow (similar to the provided photograph). Ask students to:\n\n1. **Label or point to:** The seed coat, the shoot, and the soil.\n2. **Answer:** \"Why did we plant the seed in the soil?\" \n3. **Predict:** \"What will happen to the shoot? Which way will it grow?\"\n4. **Draw or tell:** \"What will happen to the roots? Which way will they grow?\"\n\n**Alternative Exit Ticket (picture-based for early readers):**\n\nShow three pictures: (1) a dry seed, (2) a germinating seed, (3) a young plant. Ask:\n- \"Which picture shows a seed that is starting to grow?\" \n- \"What does the seed need to look like picture 3?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Students can identify at least two parts of a seed and explain what each part does.\n\n✓ Students understand that seeds germinate when given water and warmth.\n\n✓ Students can predict which direction roots and shoots grow.\n\n✓ Students recognize that baby plants (seeds) and parent plants are similar but not exactly alike.\n\n✓ Students create a care plan that reflects understanding of seed needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students demonstrate understanding of seed structure and function through labeled diagrams or verbal descriptions.\n- Students articulate that germination requires water, warmth, and darkness (initially).\n- Students predict and explain growth patterns (roots down, shoots up).\n- Students recognize the relationship between seeds and parent plants and can identify similarities and differences.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only the core terms (seed, root, shoot, grow) during Explore and early Explain. Introduce other vocabulary (seed coat, germination, embryo) only after students grasp basic concepts.\n\n2. **Hand-Over-Hand Guidance:** During planting, provide physical support to help students make the hole in soil, place the seed gently, and cover it. Model actions first; then guide their hands.\n\n3. **Picture-Based Observations:** Provide a picture card with labels (seed coat, root, shoot) during Explain. Have students match their observations to the picture rather than generating labels independently. Simplify exit ticket to point-and-identify rather than write-and-label.\n\n4. **Paired Observation:** Pair struggling learners with stronger peers during seed observation. Have the pair share one hand lens and take turns describing what they see.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper Comparison:** Ask advanced students to compare multiple seed types (beans, sunflower, pumpkin). Have them predict which will germinate fastest and why. Introduce the idea that different seeds need different conditions.\n\n2. **Investigate Variables:** Challenge students to design a simple experiment: \"What happens if we don't give our seed water?\" or \"What happens if we put our seed in a dark closet instead of a sunny window?\" (Conduct with teacher supervision; use spare seeds only.)\n\n3. **Predict Future Stages:** Have advanced students draw or write about what they think will happen to their seed over the next 2-4 weeks. Introduce terms like \"seedling,\" \"true leaves,\" and \"growth.\"\n\n4. **Research Parent Plants:** Provide picture books or websites about bean plants, sunflowers, or other plants matching students' seeds. Ask: \"How big does your plant grow? What does the flower look like? What does the seed look like on the grown-up plant?\" (This connects seeds to reproduction and life cycles.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Observe and Draw Over Time (Ongoing, weeks 1-4):**\n   - Have students draw their seed and seedling once a week in their observation journals. Provide a simple chart with columns for \"Week 1,\" \"Week 2,\" \"Week 3,\" etc.\n   - Ask: \"How has your plant changed? What new parts do you see?\" \n   - This reinforces the concept that plants grow and change over time and connects to observing life cycles (1-LS3-1).\n\n2. **Design a Seed Dispersal Carrier (Application of 1-LS1-1):**\n   - After discussing how seeds travel and spread, have students design a \"seed taxi\"—a tool or vehicle that could help carry seeds from one place to another (mimicking how animals disperse seeds).\n   - Students can use craft materials (tissue paper, cotton balls, pockets, etc.) to create a design that protects and carries a seed.\n   - Ask: \"How is your seed taxi like how animals help plants spread their seeds?\"\n\n3. **Create a \"Plant Parent and Baby\" Book (Connecting to 1-LS3-1):**\n   - Have students create a simple 4-6 page booklet showing a parent plant and a baby seed/seedling.\n   - Include simple sentences or pictures: \"This is a baby bean seed. This is a grown-up bean plant. They are alike because... They are different because...\"\n   - Share books with the class to reinforce that baby plants are like, but not exactly like, their parents.\n\n---",
