Identify and describe the special body parts of a pelican that help it survive.\n2. Explain how a pelican's beak helps it catch fish for food.\n3. Compare the pelican's body to other animals and describe how different body parts are designed for different jobs.\n4. Predict how other water animals might use their body parts to find food in water habitats.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal body parts and how they are used.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the pelican (projected or printed on poster board)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Small toy fish or picture cutouts of fish\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Allow students to look silently for 10-15 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about this bird's mouth or beak? What is unusual about it?\" *(Allow 2-3 student responses)*\n   - \"Why do you think a pelican might have such a long, special beak? What could it be used for?\" *(Encourage wild guesses — this is activation)*\n   - \"Do you think this bird lives near water or in the forest? How do you know?\" *(Point to the water in the background)*\n   - \"What do you wonder about how this bird catches food?\" *(Write student wonderings on chart paper)*\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder if that big beak helps the pelican catch fish like a net or bucket. Let's investigate!\"\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become bird scientists and test whether different beak shapes catch fish differently — just like a real pelican!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how different \"beak\" tools catch \"fish\" from water and discover why beak shape matters for hunting.\n\n**Materials (per pair of students):**\n- 1 shallow container filled with water (8–10 inches diameter; e.g., pie pan, shallow bin, or large bowl)\n- Small foam fish cutouts (precut 2-3 inches long) OR wrapped paper balls with paper-clip \"fins\" attached—5-8 per pair\n- 3 different \"beak tools\" (students test all three in turn):\n  - **Tool A:** Regular tweezers (straight, narrow)\n  - **Tool B:** Salad tongs or small kitchen tongs (wider grab)\n  - **Tool C:** Slotted spoon (flat with holes, like a net)\n- Paper towel for drying tools between turns\n- Recording sheet (see below)\n- 1-minute timer (optional)\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Place your foam fish gently in the water pan. They should float on the surface or sink to the bottom.\"\n\n2. \"Using Tool A (tweezers), try to grab and lift ONE fish out of the water. Count how many you catch in 1 minute (or 10 tries). Write the number on your sheet.\"\n\n3. \"Return all fish to the water. Dry your tool. Now try Tool B (tongs) the same way. Record your number.\"\n\n4. \"Return all fish to the water. Dry your tool. Now try Tool C (slotted spoon). Record your number.\"\n\n5. \"Look at your three numbers. Circle the tool that caught the MOST fish. Why do you think that tool worked best?\"\n\n**Recording Sheet (Simple sketch + numbers):**\n```\nMy Fish-Catching Tools\n\nTool A (Tweezers): ___ fish caught\nTool B (Tongs): ___ fish caught  \nTool C (Spoon): ___ fish caught\n\nWhich tool caught the most? Circle it.\nDraw why you think it worked best:\n[space for simple drawing]\n```\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and observe which tool each pair finds most successful.\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why did that tool work better?\" or \"How is the spoon like a net?\"\n- Do NOT say \"The spoon is like a pelican's pouch\" yet — let them discover the connection.\n- Help manage water spills; have paper towels available.\n- If a pair finishes early, ask: \"Can you try catching fish in a different way? What happens?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most students will discover that the slotted spoon (which mimics a net/pouch shape) catches more fish than tweezers or tongs.\n- Students will record numerical data and make a simple inference about tool effectiveness.\n- Students will connect their \"tool\" to real animal body parts (emerging understanding).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and make explicit connections between the investigation and the pelican's body adaptation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pelican photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary\n- Optional: Picture cards of other water birds (duck, heron, cormorant) to compare\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 pairs to share their results: \"Which tool caught the most fish? Show us your number.\"\n   - Record their findings on a simple bar graph on the board or chart paper.\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the spoon worked best?\" *(Guide them to say: wide, has holes, scoops things)*\n\n2. **Make the Connection (5 minutes):**\n   - Point back to the pelican photograph.\n   - \"Your spoon worked like a NET or a BUCKET, right? A pelican's beak works the same way! Look at the long pouch under its beak. When it dives into the water, the pouch fills with water AND fish, just like your spoon caught water and fish.\"\n   - Ask: \"How is the pelican's beak like your best tool (the spoon)?\" *(Expected answer: Wide, can scoop things, catches many fish)*\n\n3. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (5 minutes):**\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n   \n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. *(Example: \"A pelican's pouch beak is an adaptation for catching slippery fish.\")*\n   \n   - **Beak (or Bill):** The hard mouth of a bird; different shapes for different jobs. *(Example: \"A pelican's beak is long and has a pouch. A parrot's beak is short and strong.\")*\n   \n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food and water. *(Example: \"A pelican's habitat is near the ocean or big lakes.\")*\n   \n   - **Inherited Trait:** A body part or behavior that an animal is born with, passed down from parents. *(Example: \"Baby pelicans are born with long beaks because their parents have long beaks.\")*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Why does a pelican have such a long, pouchy beak?\" *(Look for: \"to catch fish,\" \"to hold water and fish,\" \"to scoop things\")*\n   - Ask: \"Is a pelican's beak an adaptation? How do you know?\" *(Look for: \"Yes, it helps it survive\" or \"Yes, it helps it hunt\")*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can use the term \"adaptation\" in a sentence about the pelican's beak.\n- Students explain that the pelican's beak shape helps it catch fish (functional understanding).\n- Students recognize that different animals have different beak shapes for different foods/habitats.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of adaptations to other water animals and deepen critical thinking.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos of 4-6 water animals: duck, great blue heron, penguin, flamingo, cormorant, spoonbill\n- Chart paper titled \"Beaks Built for Different Jobs\"\n- Optional: Simple animal field guide or images printed from a reliable source (e.g., Audubon, National Geographic Kids)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Comparative Analysis (10 minutes):**\n   - Show students pictures of 3-4 other water birds (e.g., a duck with a flat beak, a heron with a spear-like beak, a penguin with a pointed beak).\n   - For each animal, ask: \"What does this beak look like? What do you think this bird eats? How is it different from a pelican's beak?\"\n   - Record observations on a chart:\n     ```\n     Animal      | Beak Shape     | What It Might Eat | Adaptation for...\n     Pelican     | Long + pouch   | Fish (slippery)   | Scooping\n     Duck        | Flat + wide    | Seeds, plants     | Filtering\n     Heron       | Spear-like     | Fish              | Stabbing/spearing\n     ```\n\n2. **Scenario Application (5 minutes):**\n   - Present a scenario: \"A new water bird arrives in our area. It eats crabs and shellfish that hide under rocks. What might its beak look like? Draw and describe it.\"\n   - Students sketch and label their predicted beak shape.\n   - Share 2-3 drawings and explain the reasoning.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Guide comparisons without leading too much: \"What do you notice about how the heron's beak is different?\"\n- Validate all reasonable predictions in the scenario activity.\n- Connect back to the fishing experiment: \"Remember your tools? Which tool would work like a heron's beak?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students compare at least 2 water birds' beaks and identify differences.\n- Students use the word \"adaptation\" when describing beak shapes.\n- Students predict a new animal's beak based on its food or habitat (transfer of understanding).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students can identify adaptations, explain their function, and apply this understanding to new scenarios.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n   - Observation during Explore: Do students test all three tools and record data?\n   - Discussion during Explain: Can students explain why the spoon worked best?\n   - Elaboration activity: Do students predict beak shapes for new animals with reasonable justification?\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (Summative) — Choose ONE:**\n\n   **Option A: Verbal (for struggling readers/writers)**\n   - Ask each student individually as they leave:\n     - \"What is one special body part the pelican has that helps it catch fish?\"\n     - \"Why is a pelican's long beak an adaptation?\"\n   \n   **Option B: Written/Drawn (standard)**\n   ```\n   EXIT TICKET: Pelican Adaptations\n   \n   1. Draw or name one body part of a pelican that helps it survive.\n   \n   2. Why does the pelican need this body part?\n      □ To catch fish    □ To fly    □ To eat plants\n   \n   3. What does the word \"adaptation\" mean?\n      (Circle the best answer)\n      a) A special body part that helps an animal survive\n      b) A color an animal can change\n      c) A type of fish\n   ```\n\n   **Option C: Performance Task (for advanced learners)**\n   ```\n   You find a bird with a short, thick beak and a long neck. \n   Its home is in a sandy beach near the water.\n   What do you think this bird eats? \n   Why does its beak shape fit its food?\n   ```\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n   - **Meets Standard:** Student identifies at least one pelican adaptation (beak, body shape) and explains its function (catching fish, swimming).\n   - **Approaching Standard:** Student identifies a body part but explains function vaguely or incompletely.\n   - **Below Standard:** Student cannot identify pelican adaptations or explain their function.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- 80%+ of students can name one pelican adaptation.\n- 70%+ of students can explain why that adaptation helps the pelican survive.\n- 60%+ of students can use the term \"adaptation\" correctly in a sentence.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Pre-Teach Vocabulary:** Before the lesson, introduce \"beak\" and \"adaptation\" with picture cards during a brief 5-minute introduction. Use the pelican photo and point to the beak.\n\n2. **Partner with Stronger Peer:** During Explore, pair a struggling student with a stronger partner. Have the stronger student lead the fish-catching tool testing while both record data together.\n\n3. **Simplified Recording Sheet:** Provide a sheet with pictures instead of words:\n   ```\n   Which tool caught the most fish?  \n   [Picture of tweezers]  [Picture of tongs]  [Picture of spoon]\n   Circle the one with the MOST fish. ✓\n   ```\n\n4. **Sentence Frames for Explanation:**\n   - \"The pelican's beak is like a _____ because _____.\"\n   - \"An adaptation is _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Multi-Step Tool Design:** \"Design your own 'beak' tool using materials in the classroom (plastic wrap, aluminum foil, etc.). Test it. Does it catch more or fewer fish than the spoon? Why?\"\n\n2. **Food Chain Connection:** \"A pelican eats fish. What do fish eat? What might eat a pelican? Draw a food chain with arrows.\"\n\n3. **Habitat Exploration:** \"Research where pelicans live (ocean, lake, river). What other animals live there? How are their beaks different? Why?\" (Use a children's picture book or website; teacher curates resources.)\n\n4. **Comparative Writing:** \"Write 2-3 sentences comparing a pelican's beak to a duck's beak. How are they the same? How are they different? Why?\" (Expected: A pelican has a long pouch; a duck has a flat beak. Pelicans catch fish; ducks eat plants.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Beak Detectives\" Sorting Game:** Create picture cards of 8-10 different birds (pelican, duck, woodpecker, hummingbird, eagle, parrot, etc.). Students sort by beak type and predict what each bird eats. Display as a classroom \"Bird Beak Chart.\"\n\n2. **Observational Field Study:** If your school is near a body of water, take students on a nature walk to observe real water birds. Have them sketch beaks they see and compare to the pelican. Record observations in a \"Bird Journal.\"\n\n3. **\"Design an Animal\" Creative Extension:** Students imagine a new animal for an invented habitat (e.g., \"a muddy swamp\") and design its body parts (beak, feet, tail) to help it survive. They draw, label adaptations, and present to the class: \"This animal has a _____ beak because _____.\"\n\n4. **Read-Aloud Connection:** Pair this lesson with a picture book such as *Pelican* by Stella Lilly (National Geographic Little Kids) or *A Pair of Pelicans* by Polly Carter. Read aloud and ask: \"Did we learn about that in our lesson?\"\n\n5. **\"Tool Challenge\" Extension:** Provide students with additional \"tools\" (clothespins, forks, spatulas) to test in the fish-catching activity. Graph results and rank all tools by effectiveness. Discuss why some tools work better than others.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** Manage water spills promptly to prevent slipping. Use shallow water containers and supervise closely.\n- **Preparation:** Cut foam fish or pre-make paper-ball fish at least one day before the lesson.\n- **Pacing:** If students are highly engaged in Explore, it's okay to extend that phase by 5 minutes and shorten another phase slightly.\n- **Assessment:** Keep exit tickets and observation notes to inform future lessons on animal adaptations.\n- **Real-World Connection:** Mention that scientists study animal body parts to understand how nature \"designs\" solutions to problems — this links to engineering thinking in later grades.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly addresses the pelican photograph by using its distinctive beak as the central learning focus, guides students through hands-on discovery, and connects abstract adaptation concepts to concrete, observable evidence. Second graders will leave understanding that animals' body parts are not random—they are \"built\" to help them survive in their homes.",
