ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how animals hide and survive in nature.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the katydid (or display on screen/projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently so all students can see it clearly. Do NOT tell them what the animal is yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you spot the animal hiding here?\" (Allow 30-45 seconds of silent searching.)\n   - \"What color is the animal you found? Why do you think it might be that color?\"\n   - \"How do you think this animal uses its color to stay safe?\"\n   - \"What do you think would happen to this animal if it lived on brown dirt instead of green grass?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder why this animal looks so much like the plants around it. What do YOU wonder about how animals hide?\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper to reference throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to investigate how animals like this katydid use their appearance to hide and survive. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate camouflage by observing, comparing, and discovering why matching a habitat is important for survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4-5 colored construction paper sheets per student (green, brown, tan, white, purple)\n- Scissors\n- Paper scraps or small cardstock animal shapes (pre-cut simple animal outlines, or have students cut simple shapes)\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- White poster board or large paper (for \"habitats\")\n- Glue sticks\n- Chart or table for recording observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Camouflage Hunt (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Prepare the room ahead of time: Hide 10-15 small colored paper shapes (mixed colors) throughout the classroom — some matching classroom colors/objects, others contrasting.\n\n2. Tell students: \"A katydid hides by looking like the plants around it. Let's see what we can find hidden in our classroom, just like hunting for the katydid in the photograph.\"\n\n3. Set a 3-minute timer. Students silently search and count how many shapes they find. They do NOT pick them up — just record how many they spot.\n\n4. **Debrief:** Ask: \"Which colors were easiest to find? Which were hardest to see? Why?\"\n   - Guide students to notice that shapes matching the background (e.g., green on green) were harder to find.\n\n**Part B: Design a Camouflaged Animal (12-15 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide students into pairs. Assign each pair a \"habitat\" (one of these scenarios):\n   - Green grass and plant area\n   - Brown soil and dead leaves\n   - Sandy beach\n   - Snow and ice\n   - Forest tree bark\n\n2. **Student task:**\n   - Using colored paper, create a small animal shape for your habitat.\n   - Color or decorate it to blend in with your habitat using colored pencils/markers.\n   - Glue your camouflaged animal onto a large poster board that shows your habitat (draw/glue background materials).\n   - Record on a simple table: *Habitat | Animal Color | Why this color helps it hide*\n\n3. **Documentation:** Students draw or write one sentence explaining: \"My animal is _____ (color) because in the _____ (habitat), this color helps it hide from predators.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask questions like: \"How does the color you chose match your habitat?\" and \"What animal hunts your animal? How would this color trick the hunter?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the \"right\" colors — guide them to discover through comparison.\n- Prompt struggling students by asking: \"What color is most common in your habitat?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that animals that match their environment are harder to see.\n- Pairs create camouflaged animals with thoughtful color choices tied to specific habitats.\n- Students record observations connecting color to survival advantage.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce scientific vocabulary and formalize the concept of camouflage as an adaptation that aids survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of katydid (displayed again)\n- Student camouflage projects from Explore phase\n- Anchor chart or poster with vocabulary\n- Whiteboard/chart paper for labeling\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gallery Walk (5 minutes):** Students place their camouflage projects around the room. Do a quick walk where students observe 2-3 other pairs' work.\n\n2. **Group Share & Discussion (7-8 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 pairs to briefly show their camouflaged animal and explain their habitat and color choice.\n   - Highlight connections: \"Just like the katydid in our photo blends with green grass, [student name]'s animal blends with the sandy beach because it's the same color!\"\n\n3. **Introduce Vocabulary (5 minutes):**\n\n   **Camouflage:** A color, pattern, or shape that helps an animal blend in with its surroundings so predators have a harder time seeing it.\n\n   **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and thrive in its environment. (Example: The katydid's green wings are an adaptation.)\n\n   **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals. (Example: A bird might hunt a katydid.)\n\n   **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives, with the right food, water, and shelter it needs. (Example: A grassy field is a habitat for a katydid.)\n\n   **Trait:** A characteristic or feature of a living thing. (Example: Being green is a trait of many katydids.)\n\n4. **Connect Back to Photograph:**\n   - Point to the katydid image: \"This katydid has a green color and wings shaped like leaves. These are traits it inherited from its parents. Because the katydid lives in green grass, this color is a perfect adaptation — it's camouflage that keeps it safe.\"\n   - Ask: \"How is the katydid's green color like the colors you chose for your camouflaged animals?\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why is camouflage important for a katydid's survival?\" (Listen for: helps it hide from predators, keeps it safe, helps it survive.)\n   - \"Can you give me a thumbs up if you think camouflage is a trait an animal is born with?\" (Yes — inherited from parents.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|----------|--------------------------------|\n| **Camouflage** | Colors, patterns, or shapes that help an animal hide by blending in with where it lives. |\n| **Adaptation** | Something about an animal's body or the way it behaves that helps it survive in its home. |\n| **Predator** | An animal that hunts and eats other animals for food. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. |\n| **Trait** | A feature or characteristic of a living thing that it gets from its parents. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that camouflage is an adaptation that helps animals survive.\n- Students can connect the katydid's green color to its habitat and survival advantage.\n- Students recognize that traits like color are inherited and influenced by where an animal lives.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by investigating how camouflage works in real habitats and considering what happens when environments change.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of 4-5 different animals in their habitats (printed or displayed): katydid, moth on tree bark, Arctic hare in snow, leaf-tailed gecko on tree, fish in coral\n- Habitats that have changed (optional images): forest after fire, green habitat with pollution, etc.\n- Animal adaptation matching cards (optional)\n- Observation sheet or comparison chart\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Camouflage in Nature (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show 3-4 different animal images** where students must locate the animal (moth on bark, snow hare in snow, etc.). Start with easy, progress to harder.\n\n2. **For each image, ask:**\n   - \"Can you find the animal? What color/pattern is it?\"\n   - \"What is the habitat around it?\"\n   - \"Why does this coloring help the animal survive?\"\n\n3. **Complete a comparison chart** together:\n\n| **Animal** | **Habitat** | **Color/Pattern** | **How Camouflage Helps** |\n|-----------|-----------|------------------|------------------------|\n| Katydid | Green grass & leaves | Green | Hides from birds & predators |\n| Moth | Tree bark | Brown/gray | Predators can't see it on bark |\n| Arctic Hare | Snow | White | Blends with snowy landscape |\n\n**Part B: What If the Habitat Changes? (5-7 minutes)**\n\n1. **Present a scenario:** \"Imagine a green katydid lived in a place. Then all the grass got cut down and the area turned brown. What would happen to the katydid now? Would it be easier or harder for predators to see it?\"\n\n2. **Student thinking/discussion:**\n   - Guide them to realize the green katydid would now stand out against brown soil.\n   - It would be easier for predators to spot and eat it.\n   - This is why habitats matter — animals are adapted to specific environments.\n\n3. **Ask:** \"What other habitats might be dangerous for a green katydid?\" (Desert, snow, ocean, etc.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask questions that guide students to make connections without giving answers.\n- Celebrate observations: \"Great thinking! You noticed that camouflage only works if the animal is in the right habitat!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify camouflaged animals in multiple habitats.\n- Students recognize that adaptation is specific to an environment.\n- Students understand that environmental changes can threaten an animal's survival.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students understand camouflage as an adaptation that aids survival in specific habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- **During Explore:** Observe whether students select colors that logically match their assigned habitat. Ask probing questions to assess reasoning.\n- **During Explain:** Listen to student responses during vocabulary checks and connection questions. Look for understanding of how adaptation connects to survival.\n- **During Elaborate:** Monitor student thinking in the \"what if habitat changes\" scenario. Can they predict consequences?\n\n**Summative Exit Ticket (end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal or written, adjusted for writing level):\n\n**Question 1:** \"The katydid in our photo is green. Why is being green a good trait for a katydid to have?\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student mentions that green helps it hide in grass/plants or blend in/avoid being eaten.\n\n**Question 2:** \"Imagine a katydid moved to a red flower garden. Would its green color still be good camouflage? Why or why not?\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student explains that green would NOT blend in with red flowers, making it easier for predators to see.\n\n**Question 3 (Observation-based):** Show a new camouflaged animal image (e.g., a stick insect on a branch). \"This animal looks like a stick. How does this help it survive?\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student connects appearance to hiding from predators or safety.\n\n**Assessment Strategy Options:**\n- **Written Exit Tickets:** For students with developing writing skills, use pictures + one-word responses or teacher scribing.\n- **Verbal Exit Tickets:** Ask the three questions orally to students; you or a teaching assistant record responses.\n- **Observation Checklist:** Use the guiding questions above to check off whether each student demonstrates understanding.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student can identify at least one way camouflage helps an animal survive.\n- Student can explain that an animal's color/appearance is connected to its habitat.\n- Student can predict what would happen if an animal's habitat changed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will demonstrate understanding that camouflage is an adaptation tied to survival and habitat.\n- Students will use vocabulary: camouflage, adaptation, habitat, predator, trait.\n- Advanced students may make connections to environmental change and species survival.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary matching:** Pair struggling students with a visual vocabulary chart with pictures (green katydid next to the word \"camouflage,\" etc.). Reduce the number of vocabulary terms to focus on camouflage and habitat.\n\n2. **Habitat choice for Explore:** Assign simpler habitats (just green grass OR brown soil, not multiple options). Provide pre-colored animal shapes so students focus on placement and explanation rather than color selection.\n\n3. **Sentence stems for explanations:** Provide frames like \"This animal is _____ (color) because _____ (color) helps it hide in the _____.\" Students fill in the blanks rather than generating from scratch.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate mimicry beyond color:** Show students images of animals with pattern camouflage (zebra stripes breaking up shape, moth with eyespots, etc.). Ask: \"How do patterns help animals hide, not just colors?\" Have them research and create a pattern-based camouflage design for their own animal.\n\n2. **Environmental change scenarios:** Present more complex \"what if\" scenarios: \"If climate change made grass turn brown earlier each year, what would happen to green katydids over many generations? Would their color change?\" (Introduces idea of natural selection and adaptation over time, previewing 4th-5th grade concepts.)\n\n3. **Comparative habitat project:** Ask advanced students to compare two very different habitats (forest and desert, for example) and identify which animals would survive well in each and why. Create a Venn diagram showing adaptation differences.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Camouflage Scavenger Hunt in School Grounds:** On a follow-up day, take students outside to observe real insects and small animals in grass, on trees, or in shrubs. Challenge them to spot as many animals as they can using their new understanding of camouflage. Record findings: \"Found a [animal name], it was [color], hiding in [habitat]. Its camouflage works because...\"\n\n2. **Design a New Habitat for the Katydid:** Provide students with art materials (paints, collage materials, colored paper) to design an entirely new, imaginary habitat for a katydid. Then ask: \"If a katydid lived here, what color and pattern would it need to be to survive? Design what this katydid would look like.\" Students draw/paint the katydid and explain their design choices.\n\n3. **Predator-Prey Role Play:** Divide the class into \"predators\" (birds) and \"prey\" (katydids). Use the outdoor space or large indoor space. Give \"katydid\" students colored armbands or ribbons. Ask \"predators\" to try to tag \"katydids.\" Run the game in different colored environments (green blankets, brown paper backdrop, etc.) and discuss: \"When katydids matched the environment, predators had harder time tagging them. When they stood out, they were caught faster.\" Connects camouflage to real survival advantage through kinesthetic learning.\n\n---",
