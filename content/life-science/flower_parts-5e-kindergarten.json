Use their senses to observe and describe the different parts of a flower.\n2. Explain that flowers are an important part of plants.\n3. Identify patterns in flower petals and other flower parts.\n4. Describe one thing flowers need to stay healthy and alive.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital display of the flower photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Show students the image of the pink hibiscus flower with its prominent stamen and stigma. Project it large on a screen or display it on chart paper at student eye level.\n\n2. **Invitation to Observe:** Say: \"Look at this beautiful pink flower! What do you notice? What do you see?\" Allow students to shout out observations without filtering—encourage excitement and curiosity.\n\n3. **Specific Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What color is this flower? Do you like it?\"\n   - \"Can you point to the yellow stringy parts in the middle? What do you think they are for?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a flower that looks like this one?\"\n   - \"What do you think the flower needs to be so beautiful and healthy?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** Say: \"I wonder... what is inside the flower? Why does it have so many special parts? Today, we're going to be flower detectives and find out!\"\n\n5. **Record Observations:** Write student observations on chart paper as they share. Keep language simple: \"Brooke said it's pink. Maya said it has yellow strings.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's go outside (or to our science table) to look at real flowers up close, just like the one in this picture!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover flower parts through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Fresh flowers (one per small group or one per pair of students)—hibiscus, tulips, daisies, or other large, sturdy flowers with visible parts\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (optional but helpful)\n- Large paper plates or white paper for each group\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Paper towels\n- Small containers of water (optional, to keep flowers fresh)\n- Observation recording sheets (simple pictures of flowers with labels like \"petals,\" \"middle part,\" \"stem\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the Flower:** Give each small group a fresh flower. Say: \"This is our flower to explore. Be gentle—flowers are delicate like us when we're sleeping!\"\n\n2. **Guided Sensory Exploration:** Direct students with specific prompts:\n   - \"Touch a petal gently. How does it feel? Is it soft? Bumpy? Smooth?\"\n   - \"Look inside the middle of the flower. What colors do you see?\"\n   - \"Smell the flower. Does it have a smell?\"\n   - \"Count the petals. How many do you have?\"\n   - \"Find the long, thin parts in the middle (stamen). What do you think they do?\"\n\n3. **Hands-On Investigation:** Allow students to:\n   - Gently pull off a petal and examine it closely with a hand lens\n   - Look at the yellow powder (pollen) on the stamen\n   - Touch the stigma (the sticky part at the top)\n   - Feel the stem\n\n4. **Documentation:** Have students:\n   - Draw what they see on their flower on white paper\n   - Color in the parts\n   - Use simple labels from the recording sheet (teacher can write words; students point and label)\n   - Record one texture they felt (soft, bumpy, smooth)\n\n5. **Teacher Role:** Circulate among groups, asking open-ended questions:\n   - \"What did you discover?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the flower has petals?\"\n   - \"What happens if we touch the yellow powder?\"\n   - \"Is the stem strong or bendy?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe multiple parts of a real flower\n- Students describe textures, colors, and patterns they see\n- Students create a simple drawing or labeled diagram of flower parts\n- Students recognize that flowers have many different parts working together\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and key concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled flower diagram (pre-drawn or drawn now with student input)\n- Marker\n- Original flower photograph (still displayed)\n- Real flower (can be the same one from Explore or a new one)\n- Picture cards showing: petals, stem, stamen, leaves, roots (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Gather students in a circle with their flowers or drawings. Ask:\n   - \"Who wants to tell us what you discovered?\"\n   - \"What was your favorite part of the flower to touch?\"\n   - \"Did your flower look like the one in the picture?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary:** Using the real flower and the photograph, teach these terms with student-friendly definitions:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Petals:** The colorful parts of the flower that are soft and pretty. They help attract bees and butterflies.\n   - **Stamen:** The long, thin yellow parts in the middle of the flower that make yellow powder called pollen.\n   - **Stigma:** The sticky part at the very top of the stamen that catches pollen.\n   - **Stem:** The green part that holds the flower up and helps bring water and food from the roots to the petals.\n   - **Flower:** A special part of a plant that makes seeds so new plants can grow.\n\n3. **Connect to Image and Exploration:**\n   - Point to each part on the flower photograph, then on the real flower. Say: \"Here are the petals—you touched petals today! Here's the stamen with the yellow powder.\"\n   - Have students point to matching parts on their own drawings.\n   - Reinforce: \"The flower is SO important! Without flowers, we wouldn't have seeds to grow new plants.\"\n\n4. **Introduce Plant Needs:** Say: \"Flowers need some things to stay healthy, just like you need food and water. What does a flower need?\"\n   - Guide students to recognize: water, sunlight, soil, and air\n   - Connect to K-LS1-1: \"These are things flowers NEED to SURVIVE and make seeds.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students to point to petals on their drawings\n   - Ask: \"Why is the flower important?\" (to make seeds)\n   - Ask: \"What does a flower need to grow?\" (water, sun, soil)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students learn and use vocabulary for flower parts\n- Students understand that flowers are essential for plant reproduction\n- Students can identify what flowers need to survive\n- Students connect new vocabulary to what they observed during Explore\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding through a plant care activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small potted flowering plants (4-5 pots) or seeds to plant in small cups\n- Watering cans or spray bottles\n- Soil\n- Sunny windowsill access (or grow light)\n- \"Plant Care\" chart with pictures (water, sun, soil, love)\n- Markers\n- Plant observation journal (simple pictures and words)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario Introduction:** Say: \"Now that we're flower experts, we need to take care of flowers! Let's plant flowers in our classroom and watch them grow.\"\n\n2. **Hands-On Plant Care:**\n   - Give small groups a potted plant or seeds to plant in soil\n   - Have students water the plant gently (model first)\n   - Place in a sunny location\n   - Discuss: \"What does this plant need from us?\"\n\n3. **Create a Plant Care Chart:** As a class, create a visual chart showing what flowers/plants need:\n   - **Water:** Draw a watering can\n   - **Sunlight:** Draw the sun\n   - **Soil:** Draw dirt\n   - **Care:** Draw hands being gentle\n   - Have students decorate or add stickers\n\n4. **Observation Over Time:** Students will:\n   - Water the plant every 2-3 days (assign rotating \"plant waterers\")\n   - Observe changes in the plant\n   - Predict: \"Will flowers come? When?\"\n   - Draw what they observe in a simple journal\n\n5. **Make Connections:** Ask:\n   - \"The flower in the picture was so healthy. What helped it grow?\"\n   - \"How is taking care of our plant like taking care of ourselves?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Model gentle plant care\n- Ask questions that connect plant needs to survival concepts\n- Facilitate daily observations\n- Encourage responsibility and care\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that plants have specific needs\n- Students engage in caring for a living plant\n- Students predict and observe plant growth\n- Students understand the connection between meeting plant needs and plant survival (K-LS1-1)\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of flower parts and plant needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n   - Observe student participation in Explore: Can they identify flower parts? Do they describe what they see?\n   - During Explain: Listen to student responses about vocabulary and plant needs\n   - Check drawings and labels for accuracy\n\n2. **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes):**\n\n   **Activity Options (choose one or use both):**\n\n   **Option A: Picture Identification**\n   - Show students the original flower photograph again\n   - Ask:\n     - \"Point to the petals. What color are they?\" (Student points and answers)\n     - \"Show me the yellow parts in the middle. What do we call them?\" (Student points and says \"stamen\" or \"the stringy yellow parts\")\n     - \"Tell me one thing this flower needs to stay alive.\" (Student responds: sun, water, or soil)\n\n   **Option B: Simple Drawing and Labeling**\n   - Give each student a simple flower outline\n   - Ask them to:\n     - Color the petals\n     - Draw the yellow parts in the middle\n     - Draw what the flower needs (sun, water, soil) around the flower\n   - Collect to assess understanding\n\n   **Option C: Observation Question**\n   - Ask individually or in small groups: \"What do you remember about flowers? What did your flower need?\"\n   - Record responses verbally (teacher notes)\n\n3. **Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n   - ✓ Student can identify at least 2 flower parts (petals, stamen, stem)\n   - ✓ Student describes a texture or color they observed\n   - ✓ Student can name at least one thing a flower needs to survive (water, sun, or soil)\n   - ✓ Student demonstrates gentle handling and care of plants\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding of flower structure through identification and description\n- Students show awareness that flowers have specific needs for survival\n- Students engage respectfully with living plants\n- Data collected informs next steps for instruction (reteaching, advancing concepts, etc.)\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only 2-3 key terms (petals, stamen, stem) rather than all five. Repeat terms multiple times with visual supports. Use the photograph and real flower to point and practice saying words together.\n\n2. **Guided Observation:** Pair students with a partner or provide one-on-one guidance during Explore. Ask simpler questions: \"Is it soft or hard?\" \"What color do you see?\" instead of open-ended prompts. Provide hand-over-hand support for gentle petal touching if needed.\n\n3. **Visual Supports:** Use picture cards or the flower photograph as a reference during all phases. Create a simple 2-part visual showing \"What flowers need\" (pictures of water and sun only, not soil or air).\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper Investigation:** Ask advanced students: \"What do you think the yellow powder (pollen) does?\" Introduce the concept that pollen helps make seeds. Explore: \"How does pollen move from flower to flower?\" (bees, butterflies, wind). Have them observe a real bee or butterfly visit flowers if possible.\n\n2. **Prediction and Documentation:** Have students predict what will happen to a flower after different scenarios:\n   - \"What will happen if we don't water this flower for one week?\"\n   - \"What will happen if we put this flower in a dark closet?\"\n   - Test predictions and document findings over several days with detailed drawings and words.\n\n3. **Life Cycle Extension:** Show students pictures of a flower's life cycle (seed → sprout → plant → flower → seed). Have advanced students arrange picture cards in order or create their own life cycle drawing, connecting flowers to seeds and new plants.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Flower Sorting and Pattern Activity:**\n   - Collect pictures of different flowers (tulips, daisies, roses, sunflowers, marigolds)\n   - Students sort by: color, number of petals, size, or other attributes\n   - Create a class graph: \"How many petals?\" or \"What color flower do you like best?\"\n   - Reinforces observation skills and introduces data/graphing in a playful way\n\n2. **Pollinator Detective Walk:**\n   - Take students on a nature walk around the school grounds or nearby park to observe flowers and pollinators (bees, butterflies, ladybugs)\n   - Students sketch flowers they find and mark if they see any insects visiting them\n   - Discuss: \"What was the insect doing? Why was it on the flower?\"\n   - This bridges plant needs with real-world observation and introduces the role of flowers in nature\n\n3. **Flower Art and Writing:**\n   - Students create a large, colorful flower collage using tissue paper, paint, or natural materials (petals, leaves)\n   - Have them write or dictate 2-3 sentences about their flower: \"My flower is ___. It needs ___. I think it is special because ___.\"\n   - Display in the classroom and read together, celebrating student learning and creativity\n\n---\n\nThis lesson brings the photograph to life through sensory exploration and care, grounding abstract concepts about plant needs in Kindergarten-appropriate, hands-on experience.",
