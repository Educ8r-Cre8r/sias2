Identify and describe what plants (like trees) need to survive and grow healthy and strong.\n2. Plan and carry out an investigation using simple plant samples to test whether sunlight and water affect plant growth.\n3. Make observations of plants in a habitat and explain how different plants and animals depend on each other in that environment.\n4. Compare what the large oak tree in the photograph needs to survive with the needs of smaller classroom plants.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring the photograph of the mighty oak tree.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of the live oak tree (or display on interactive board)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Chart titled \"What Do You Wonder?\" posted on the wall\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph prominently** where all students can see it clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Facilitate a \"Think-Pair-Share\" discussion:**\n   - Think (15 seconds): \"Look carefully at this giant oak tree. What do you notice about it?\"\n   - Pair (1 minute): Students turn to a partner and describe what they see.\n   - Share (2 minutes): Call on 3-4 pairs to share observations aloud. Write key words on chart paper (e.g., \"big trunk,\" \"lots of leaves,\" \"green,\" \"branches\").\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"This tree is HUGE! How do you think a tiny seed grew into such a giant tree?\"\n   - \"What do you think this tree needs to stay healthy and keep growing?\"\n   - \"Do you see any animals or insects living in or around this tree? Where might they be hiding?\"\n   - \"If we brought a small plant to our classroom, what would we have to do to keep it alive and healthy?\"\n\n4. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n   - \"I'm going to show you some small plants in our classroom. Do you think these plants need the SAME things as this giant oak tree to grow? Let's investigate and find out!\"\n   - Record student predictions on the \"What Do You Wonder?\" chart.\n\n**Transition:** \"Scientists investigate questions by doing experiments. Today, we're going to plan an investigation to test what plants really need to grow, just like this oak tree!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students conduct a hands-on investigation to discover that plants need both sunlight and water to grow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4-6 small potted bean plants or seedlings (all the same type and size)\n- Watering can with water\n- Access to a sunny windowsill and a dark closet or cabinet\n- Masking tape and markers\n- Observation journals or data recording sheets (with pictures and words)\n- Ruler (optional, for older 2nd graders)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set Up the Investigation (5 minutes):**\n   - Divide the class into 2 small groups.\n   - **Group 1's Job:** Care for one plant in a SUNNY location (windowsill) and water it regularly. Label this pot: \"Sunlight + Water.\"\n   - **Group 2's Job:** Care for one plant in a DARK location (closet) but water it regularly. Label this pot: \"No Sunlight + Water.\"\n   - **Control:** Keep one plant in a sunny location but DO NOT water it (water only once every 2 weeks). Label: \"Sunlight + No Water.\" *Teacher handles this to ensure safety.*\n\n2. **Daily Observations (over 1-2 weeks):**\n   - Each day, have students observe their assigned plant for 2-3 minutes.\n   - Students record observations in their journals using:\n     - **Pictures:** Draw the plant as it looks each day.\n     - **Words/Labels:** With teacher support, write or dictate observations (e.g., \"Leaves are green,\" \"Leaves look yellow,\" \"Plant is droopy,\" \"New leaves growing\").\n   - Guide observation questions: \"What color are the leaves?\" \"Do the leaves look healthy?\" \"Is the plant growing taller?\" \"Does it look the same as yesterday?\"\n\n3. **Connection to the Photograph:**\n   - \"The oak tree in the picture gets LOTS of sunlight and water from rain and the ground. That's why it's so big and healthy. Let's see what happens to our classroom plants when we give them different things.\"\n\n4. **What Students Should Record:**\n   - Daily sketches of plant appearance\n   - Color observations (green, yellow, pale)\n   - Height (if measurable) or growth descriptions\n   - Overall health appearance (healthy/strong vs. droopy/weak)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate setup and ensure consistent watering of Group 1's plant and control plant.\n- Ask open-ended questions during observations: \"What changed since yesterday?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\" \"Which plant looks healthiest?\"\n- Do NOT provide answers—let students make their own observations and draw conclusions.\n- Encourage students to make predictions about what they think will happen next.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that the plant with sunlight AND water stays green and healthy.\n- Students observe that the plant with sunlight but NO water becomes droopy and unhealthy.\n- Students observe that the plant in darkness (no sunlight) becomes pale/yellow and weak, even with water.\n- Students begin to understand that BOTH sunlight and water are necessary for healthy plant growth.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to the concepts of plant needs and habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary terms\n- Photographs of plants in different habitats (optional: forest, desert, water)\n- Picture cards of animals in/around trees\n- Student observation journals from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover about the plants we were watching? Which plant looked the healthiest?\"\n   - Guide students to conclude: \"Plants need BOTH sunlight and water to grow healthy and strong.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the oak tree in our big picture is so healthy? What does it have?\"\n   - Response: \"It gets sunlight from the sky and water from rain!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n   - **Sunlight:** Energy from the sun that plants need to make their own food and grow strong.\n   - **Water:** A liquid that plants suck up from the soil through their roots to stay alive and healthy.\n   - **Roots:** The plant parts that grow under the ground and drink water from the soil.\n   - **Habitat:** A place where plants and animals live. It has everything they need to survive.\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n\n3. **Connections Back to the Photograph:**\n   - \"This oak tree has been living in this park for many, many years. The soil below it has water, and the leaves way up high catch lots of sunlight. That's why it's so big!\"\n   - \"Look at the picture—do you see other plants around the oak tree? Do you see people? Do you see buildings? This whole area is the tree's HABITAT. All these things help the tree survive.\"\n\n4. **Habitat and Diversity Discussion (4 minutes):**\n   - Show picture cards of animals (birds, squirrels, insects) that might live in or around the oak tree.\n   - \"Trees need sunlight and water. But many ANIMALS need trees too! Birds build nests in the branches. Insects live on the leaves. Can you think of animals that might live in this big oak tree?\"\n   - Discuss: \"The oak tree, other plants, animals, people—they all share this habitat. They all need different things, but they all live here together.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we grew plants in a room with no sunlight, what would happen?\" (They would turn pale and weak.)\n   - Ask: \"If we had lots of sunlight but never gave our plant water, what would happen?\" (It would dry out and die.)\n   - Ask: \"Where is the oak tree's habitat, and what does it have there?\" (In the park; it has sunlight, water, soil, and animals nearby.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and explain the main things plants need: sunlight and water.\n- Students understand that a habitat is where living things get what they need to survive.\n- Students can identify that the oak tree and other organisms share a habitat.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding of plant needs and habitats by exploring a new scenario and making real-world connections.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or small photographs of different habitats: sunny garden, shady forest, desert, rainforest, classroom\n- Index cards with plant/animal names\n- Chart paper titled \"Habitat Needs\"\n- Optional: seeds, small pots, soil for students to start their own plant\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Matching Game (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display 3-4 different habitat pictures** (sunny park like the oak tree, shaded forest, desert, classroom windowsill).\n\n2. **Give each student or pair a card** with a plant or animal name (e.g., oak tree, grass, robin, squirrel, cactus, fern).\n\n3. **Students place their card** in the habitat where they think that plant/animal would best survive.\n\n4. **Discuss choices:**\n   - \"Why did you put the oak tree in the sunny park?\"\n   - \"Where would a cactus live best? Why?\"\n   - \"Does a fern need lots of sun like the oak tree?\"\n\n5. **Conclusion:** \"Different plants and animals have different needs. The oak tree loves sunlight, but some plants prefer shade. All habitats are special!\"\n\n**Option B: Design a Plant Care Plan (if students finish early or for homework)**\n\n1. **Scenario:** \"Pretend your family is bringing home a small plant. What will you do to help it survive and grow healthy?\"\n\n2. **Students draw and write (with teacher support):**\n   - Where will I put the plant? (sunny spot? shady spot?)\n   - How often will I water it?\n   - What does my plant need from its habitat?\n\n3. **Students share their plant care plans aloud.** Celebrate plans that include both sunlight and water!\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussions without giving answers; ask: \"Why do you think that plant belongs there?\"\n- Support students in making connections: \"Remember our investigation? We learned plants need sunlight and water. Does that plant get those things in this habitat?\"\n- Celebrate diverse thinking: \"That's a great observation! Tell us why you chose that habitat.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding of plant needs to new situations.\n- Students recognize that different plants have different habitat preferences.\n- Students demonstrate understanding by explaining their choices using the vocabulary from Explain phase.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant needs, growth requirements, and habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n- **Observation Phase:** Circulate during Explore and Elaborate. Listen for use of vocabulary (sunlight, water, roots, habitat, survive). Record anecdotal notes about which students are making connections.\n- **Discussion Questions:** During Explain and Elaborate, track student responses to open-ended questions. Note who can explain WHY plants need sunlight and water, not just THAT they do.\n- **Drawings and Records:** Review observation journals for evidence that students tracked plant changes and understood the connection between care and growth.\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (administer at end of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal, drawn, or written with teacher scribe). Ask:\n\n1. **\"Look at this picture of the oak tree again. Name TWO things this tree needs to grow big and strong.\"** \n   - Success: Student identifies sunlight AND water.\n\n2. **\"Draw a happy plant in its habitat. What things does the plant have in its habitat?\"** \n   - Success: Student draws a plant with indicators of sunlight (sun, bright area) and water (raindrops, ground).\n\n3. **\"Our classroom plant was sitting in a dark closet with water. Our other plant was in the sun with water. Which plant was healthier? Why?\"**\n   - Success: Student identifies the sunny plant as healthier and explains that plants need sunlight to be healthy.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student can identify at least two things plants need to survive (sunlight and water).\n- ✓ Student can explain (in words or drawings) why plants need these things.\n- ✓ Student can compare two plants or habitats and explain differences in plant health based on available resources.\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary correctly (sunlight, water, roots, habitat, survive) in context.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students (80%+) can identify sunlight and water as plant needs.\n- Most students can give simple explanations for why these matter.\n- Students demonstrate understanding through drawings, observations, and verbal explanations.\n- Students show growing ability to connect the mighty oak tree to the needs of all plants.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use shorter definitions and repeat key terms often. Use picture cards alongside words (picture of sun = sunlight; picture of water droplet = water).\n\n2. **Structured Observation:** Provide sentence frames for recording observations in journals:\n   - \"Today, my plant's leaves are _____ (green/yellow).\"\n   - \"The plant is _____ (droopy/standing up tall).\"\n   - \"I think the plant needs _____.\"\n\n3. **Peer Support:** Pair struggling students with patient peers during investigation and discussions. Allow them to listen to and repeat back partner explanations before sharing with the whole group.\n\n4. **Visual Aids:** Use real potted plants in the room as references throughout the lesson. Point to roots, leaves, soil, and sunlight source physically.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Investigation:** Have students design their OWN experiment. \"What else might help a plant grow? (e.g., temperature, type of soil, fertilizer).\" Plan an investigation and predict outcomes.\n\n2. **Research and Report:** Provide books or simple websites about how different plants adapt to their habitats. \"Find a plant that lives in a place with very little water. How does it survive?\" Students create a poster or short presentation.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Connections:** \"The oak tree needs sunlight and water. What animals depend on the oak tree for food, shelter, or water? Create a drawing showing how the oak tree connects to other living things in the park.\"\n\n4. **Data Analysis:** Have advanced students measure plant height weekly and create a simple graph showing growth over time, comparing sunlight + water vs. other conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Sprouting Experiment:** Send home a bean seed in a plastic bag with soil and instructions. Students observe germination and growth over 2 weeks, connecting back to plant needs. Document with photos and journal entries.\n\n2. **Tree Investigation Walk:** Take the class on a nature walk around the school grounds or local park to observe different trees and plants. Students identify and sketch plants in sunny vs. shady spots and discuss why different plants grow in different locations. Create a \"Plant Habitat Map\" of the campus.\n\n3. **How Animals Help Plants Grow:** Follow up with 2-LS2-2 by having students explore how animals disperse seeds. Read a book like \"The Tiny Seed\" by Eric Carle, then create a simple model showing how animals (birds, squirrels, wind) help spread seeds to new habitats where plants can grow.\n\n4. **Interview a Gardener/Groundskeeper:** Invite a local gardener, park worker, or school groundskeeper to visit and explain how they care for plants and trees. Students prepare questions in advance based on their learning (What do plants need? How do you help plants grow?).\n\n5. **Classroom Garden Project:** Start a small classroom or windowsill garden with herbs or vegetables. Students take responsibility for watering, monitoring sunlight, and recording growth. This extends the investigation into real-time, long-term plant care.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
