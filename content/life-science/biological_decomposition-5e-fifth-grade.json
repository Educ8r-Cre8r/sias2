ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the hollow tree.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the hollow tree displayed on a screen or printed large (at least 8.5\" × 11\")\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and introduce the photograph:** Project the image of the hollow tree on the screen or pass around a large print. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you notice about this tree? What looks different about the inside compared to the outside?\"\n   - \"If so much of the tree is hollow on the inside, why do you think this tree is still alive and growing branches?\"\n   - \"What might have caused this hole to form? What could have eaten or broken down the wood inside?\"\n   - \"Where does all the old wood go? What happens to it?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what creatures or living things might be responsible for breaking down this tree from the inside. Let's investigate what happens to dead plants in nature.\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions:** Write student ideas on chart paper. Accept all responses without judgment; they will be revisited during Explain.\n\n**Transition:** \"To understand what's happening to this tree, we need to become decomposition detectives and do an investigation with our own dead plant material.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover decomposition and the role of decomposers through hands-on observation and experimentation.\n\n**Materials per group of 3-4 students:**\n- Clear plastic container (quart-sized storage container or gallon ziplock bag)\n- Leaf litter or dead leaves (collected from outside or pre-collected)\n- Small twigs or bark pieces\n- Soil or compost (about 1 cup)\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Hand lens or magnifying glass\n- Paper towels\n- Observation sheet (template provided below)\n- Labels and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Preparation (Teacher does this before Explore):** Collect decomposing leaf litter and small dead plant material from the school grounds or prepare containers with a mixture of soil, leaves, and small twigs.\n\n2. **Student investigation steps:**\n\n   **Step 1 - Create a decomposition chamber:**\n   - Provide each group with a clear container.\n   - Have students layer soil, dead leaves, small twigs, and bark pieces into the container (approximately 3-4 inches deep).\n   - Lightly mist the mixture with water until it's damp but not soggy.\n   - Seal the container loosely (not airtight—decomposers need some air).\n   - Label with the group's name and date.\n\n   **Step 2 - Observe closely:**\n   - Have students use the magnifying glass to observe the mixture carefully.\n   - Ask them to look for:\n     - Small insects, worms, or pill bugs\n     - Fungal growth (white threads or spots)\n     - Changes in color or texture of the dead leaves\n     - Any signs of decay or breakdown\n   - Students draw what they see and list observations on the observation sheet.\n\n   **Step 3 - Predict and wonder:**\n   - Ask: \"What do you think will happen to these dead leaves and twigs over the next week?\"\n   - Prompt: \"What living things might be breaking down this dead material?\"\n   - Record predictions on the observation sheet.\n\n3. **Connection to the photograph:**\n   - Ask students: \"How is what we see in this container similar to what might be happening inside the hollow tree?\"\n   - Students answer on their observation sheet.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions rather than providing answers.\n- Ask: \"What small creatures do you see? What might they be eating? Why would fungi grow on dead plants?\"\n- Encourage careful observation and documentation.\n- Do not lecture; allow students to discover through observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe living decomposers (insects, worms) in the containers.\n- Students note changes in color, texture, and smell of dead material.\n- Students begin to wonder about what \"eats\" or breaks down dead plant matter.\n- Students record observations and predictions in their science notebooks.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration. Connect discoveries to ecosystem nutrient cycling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or slides with vocabulary terms\n- Diagram or model showing decomposition cycle (teacher-prepared visual or from a science resource)\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Image of the hollow tree displayed again\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore phase (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to briefly share what they observed in their decomposition containers.\n   - Emphasize any living decomposers they found or changes they noticed.\n   - Ask the class: \"Why do you think these things were living in the dead plant material?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with grade-appropriate definitions (8 minutes):**\n\n   **Decomposer:** A living organism (like bacteria, fungi, insects, or worms) that breaks down dead plants and animals into smaller pieces and nutrients. Decomposers are nature's recyclers.\n\n   **Decomposition:** The process by which dead plants, animals, and other organic matter are broken down into simpler substances that return to the soil.\n\n   **Nutrient:** Substances that living things need to grow, stay healthy, and have energy. Plants and animals get nutrients from food and soil.\n\n   **Matter:** Anything that takes up space and has weight. In this lesson, matter includes dead leaves, wood, soil, and the living things that break them down.\n\n   **Nutrient cycle (or matter cycle):** The movement of nutrients and matter from dead organisms back into soil and air, where they can be used by living plants and animals again.\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph and Explore activity (3 minutes):**\n   - Display the hollow tree image again.\n   - Explain: \"The hole in this tree was created by decomposers—fungi, termites, beetles, and bacteria—that broke down the dead wood inside. This is decomposition. As they break down the wood, they release nutrients back into the soil and tree. That's why this tree is still healthy and alive—it's getting nutrients from the recycled matter!\"\n   - Connect to students' observations: \"The creatures and fungi you saw in your containers are doing the same thing the decomposers in that tree are doing.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Can anyone explain in your own words what a decomposer does?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why is decomposition important for plants?\"\n   - Look for responses that mention recycling, breaking down, or returning nutrients to soil.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Decomposer:** A living thing that breaks down dead plants and animals and returns nutrients to the soil.\n- **Decomposition:** The process of dead things being broken down into nutrients and simpler materials.\n- **Nutrient:** Materials that living things need to grow and stay healthy.\n- **Matter:** Anything that takes up space; the \"stuff\" that makes up our world.\n- **Nutrient cycle:** The path nutrients take as they move from dead organisms back into soil and to new living plants.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define decomposer and decomposition in their own words.\n- Students understand that decomposers recycle dead material.\n- Students make the connection between the decomposers in their containers and the decomposition happening in the hollow tree.\n- Students can answer: \"Why do we need decomposers?\" (to recycle nutrients so plants can grow)\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by developing a model of nutrient cycling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster paper or chart paper (one per group)\n- Colored markers or colored pencils\n- Images of decomposers (fungi, bacteria, earthworms, beetles, termites—printed or from slides)\n- Scissors and glue sticks\n- Labels or index cards with vocabulary terms\n- Optional: photo of the hollow tree to include on the model\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the modeling task:**\n   - Explain: \"Now we're going to create a model that shows how nutrients move through an ecosystem. A model helps us understand something that's hard to see in real life.\"\n   - Show students an example model or simple diagram showing: dead plant → decomposer → nutrients in soil → growing plant → dead plant (cyclical).\n\n2. **Small group model creation (15 minutes):**\n   - Divide the class into groups of 3-4.\n   - Assign each group one of these ecosystem scenarios:\n     - **Group A:** A dead log on a forest floor\n     - **Group B:** A decomposing tree (like the one in the photograph)\n     - **Group C:** A garden compost pile\n     - **Group D:** Dead leaves in a forest\n   \n   - Each group's task:\n     - Draw or arrange their scenario in the center of the poster.\n     - Add and label decomposers that would break down the dead material.\n     - Use arrows to show nutrients moving back into the soil.\n     - Show how a living plant uses those recycled nutrients to grow.\n     - Write 2-3 sentences explaining their model.\n\n3. **Gallery walk and peer feedback (5 minutes):**\n   - Post models around the room.\n   - Have students walk around and observe other groups' models.\n   - Use a simple feedback protocol: \"I notice... I wonder...\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What decomposers would be in your scenario? Where do the nutrients go after the decomposer breaks down the dead material?\"\n- Encourage students to use the vocabulary terms: decomposer, decomposition, nutrient, matter.\n- Support groups in making their model show a cycle, not just one direction.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual model showing decomposition and nutrient cycling in an ecosystem.\n- Models show decomposers breaking down dead material and nutrients returning to soil.\n- Students use vocabulary terms correctly in their model labels and explanations.\n- Students can explain their model to peers and answer questions about how nutrients move.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of decomposition and nutrient cycling.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment during the lesson:**\n- Observe students during Explore: Do they identify living decomposers? Do they note changes in dead material?\n- Listen during Explain: Can students define decomposer and decomposition? Do they connect these terms to the photograph?\n- Observe during Elaborate: Do their models show matter moving in a cycle? Can they explain how decomposers help?\n\n**Exit ticket (Summative assessment) - Provide to all students at the end of Session 3:**\n\nComplete the following on an index card or half-sheet:\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Show a decomposer breaking down dead plant material. Label the decomposer, the dead material, and the nutrients being released.\n\n2. **Explain in 2-3 sentences:** \"Why is decomposition important for plants in an ecosystem?\"\n\n3. **True or False (circle one):**\n   - Decomposers are living things that break down dead material. **TRUE / FALSE**\n   - Nutrients from dead plants cannot be used by living plants. **TRUE / FALSE**\n   - The hollow tree in our photograph is dead because decomposers are breaking it down. **TRUE / FALSE**\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery if they:\n- Correctly identify at least one decomposer and explain what it does.\n- Describe decomposition as a process that returns nutrients to soil.\n- Show understanding that decomposers and decomposition are essential for plant growth and ecosystem health.\n- Use vocabulary terms (decomposer, decomposition, nutrient, matter) correctly in writing or speech.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show students can visualize and explain decomposition.\n- Responses demonstrate understanding that decomposition is a recycling process essential for ecosystems.\n- Students understand the connection between the hollow tree photograph and the decomposition process.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards:** Provide picture cards with decomposer images and one-word labels (worm, fungus, beetle, bacteria) during Explain. Students can match pictures to the word decomposer.\n\n2. **Guided observation during Explore:** Pair struggling students with stronger peers. Ask focused questions: \"Do you see anything moving? Do you see any fuzzy white stuff? What color are the leaves now?\" to direct their observation.\n\n3. **Structured exit ticket:** Provide a partially completed exit ticket with sentence starters: \"A decomposer is _____. Decomposition helps plants because _____.\" Students fill in the blanks with word banks provided.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research extension:** Have advanced students research specific decomposers (millipedes, mycorrhizal fungi, specific bacteria species) and create an informational poster showing what that decomposer breaks down and how it contributes to nutrient cycling.\n\n2. **Time-scale investigation:** Challenge students to predict what the decomposition container will look like after 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month. Have them design a timeline and explain what changes they expect and why.\n\n3. **Comparison analysis:** Have advanced students compare decomposition rates in different conditions (moist vs. dry, dark vs. light, with soil vs. without soil). Design an experiment to test one variable and predict outcomes based on what they learned about decomposer needs.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Long-term decomposition observation project:** \n   - Students maintain their decomposition containers throughout the month, observing weekly and recording observations. \n   - Create a time-lapse poster or digital presentation showing how the dead material breaks down over time.\n   - Conclude by analyzing what nutrients have returned to the soil and predicting how plants would use these nutrients if grown in the decomposed material.\n\n2. **Hollow tree investigation field trip or virtual exploration:**\n   - If possible, take students outdoors to observe dead logs, leaf litter, or decaying wood in the local environment.\n   - Have them use magnifying glasses to find living decomposers and document evidence of decomposition.\n   - If a field trip isn't possible, use virtual tour resources or additional photographs to explore natural decomposition sites.\n   - Students create a field guide: \"Decomposers in Our Neighborhood.\"\n\n3. **Compost classroom project:**\n   - Start a small classroom composting bin (worm bin or regular compost) and maintain it throughout the year.\n   - Students observe the decomposition of food scraps and yard waste.\n   - At the end of the year, harvest \"finished compost\" and use it to grow plants in a class garden, demonstrating that decomposed matter truly supports new plant growth.\n   - Connect to K-5 sustainability and environmental stewardship standards.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis 5E lesson plan transforms the photograph of the hollow tree into an engaging exploration of decomposition and nutrient cycling. Students move from curious observation to hands-on investigation with their own decomposition containers, then develop vocabulary and conceptual understanding, and finally create visual models showing how matter moves through ecosystems. By the end, students recognize decomposers not as destructive agents but as essential helpers that recycle nutrients and sustain life—a powerful shift in perspective that deepens ecological understanding and supports NGSS standard 5-LS2-1.",
