Identify the body parts of a bee and explain how each part helps it collect pollen and nectar from flowers.\n2. Describe the relationship between bees and flowers and explain why both organisms need each other to survive.\n3. Recognize that bees' fuzzy bodies and flowers' bright colors are helpful traits that make pollination possible.\n4. Construct a simple model showing how bees help flowers reproduce.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (or projected image) of the bee on the purple flower\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: real flowers (or plastic flowers) for students to observe\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph prominently.** Show the image without explaining it. Say: \"Look closely at this picture. I want you to notice everything you can see.\"\n\n2. **Facilitate initial observations (2-3 minutes):** Ask students to turn to a partner and describe what they see. Then call on volunteers to share observations aloud. Expect responses like: \"There's a bee,\" \"The flower is purple,\" \"The bee is on the flower,\" \"I see yellow stuff on the bee.\"\n\n3. **Ask targeted discovery questions (4-5 minutes):**\n   - \"Why do you think the bee is visiting this flower? What might it be looking for?\"\n   - \"What do you notice on the bee's body? What could that fuzzy stuff be for?\"\n   - \"If the bee is getting something from the flower, what do you think the flower might be getting from the bee?\"\n   - \"Do you think the bee and the flower need each other? Why or why not?\"\n\n4. **Activate prior knowledge:** Ask: \"What do you already know about bees? Where have you seen bees? What do bees do?\" Record responses on chart paper.\n\n5. **Pose a wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... if bees didn't visit flowers, what would happen to the flowers? Let's investigate and find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to do an activity to discover how bees and flowers really work together.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover pollination concepts through hands-on simulation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small paper cups or containers (one per student or pair)\n- Flour or powdered sugar\n- Paintbrushes, cotton balls, or small pom-poms\n- Paper flowers (pre-cut by teacher, or students can draw/color simple flower shapes on paper)\n- Tape\n- Paper towels\n- Hand lenses (optional but recommended)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Teacher Preparation:** Before the lesson, cut out simple flower shapes from colored paper (each with a visible center). Place a small amount of flour or powdered sugar in cups as \"pollen.\" Tape flowers to a table, wall, or clipboard.\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"You are going to be a bee! You'll collect 'pollen' from flowers and see what happens.\"\n\n2. \"Use the paintbrush [or cotton ball/pom-pom] as your bee's body. Dip it into the flour or powdered sugar to pick up the 'pollen.'\"\n\n3. \"Now fly your bee to a paper flower. Gently touch the flower with your pollen-covered brush. What happens? What sticks to the flower?\"\n\n4. \"Visit 3-4 different flowers. Each time, notice if the pollen transfers to the flower.\"\n\n5. \"Now look at your hands. Look at your brush. Look at the flowers. What do you observe?\" (Students will notice pollen is now on the flowers, that it spreads from one place to another, that it sticks to the flower centers.)\n\n6. **Documentation:** Have students draw or write in their science notebooks:\n   - What did the brush pick up from the first flower?\n   - What happened when you touched the other flowers?\n   - Where did the pollen go?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the pollen now? Is it still on your brush? Where else is it?\" \n- Do NOT explain pollination—let students discover through handling.\n- Encourage observation using hand lenses to see pollen grains up close.\n- Keep the activity playful and sensory.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that a fuzzy object (brush/pom-pom) picks up powder easily.\n- Students observe that powder transfers from one place to another when the fuzzy object touches multiple surfaces.\n- Students document their observations in words, drawings, or simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The photograph from the Engage phase\n- Pictures or diagrams of bee body parts (antennae, compound eyes, fuzzy body, legs, wings, proboscis/tongue)\n- Simple diagram showing the pollination process\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover in your exploration? What did you learn about how the pollen moves?\"\n   - Call on several students to share their observations.\n   - Record key discoveries on chart paper (e.g., \"Pollen sticks to fuzzy things,\" \"Pollen moves from flower to flower,\" \"The powder gets on different parts\").\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary and Concepts (10 minutes):**\n   - Return to the photograph. Say: \"This is a real bee, and it was doing the same thing you just discovered!\"\n   - Introduce and define vocabulary:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Pollen** | Tiny powder-like particles inside flowers that help make new plants. |\n| **Pollination** | When pollen moves from one flower to another, helping the flower make seeds. |\n| **Bee** | An insect with a fuzzy body, wings, and special body parts that help it collect pollen and nectar. |\n| **Nectar** | A sweet liquid inside flowers that bees drink for food. |\n| **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and do important jobs. |\n\n3. **Make Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the bee in the photograph. \"See how fuzzy the bee is? That's an adaptation. The fuzz picks up pollen, just like your brush did. But the bee's fuzz helps the flower make seeds!\"\n   - Point to the flower. \"The flower is bright purple with lots of petals. That's also an adaptation. The bright color attracts bees so they'll visit and help pollinate.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why does the bee visit the flower? Why does the flower need the bee?\" (Bee: to get nectar and pollen for food. Flower: to get pollinated so it can make seeds.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can someone use the word 'pollen' in a sentence about what we discovered?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why is the bee's fuzzy body important for the flower?\"\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if there were no bees to visit flowers?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that pollen is a real substance with a purpose.\n- Students recognize that bee and flower traits are adaptations for pollination.\n- Students can explain a simple relationship: bees need nectar, flowers need pollination.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by creating a model.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper (8.5\" × 11\" or larger)\n- Colored pencils, crayons, or markers\n- Glue sticks\n- Pre-cut or traced images of bees and flowers (or students draw their own)\n- Yarn, string, or arrows (to show pollen movement)\n- Optional: labels and sentence strips\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario/Real-World Connection:**\n\"A farmer wants to grow lots of pumpkins. Pumpkins need bees to pollinate them. Let's create a diagram that shows how a bee pollinates a pumpkin flower so the farmer can grow lots of pumpkins.\"\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Draw or glue a pumpkin flower on your paper.\"\n\n2. \"Draw or glue a bee on the flower.\"\n\n3. \"Use a marker or yarn to show the pollen moving from the flower to the bee's body.\"\n\n4. \"Use another arrow or yarn to show the pollen moving from the bee to another flower (or the same flower).\"\n\n5. \"Label the parts if you can: bee, flower, pollen.\"\n\n6. \"Below your diagram, write or draw a sentence that explains what the bee is doing and why the flower needs it. Example: 'The bee gets nectar. The pollen sticks to the bee. The bee carries it to another flower.'\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide sentence starters: \"The bee is... The pollen helps... Without bees, the flowers would...\"\n- Encourage students to use vocabulary from the Explain phase.\n- Ask: \"Can you show where the pollen goes?\" and \"Why is that important?\"\n- Allow students to use drawings if writing is challenging.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual model showing the relationship between bee and flower.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that pollen moves and serves a purpose.\n- Students apply vocabulary in written or illustrated form.\n- More advanced students may add details like \"the bee's fuzzy body\" or \"nectar\" to their models.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pollination and organism relationships.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the lesson):**\n- Circulate during Explore: Do students observe pollen transfer? Can they describe what's happening?\n- Listen to explanations in Explain phase: Can students define pollen and explain why bees visit flowers?\n- Review Elaborate models: Do diagrams show pollen movement? Are labels or descriptions accurate?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (End of lesson):**\n\nProvide students with a simple graphic organizer or ask them to respond (verbally, drawn, or written) to these prompts:\n\n1. **\"Look at the bee in the photograph again. Draw or write: What part of the bee's body helps it collect pollen?\"** \n   - *Success Criteria:* Student identifies fuzzy body or mentions fuzz/hair sticking to pollen.\n\n2. **\"Why is it important for the bee to visit the flower?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student mentions nectar, pollen, or food (bee's need).\n\n3. **\"Why is it important for the flower to have the bee visit?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student mentions pollination, seeds, or reproduction (flower's need).\n\n4. **\"If there were no bees, what might happen to the flowers?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student predicts that flowers wouldn't be pollinated, wouldn't make seeds, or wouldn't reproduce.\n\n**Scoring Guide:**\n- **Advanced:** Student answers all four questions accurately with details and uses science vocabulary.\n- **Proficient:** Student answers 3-4 questions with general understanding and some vocabulary use.\n- **Developing:** Student answers 1-2 questions with partial understanding; needs clarification or reteaching on one concept.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify at least two reasons bees and flowers need each other.\n- 75% of students can use the word \"pollen\" correctly in a sentence or diagram.\n- Students can predict what would happen without pollinators, showing causal reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards:** Provide picture cards for \"bee,\" \"flower,\" \"pollen,\" and \"nectar.\" Allow students to match cards to parts of the photograph rather than writing definitions.\n\n2. **Sentence starters with visuals:** For the Exit Ticket, provide multiple-choice responses or fill-in-the-blank sentences:\n   - \"The bee collects _____ from the flower.\" (pollen/nectar)\n   - \"The flower is bright purple so that _____ will visit it.\" (bees/insects)\n\n3. **Paired investigation:** During Explore, pair struggling readers/writers with a peer to co-investigate and co-document findings. Allow drawings instead of written labels in the science notebook.\n\n4. **Reduced model complexity:** For Elaborate, allow students to glue pre-cut images instead of drawing, and accept single-word labels instead of full sentences.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extended research:** \"Choose another animal that pollinate flowers (butterfly, hummingbird, beetle). Draw and label how its body is adapted for pollination. How is it different from a bee?\"\n\n2. **Real-world scenario:** \"A beekeeper wants to help more bees and flowers. What could she do? Draw or write your ideas.\" (Expected responses: Plant more flowers, don't use harmful chemicals, provide water, create bee homes.)\n\n3. **Complex relationships:** \"Some flowers are pollinated by wind, not bees. Compare a wind-pollinated flower to a bee-pollinated flower. Why do you think they look different?\" (Students research or observe images of grass flowers vs. showy flowers.)\n\n4. **Predictive thinking:** \"What might happen to our food if bees disappeared? Research or list foods that depend on bees for pollination.\" (Encourage connections to crops like almonds, apples, cucumbers, blueberries.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Pollinators Around Our School:**\n   - Take students on a supervised outdoor walk to observe flowers and look for bees, butterflies, or other pollinators.\n   - Have students sketch flowers they find and mark whether they see any insects visiting them.\n   - Return to class and discuss: \"Which flowers did we find? Did we see any pollinators? Why do you think some flowers had visitors and others didn't?\"\n   - Connection: This reinforces that pollination happens in real ecosystems and that certain flowers attract specific pollinators.\n\n2. **Create a \"Pollinator-Friendly Flower Garden\" Plan:**\n   - Provide pictures of different flowers (sunflowers, zinnias, marigolds, lavender, black-eyed Susans).\n   - Have students choose 3-4 flowers and create a simple garden layout on paper.\n   - Ask: \"Why did you choose these flowers? Will they attract bees? What colors are they? Are they clustered together?\" \n   - Connection: This applies learning to school or home gardening and deepens understanding of adaptation.\n\n3. **Bee Life Cycle Investigation:**\n   - Show pictures of bee life stages: egg, larva, pupa, adult.\n   - Discuss: \"Bees also have a life cycle like other animals. What do bees need at each stage? How does pollination help bees survive?\" \n   - Students create a simple life cycle wheel or poster showing bee stages.\n   - Connection: This extends to 3-LS1-1 (life cycles) and helps students understand why pollination is critical for bee survival and reproduction.\n\n---\n\n## Connections to Standards\n\n- **3-LS2-1:** This lesson demonstrates how bees form groups (colonies) and how their relationship with flowers helps both organisms survive.\n- **3-LS4-2:** Fuzzy bodies and bright flower colors are variations/traits that provide advantages—bees can collect pollen efficiently, flowers attract pollinators.\n- **3-LS4-3:** Bees can survive well in habitats with flowering plants; flowers require pollination to reproduce successfully in their habitats.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Safety:** Assure students that bees are not aggressive when they're visiting flowers. If using real flowers, ensure no allergenic species are used. If bees are observed outdoors, maintain distance and supervise closely.\n- **Sensitivity:** Some students may have bee phobias. Use the photograph and models as the primary teaching tool; outdoor observation is optional.\n- **Cross-curricular tie:** This lesson naturally connects to reading (informational texts about bees), math (counting flowers, pollen grains under a hand lens), and art (drawing and decorating flowers and bees).\n- **Timing:** This lesson works well in spring (when flowers bloom and bees are active) but can be taught year-round using photographs and collected specimens.",
