  "content": "# NGSS Engineering Design Process Challenge: Lizard Display & Protection\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n- A lizard (appears to be an anole or similar species) with gray and tan coloring on its head and body\n- A bright red and yellow dewlap (throat fan) extended below the chin\n- Rough, dry bark or wood branch the lizard is perched on\n- Sandy/rocky ground visible in the blurred background\n- Small pebbles and scattered woody debris in the habitat\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n- **From the extended red dewlap**: The lizard uses bright colors to signal or communicate with other lizards; a design must account for visibility and movement in a habitat with neutral tones.\n- **From the rough bark perch**: The lizard needs textured surfaces for grip and climbing; smooth surfaces would be inadequate.\n- **From sandy ground and rocky background**: The lizard's natural habitat includes loose materials and stones that provide shelter, camouflage, and temperature regulation.\n\n---\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2 Version:**\n*Design a cozy home for a lizard using sticks, rocks, and sand. Your lizard needs a hiding spot where it can rest, a branch to climb on, and a sunny spot to warm up. Test your design: Can your toy lizard fit inside? Can it climb the branch? Does it have shade?*\n\n**3-5 Version:**\n*Design and build a terrarium enclosure for a display lizard that meets these criteria:*\n- *Must include at least two different textured surfaces (bark, stone, sand) so the lizard can climb and hide.*\n- *Must provide a shaded shelter area (using natural or craft materials) that is at least 5 cm deep.*\n- *Must include an open basking area with clear visibility (to simulate the lizard's communication behavior).*\n- *The structure must be stable enough to hold a 50g weight (representing the lizard) without tipping.*\n- *Test it: Does water drain properly? Can you easily observe the lizard from one side?*\n\n---\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\n**Why this phase fits:** The photo shows a living creature in its natural habitat—a real-world context where students can identify actual needs (shelter, climbing surfaces, temperature regulation, visibility for mating displays). This phase invites students to ask: \"What does this lizard need to survive and thrive?\" before jumping to solutions. The visible behaviors and habitat structure prompt genuine inquiry rather than leading students toward a pre-determined answer.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Materials\n- Branches, twigs, or bark pieces (from outdoors or craft suppliers)\n- Sand or sandy soil\n- Small rocks and pebbles\n- Cardboard tubes or paper cups (for shelter)\n- Tape, glue, or hot glue gun\n- Shallow container or cardboard box (as the enclosure base)\n- A toy lizard or model (for testing, if live animals aren't available)\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Time\n**Two 30-minute sessions** (or one 60-minute session with breaks)\n- Session 1: Planning, gathering materials, initial building (20–30 min)\n- Session 2: Testing, observing, and refining the design (25–35 min)\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS 3-5-ETS1-1** (Define a design problem that can be solved by applying scientific ideas about animals, plants, structures, and/or processes) by grounding engineering in observable animal behavior and habitat needs, making the challenge meaningful and rooted in real science.",
