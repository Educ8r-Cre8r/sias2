Observe and describe how a snake's body color and patterns help it hide in its habitat.\n2. Identify two things that animals need to survive (shelter and safety).\n3. Explain why an animal's appearance can help it stay safe.\n4. Create or find their own hiding spot using camouflage ideas from nature.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student interest and activate prior knowledge by revealing the hidden snake in the photograph.\n\n#### Materials\n- Printed or projected photograph of the snake in dried leaves and wood\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pointer or stick (optional)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display Strategy:**\nProject or display the photograph on a board or screen. Do NOT immediately tell students there is a snake in the picture.\n\n**Engagement Hook:**\nShow the image and say: \"I have a mystery picture to show you. Something is hiding in this pile of leaves and sticks. Can you find it? Look carefully! It might be tricky to spot.\"\n\n**Discussion Questions (Calibrated for Kindergarten):**\n1. \"What do you see in this picture? What is it made of?\" *(Establish prior knowledge about leaves, sticks, nature)*\n2. \"Do you think anything might be hiding here? Why would an animal hide?\" *(Activate thinking about survival)*\n3. \"Can you find the snake? What color is it? How is it the same color as the leaves?\" *(Guide observation)*\n4. \"Why do you think the snake is the same color as its home?\" *(Introduce camouflage concept intuitively)*\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n\"I wonder how the snake uses its coloring to stay safe. Let's explore that mystery together!\"\n\n#### Transition\n\"Now we're going to play a hiding game to understand how snakes use their colors to stay safe — just like in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate camouflage through hands-on discovery using color matching and hiding games.\n\n#### Materials\n- Colored construction paper (brown, tan, green, yellow) — 1 piece per student\n- Colored paper cutouts of small animals (pre-cut or student-cut): snakes, lizards, frogs, caterpillars (2-3 per student, various colors)\n- Small classroom spaces: shelves, carpet areas, tables\n- Recording sheets with simple drawings (teacher-prepared, optional)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part 1: Camouflage Matching Game (10 minutes)**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n1. \"Each of you has a colored paper (this is your habitat — where an animal lives).\"\n2. \"You also have paper animal cutouts in different colors.\"\n3. \"Your job: Place each animal on the colored paper where it will be HARDEST to find. Which animal matches best?\"\n4. \"Try: a brown snake on brown paper, a green frog on green paper, and a green frog on brown paper. Which is easier to see?\"\n\n**Teacher Facilitation:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Can you easily see that animal? Why or why not?\"\n- Do NOT tell students which match best — let them discover.\n- Prompt: \"Which paper does your animal disappear into?\"\n\n**What Students Record:**\n- Teacher or student draws or points to which animal was hardest to find on each colored paper\n- Simple tally or circles to show \"easy to see\" vs. \"hard to see\"\n\n**Part 2: Classroom Hiding Game (12 minutes)**\n\n**Setup:**\nHide pre-made colored animal cutouts around the classroom:\n- Brown snakes in/near brown areas (shelf, bulletin board)\n- Green frogs on green posters or plants\n- Bright yellow snakes in open spaces\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. \"Your animal friends are hiding around the classroom!\"\n2. \"Can you find them? Which ones are easy to spot? Which are hard to find?\"\n3. \"Draw or point to show where each animal was hiding.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Observe which animals students find quickly vs. slowly\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"Why was that animal hard to find? What color was it near?\"\n- Do not explain — let them reason\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that colors matching the surroundings are harder to see\n- Students realize animals hiding in matching colors stay safer\n- Students begin using the word \"hide\" or \"same color\" to explain their findings\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce vocabulary and formalize the concept of camouflage as an adaptation for survival.\n\n#### Materials\n- Photograph displayed again on screen or board\n- Chart paper with large, simple drawings labeled with vocabulary\n- Real or high-quality images: snake, scale, camouflage, habitat (printouts or projected)\n- Student-friendly anchor chart to co-create\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\nFacilitate a brief class discussion:\n- \"What did you discover in the hiding games?\"\n- \"Tell me about an animal that was hard to find. What color was it? Where was it hiding?\"\n- Record student observations on chart paper with simple drawings and words\n\n**Formal Vocabulary Introduction (8 minutes):**\n\nIntroduce vocabulary with Kindergarten-friendly definitions and visual references:\n\n**1. Camouflage (KAM-uh-flahj)**\n   - **Definition:** \"When an animal's color or pattern matches where it lives, so it's hard to see. It helps the animal hide and stay safe.\"\n   - **Show:** Point to the snake in the photograph. \"This snake is camouflaged — see how it matches the dead leaves?\"\n\n**2. Scales (SKAYLZ)**\n   - **Definition:** \"Tiny, overlapping pieces that cover a snake's body. They protect the snake and help it move. The scales are often the same color as where the snake lives.\"\n   - **Show:** Display image of snake scales or point to scale-like pattern. Let students trace their fingers on a textured surface to feel what scales might be like.\n\n**3. Habitat (HAB-uh-tat)**\n   - **Definition:** \"The place where an animal lives. It has everything the animal needs: food, water, and safe places to hide.\"\n   - **Show:** Point to the dried leaves and sticks in the photograph. \"This is the snake's habitat.\"\n\n**4. Survival (sur-VY-vul)**\n   - **Definition:** \"Staying alive and safe. Animals need to hide, find food, and drink water to survive.\"\n   - **Show:** Mime hiding and say, \"When the snake hides using its color, it survives — it stays safe!\"\n\n**5. Pattern (PAT-urn)**\n   - **Definition:** \"Shapes and lines that repeat. Snakes have patterns (stripes, spots, squiggles) that help them match their habitat.\"\n   - **Show:** Draw simple snake patterns on board. Compare to leaf veins and wood grain in the photograph.\n\n**Connections Back to Photo & Explore (4 minutes):**\n- \"Remember when we found the brown snake hiding in brown leaves? That's camouflage! The snake's color matches its habitat to help it survive.\"\n- \"The snake's scales are the same color and pattern as the dead leaves — see the match?\"\n- Revisit the Explore hiding game: \"You were doing what camouflage does — you were hiding things that matched their background.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding (1 minute):**\n- Ask 2-3 quick questions:\n  - \"Show me with your hands: Is camouflage when an animal matches its home, or when it stands out?\" *(Students nod or shake heads)*\n  - \"Why does the snake need to hide?\" *(Accept responses: \"to be safe,\" \"so animals don't eat it,\" \"to survive\")*\n  - \"What color is this snake?\" *(Point to photo)* \"What is it hiding in?\" *(Point to leaves)*\n\n#### Vocabulary\n\n| Term | Kindergarten-Friendly Definition |\n|------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Camouflage** | When an animal's color matches where it lives so it's hard to see |\n| **Scales** | Tiny overlapping pieces that cover a snake's body |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives with food, water, and hiding spots |\n| **Survival** | Staying alive and safe |\n| **Pattern** | Shapes and lines that repeat on an animal or in nature |\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students can point to the snake in the photograph and explain it uses color to hide\n- Students use the word \"camouflage\" or \"hide\" to describe the concept\n- Students understand that animals need to be safe to survive\n- Students recognize patterns and colors in nature\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply camouflage concepts to new contexts and explore how other animals use color and pattern to survive.\n\n#### Materials\n- Picture cards of animals in their habitats (include: frog in pond, bird on tree, butterfly on flower, deer in forest, owl on branch) — color printed\n- Matching game sheets or real objects students can sort\n- Brown, green, and tan crayons or markers\n- White paper or pre-drawn animal outlines (simple snake, lizard, frog shapes)\n- Habitat images or cut-out backgrounds (leaves, grass, tree bark, flowers)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part 1: Camouflage Detective (8 minutes)**\n\n**Setup:**\nDisplay 4-5 animal pictures in their natural habitats.\n\n**Student Task:**\n1. \"Look at each animal. Does it match where it lives?\"\n2. \"Is it camouflaged? Or does it stand out?\"\n3. \"Point to the animals that hide really well.\"\n\n**Examples to show:**\n- Green frog on a lily pad (well camouflaged)\n- White polar bear on snow (well camouflaged)\n- Bright red ladybug on a leaf (stands out — not camouflaged)\n- Brown deer in a forest (camouflaged)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask: \"Why do you think this animal is easy to see?\" or \"Why is this animal hard to spot?\"\n- Guide students to notice color matching without explaining\n- Accept all reasoning — \"Because it's brown like the tree!\" is perfect\n\n**Part 2: Design Your Own Camouflaged Animal (10 minutes)**\n\n**Setup:**\nGive each student a pre-drawn animal outline (or they can draw a simple snake) and a habitat background (leaves, grass, rocks, etc.).\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. \"Your animal needs to hide in this habitat.\"\n2. \"Use crayons to color your animal so it matches where it lives.\"\n3. \"Make it camouflaged! Can your friends find it?\"\n\n**Differentiation Built In:**\n- Some students color matching colors; others add patterns\n- Some use pre-drawn animals; others draw their own\n- Some color on provided habitats; others cut and glue\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"What color is your animal?\" \"What color is its home?\" \"Do they match?\"\n- Take photographs of student work for documentation\n- Celebrate pattern-making and color choices\n\n**Sharing Circle (optional, within 18 minutes):**\n- 2-3 students share their camouflaged animals\n- Class tries to spot the hidden animal\n- Student explains: \"My snake is brown because it lives in...\"\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students create animals that match their habitats using color and/or pattern\n- Students explain why their animal is hard to see (color matching)\n- Students apply the camouflage concept to animals beyond snakes\n- Students demonstrate understanding that many animals use this survival strategy\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of camouflage, habitat, and animal survival needs.\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore phase:** Did students match colors correctly? Did they use words like \"hide\" and \"same color\"?\n- **Listen during Explain phase:** Do students use vocabulary in context? Can they explain why the snake is hard to see?\n- **Circulate during Elaborate phase:** Can students apply camouflage to new animals? Do they choose matching colors intentionally?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes):**\n\nChoose ONE format based on your class:\n\n**Option 1: Show & Tell (Visual/Verbal)**\nShow the original snake photograph and ask:\n1. \"Can you find the snake? Show me where it is.\"\n2. \"Why is the snake hard to find?\" (Listen for: \"color,\" \"matches,\" \"camouflage,\" \"hiding\")\n3. \"What does the snake need to survive?\" (Listen for: \"safe,\" \"hide,\" \"food,\" \"home\")\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student points to or describes the snake's location\n- ✓ Student explains it matches the leaves/background\n- ✓ Student names at least one survival need\n\n**Option 2: Pictorial Response**\nProvide a simple worksheet with three pictures:\n- A brown snake on brown leaves (camouflaged)\n- A blue snake on brown leaves (not camouflaged)\n- A frog partially hidden in grass (camouflaged)\n\nAsk: \"Circle the animals that are hiding really well. Why are they hard to see?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student circles camouflaged animals (pictures 1 and 3)\n- ✓ Student makes a mark or simple drawing showing understanding\n- ✓ Teacher can see student explains or points to \"color match\"\n\n**Option 3: Performance Task**\nShow the designed camouflaged animal from Elaborate.\n\nAsk:\n1. \"Tell me about your animal. Where does it live?\"\n2. \"Is it camouflaged? How do you know?\"\n3. \"Why does this animal need to hide?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies the habitat\n- ✓ Student recognizes colors match\n- ✓ Student states it helps the animal stay safe\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n**Evidence of Meeting K-LS1-1:**\n- Students observe and describe patterns: \"The snake is the same brown as the leaves.\"\n- Students use observations to explain what animals need: \"The snake needs to hide so it stays safe.\"\n- Students make connections between body features (color, scales) and survival (camouflage in habitat).\n\n**Kindergarten-Appropriate Success Indicators:**\n- Most students can locate the hidden snake in the photograph\n- Most students use color-matching language (\"same color as...,\" \"brown like...\")\n- Most students identify at least one survival need (safe, hide, or implied: food/home)\n- Students who create camouflaged animals show intentional color choices\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplify Vocabulary:**\n   - Use only \"hide,\" \"safe,\" \"same color\" language\n   - Skip formal terms like \"camouflage\" — focus on the concept\n   - Use gestures and actions: \"sneaky snake hides\" (make hiding motion)\n\n2. **Scaffolded Explore Activity:**\n   - Provide only 2 colors instead of 4-5\n   - Pair animals with obvious matches (bright yellow animal only goes on yellow background)\n   - Pre-sort one set so student sees correct matching, then repeats\n\n3. **Pre-Made Options for Elaborate:**\n   - Provide pre-colored animals rather than asking students to color\n   - Offer habitat backgrounds already cut and attached to paper\n   - Use picture cards instead of drawings for students who struggle with fine motor skills\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Exploration:**\n   - Ask: \"Can you find an animal in OUR classroom that is camouflaged? Where is it hiding? What color is it?\"\n   - Challenge: \"Design TWO different habitats for a snake. Should the snake be a different color in each home?\"\n   - Introduce: \"Some animals are NOT camouflaged. They are bright colors. Why might that be?\" (Springboard to warning colors)\n\n2. **Deeper Vocabulary & Concepts:**\n   - Introduce \"pattern\" explicitly; have students create patterned snakes (stripes, spots, squiggles)\n   - Connect to food chain: \"If the snake hides, what does that mean for the animals that eat snakes?\"\n   - Explore multiple habitats: \"What if this snake lived in a snowy place? Should it be white? Why?\"\n\n3. **Application & Creation:**\n   - Have students design a camouflaged animal for a habitat they choose (desert, ocean, forest)\n   - Create a \"Camouflage Hunt\" in the classroom where advanced students hide colored cutouts for peers to find\n   - Ask: \"Which survives better — the hidden animal or the bright one? Why?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### 1. **Snake Skin Rubbings & Texture Exploration**\nCollect bark, leaves, tree trunks, and stones from outdoors. Students do pencil rubbings to feel textures and see patterns. Connect: \"Snakes have bumpy scales like tree bark. How does that help them blend in?\" Create a class texture collage labeled with nature's camouflage patterns.\n\n### 2. **Habitat Walk & Camouflage Scavenger Hunt**\nTake students on a nature walk (schoolyard, park, or even a window observation). Challenge: \"Find something that is hiding because of its color. Is it camouflaged?\" Photograph findings and create a classroom book: *\"Things That Hide in Our Neighborhood.\"* Compare colors, patterns, and habitats.\n\n### 3. **Camouflage Story Circle & Role-Play**\nTell the story of a snake using the photograph: \"Once, a sneaky snake lived in these dead leaves...\" Students act out the snake hiding, moving, and staying safe. Expand story: \"Then a bird came looking for a meal. The snake was so well hidden, the bird flew away. The snake survived!\" Discuss: \"Why did the snake survive?\" (Because it was camouflaged.)\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
