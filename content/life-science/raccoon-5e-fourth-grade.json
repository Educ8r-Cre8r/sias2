Identify and describe at least three external body structures of a raccoon and explain how each structure helps the raccoon survive in its wetland habitat.\n2. Explain how a raccoon's senses (sight, touch, smell, hearing) help it gather information about its environment and find food.\n3. Create a detailed drawing or model that shows how a raccoon's body structures and senses work together to help it survive and behave in its habitat.\n4. Use evidence from observations and prior knowledge to construct a simple argument about why raccoons are well-suited to life near water and in trees.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the raccoon on the log\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen where all students can see it clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Ask students to \"Think-Pair-Share\"** their observations:\n   - Think: \"Look carefully at this animal. What do you notice about its body?\"\n   - Pair: Turn to a neighbor and describe what you see (30 seconds per person).\n   - Share: Call on 4-5 pairs to share one observation each. Record observations on chart paper under the heading \"What We Notice.\"\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (allow 5-10 seconds of think time before answering):\n   - **Question 1:** \"What do you think this animal uses the dark marking across its face for? Why might it have that pattern?\"\n   - **Question 2:** \"This raccoon is standing on a log next to water. What parts of its body do you think help it balance and climb on logs?\"\n   - **Question 3:** \"If you were this raccoon, how would your eyes, ears, and paws help you find food at night near the water?\"\n   - **Question 4:** \"What do you predict this raccoon might be looking for or doing at the edge of the water?\"\n\n4. **Record predictions** on chart paper. Use language like: \"Some of us think the raccoon might be looking for food. Some think it might be drinking water. Let's investigate to find out more!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Tomorrow, we're going to become raccoon scientists and discover how this animal's body parts help it survive. But first, let's explore what makes raccoons such amazing survivors!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- Printed copies of a labeled raccoon anatomy diagram (outline provided by teacher or from NGSS-approved sources)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- String or yarn (for tracing)\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but recommended)\n- \"Raccoon Detective\" recording sheets (see template below)\n- Printed photo of the raccoon from the lesson (1 per group)\n\n**Raccoon Detective Recording Sheet Template:**\n```\nRaccoon Detective Sheet\nName: ___________________ Date: ___________\n\nPart of the raccoon I'm studying: _______________\n\nDraw what you see:\n[Box for drawing]\n\nWhat do I think this body part helps the raccoon do?\n_________________________________________________\n_________________________________________________\n\nWhat information might this body part help the raccoon sense or feel?\n_________________________________________________\n_________________________________________________\n```\n\n**Activity – \"Raccoon Detective Stations\" (Hands-on Investigation):**\n\n1. **Set up 4 \"Detective Stations\"** around the room, each focused on a different raccoon feature:\n   - **Station 1: Eyes & Mask** – Students examine the eye position and marking\n   - **Station 2: Paws & Claws** – Students examine paw structure\n   - **Station 3: Ears** – Students examine ear shape and position\n   - **Station 4: Whiskers & Nose** – Students examine sensory features\n\n2. **Rotate students through stations** (5-6 minutes per station). At each station:\n   - Provide the printed photo and magnifying glass\n   - Students carefully draw what they observe on their Raccoon Detective Sheet\n   - Students predict what that body part helps the raccoon do\n   - Students write or draw one way that body part helps the raccoon sense its environment\n\n3. **During Station 2 (Paws)**, include this tactile experience:\n   - Students feel a leather glove or soft cloth to simulate a raccoon's sensitive paws\n   - They use their fingers to manipulate small objects (buttons, beads) to understand how raccoons can feel and manipulate food in water\n\n4. **Document discoveries** on individual sheets and on a shared \"Raccoon Adaptations\" anchor chart that you'll build throughout the lesson.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between stations, asking guiding questions: \"What do you notice? Why do you think the raccoon has that feature? How does it help the raccoon survive?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answers; use questions to guide their thinking.\n- Encourage students to make predictions: \"What would happen if a raccoon didn't have sharp claws?\"\n- Support struggling students by asking them to point to the feature and describe only what they see (not why), then ask: \"What might that help it do?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will complete observations at each station with drawings and predictions about function.\n- Students will begin to understand that body parts have purposes related to survival.\n- Students will make connections between visible structures and behaviors.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart (started in Explore phase)\n- Digital photo of the raccoon\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Optional: short video clip (2-3 minutes) of raccoons in natural habitat foraging (YouTube search: \"raccoon foraging behavior\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on the carpet** with their completed Detective Sheets.\n\n2. **Build the Anchor Chart collaboratively:**\n   - Title: \"How Raccoons' Body Parts Help Them Survive\"\n   - Create a three-column chart:\n     | Body Part | What It Does | Why It Helps the Raccoon |\n     |-----------|--------------|-------------------------|\n   - Invite students to share discoveries from each station\n   - Fill in the chart with their language first, then add/clarify scientific vocabulary\n\n3. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (write and display each term):\n   - **Adaptation**: A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment. Example: \"A raccoon's sharp claws are an adaptation for climbing and digging.\"\n   - **External Structure**: A body part on the outside of an animal that has a specific job. Example: \"Eyes, ears, and paws are external structures.\"\n   - **Sensory Information**: Information that animals collect using their senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste). Example: \"When a raccoon feels the mud with its paws, it's gathering sensory information about food.\"\n   - **Habitat**: The place where an animal lives. Example: \"A raccoon's habitat includes wetlands, forests, and areas near water.\"\n   - **Foraging**: Searching for and gathering food. Example: \"Raccoons forage at night near water for frogs and crayfish.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Point to the photograph and ask: \"Which body parts help this raccoon forage for food at night?\"\n   - Have students use \"thumbs up/sideways/down\" to show confidence in answering.\n   - Ask: \"How do a raccoon's paws and eyes work together to help it find food?\"\n   - Invite 2-3 students to explain in their own words.\n\n5. **Make connections explicit:**\n   - \"Remember when we predicted that the raccoon might be looking for food? Look at the chart—we can see it has eyes that see well, paws that feel carefully, and a nose that smells. These adaptations help it do exactly that!\"\n\n**Vocabulary Chart (display throughout unit):**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition | Example |\n|------|----------------------------|---------|\n| **Adaptation** | A body part or way of acting that helps an animal survive | Sharp claws help raccoons climb |\n| **External Structure** | A body part on the outside of an animal that does a job | Eyes, ears, paws, tail |\n| **Sensory Information** | Information animals collect with their senses | Feeling with paws, seeing with eyes |\n| **Habitat** | The home place where an animal lives | Wetlands near water for raccoons |\n| **Foraging** | Searching for and collecting food | Raccoons forage for crayfish at night |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define adaptation and identify examples from the raccoon.\n- Students understand that external structures have functions related to survival.\n- Students see that body parts and senses work together.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Blank paper or 8.5\" x 11\" cardstock\n- Colored pencils, markers, crayons\n- Optional: craft materials (yarn, fabric scraps, googly eyes) for 3D models\n- \"Raccoon Adaptation Cards\" (pre-made by teacher with scenarios)\n- Chart paper for anchor chart\n\n**Activity – \"Design a Survivor\" Challenge:**\n\n**Part A: Scenario Cards (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Prepare 4 \"What If?\" scenario cards** (read aloud to students):\n   - **Card 1:** \"A raccoon loses its sharp claws in an accident. How would this affect its survival? Which of its other body parts could help it survive?\"\n   - **Card 2:** \"A raccoon is in complete darkness at the bottom of a hollow tree. Which senses would be most helpful to find a way out?\"\n   - **Card 3:** \"A raccoon is trying to catch a small fish in muddy water. Which body parts work together to help it? Explain how.\"\n   - **Card 4:** \"A baby raccoon must learn to find food. Which of its senses would help it learn where food is hiding?\"\n\n2. **Place students in pairs.** Assign each pair a scenario card.\n\n3. **Pair discussion** (3 minutes): Students talk about their scenario and sketch what they think would happen.\n\n4. **Pair share-out** (1 minute per pair): Each pair shares their thinking. Encourage other students to add ideas: \"Do you agree? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Part B: Create a \"Raccoon Adaptation Poster\" (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Give each student a blank sheet** and ask: \"Choose ONE body part or sense of the raccoon that helps it survive. Draw or create a picture showing how it uses that feature.\"\n\n2. **Provide sentence stem** on the board:\n   - \"A raccoon's _____________ helps it _______________ because ______________.\"\n\n3. **Students create** their poster with:\n   - A clear drawing of the chosen adaptation\n   - Labels of the body part\n   - A caption explaining how it helps survival\n   - One example behavior (e.g., \"Raccoons use their paws to feel for crayfish underwater\")\n\n4. **Gallery walk:** Post posters around the room. Students do a silent walk and place a sticky note on a poster they find interesting, writing why.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate during pair work, asking: \"How do those body parts work together?\" and \"Why is that sense important at night?\"\n- During poster creation, prompt with: \"Can you show me HOW your raccoon uses that body part?\" and \"What would happen without it?\"\n- Celebrate thinking: \"I love how you connected the claws to climbing!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply learning to new scenarios and explain cause-and-effect relationships.\n- Students create a product that demonstrates understanding of structure-function relationships.\n- Students use evidence and reasoning to support ideas.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of learning objectives.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation of student responses at Detective Stations (Do they notice details? Do they predict functions?)\n- Thumbs up/sideways/down check for understanding during Explain phase\n- Quality of contributions during Elaborate scenario discussions\n- Use of vocabulary in student responses\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an \"Exit Ticket\" (can be digital or paper):\n\n**Exit Ticket – Version A (Draw & Label):**\n```\nRaccoon Survival Exit Ticket\n\nDraw a raccoon and label THREE body parts.\nFor each body part, write or draw how it helps the raccoon survive.\n\nBody Part 1: ________________\nHow it helps: _________________________________\n\nBody Part 2: ________________\nHow it helps: _________________________________\n\nBody Part 3: ________________\nHow it helps: _________________________________\n```\n\n**Exit Ticket – Version B (Short Answer):**\n```\n1. Name ONE external structure a raccoon has that helps it find food.\n   _________________________________________________\n\n2. Explain HOW that body part helps the raccoon survive.\n   _________________________________________________\n   _________________________________________________\n\n3. A raccoon uses its eyes AND its paws to catch food in water.\n   Why does the raccoon need BOTH of these body parts?\n   _________________________________________________\n   _________________________________________________\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they can:\n- ✓ Identify at least 2 external structures visible in the photograph (e.g., paws, eyes, ears, claws, whiskers)\n- ✓ Explain what at least ONE structure does (e.g., \"Claws help climb\" or \"Eyes help see at night\")\n- ✓ Make a connection between a body part and survival behavior (e.g., \"Paws help feel for food in water\")\n- ✓ Use vocabulary correctly (adaptation, external structure, habitat, or foraging at least once)\n\n**Data Collection:**\n- Collect exit tickets to determine which students need reinforcement\n- Students scoring below 2/4 criteria may need small-group review before moving to next unit\n- Students scoring 4/4 are ready for elaboration and extensions\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show students can identify structures and explain basic functions\n- Most students can make one explicit connection between structure and survival\n- Student language includes at least one key vocabulary term\n- Drawings and labels show careful observation skills developed during Explore phase\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### SUPPORT (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary & Sentence Frames:**\n   - Provide pre-made sentence stems and word banks during Explain phase\n   - Use simpler definitions: \"An adaptation is a special part of an animal's body that helps it live.\"\n   - Reduce number of vocabulary terms to 3 (adaptation, external structure, habitat)\n\n2. **Targeted Detective Station Support:**\n   - Assign a classroom aide or peer buddy to work with this group at the \"Paws & Claws\" station\n   - Provide pre-drawn diagrams with blanks to fill in rather than blank paper\n   - Ask lower-level questions: \"What color is this? What shape? Is it big or small?\"\n   - Move from observable features to function more slowly\n\n3. **Modified Exit Ticket:**\n   - Provide a modified exit ticket with sentence frames and picture options\n   - Read aloud the exit ticket questions\n   - Accept drawings without labels as evidence of understanding\n   - Example: \"The raccoon's _________ helps it _________.\" (paws, claws, eyes provided as choices; survive, climb, see provided as choices)\n\n#### CHALLENGE (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deep Comparison Activity:**\n   - Provide photos of other animals (beaver, otter, frog) that share the wetland habitat\n   - Ask: \"How are these animals' body parts similar or different? Why might each animal have different adaptations for the same habitat?\"\n   - Have students create a Venn diagram comparing raccoon and otter adaptations\n\n2. **Research Extension:**\n   - Direct students to research how raccoons' senses work together when foraging (e.g., how touch and smell combine)\n   - Ask them to write or present: \"Why do you think raccoons are considered 'intelligent' animals? Use what you learned about their senses and structures.\"\n   - Provide age-appropriate sources or guided research questions\n\n3. **Design Challenge:**\n   - \"Design an animal that could live in three different habitats (wetland, forest, urban neighborhood) like a raccoon does. What adaptations would it need? Draw and label your creation.\"\n   - Require students to justify each adaptation with evidence: \"Why did you choose that body part?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Nocturnal Hunter Simulation\" (Hands-on, 20 minutes)**\n   - Set up a darkened area with small objects (beads, pasta, buttons) scattered on a table\n   - Blind-fold students and have them try to find objects using only their hands (like raccoons using sensitive paws in dark water)\n   - Discuss: \"What did you learn about how raccoons might hunt at night without seeing everything?\"\n   - Connection to 4-LS1-2 (senses and responses)\n\n2. **\"Raccoon Habitat Diorama\" (Visual/Creative, 30-40 minutes)**\n   - Students create a shoebox diorama of a raccoon's wetland habitat\n   - Must include: water, vegetation, a log or tree (like in the photograph), and a raccoon figure\n   - Students label and identify 3 reasons why each element is important for the raccoon's survival\n   - Encourage students to explain their dioramas to classmates using vocabulary from the lesson\n\n3. **\"Daily Life of a Raccoon\" Comic Strip (Writing/Illustration, 30 minutes)**\n   - Students create a 4-6 panel comic showing how a raccoon uses its adaptations throughout the day (finding food, climbing, listening for danger, etc.)\n   - Each panel should show at least one body structure and explain what the raccoon is doing\n   - Students share comics and identify which adaptations are shown\n   - Supports 4-LS1-1 (structures supporting behavior)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Teacher Notes\n\n**Classroom Management Tips:**\n- Set clear expectations before Detective Stations: \"You will have 5 minutes at each station. When I ring the bell, rotate silently to the next station.\"\n- Assign a student timer or use a visual timer projected on the board.\n- Pre-assign station groups to ensure mixed-ability partnerships.\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart Display:**\n- Keep the vocabulary chart posted throughout the week for reference.\n- Point to it frequently during discussions: \"Remember our word 'adaptation'? Let's use it!\"\n\n**Connection to Prior Knowledge:**\n- Ask students: \"What animals have you seen at night or near water? What could they do with their bodies?\"\n- Build from animals students know (dogs, cats, squirrels) to the raccoon.\n\n**Safety Notes:**\n- When discussing claws and climbing, ensure students understand these are tools for animals, not models for human behavior.\n- If using magnifying glasses, review proper handling and set expectations before use.\n\n**Family Extension:**\n- Send home a \"Raccoon Observation Journal\" page: \"If you see a raccoon or learn about one, what body parts do you notice? What is it doing? How might its body help it do that?\"\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly engages students with the photograph, moves through genuine exploration and discovery, builds vocabulary and concepts systematically, and requires students to apply and defend their understanding. It is fully aligned with grade 4 NGSS standards and uses materials available in most classrooms.",
