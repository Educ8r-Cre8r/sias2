The plant has bright green leaves and is growing out of dark soil placed inside the bottle. You can see the plant's roots through the clear sides of the bottle. This is a fun science experiment that shows how plants can grow in different containers.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates plant growth and the basic needs of living things. Even though the plant is growing in an unusual container (a recycled bottle), it still has everything it needs to survive: soil for nutrients, water, air, and sunlight. The clear bottle acts like a mini greenhouse, trapping moisture and warmth to help the plant grow. This shows us that plants are adaptable and can grow in many different environments as long as their basic needs are met.\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Plant Needs**: Plants need soil (nutrients), water, air, and sunlight to grow and stay healthy.\n\n2. **Germination**: This is when a seed sprouts and begins to grow into a new plant.\n\n3. **Root System**: The roots you can see through the bottle help the plant get water and nutrients from the soil and hold the plant in place.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nHave students create their own bottle planters using recycled plastic bottles! Cut bottles in half, add soil and seeds (bean seeds work great), and observe growth over 2-3 weeks. Students can draw daily observations and measure plant height.
