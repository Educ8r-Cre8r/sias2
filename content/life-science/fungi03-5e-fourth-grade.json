Identify external structures of fungi (cap, gills, stem) and explain how these structures help fungi survive in their environment.\n2. Explain the role of fungi as decomposers in breaking down dead plant material and returning nutrients to soil.\n3. Describe the habitat conditions where fungi thrive (moisture, darkness, dead wood or leaves).\n4. Construct a simple argument using evidence from observations about why fungi are important to forest ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about decomposition and fungi using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copies of the photograph (one per student or small group) OR digital display via projector\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or distribute printed copies. Give students 30 seconds to silently observe without speaking.\n\n2. **Pose this initial mystery:** \"These are living things growing on dead wood. How do you think they got there? What are they doing?\" Allow 1-2 students to share initial thoughts without correction.\n\n3. **Ask these discovery questions:**\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this in your yard or on a forest walk? What did it look like?\"\n   - \"What do you notice about the shape of these organisms? What parts can you see?\"\n   - \"Why would these things grow on dead wood instead of on a healthy, living tree?\"\n   - \"If these living things are breaking apart the dead wood, where do you think all that wood goes?\"\n\n4. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** \"I'm wondering: Could a forest exist without these organisms? Let's investigate!\"\n\n5. **Record student observations and questions** on chart paper to revisit during Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"To understand what these organisms are and why they matter to forests, let's do some hands-on exploring.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposition and the role of fungi through a model-building activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 2 clear plastic cups or jars\n- Moist potting soil or compost\n- Dead leaves, small twigs, or bark pieces (collected beforehand or pre-bagged)\n- Damp piece of bread or apple slice\n- Water spray bottle\n- Labels and markers\n- Observation sheet (see below)\n- Optional: magnifying glasses\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Cup Setup:** Label two cups: \"With Decomposers\" and \"Without Decomposers.\"\n\n2. **Prepare Cup A (With Decomposers):**\n   - Add 3 inches of moist soil to the cup\n   - Layer dead leaves, small bark pieces, and a piece of damp bread or apple slice on top\n   - Mist with water so soil is damp but not soggy\n   - *Note to students: \"The mold and other decomposers will grow on these materials.\"*\n\n3. **Prepare Cup B (Without Decomposers):**\n   - Add 3 inches of moist soil\n   - Add the same dead leaves and bark\n   - Do NOT add the bread or apple slice\n   - Mist lightly with water\n   - *Note to students: \"We'll keep this one without extra decomposer food to compare.\"*\n\n4. **Placement:** Put both cups in a cool, dimly lit place (not in direct sunlight). Mist every other day to keep soil moist.\n\n5. **Observation Sheet (completed during and after the 5-7 day observation period):**\n   - Draw what you see in Cup A at Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, and Day 7\n   - Draw what you see in Cup B at the same time intervals\n   - Record: What do you notice growing? What's happening to the dead materials?\n   - Write: Which cup shows more change? Why?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups asking guiding questions: *\"What do you notice forming on the bread? Do you think it's alive? Why or why not?\"*\n- Do **not** tell students the answers; instead, redirect: *\"What would happen if we kept it warm and wet? What would happen if we dried it out?\"*\n- Ensure cups are kept moist but not waterlogged\n- Take photos of both cups on Days 1, 3, and 5 for comparison during Explain phase\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Cup A shows visible mold growth (white, green, or fuzzy) on the bread/apple and decomposition of leaves and bark\n- Cup B shows slower or minimal change\n- Students record observations showing progression of decomposition\n- Students begin to infer that something invisible or visible on the organic material is causing breakdown\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts about fungi and decomposition.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with \"Fungi\" written at the top\n- Images or labeled diagram of mushroom structures (cap, gills, stem)\n- Photographs from Explore phase (taken during the activity)\n- Original lesson photograph displayed again\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups: *\"What changed in your Cup A? What do you think caused those changes?\"*\n   - Record student observations on chart paper\n   - Ask: *\"Have you heard of mold or mildew? That's one kind of fungus!\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   Display each term with a student-friendly definition and a visual example or connection:\n\n   - **Fungi (plural) / Fungus (singular):** Living organisms that are neither plants nor animals. They get food by breaking down dead things, like the mold growing in your cup. *Point to the mushrooms in the photograph.*\n   \n   - **Decomposer:** A living thing that breaks down dead plants and animals into smaller pieces, returning nutrients to the soil. Fungi are decomposers! *Show Cup A mold as an example.*\n   \n   - **External Structures:** The parts of an organism you can see on the outside. Look at the mushrooms: they have a cap, gills underneath, and a stem. Each part helps the fungus do its job. *Point to each structure in the photograph.*\n   \n   - **Nutrients:** Special materials in soil that help plants and animals grow strong and healthy. When fungi break down dead leaves, they release nutrients back into the soil.\n   \n   - **Habitat:** The place where a living thing naturally lives. Fungi love dark, damp places—like forest floors and the sides of wet trees.\n\n3. **Connections Back to Photo and Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Revisit the original photograph: *\"These mushrooms are growing on dead wood in a dark, moist forest. They're breaking down the dead wood, just like the mold in your cups broke down the bread and leaves.\"*\n   - Compare: *\"In your Cup A, the decomposers (mold and other tiny fungi) made the materials disappear. In the forest, these mushrooms do the same thing to fallen trees.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Quick-response poll: *\"Thumbs up if fungi are alive. Thumbs sideways if you're not sure. Thumbs down if you think they're not alive.\"* (All thumbs should be up; address any misconceptions.)\n   - Ask: *\"If we didn't have fungi, what would happen to all the dead leaves and fallen trees in a forest?\"* (They would pile up and pile up; nutrients wouldn't return to soil.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Fourth Grade-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------------|\n| **Fungi** | Living organisms that break down dead things to get food; not plants or animals. |\n| **Decomposer** | A living thing that breaks dead plants and animals into smaller pieces and returns nutrients to soil. |\n| **External Structures** | The parts of a living thing you can see on the outside (like the cap and stem of a mushroom). |\n| **Nutrients** | Special materials in soil that help plants and living things grow strong. |\n| **Habitat** | The home or place where a living thing naturally lives (e.g., dark, wet forest floors). |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can name and identify the external structures of a mushroom\n- Students understand that fungi are alive and break down dead material\n- Students recognize that fungi play an important role in returning nutrients to soil\n- Students connect the mold in their cups to the mushrooms in the photograph\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of fungi to a new context and consider their role in ecosystems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or individual paper\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: Pictures of different forest habitats (decaying log, leaf litter, wet bark)\n- Optional: Real samples of decomposing material (bark with mold, decaying leaves) in sealed containers for safe observation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Ecosystem Detective (Recommended for most classes)**\n\n1. Provide students with a scenario: *\"Imagine a forest where all the fungi suddenly disappeared. What would happen?\"*\n\n2. In small groups, students create a **Cause-and-Effect Chain** on chart paper:\n   - Box 1: *\"No fungi to break down dead leaves and fallen trees\"*\n   - Arrow down\n   - Box 2: *\"Dead material piles up and doesn't return nutrients to soil\"*\n   - Arrow down\n   - Box 3: *\"Plants can't get nutrients to grow strong\"* (or similar conclusion students reach)\n   - Arrow down\n   - Box 4: *\"________ (what happens next?)\"*\n\n3. Groups present their chain to the class (1-2 minutes per group)\n\n4. Teacher guides: *\"You've just explained why fungi are SO important! They help keep forests healthy by recycling nutrients.\"*\n\n**Option B: Fungi Habitat Designer (For advanced/differentiated groups)**\n\n1. Show students pictures of different habitats: decaying log, leaf litter under bushes, damp basement corner, etc.\n\n2. Students choose one habitat and sketch or describe: \n   - Where fungi would grow in this habitat\n   - Why this location has the right conditions (dark? wet? dead material?)\n   - What structures fungi use to break down the material there\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: *\"Why did the fungi grow on the bread and not on the soil? What does that tell us about where fungi like to live?\"*\n- Encourage students to use their observations from the Explore cups: *\"Remember how mold grew on the damp bread? What do fungi need to survive?\"*\n- Validate all reasonable thinking and gently guide misconceptions: *\"Some people think fungi are plants because they grow from the ground. What did you observe that showed fungi are actually different?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students construct a logical cause-and-effect chain showing the importance of fungi\n- Students explain that fungi need specific habitat conditions to survive (moisture, darkness, dead material)\n- Students articulate why ecosystems need decomposers\n- Students apply vocabulary (decomposer, nutrients, habitat, external structures) correctly in new contexts\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fungi, decomposition, and ecosystem roles.\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n\n- **Observation cups (Days 1-5):** Review student observation sheets for evidence that they noticed changes over time and recorded what they saw\n- **Vocabulary check during Explain:** Listen to student responses to quick-response polls and thumbs-up/down checks\n- **Questioning during Elaborate:** Note which students can explain cause-and-effect relationships and use vocabulary correctly\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (End of Session 2)**\n\nProvide each student with a card. They respond to **one or more** of the following prompts (adjust based on your students' writing level):\n\n**Option 1 (Short Answer):**\n- *\"What is one external structure of a fungus and what does it do?\"*\n- *\"Why do fungi grow on dead wood instead of on living trees?\"*\n- *\"Name one reason why forests need fungi.\"*\n\n**Option 2 (Illustration with Labels):**\n- Draw a mushroom and label its external structures (cap, gills, stem)\n- Draw or describe a good habitat for fungi to live in\n\n**Option 3 (Argument with Evidence):**\n- *\"Do you think fungi are important to a forest? Use what you observed in your cup and what you learned to explain your answer.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student correctly identifies at least 2 external structures of fungi, explains their function, AND describes fungi's role as a decomposer\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student identifies 1-2 structures and shows beginning understanding of decomposition\n\n✓ **Beginning:** Student identifies fungi structures but cannot yet explain their function or role in ecosystems\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students demonstrate understanding that fungi have external structures with specific functions\n- Students explain that fungi are decomposers that break down dead material\n- Students make connections between the photograph, their observation cups, and ecosystem roles\n- Students use vocabulary (fungi, decomposer, nutrients, habitat, external structures) accurately in written or verbal responses\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a large, illustrated chart with pictures and simple definitions of all five key vocabulary terms. Keep it posted throughout the lesson for reference. Pair struggling readers with a buddy who can read aloud.\n\n2. **Guided Observation:** During Explore, provide struggling learners with a **partially completed observation sheet** with sentence frames:\n   - *\"On Day 1, I see _____ growing on the ___.\"*\n   - *\"The dead leaves look _____ now.\"*\n   - This supports them in noticing changes without the cognitive load of starting from scratch.\n\n3. **Structured Exit Ticket:** Offer **multiple-choice or image-based options** for the exit ticket instead of open-ended responses:\n   - *\"Which is an external structure of a mushroom? a) Cap b) Roots c) Leaves\"*\n   - *\"Does fungi help or hurt a forest? Show with a thumbs up or thumbs down and say why in one sentence.\"*\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Fungal Network Research:** Ask advanced students to investigate and present on **mycelium—the underground network of fungi** that extends beyond what we can see. Provide guiding questions: *\"How might fungi communicate or share nutrients through the soil? Why is this important?\"* (Connects to real-world topic of \"the wood wide web.\")\n\n2. **Comparative Decomposition:** Have students design an experiment comparing decomposition rates under different conditions (cold vs. warm, wet vs. dry). Predict outcomes and explain using their understanding of fungi's habitat needs.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Role Extension:** Challenge students to create a food web or energy flow diagram showing fungi's position in the ecosystem. Include: *dead plants → fungi → soil nutrients → living plants*. Ask: *\"Without fungi, could this cycle work?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Forest Floor Terrarium:** Have students create a long-term observation terrarium using a clear plastic container, soil, dead leaves, small twigs, and a damp cloth. Cover loosely and observe weekly for 2-3 weeks to watch decomposition and fungal growth in real time. Students keep a journal with sketches and predictions. (Great for early finishers or a take-home project.)\n\n2. **Fungi Detective Walk:** Take students on a short nature walk (schoolyard, park, or neighborhood) to hunt for evidence of fungi and decomposition. Have them photo-document or sketch: fallen logs with mushrooms or mold, leaf litter breaking down, or tree bark with fungal growth. Back in class, create a poster: *\"Fungi in Our Community: Where We Found Decomposers.\"*\n\n3. **Nutrient Cycle Model:** Students create a paper or digital poster or model showing how nutrients cycle through a forest:  \n   *Living Plants → Death/Fall → Fungi Decompose → Nutrients Return to Soil → Plants Grow.*  \n   Include labels of external structures of fungi and key vocabulary. Display in the hallway as a teaching tool for other classes.\n\n---\n\n**Notes for Implementation:**\n\n- **Timing for Cup Observations:** Start cups on Day 1 of the lesson, but students will observe visible changes by Days 3-5. If you have limited time, take photos yourself and show progression on subsequent days, or extend observations into the following week.\n- **Safety:** Ensure students do NOT touch or taste any materials in cups. If using real mushrooms, handle only with gloves and wash hands thoroughly afterward. Do not eat any fungi students find.\n- **Connections to Future Learning:** This lesson lays groundwork for later units on ecosystems, food webs, and nutrient cycles. Reference fungi during those units: *\"Remember our decomposers?\"*",
