ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image (fungi02.jpeg) or printed copies (one per student pair)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"Wonder Board\" (a designated wall space or paper anchor chart)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or distribute printed images to student pairs. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation time. Say: *\"Take a good look at this picture. Don't talk yet—just observe.\"*\n\n2. **Launch the discussion** with these guided questions:\n   - *\"What do you notice in this picture? Describe what you see without naming it.\"* (Listen for: yellow/tan objects, umbrella-like shapes, thin stems, growing on wood, different sizes)\n   - *\"Have you ever seen something like this in your yard, park, or forest? What was it called?\"* (Guide toward \"mushroom\" or \"fungus\")\n   - *\"Do you think these yellow objects are alive? Why or why not?\"* (Listen for reasoning about growth, structure, living in nature)\n   - *\"What do you wonder about how these mushrooms got there and why they grow on old wood?\"* (Encourage predictions and questions)\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** *\"In this lesson, you're going to discover that mushrooms are special living things with structures that help them do their job. Before we start, write or draw one prediction: What do you think mushrooms do in nature? Why might they be important?\"* \n\n   Have students share predictions aloud and record key ideas on the Wonder Board (e.g., *\"They might be food,\" \"They help plants grow,\" \"They break down dead things\"*).\n\n**Transition:** *\"Great predictions! Now we're going to explore mushrooms up close and act like scientists to understand these mysterious living things.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per student pair):**\n- Fresh or high-quality photo printouts of the mushroom image (color, large format if possible)\n- Hand lens or magnifying glass\n- Rulers (metric and standard)\n- \"Mushroom Investigation Worksheet\" (see template below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: real mushrooms (purchased from grocery store, gilled varieties) in sealed containers for safe observation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Detailed Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** to each student pair. Assign roles: one student is the \"Observer\" (uses hand lens and describes), the other is the \"Recorder\" (draws and writes).\n\n2. **Give these step-by-step directions:**\n   - *\"Using your hand lens, look closely at ONE mushroom in your image. Start at the bottom and work your way to the top.\"*\n   - *\"Find the thin part connecting the mushroom to the wood. What shape is it? Draw it on your worksheet.\"*\n   - *\"Now look at the top part—the umbrella or cap. What color is it? What texture do you feel (if using a real mushroom)? Does it look smooth or bumpy? Sketch it.\"*\n   - *\"Measure the height of the stem using your ruler. Write the measurement.\"*\n   - *\"Look at the mushrooms around your main one. Are they all the same size? Why might some be bigger than others?\"*\n\n3. **Record observations** on the **Mushroom Investigation Worksheet** (students sketch and label):\n   - Cap (top part)\n   - Stem (middle part)\n   - Base (where it connects to the wood)\n   - Three observations about color, shape, and size\n\n**Part B: Comparison and Prediction (10 minutes)**\n\n4. **Compare sizes:** Have students identify the smallest and largest mushroom in the photograph. Estimate: *\"If the smallest is a baby mushroom and the largest is a grown-up mushroom, what do you think happens in between?\"* (Guide toward understanding growth/life stages)\n\n5. **Habitat observation:** *\"All these mushrooms are growing on wood. Look closely—is the wood alive or dead? How can you tell?\"* (Students should notice the wood is dark, broken down, and not green like living wood)\n\n6. **Predict function:** *\"What do you think the mushroom's job might be? Is it eating the wood, helping the wood, or something else? Write or draw your prediction.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between pairs and listen to their observations without correcting.\n- Ask follow-up questions: *\"What else do you notice?\" \"How is this one different from that one?\" \"What does that tell you?\"*\n- Do NOT provide answers; guide observation with open-ended prompts.\n- Ensure all students get a turn to observe closely.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Detailed sketches and labels of mushroom parts\n- Measurements of at least one mushroom\n- Written observations noting size variation and growing on dead wood\n- Predictions about mushroom function and growth\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Projected image of the mushrooms\n- Vocabulary cards (with images) for: **fungus, decomposer, cap, stem, spores, organism**\n- Student copies of \"Mushroom Anatomy\" labeled diagram\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share ONE observation they made. Record key findings on chart paper as a \"Class Discovery List.\"\n   - Ask: *\"What did most of you notice about the mushroom shapes? The sizes? Where they were growing?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   Present each term with visuals and student-friendly definitions:\n\n   - **Fungus (plural: fungi)** – *\"A living thing that is NOT a plant and NOT an animal. It has special structures that help it live and grow. Mushrooms are a type of fungus.\"*\n   \n   - **Decomposer** – *\"A living organism whose job is to break down and recycle dead things in nature. Think of decomposers as nature's recyclers!\"*\n   \n   - **Cap** – *\"The umbrella-shaped top part of a mushroom. It protects the important parts inside.\"*\n   \n   - **Stem** – *\"The thin, stick-like part that holds up the cap. It's like a mushroom's skeleton.\"*\n   \n   - **Spores** – *\"Tiny, tiny particles (smaller than seeds) that fungi release to make new fungi. They're like fungus babies that float in the air.\"*\n   \n   - **Organism** – *\"Any living thing—plants, animals, fungi, and more.\"*\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the image: *\"These yellow things are called mushrooms. They are fungi—living organisms. See how they have caps and stems? Those are special structures. The cap protects what's inside, and the stem holds it up so the mushroom can release spores into the air.\"*\n   \n   - *\"Notice they're growing on that old, dark wood? That's a clue! Mushrooms are decomposers. That means their job is to break down dead wood and turn it back into soil. They're nature's cleanup crew!\"*\n   \n   - *\"Look at the different sizes. That big one is older, and those tiny ones are babies. They're growing just like you do!\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: *\"Can someone tell me in their own words: What is a decomposer and why is a mushroom one?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"What are the two main external structures you see on every mushroom?\"* (Cap and stem)\n   - Thumbs-up/sideways/down check: *\"Do you feel like you understand what fungi are and why they need those structures?\"*\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (Display and Keep Posted):**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|-----|\n| **Fungus** | A living thing with special structures; not a plant, not an animal |\n| **Decomposer** | An organism that breaks down dead things and recycles them in nature |\n| **Cap** | The umbrella-shaped top of a mushroom that protects the spore-making parts |\n| **Stem** | The thin part that holds up the cap |\n| **Spores** | Tiny fungus \"babies\" that float in the air to make new fungi |\n| **Organism** | Any living thing |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and label mushroom structures (cap, stem).\n- Students understand that fungi are living organisms with specialized structures.\n- Students can explain that mushrooms are decomposers that break down dead material.\n- Students grasp that different sizes indicate growth over time.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Fungi Role-Play Cards\" (prepared ahead—see below)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: images of different fungi types (shelf fungus, puffball, morels)\n- **Mushroom Life Cycle Diagram** (partially filled in; students complete)\n\n**Activity: Mushroom Life Cycle and Ecosystem Role**\n\n**Option A: Life Cycle Sequencing (Recommended for whole class)**\n\n1. **Present four stages of mushroom growth** (display images or draw on board):\n   - Stage 1: A spore lands on dead wood\n   - Stage 2: The fungal network grows underground/within the wood (invisible)\n   - Stage 3: The mushroom pushes up from the wood (what we see in the photo)\n   - Stage 4: Mushroom releases spores into the air; the cycle continues\n\n2. **Provide each student pair with four cards** showing these stages (in scrambled order).\n\n3. **Task:** *\"Arrange these cards in the order you think they happen. Remember: the tiny mushrooms you saw in the picture were at different stages. Use what you learned.\"*\n\n4. **Debrief:** Walk through the correct sequence. Ask: *\"Which stage was the baby mushroom? Which stage was the grown-up? What comes after the grown-up dies?\"*\n\n**Option B: Decomposer Detective (Alternative activity)**\n\n1. **Distribute \"Fungi Role-Play Cards\"** (one scenario per pair):\n   - Card 1: A mushroom's job (breaking down fallen tree)\n   - Card 2: A human's role (noticing the mushroom and learning from it)\n   - Card 3: An animal's role (maybe eating the mushroom or spreading spores)\n\n2. **Ask:** *\"If this mushroom wasn't here, what would happen to the dead wood? Where would it go?\"*\n\n3. **Have pairs act out or draw:** How the mushroom helps the forest by decomposing, and why that matters.\n\n**Option C: Habitat Requirements Exploration**\n\n1. **Show or display:** *\"Mushrooms don't grow everywhere. They need special conditions. Based on what you saw in the photo, what do you think mushrooms need to survive?\"*\n\n2. **Guide students to identify:** Dead wood, moisture, darkness (under the wood), warmth.\n\n3. **Create a \"Mushroom Needs\" anchor chart together.**\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion without providing direct answers.\n- Ask: *\"Why would a mushroom need that? How does it help the organism?\"*\n- Challenge advanced students: *\"If you removed the wood, what would happen to the mushroom?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students sequence the mushroom life cycle correctly and can explain each stage.\n- Students articulate why decomposers are important to ecosystems.\n- Students identify habitat requirements for fungi.\n- Evidence of deepening understanding about fungal function and structures.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Did students accurately observe and sketch mushroom structures? Did they measure and compare sizes?\n- **Check-for-Understanding questions during Explain:** Could students define key vocabulary and explain mushroom function?\n- **Participation in Elaborate:** Did students sequence the life cycle logically? Could they articulate ecosystem importance?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket**\n\n**Provide each student with an \"Exit Ticket\" (printed or digital).** Students respond to ALL three questions:\n\n1. **Structure & Function (addresses 4-LS1-1):**\n   *\"Look at this mushroom cap and stem. Explain WHY a mushroom needs both of these parts to survive and make new fungi. Use the word 'spores' in your answer.\"*\n   \n   **Success Criteria:** \n   - Student identifies both cap and stem.\n   - Student explains that the cap protects/holds spores.\n   - Student explains that the stem holds up the cap.\n   - Student uses the word \"spores\" correctly.\n\n2. **Organism & Growth:**\n   *\"Is a mushroom alive? Give TWO reasons from what you learned today.\"*\n   \n   **Success Criteria:**\n   - Student says \"yes,\" it is alive.\n   - Student provides at least two reasons from: grows over time, has structures, decomposes, reproduces (releases spores), responds to its habitat.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Role:**\n   *\"Mushrooms are decomposers. Explain what a decomposer does and why forests need them.\"*\n   \n   **Success Criteria:**\n   - Student defines decomposer (breaks down dead things).\n   - Student explains the benefit (recycles nutrients, makes soil, cleans up).\n\n**Optional Performance-Based Assessment:**\n- **Mushroom Observation Drawing:** Have students create a labeled diagram of a mushroom from memory, labeling at least 3 parts (cap, stem, base, spores if desired) with descriptions of each part's function.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 70% or more of students correctly answer at least 2 of 3 exit ticket questions with clear reasoning.\n- Students can name at least two mushroom structures and explain their function.\n- Students understand mushrooms as living decomposers with life cycles.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Provide a word bank:** During exit ticket and worksheet completion, offer a list of vocabulary and sentence starters:\n   - *\"The cap is…\"*\n   - *\"The stem helps by…\"*\n   - *\"Decomposers are important because…\"*\n\n2. **Pair with a stronger reader/observer:** During Explore, strategically pair students so the Observer role goes to a student who can describe in detail, and the Recorder pairs with a capable sketcher/writer.\n\n3. **Use real mushrooms (if available):** Allow struggling students to handle a mushroom safely in a sealed container. Tactile learners benefit from seeing 3D structures. Remind: *\"We're looking, not eating!\"*\n\n4. **Simplify life cycle task:** Instead of four stages, provide only two (tiny mushroom → big mushroom) and ask: *\"What happens first? What happens next?\"*\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deep-dive into decomposition:** *\"If a mushroom breaks down wood over months or years, what is actually happening to the wood cells? Where does the wood material GO?\"* Have students research or hypothesize about matter transformation. Connect to the idea that energy and matter cycle in ecosystems.\n\n2. **Spore dispersal investigation:** *\"Mushrooms release spores into the air. How do you think they travel? Design an experiment or model showing how spores from one mushroom might create mushrooms far away.\"* (Connect to wind, water, animals as dispersal mechanisms.)\n\n3. **Fungi diversity:** Show images of different fungal types (shelf fungi, puffballs, morels, cup fungi). Ask: *\"How are these different from the mushrooms in our photo? Why do you think fungi come in so many shapes?\"* Challenge students to infer that different structures help fungi survive in different habitats.\n\n4. **Ecosystem impact:** *\"What would happen to a forest if all the decomposers disappeared? Create a visual story board or comic strip showing the effects.\"*\n\n5. **Writing extension:** *\"Write a day-in-the-life story from the perspective of a mushroom. What does it sense? What is it doing? Why?\"* (Connects to 4-LS1-2 about organisms responding to their environment through senses.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fungi Field Journal Project (Homework/Take-Home)**\n   - *\"Over the next two weeks, look for mushrooms or fungi in your yard, park, or neighborhood. Take a photo or draw a picture. Write three observations about where it grew and what it was growing on. Bring your journal back to share with the class.\"* This extends the lesson into the real world and reinforces that fungi are everywhere. Students develop observation skills and connect learning to their local ecosystem.\n\n2. **Classroom Decomposition Experiment (Follow-up lesson, 2-3 weeks)**\n   - *\"Let's see decomposition in action!\"* Collect a small piece of dead wood. Place it in a clear plastic container with moist soil. Over 3-4 weeks, observe it regularly. Draw pictures and write observations. Does it break down? Do fungi appear? Students witness the decomposition process firsthand and understand the long-term role of fungi.\n\n3. **Mushroom vs. Plant Comparison Chart (Cross-curricular: Science + Language Arts)**\n   - Create a Venn diagram comparing plants and fungi. Students sort characteristics into: \"Plants only,\" \"Fungi only,\" and \"Both.\" Example characteristics: makes own food (plant), eats dead things (fungus), has structures (both), makes seeds (plant), makes spores (fungus). This deepens understanding of why fungi are NOT plants despite superficial similarities.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** If using fresh mushrooms, ensure they are store-bought and not foraged. Remind students never to eat wild mushrooms. Keep handling controlled and hands-washing mandatory.\n- **Visuals matter:** Fourth graders are visual learners. Use the photograph repeatedly, pointed out different details in each phase.\n- **Vocabulary persistence:** Post vocabulary anchor charts and refer back to them throughout the lesson and in future lessons. Repetition builds retention.\n- **Real-world connection:** Mention that students might see mushrooms in their yards after rain—and now they'll understand what they're looking at!\n- **NGSS alignment note:** This lesson addresses 4-LS1-1 (structures and functions for survival/reproduction) primarily. It touches 4-LS1-2 indirectly by having students observe how mushrooms \"sense\" and \"respond to\" their habitat (moisture, wood presence) through their growth toward the food source.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
