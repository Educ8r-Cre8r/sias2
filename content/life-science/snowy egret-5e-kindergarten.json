Identify and describe what a wading bird (egret) needs to survive using observations from the photograph.\n2. Recognize that animals have body parts that help them get food and stay safe in their habitats.\n3. Compare what a bird needs to survive with what they, as humans, need to survive.\n4. Use simple words to explain why an egret lives near water.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the egret and activate prior knowledge about animal survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital copy of the snowy egret photograph (large enough for whole class to see)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Small stuffed bird or toy bird (optional, for handling pass-around)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a board or screen where all students can see it clearly. Do not give them any information yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to observe silently** for 20–30 seconds. Say: \"Look carefully at this bird. What do you notice? What do you see?\"\n\n3. **Pose these discussion questions one at a time**, allowing 2–3 hands-up responses per question:\n   - \"What color is this bird? What do you think those long, thin legs are for?\"\n   - \"Where is the bird standing? What do you see around it?\" (Guide them to notice the water and rocks.)\n   - \"Do you think this bird is hungry? How might it find food in this place?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this bird came to this spot with water?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** Say, \"This is a real bird called a wading bird. I wonder... what does this bird need to live a happy, healthy life? Just like you need food, water, and a safe home, what do you think this bird needs?\"\n\n5. **Collect student predictions** on chart paper titled \"What Does a Wading Bird Need?\" Do not correct answers yet.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to explore and investigate to see what this bird really needs to survive!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate animal survival needs through a hands-on matching activity and movement exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards or paper (15–20 cards)\n- Pictures or drawings of: fish, water, rocks/sticks, nests, trees, bugs\n- Printed photograph of the egret (one per small group or access to the display)\n- Blue fabric, blue paper, or blue plastic sheet (to represent water)\n- Sandbox, kinetic sand, or floor space with tape to mark \"shallow water area\"\n- Observation clipboard (one per student or pair)\n- Pencils for marking observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Habitat Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide students into small groups of 3–4.\n\n2. Set up a \"water habitat station\" on the floor: Spread blue fabric or paper to represent water. Scatter picture cards (fish, rocks, nests, trees, bugs) around the habitat.\n\n3. Give each group **one copy of the egret photograph**.\n\n4. **Student directions:** \"Look at your picture of the bird. Now look at our water habitat area. What things in the habitat do you think the egret needs? Point to them and talk about why. Use your clipboard to draw or mark the things the egret would want here.\"\n\n5. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask clarifying questions: \"Why do you think the egret needs that?\" \"Where would the egret find food?\" \"What would the egret do on the rocks?\" Do not supply answers; guide thinking with questions.\n\n6. **Students record observations** by drawing or making tally marks on their clipboards.\n\n**Part B: Movement Exploration (8–10 minutes)**\n\n1. Bring the group back together. Create a shallow \"wading zone\" using blue fabric or a taped floor area.\n\n2. **Demonstrate slowly:** Walk through the \"water\" like an egret, lifting knees high to show how long legs help move through water. Pause to \"look for fish.\"\n\n3. **Student directions:** \"Let's pretend to be wading birds! Slowly walk through the shallow water. Lift your knees high like the bird's long legs. Stop and look down—can you 'see' the fish to catch?\"\n\n4. Have 2–3 students model at a time; others watch and comment.\n\n5. Ask: \"Was it easy to walk in shallow water? Did the long legs help?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify that the egret needs water, food (fish), and a safe place to rest.\n- Students understand that long legs help the bird move and find food in water.\n- Students record or draw observations linking body parts to survival needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of animal survival needs using the photograph as reference.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Large printed egret photograph\n- Word cards with pictures and labels (optional)\n- Real or toy examples: a stick (beak), a long straw (leg), blue water in a shallow pan\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations from Explore:** Ask groups: \"What did you find that the egret needs?\" Record responses on a fresh chart titled \"What This Bird Needs to Survive.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (point to the photograph as you define each):\n\n   | **Term** | **Kindergarten-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Habitat** | A place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs (like food, water, and shelter). |\n   | **Beak** | The hard, pointed mouth part of a bird that helps it catch and eat food. |\n   | **Legs** | The long, thin body parts that help the bird walk and wade through water. |\n   | **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy by getting the things you need. |\n\n3. **Make connections to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the beak: \"This egret's beak is long and pointy. Perfect for catching slippery fish in the water!\"\n   - Point to the legs: \"See how long and thin these legs are? They help the bird stand in water without sinking.\"\n   - Point to the water: \"The egret lives here near water because it finds fish to eat and a safe place to rest.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we took away the water, could the egret survive here? Why not?\"\n   - Ask: \"How is this bird's body special compared to other birds you know?\" (Guide them to notice the long legs and beak.)\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if this bird couldn't find fish?\"\n\n5. **Summarize:** \"Just like you need food, water, and a safe home, the egret needs food (fish), water, and a place to rest. Its special body parts help it get what it needs!\"\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (posted on board):**\n- **Habitat** — where an animal lives\n- **Beak** — the bird's mouth for catching food\n- **Legs** — help the bird walk and wade\n- **Survive** — to stay alive\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name 3 things an egret needs to survive.\n- Students can explain (in simple words) how the egret's body parts help it survive.\n- Students use vocabulary terms (habitat, beak, legs, survive) in responses.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of animal survival needs to compare different animals and habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of different habitats (forest, desert, ocean, grassland)\n- Picture cards of different animals (robin, squirrel, fish, butterfly)\n- Chart paper titled \"What Do Different Animals Need?\"\n- Optional: photographs of 2–3 additional wading birds (crane, heron, stilt)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Animal Matching (Recommended for Kindergarten)**\n\n1. Show students picture cards of 2–3 different habitats (forest, water, grassland).\n\n2. Display animals one at a time: a squirrel, a fish, a robin, a butterfly.\n\n3. **Student task:** \"Does this animal live in the same habitat as the egret (water)? Why or why not? What does this animal need to survive?\"\n\n4. Place animal pictures next to matching habitat cards as students discuss.\n\n5. **Facilitate discussion:**\n   - \"The squirrel lives in the forest. What does a squirrel need? Is it the same as the egret?\"\n   - \"The fish lives in water too. How is the fish different from the egret? What does it need?\"\n\n6. **Create a comparison chart:**\n   | **Animal** | **Habitat** | **Needs to Survive** |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | Egret | Water | Fish, water, rocks to rest |\n   | Squirrel | Forest | Nuts, tree, shelter |\n   | Fish | Water | Water, plants, smaller animals |\n\n**Option B: Wading Bird Exploration (For advanced learners)**\n\n1. Show photographs of other wading birds (great blue heron, black-necked stilt, sandpiper).\n\n2. Ask: \"How are these birds like the egret? How are they different?\"\n\n3. Discuss: \"They all live near water. They all have long legs and beaks. They all eat fish. Why do you think they all look similar?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** Guide discussion with questions rather than giving answers. Encourage students to use observations from the photograph and their Explore activity to make predictions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different animals need different things to survive.\n- Students apply the concept that body parts match an animal's habitat and needs.\n- Students can explain why the egret is suited to living near water.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of animal survival needs and the connection between body parts and habitat.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- During Engage, note which students make predictions about the bird's needs.\n- During Explore, observe whether students identify water, food, and shelter as necessary.\n- During Explain, track who uses vocabulary terms correctly.\n- During Elaborate, listen for explanations connecting body parts to survival needs.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5–8 minutes):**\n\n**Option A: Verbal Questioning (Best for Kindergarten)**\n\nAsk each student or small group these questions. Record their responses on an index card:\n\n1. \"What does the egret in the picture need to survive?\" (Listen for: water, food/fish, shelter.)\n2. \"What body part helps the egret catch fish?\" (Listen for: beak or mouth.)\n3. \"Why does the egret have long legs?\" (Listen for: to wade in water, to walk through water without sinking.)\n\n**Option B: Drawing and Labeling**\n\nProvide a simple line drawing of an egret or a blank paper. Ask: \"Draw or point to the parts of the egret that help it survive. Tell me why each part is important.\"\n\n**Option C: Photo Sorting**\n\nShow 4–5 pictures: egret in water, squirrel in tree, fish in water, bird in nest, butterfly on flower.\n\nAsk: \"Which pictures show animals in their habitat? Which animals need water to survive?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Students demonstrate understanding if they:**\n- Identify at least 2 things an egret needs to survive (e.g., water and food)\n- Name or point to the beak or legs and explain how these help the bird\n- Make a connection between the bird's body and its habitat (e.g., \"Long legs help it walk in water\")\n- Use at least one vocabulary term correctly (habitat, beak, survive, or legs)\n\n✓ **Students show partial understanding if they:**\n- Identify what an egret needs but cannot explain why\n- Name body parts but do not connect them to survival\n- Use vocabulary terms but with unclear meanings\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on 2 key terms only (beak, habitat). Repeat these terms multiple times and display picture labels throughout the lesson.\n\n2. **Provide sentence starters:**\n   - \"The egret needs _______________.\"\n   - \"The egret's ______________ helps it _______________.\"\n   - \"The egret lives in the _______________.\"\n\n3. **Use hand-over-hand modeling:** During the Explore movement activity, physically guide a student to walk like an egret, helping them feel how long legs help move through water.\n\n4. **Simplify the Explore task:** Instead of finding multiple items in a habitat, ask students to find just one thing: \"Point to the water. The egret needs water.\"\n\n5. **Allow drawing instead of writing:** Accept drawings or pointing to pictures as responses during the Exit Ticket.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extend to other wading birds:** Show photographs of herons, cranes, or stilts. Ask: \"How are these birds similar to the egret? Why do they all have long legs?\" Challenge students to make hypotheses about why birds with similar needs look alike.\n\n2. **Introduce food chains:** \"The egret eats fish. The fish eats smaller plants. What if there were no plants? Could the egret survive?\" Guide simple thinking about connected survival.\n\n3. **Compare to human needs:** \"We also need food, water, and shelter, like the egret. But we don't have beaks or long legs. Why? What body parts do WE use to get food and stay safe?\"\n\n4. **Design a habitat:** Provide materials (blue paper, markers, clay, small stones) and ask: \"Create a place where an egret could survive. What must you include? Why?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Wading Bird Walk (Outdoor/Movement Activity)**\n   - Take students outside to a field or gym. Mark a \"water zone\" with chalk or tape. Have students walk like different birds: waddle like a duck (short steps, low to ground), stride like an egret (long steps, knees high), hop like a sparrow (quick, bouncy). Discuss why different birds move differently. *Connects to:* body structure and adaptation.\n\n2. **Create a Bird Needs Poster (Art + Science)**\n   - Provide large paper and have students draw and label what an egret needs to survive: water (blue), fish (orange), rocks or trees (shelter). Display in classroom. Invite students to add more wading bird pictures as research continues. *Connects to:* summarizing and communicating learning.\n\n3. **Egret Beak Experiment (Hands-On Exploration)**\n   - Provide materials: chopsticks or sticks (beak), water table, small objects (fish crackers, pom-poms, beads). Ask: \"Can you pick up the 'fish' with your 'beak'? Which 'beak' works best? Why?\" Discuss how the egret's pointy beak is special for catching slippery fish. *Connects to:* tool use and adaptation.\n\n4. **Bird Habitat Sort (Center Activity)**\n   - Create picture cards of habitats (water, forest, desert, sky) and animals (egret, squirrel, eagle, camel). Students match animals to habitats and explain why. *Connects to:* habitat recognition and animal diversity.\n\n5. **Read-Aloud Pairing**\n   - Pair this lesson with picture books such as *Big & Little* by Steve Jenkins (compares animal sizes and body parts), *Feathers* by Kerrie Shanahan, or *Birds* by Kevin Henkes. Stop to connect book content back to what students learned about the egret.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Pacing:** Kindergarten students need frequent transitions and movement. Consider breaking this lesson across two 30–40 minute sessions: Engage + Explore on Day 1; Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2.\n- **Visual supports:** Use the photograph throughout all phases. Kindergarteners are visual learners and benefit from repeated reference to the image.\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Introduce vocabulary in Explain, but continue using the same terms in Elaborate and Evaluate to reinforce learning.\n- **Cultural responsiveness:** If students have experience with birds or wetlands in their own communities, invite them to share observations and drawings.\n- **Safety reminder:** If using a water table or blue fabric floor activity, ensure students do not drink water and supervise closely.",
