This photo shows fungi growing on dead tree material (decaying wood and bark).\n- **Diverse life in different habitats** — The forest floor (shown here with soil, stones, and fallen wood) contains many different organisms living together; fungi are one type adapted to this habitat.\n- **Observable structures and adaptations** — The umbrella-shaped caps with gills underneath are visible structures that help fungi release tiny spores to make new fungi.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**Mushroom Detectives: Discovering Fungi in Forest Homes**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 40-minute sessions (or one 75-minute session with snack break)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-LS4-1: Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Describe what fungi are and explain that they are living organisms (not plants or animals).\n2. Observe and identify where fungi grow in nature using the photograph as a model.\n3. Explain the role fungi play in breaking down dead wood and returning nutrients to soil.\n4. Compare fungi to plants and animals by noting their unique characteristics (no roots, no chlorophyll, grow on decaying matter).\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about mushrooms and fungi by using the photograph to spark questions about what mushrooms are and where they live.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of fungi on tree bark (one per student or enlarged poster for group)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"Wonder Board\" (designated space on classroom wall or whiteboard)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph.** Show students the image of the pale, umbrella-shaped mushrooms growing on dark tree bark. Ask them to observe for 30 seconds in silence, studying every detail.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions** (speak naturally, not robotically):\n   - \"What do you notice growing on this tree? What does it look like?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen mushrooms or toadstools like this in your yard or park? Where were they?\"\n   - \"Do you think these mushrooms came from seeds, like we plant in the garden? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What do you wonder about how these mushrooms got there?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge.** Ask: \"How is a mushroom like a plant? How might it be different?\" Record student ideas on the \"Wonder Board\" without correcting them yet.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt.** Say: \"Today, we're going to be mushroom detectives and find out what mushrooms really are and why they grow on dead wood!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore a forest habitat and search for clues about where fungi like to live and what they do.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students conduct a hands-on observation investigation to discover where and how fungi grow by examining photographs, natural samples (if available), and a simple model habitat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (one per student pair or small group)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per pair)\n- **Model habitat in a clear container:** A small glass jar or clear plastic container with:\n  - Damp soil or compost at the bottom\n  - Pieces of rotting wood or bark collected from outdoors (moistened)\n  - A few twigs\n  - Sealed with a lid (teacher prepared in advance)\n- Observation sheets (template provided below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: Small fresh mushrooms (store-bought) to safely observe (do not eat)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Photograph Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Provide each pair with a photograph.** Give students a magnifying glass and observation sheet.\n\n2. **Guided observation.** Say: \"Use your hand lens to look very carefully at the mushrooms. Draw what you see. Mark on your drawing:\n   - Where are the mushrooms growing?\n   - What are they growing on?\n   - What shape are they?\n   - What color are they?\"\n\n3. **Record observations.** Students sketch the mushrooms and label the dark tree bark, the pale mushroom caps, and the gills underneath (visible in the photo). They may label these parts or simply describe what they see in words or pictures.\n\n4. **Pair discussion.** Ask: \"Why do you think the mushrooms are growing *on the tree* and not floating in the air? What do they need?\"\n\n**Part B: Model Habitat Exploration (10–12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the habitat jar.** Hold up the sealed container with moistened wood/bark inside. Say: \"I made a tiny forest home with dead wood. This is the kind of place where fungi like to grow. Let's see what happens over the next few days.\"\n\n2. **Seal and observe protocol.** Explain: \"We're going to watch this jar for one week. Fungi need three things: dead wood (food), moisture (water), and darkness. Let's see if anything grows in our model.\"\n\n3. **Students predict and record.** Each student or pair writes or draws: \"What do I think will grow in this jar? Where will it grow?\" Display the jar in a dark corner of the classroom (e.g., a closet shelf or under a covered table).\n\n4. **Explain the wait.** Say: \"Fungi are very different from plants. We don't see them grow as fast, but they're hard at work breaking down the wood into tiny pieces. That takes time!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate while students observe the photograph, asking open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Why might it be growing there?\"\n- Avoid telling students the answers; guide them to observe carefully.\n- Prepare the model habitat before the lesson so it's ready to go.\n- Model proper use of the hand lens.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will draw detailed observations of the mushroom structures and habitat.\n- Students will predict where fungi grow (on dead wood, in moist places).\n- Students will understand that fungi need specific conditions to survive.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts about fungi, drawing on student observations from the Explore phase.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Printed vocabulary cards with images (see below)\n- The photograph (displayed again)\n- Anchor chart (to be created during this phase)\n- Optional: Real fresh mushroom for safe, tactile demonstration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out.** Invite 3–4 student pairs to show their drawings and describe what they observed. Ask: \"Where did you see the mushroom growing? What was it sitting on?\"\n\n2. **Introduce fungi vocabulary** using student-friendly language. Create an anchor chart as you teach:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Fungi (FUN-guy) / Mushroom:** A living organism that grows on dead or rotting wood and other things. It is NOT a plant and NOT an animal—it's its own special kind of life! (Point to photograph.) These pale caps on the bark are fungi.\n   - **Decompose / Decay:** When fungi break down dead wood into tiny, tiny pieces and help return nutrients (food for plants) back to the soil. Say: \"Fungi are like nature's cleanup crew!\"\n   - **Habitat:** A place where a living thing makes its home. The forest floor with damp soil, dark corners, and dead wood is a perfect habitat for fungi.\n   - **Spores:** Super-tiny particles that fungi release (like invisible seeds) to make new fungi grow. You can't see them, but they float through the air and soil.\n   - **Gills:** The ridges underneath the mushroom cap that help spread spores.\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph.** Point to the image and say: \"See these mushrooms? They're growing on the dark, wet bark. This dead tree is their home and their food. The mushrooms release millions of spores—too small to see—and those spores help make new mushrooms grow.\"\n\n4. **Compare organisms.** Create a simple comparison chart on the board:\n\n   | Feature | Plants | Animals | Fungi |\n   |---------|--------|---------|-------|\n   | Move around? | No | Yes (many do) | No |\n   | Need sunlight? | Yes | No | No |\n   | Eat dead things? | No | Some do | **Yes!** |\n   | Grow from seeds? | Yes | No | No (from spores) |\n\n   Say: \"Fungi are so special that scientists put them in their own group!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding.** Ask:\n   - \"Is a mushroom a plant? Why not?\" (It doesn't need sunlight; it grows on dead wood, not in soil with roots.)\n   - \"What job do fungi do in nature?\" (Break down dead wood and return nutrients to the soil.)\n   - \"If you found mushrooms in your yard, what would they be growing on?\" (Decaying wood, mulch, compost, dead leaves.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define fungi and explain they are NOT plants or animals.\n- Students understand that fungi decompose (break down) dead wood.\n- Students know fungi grow in damp, dark places on decaying matter.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of fungi habitats by exploring where fungi might live in the school or classroom and predicting what conditions fungi need.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clipboards and pencils\n- \"Fungi Habitat Hunt\" worksheet (template provided)\n- Camera or drawing supplies\n- Moist cloth or cotton swabs (for safe collection, if appropriate)\n- Optional: Real, fresh mushroom sample (store-bought) for comparison\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Indoor Habitat Hunt (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the task.** Say: \"Fungi love dark, damp places with rotting things. Let's hunt around our classroom and school to find places where fungi MIGHT like to live. You won't always see mushrooms, but you can spot the right habitat!\"\n\n2. **Provide hunting guidelines.** Give each pair or small group a \"Fungi Habitat Hunt\" worksheet with pictures of possible habitats to locate:\n   - Under a potted plant (dark, moist soil)\n   - In a bathroom (damp, dark)\n   - Under mulch or wood chips outside\n   - In a compost bin (if your school has one)\n   - Dark corner with a leaky pipe (very damp)\n\n3. **Student task.** Students walk around with their clipboards and:\n   - Locate one habitat from the list\n   - Draw or photograph it\n   - Mark on their sheet: \"Is it dark? Is it wet? Is there dead wood or decaying stuff?\"\n   - Write or draw: \"Why would fungi like to live here?\"\n\n4. **Bring back findings.** Return to the classroom and share discoveries.\n\n**Option B: Fungi Needs Demonstration (if outdoor exploration is not feasible)**\n\n1. **Use the model habitat jar** from Explore phase. Say: \"Remember our forest home in this jar? Fungi need three things to grow: dead wood, water, and darkness. Let me show you what happens if we take away one thing.\"\n\n2. **Set up three small containers with moist wood or bark:**\n   - Container 1: Sealed, in the dark (control—correct conditions)\n   - Container 2: In bright light (no darkness)\n   - Container 3: With dry wood (no moisture)\n\n3. **Predict.** Ask: \"Which container do you think fungi will grow in best? Why?\"\n\n4. **Observe over one week.** Check daily. Document observations with drawings or photos. Fungi should begin to appear first in Container 1 (dark + moist + wood).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Supervise outdoor/indoor exploration; prioritize student safety.\n- Ask probing questions: \"What makes this place dark? How do you know it's wet?\"\n- Do not allow students to handle fungi found in the environment (they may be toxic); observe and photograph only.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify places in their environment where fungi could grow.\n- Students understand that fungi thrive in dark, damp habitats with decaying matter.\n- Students apply their learning to real-world contexts.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fungi, their habitats, and their role in nature.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist:** Watch students during Explore phase. Can they:\n  - Use the hand lens correctly?\n  - Identify where mushrooms are growing in the photo?\n  - Make predictions about conditions fungi need?\n- **Think-Pair-Share questions:**\n  - \"Is a mushroom a plant? Explain your thinking.\"\n  - \"Why would you find mushrooms on the forest floor but not on the top of a sunny rock?\"\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper with the following prompt. Students can draw, write, or dictate to an adult:\n\n**Choose one:**\n1. **Draw a picture** of where you think mushrooms like to grow. Label: dark, damp, dead wood.\n\n2. **Answer these questions:**\n   - What is a mushroom? Is it a plant?\n   - Why do fungi grow on dead wood?\n   - If you wanted to find fungi, where would you look?\n\n3. **Sentence frame:** \"Fungi are living organisms that _________________ and help _________________ in nature.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can describe fungi as a living organism (not a plant or animal).\n- ✓ Student can identify at least one condition fungi need (dark, damp, or decaying matter).\n- ✓ Student understands fungi break down dead wood / play a role in nature.\n- ✓ Student can name or point to a habitat where fungi might live.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify fungi as NOT a plant and describe at least one condition they need.\n- 75% of students will explain that fungi help break down dead wood or return nutrients to soil.\n- Most students will identify a realistic habitat for fungi.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Visual supports:** Use the photograph throughout the lesson as a reference. Point to specific parts when introducing vocabulary. Consider laminating it for tactile learners to touch and trace the mushroom shapes.\n\n2. **Sentence frames and word banks:** Provide students with pre-written options for their observations and exit tickets:\n   - \"Mushrooms are growing on the _____________.\"\n   - \"Fungi like dark, ___________ places.\"\n   - Word bank: bark, wood, damp, soil, decaying, nutrients\n\n3. **Pair with a strong partner:** During Explore and Elaborate phases, pair struggling readers/writers with confident peers or assign a paraprofessional to scribe observations while the student directs the drawing and thinking.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research extension:** Provide a picture book or simple online resource (teacher-vetted) about different types of fungi. Have students sketch and label 3–4 different fungi species and describe how they look different. Question: \"Why might fungi look different if they all do the same job?\"\n\n2. **Deeper decomposition study:** Ask: \"If fungi break down dead wood, what do you think happens to the nutrients after? Where do they go?\" Have students trace the path: decaying wood → fungi breaks it down → nutrients return to soil → new plants grow. Create a simple diagram or cycle.\n\n3. **Habitat conditions experiment design:** Challenge students to design their own mini-experiment. Provide two small containers with wood and ask: \"How would you test whether fungi prefer darkness or light? What would you keep the same?\" (Controlled variable thinking.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fungi Life Cycle Illustration:** Over the next 2–3 weeks, take daily photos of the model habitat jar from Explore/Explain phase. Create a simple picture sequence showing growth (if fungi appear). Have students arrange photos in order and write/dictate captions: \"Day 1: No fungi. Day 5: White fuzzy stuff appears!\" This introduces the concept of life cycles.\n\n2. **Forest Floor Investigation:** If safe and appropriate, take students on a short nature walk to observe the forest floor or a damp, shaded area. Have them collect fallen logs, bark, and leaves (without disturbing fungi). Discuss: \"What do you notice living on or in this wood? How has it changed?\" This reinforces habitat concepts and real-world observation.\n\n3. **Create a Fungi Habitat at Home (Optional Family Activity):** Send home a simple instruction sheet for families to create their own small jar habitat with moist wood chips and leaf litter. Students observe weekly and bring back drawings or photos. This extends learning across environments and engages families in science.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Preparation Checklist\n\n- [ ] Print and display the fungal photograph 1–2 days before the lesson.\n- [ ] Prepare the model habitat jar (moist wood/bark in sealed container) the day before.\n- [ ] Gather hand lenses and ensure they are clean.\n- [ ] Create observation sheets and \"Fungi Habitat Hunt\" worksheets (templates easily adaptable).\n- [ ] Obtain a fresh mushroom from grocery store for optional tactile demonstration.\n- [ ] If doing outdoor exploration, scout locations in advance for safety and accessibility.\n- [ ] Prepare vocabulary anchor chart template or have chart paper ready.\n- [ ] Create exit ticket handouts (can be half-sheets to save paper).\n\n---\n\n**This lesson connects students directly to the photograph by using it as the anchor for all observations and learning. The 5E structure ensures students discover concepts through exploration before receiving formal vocabulary, making the learning deeper and more meaningful.**",
