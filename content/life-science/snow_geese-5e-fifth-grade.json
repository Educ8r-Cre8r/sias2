ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal behavior and food sources using the snow geese photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of snow geese in agricultural field (photograph provided)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording student observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without explanation. Allow students 1-2 minutes of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask students to \"turn and talk\"** with a partner about what they notice. Listen for observations about:\n   - The large number of birds\n   - The agricultural field setting\n   - The birds in flight\n   - The open landscape with power lines and distant trees\n\n3. **Facilitate whole-class discussion** using these guiding questions:\n   - \"What do you think these birds are doing in this field? Why would they gather here in such large groups?\"\n   - \"Where do you think these birds came from, and where do you think they're going?\"\n   - \"What could these birds possibly be eating in this bare, plowed field?\"\n   - \"If these birds eat plants and crops, what happens to that plant material after the birds eat it? Where does it go?\"\n\n4. **Present a wonder prompt:** \"These are snow geese, and they travel thousands of miles each year following the seasons. As they move from place to place, they eat plants and leave behind waste. Today, we're going to trace the journey of matter—the stuff that makes up the plants and the geese—as it travels through the environment.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's investigate how matter moves from plants to animals and back to the environment by creating our own model of the snow geese ecosystem.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the movement of matter in an ecosystem by simulating how snow geese consume plants and cycle matter through an environment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheet of paper or poster board (one per small group)\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Images of snow geese, crops (corn, wheat, barley), water, soil, decomposers (cut from magazines or printed handouts)\n- String or yarn (to show movement pathways)\n- Scissors and glue sticks\n- Optional: Small objects (beans = plant matter, small stones = decomposers, water-filled cups = water cycle)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Introduce the Ecosystem Model**\nExplain to students: \"Snow geese eat plants like grasses, roots, and crop seeds. They fly over long distances and eat in one place, then fly to another. When they eat, they take in matter from plants. When they poop, and when they die, they return matter back to the soil. Let's show this journey.\"\n\n**Step 2: Hands-On Model Building (in groups of 3-4)**\n\n1. Students receive a large sheet of paper representing an ecosystem.\n\n2. Students place or draw the following components on their paper:\n   - Agricultural field or wetland (habitat)\n   - Snow geese (the main animal)\n   - Plants/crops that geese eat\n   - Soil\n   - Decomposers (bacteria, fungi—represented as images or labels)\n   - Water source\n   - A distant location where geese migrate\n\n3. Using string or arrows, students **trace the path of matter** by drawing or connecting:\n   - How plants take in water and nutrients from soil\n   - How geese eat the plants (consuming matter)\n   - How geese travel and deposit waste (returning matter to soil)\n   - How decomposers break down dead organisms and waste (recycling matter back to soil)\n   - How water moves through the system\n\n**Step 3: Document Observations**\nStudents should label their model and write or draw explanations for:\n- Where matter enters the system (water, soil nutrients)\n- Where matter goes when the geese eat plants\n- Where matter returns to the environment (through goose droppings and death)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"Where does that arrow go next?\" \"How does that matter get back to the soil?\" \"What happens to the plants after the goose eats them?\"\n- Avoid telling students the \"right\" answer; instead, guide them with questions.\n- Encourage groups to explain their thinking to each other.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Models showing a cycle of matter movement (rather than a simple one-way chain)\n- Evidence that students understand matter comes from the environment and returns to it\n- Arrows or pathways showing connections between plants, animals, and decomposers\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and reinforce the concept of matter cycling in ecosystems using student models and the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student models from Explore phase\n- Large diagram or anchor chart showing a food web/matter cycle (you create in advance or co-create with students)\n- Vocabulary cards or chart paper with key terms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Out from Explore Phase (5 minutes)**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to briefly present their models.\n   - Ask other students: \"Do you agree with how they showed matter moving? Why or why not?\"\n   - Highlight common patterns: cycling, multiple pathways, return of matter to soil.\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Explanation (7 minutes)**\n   - Display a simple matter-cycling diagram (or co-create one based on student models).\n   - Explain: \"You discovered that matter doesn't just disappear. Plants take in water and nutrients from soil and air. Snow geese eat those plants, taking that matter into their bodies. When geese produce waste or die, decomposers break down that matter and return it to the soil. This is called the **matter cycle** or **nutrient cycle**. Matter moves in a cycle—it's never lost; it just changes form.\"\n   - Connect back to the photograph: \"Those snow geese in the field are part of a matter cycle. Every plant they eat, every bit of waste they leave behind—it's all part of moving matter through the environment.\"\n\n3. **Introduce and Define Vocabulary (5 minutes)**\n\n| Vocabulary Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|---|---|\n| **Matter** | All the \"stuff\" or material that makes up living and nonliving things (like plants, animals, soil, water). |\n| **Food Web** | A diagram showing how energy and matter move from plants to animals to other animals in an ecosystem. |\n| **Decomposers** | Living things (like bacteria and fungi) that break down dead plants and animals and return matter to the soil. |\n| **Nutrient Cycle** | The path that nutrients (like nitrogen and carbon) take as they move from soil to plants to animals and back to soil. |\n| **Ecosystem** | A community of living things (plants and animals) and the nonliving environment they live in, all connected by the flow of matter and energy. |\n\n4. **Check for Understanding**\n   - Ask students: \"Where does a snow goose get the matter it needs to grow and survive?\" (Expected: from plants)\n   - \"What happens to that matter after the goose eats it?\" (Expected: it becomes part of the goose's body; some is used for energy; some becomes waste)\n   - \"Where does the matter go when the goose dies?\" (Expected: decomposers break it down, and it returns to soil)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify the cycle of matter in an ecosystem\n- Students understand that matter is conserved (it doesn't disappear; it changes form)\n- Students can name and describe the role of different parts of a matter cycle (plants, animals, decomposers, soil)\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of matter cycling to a new scenario and deepen their comprehension by considering how changes in an ecosystem affect matter flow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards or paper slips with different scenarios\n- Access to student models from Explore phase\n- Optional: video clip of snow geese migration or additional photos of geese in different habitats\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Application (choose one or both based on time):**\n\n**Option A: Migration Impact Analysis**\n1. Present students with a scenario: \"Imagine a severe drought dries up the wetlands where snow geese usually rest during migration. There are no plants growing there. Where will the geese go? What happens to the matter cycle in that ecosystem?\"\n\n2. Students work in small groups to:\n   - Discuss what happens to the plants in the drought-affected area\n   - Predict where geese will seek food instead\n   - Draw or describe how the matter cycle changes when the geese move to a new location\n   - Explain: \"Does matter disappear from the ecosystem, or does it just move somewhere else?\"\n\n3. Share findings: Emphasize that matter doesn't disappear; it just moves to different locations. The geese (and the matter they carry) migrate to new ecosystems.\n\n**Option B: Food Web Extension**\n1. Expand the concept: \"Snow geese aren't the only animals in these ecosystems. Many other birds, mammals, and insects also live there. Let's think about what else eats the plants, and what eats the geese.\"\n\n2. Students add to their models (or create a new diagram) showing:\n   - Other herbivores that eat the same plants as geese\n   - Predators that might hunt geese (like eagles, foxes)\n   - Multiple pathways matter takes through the ecosystem\n\n3. Discussion: \"How does adding more animals change the way matter moves through the ecosystem? Does one animal still get all the matter from the plants?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions that encourage systems thinking: \"What is connected to what?\" \"What happens if one part changes?\"\n- Facilitate small-group discussions by listening and asking for clarification and reasoning.\n- Encourage students to revise or expand their models based on new thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that matter cycles can be disrupted or changed but matter is not lost\n- Students understand that ecosystems contain multiple interconnected pathways for matter movement\n- Evidence that students can apply the matter-cycling concept to new scenarios\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how matter moves through ecosystems and the role of different organisms in the matter cycle.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation of student models during Explore phase\n- Listen to student discussions during share-outs and group work\n- Ask students to explain their thinking: \"Tell me how matter gets from the soil to the geese and back.\"\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (provide after Elaborate phase)**\n\nStudents respond to the following prompts (written or drawn, depending on grade level readiness):\n\n1. **Draw and Label:** Create a simple diagram showing how matter from a plant ends up in a snow goose, and what happens to that matter after the goose eats it. Label at least three parts.\n\n2. **Short Response (2-3 sentences):** \"Explain why decomposers are important in the matter cycle. What would happen if decomposers disappeared?\"\n\n3. **Application Question:** \"A farmer plants wheat. Snow geese eat the wheat during migration. The geese leave droppings on the field. Is this an example of a matter cycle? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student diagram shows matter entering (plants absorbing water/nutrients), being consumed (geese eating), and returning (waste, death, decomposition).\n- Student can identify the role of at least two different parts of the matter cycle.\n- Student recognizes that matter moves in a cycle and is conserved (not lost).\n- Student can apply the concept to a new scenario or explain the importance of a specific organism's role (e.g., decomposers).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can create a labeled model showing matter movement through an ecosystem.\n- 75% of students can write or explain at least one complete cycle of matter.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that matter is conserved and cycles through ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Provide a Partially Completed Model:** Give students a template with some components (plants, geese, soil, decomposers) already labeled or drawn. Students only need to add arrows and explain connections.\n\n2. **Use Concrete Manipulatives:** Instead of drawing, provide small objects (beans for plants, buttons for geese, soil in a container). Students physically move objects to show the path of matter, then draw or photograph their model.\n\n3. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use shorter definitions and repeat key terms frequently. Create a classroom anchor chart with pictures and simple labels (e.g., \"Plants → Geese → Poop → Soil\").\n\n4. **Partner with a Stronger Peer:** Pair struggling students with partners who can model thinking and help explain concepts during group work.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Complex Food Webs:** Ask advanced students to research and create a more detailed food web that includes multiple herbivores (grasshoppers, ducks, deer), predators (foxes, eagles), and decomposers. Have them trace matter through multiple pathways and discuss how energy decreases at each level.\n\n2. **Environmental Change Impact:** Present a more complex scenario: \"If climate change causes plants to bloom earlier or later, how might this affect the snow geese migration cycle and the timing of matter cycling?\" Have students research and present findings.\n\n3. **Carbon or Nitrogen Cycle Deep Dive:** Challenge advanced students to focus on a specific element (carbon or nitrogen) and trace its path through the ecosystem from rock/air → soil → plant → animal → decomposer → back to soil/air. Create a detailed diagram with scientific vocabulary.\n\n4. **Real-World Application:** Have students research conservation efforts for snow geese and explain how protecting their habitats is actually about protecting the matter cycles those ecosystems depend on.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Migration Mapping Project:** Students research the actual migration routes of snow geese (using resources like the U.S. Geological Survey or Audubon Society). They map the route, identify the ecosystems geese travel through, and create a presentation or poster showing how matter cycles in each ecosystem along the route. Discussion: \"How does matter in an arctic tundra ecosystem differ from matter in an agricultural field ecosystem?\"\n\n2. **Decomposer Investigation:** Set up a controlled decomposition experiment where students observe how a dead plant (or plant waste) breaks down in soil over 2-4 weeks. Students examine the soil before and after, identify decomposers (if visible), and document how matter changes. Connect findings back to the matter cycle: \"What happened to the plant matter? Where did it go?\"\n\n3. **Interview a Farmer or Ecologist:** Invite a local farmer or wildlife biologist to speak to the class about how snow geese and other migratory birds affect their land. Students prepare questions such as: \"How do the geese impact crop growth?\" \"Is the nutrient cycling helpful or harmful?\" \"What management strategies do you use?\" This real-world perspective deepens understanding of matter cycles in human-impacted ecosystems.\n\n---",
