ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (large poster size or projected on screen) of the dragonfly with gecko\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student observation sheets (one per student)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Display and Introduction (2 minutes):**\nProject or display the high-quality dragonfly photograph prominently. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds without speaking. Say: *\"Look carefully at every detail in this image. What do you notice?\"*\n\n**Discussion Questions (8–10 minutes):**\nPose these questions one at a time, allowing think-pair-share responses:\n\n1. **\"What is the main animal in the middle of this photo, and what do you notice about its body parts?\"** \n   - *Look for responses about wings, eyes, legs, body segments, and colors.*\n\n2. **\"These wings look very different from a bird's wing. Why do you think this animal might have wings shaped like this?\"** \n   - *Guide toward ideas about movement, speed, balance, or hunting.*\n\n3. **\"If you look at the head, what do you see that might help this creature know what's happening around it? What is it looking at?\"** \n   - *Emphasize the large eyes and how they might sense movement.*\n\n4. **\"Where do you think this creature lives, and what clues from its body tell you that?\"** \n   - *Students may notice water plants and make connections to wet habitats.*\n\n**Wonder Prompt and Prediction (2–3 minutes):**\nWrite on chart paper: *\"I wonder how each part of this dragonfly helps it survive and hunt.\"* \n\nAsk: *\"If this creature needs to catch tiny flying insects really fast, which body parts would need to be special or strong?\"* Have students turn to a partner and make predictions.\n\n**Transition:** \n*\"Today, we're going to be insect detectives and discover how each part of a dragonfly's body is specially designed for survival. Let's explore!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Dragonfly model/diagram printouts (one per student or small group)—show labeled parts (head, thorax, abdomen, wings, legs, eyes, antennae)\n- Pipe cleaners, craft sticks, and colored paper cut into basic insect shapes\n- Index cards with habitat scenario cards (see below)\n- Rulers\n- Scissors\n- Glue sticks\n- Student exploration recording sheets\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Structural Investigation (10–12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute a dragonfly diagram** to each student or pair. Ask: *\"You are going to become a dragonfly engineer. Your job is to figure out what each body part does.\"*\n\n2. **Provide scenario cards** with questions like:\n   - *\"A dragonfly needs to turn super fast in the air to catch a mosquito. Which body parts would help with that?\"*\n   - *\"A dragonfly hunts at sunrise when it's still a bit dark. How do its eyes help it find prey?\"*\n   - *\"A dragonfly must hold onto plants when it lands. What structures help it grip?\"*\n\n3. **Student task:** Students draw arrows on their diagram connecting each body part to the survival function it performs. They write 1–2 words next to each arrow explaining the job (e.g., \"Wings → Fast movement,\" \"Eyes → Seeing prey,\" \"Legs → Gripping and climbing\").\n\n4. **Circulate and ask:** *\"Why did you connect that part to that job? Can you show me how it helps the dragonfly?\"* Do not provide answers—redirect with questions.\n\n**Part 2: Build-a-Bug Model (8–10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display the photograph again** and say: *\"Now you're going to build a simple dragonfly model using craft materials.\"*\n\n2. **Provide materials** (pipe cleaners, craft sticks, colored paper shapes) and ask students to create a 3D or 2D model of a dragonfly with:\n   - A body (abdomen, thorax, head)\n   - Four wings\n   - Six legs\n   - Two eyes (marked on the head)\n\n3. **As they build, ask:** *\"Why are the wings so long and wide? What do they need to do?\" \"Where are the eyes? Why are they in that spot?\" \"How many legs does it have? Why six and not four?\"*\n\n4. **Students record** on their exploration sheet: \"My dragonfly has _____ body parts. The part I think is most important for survival is the _____ because _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Observe and listen without correcting\n- Ask open-ended questions to deepen thinking\n- Encourage students to refer back to the photograph\n- Prompt comparisons: *\"How is this different from a butterfly or a bee?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify the main body regions and appendages\n- Students make connections between structure and survival function\n- Students create a physical or labeled model showing dragonfly anatomy\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large labeled diagram of a dragonfly (anchor chart)\n- Vocabulary cards with images\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Whiteboard/chart paper for recording vocabulary\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Share-Out and Student Thinking (5 minutes):**\n\n1. Call on 2–3 student pairs to share their structural diagrams. Ask: *\"Which body part did you choose as most important? Why?\"*\n\n2. Ask the class: *\"What did you notice about the dragonfly's eyes? Why are they so big?\"* Affirm observations like \"They help it see\" and extend: *\"Yes! Dragonflies have special eyes that help them see movement in almost every direction at the same time.\"*\n\n**Introduce Key Vocabulary (7–10 minutes):**\n\nDisplay each term on an anchor chart with the photograph visible. Use student-friendly language:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Visual Clue from Photo** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **External Structure** | Body parts on the outside of an animal that you can see and touch | Wings, legs, eyes, body segments |\n| **Compound Eyes** | Special eyes made of thousands of tiny lenses that help insects see movement super well | The large, dark, rounded head area |\n| **Thorax** | The middle section of an insect's body where the legs and wings attach | The area between the head and long abdomen |\n| **Abdomen** | The long, lower section of an insect's body | The pointed, segmented tail-like part |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat | The dragonfly's wings, eyes, and body shape help it hunt near water |\n\n**Connection to Function (3–5 minutes):**\n\nPoint to the photograph and say: *\"Let's use our new words. This dragonfly has a large thorax because strong muscles attach there to power those wings. Its compound eyes wrap around its head so it can see prey flying in almost every direction. Its long, thin abdomen helps it balance and turn quickly in the air. Every part has a job.\"*\n\nAsk: *\"Who can use one of our new words in a sentence about the dragonfly?\"* (e.g., \"The adaptation of big compound eyes helps the dragonfly see the mosquito.\")\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n\nAsk students to **point to and name** three external structures on the photograph and explain one job each part does. Listen for use of correct vocabulary.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand the names and locations of dragonfly body structures\n- Students explain how each structure supports survival and hunting behavior\n- Students correctly use vocabulary in sentences\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photographs or illustrations of 3–4 other insects (beetle, grasshopper, butterfly, water strider)\n- Comparison chart template (printed or on whiteboard)\n- Index cards with survival scenarios\n- Student notebooks or chart paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Comparative Structures Task (12–15 minutes):**\n\n1. **Display images** of a dragonfly, beetle, grasshopper, and butterfly side-by-side.\n\n2. **Ask:** *\"These are all insects, but their bodies are designed differently. Why? What does each insect need to do to survive?\"*\n\n3. **Provide a comparison chart** with rows for each insect and columns for: *Habitat, Main Job (hunting/eating/moving), Special Body Parts, How Those Parts Help.*\n\n4. **Students work in pairs** to complete the chart:\n   - **Dragonfly:** Water habitat, hunts fast insects, long wings and compound eyes → fast flight and detection\n   - **Grasshopper:** Dry grass/ground, eats plants and jumps away, strong back legs → powerful jumping\n   - **Butterfly:** Flowers, sips nectar, thin tube mouth, colorful wings → finding flowers and being recognized by mates\n   - **Beetle:** Many habitats, crawls and sometimes flies, hard outer shell and short strong legs → protection and climbing\n\n5. **Deepen thinking with scenarios:**\n   - *\"If a dragonfly had a grasshopper's short, thick legs instead of its thin legs, would it survive well? Why or why not?\"*\n   - *\"What if a butterfly had a dragonfly's large eyes? Would that help or hurt?\"*\n   - *\"Why do you think insects that live in water (like dragonflies) often look different from insects that live in trees?\"*\n\n**Application: Design-a-New-Insect (optional, if time allows — 5 minutes):**\n\nAsk: *\"If you had to design a brand-new insect that lives in the desert and needs to find water in the dark, what special body parts would it need? Why?\"* \n\nStudents sketch and label their design with at least three adapted structures and explain why each one matters.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate pair discussions\n- Ask probing questions: *\"How are these insects the same? Different? Why?\"*\n- Redirect students to the comparison chart to find evidence\n- Celebrate connections between structure and survival\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different insects have different structures because they live in different places and do different things\n- Students apply understanding to new insects\n- Students articulate the relationship between habitat, behavior, and body structure\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of external structures and their survival functions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- During **Explore:** Observe diagrams and listen to student explanations. Are students making structure-function connections?\n- During **Explain:** Listen to sentence stems: *\"The _____ helps the dragonfly _____ because _____.\" Do students use vocabulary correctly?*\n- During **Elaborate:** Review comparison charts and design sketches. Can students apply concepts to new contexts?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet or digital form with these three items:\n\n**Question 1 (Multiple Choice):**\n*\"Why does a dragonfly have very large compound eyes?\"*\n- A) To scare other insects away\n- B) To see movement in almost every direction and find prey\n- C) To look pretty\n- D) To collect pollen\n\n**Question 2 (Short Answer):**\n*\"Look at this picture of the dragonfly again. Pick ONE body structure (like wings, eyes, legs, or abdomen) and explain how it helps the dragonfly survive. Write 2–3 sentences.\"*\n\n(Provide a small labeled image of the dragonfly)\n\n**Question 3 (Reasoning):**\n*\"A dragonfly's wings are long and light, but a beetle's wings are short and hard. Why do you think they are different?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate proficiency if they:\n\n✓ **Correctly identify** at least 3 dragonfly structures and their locations  \n✓ **Explain** how at least 2 structures support survival, hunting, or movement  \n✓ **Use or understand** vocabulary: external structure, compound eyes, thorax, abdomen, adaptation  \n✓ **Make logical connections** between structure and function (e.g., \"big eyes help see prey\")  \n✓ **Compare** structures across insects and explain why differences exist  \n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Objectives:**\n\n- **Learning Objective 1:** Check exit ticket Q1 and Q2 for correct structure identification and function explanation. (Target: 80% accuracy)\n- **Learning Objective 2:** Review Elaborate comparison charts and discussion responses. Do students explain sensory structures and responses? (Target: Most students can explain compound eyes and movement response)\n- **Learning Objective 3:** Review Elaborate comparison work. Can students explain structural differences across insects? (Target: 75%+ can provide at least one valid comparison)\n- **Learning Objective 4:** Review Explore diagrams and Elaborate design sketches. Does the model show structures and their functions? (Target: All students create a labeled model with at least 3 body parts)\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary anchor chart:** Create a permanent classroom chart with pictures and student-friendly definitions of key terms (external structure, compound eyes, adaptation, habitat). Have students reference it during all activities.\n\n2. **Structured diagram:** Provide a partially filled-in dragonfly diagram during Explore with some structures and functions already labeled. Students add 2–3 more and explain those using sentence stems: *\"The _____ helps the dragonfly _____ because it is _____.\"*\n\n3. **Visual comparison:** During Elaborate, use side-by-side images of just two insects (dragonfly and grasshopper) instead of four. Create a simpler two-column chart: *\"How is it the same? How is it different?\"* Provide sentence starters: *\"The dragonfly has _____ but the grasshopper has _____. This helps because _____.\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Microscopic structures:** Provide images or videos of dragonfly compound eye close-ups or wing vein patterns. Ask: *\"These tiny structures are not visible in our photograph, but they help the dragonfly survive. Research one of these structures. How does it work? Why do you think dragonflies evolved this way?\"* Students present findings to the class.\n\n2. **Life cycle connection:** Extend to dragonfly life cycle (egg → nymph → adult). Ask: *\"A dragonfly nymph lives underwater and looks completely different. What structures do you think it has? Why? How do those change when it becomes an adult?\"* Students draw and label both forms.\n\n3. **Biomimicry design challenge:** *\"Scientists study dragonflies to design better drones and helicopters. Using what you know about dragonfly structures, design a robot that hunts for harmful insects in a garden. What structures would you copy? Why?\"* Students create a detailed labeled sketch with explanations.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Dragonfly Observation Field Study (30–45 minutes):**\n   If possible, take students to a pond, wetland, or even a school garden with standing water. Provide observation clipboards and magnifying glasses. Have students sketch and describe dragonflies they observe in their natural habitat. Ask: *\"What do you notice about how it moves? What does it seem to be doing? How does it use its structures?\"* Compile observations into a classroom \"Dragonfly Field Guide.\"\n\n2. **Insect Structure Scavenger Hunt (20–30 minutes):**\n   Create a schoolyard or classroom scavenger hunt where students find images or real specimens of insects with specific structures: *\"Find an insect with very large eyes,\" \"Find an insect with powerful jumping legs,\" \"Find an insect with colorful wings,\"* etc. Students photograph or sketch each find, identify the insect, and explain how that structure helps it survive.\n\n3. **Interactive Digital Exploration (20–30 minutes):**\n   Use free online resources (e.g., National Geographic Kids dragonfly videos, PBS Learning Media insect exploration tools, or interactive museum websites) where students explore dragonfly anatomy in 3D, learn about different dragonfly species, or watch videos of dragonflies hunting. Students take notes and answer guiding questions: *\"What surprised you? What new body parts did you learn about? How does the video help you understand dragonfly survival?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Real specimens (if available):** If you can obtain a preserved dragonfly, pinned butterfly, or other insects, students' engagement will dramatically increase. Allow careful observation time.\n- **Photograph connections:** Return to the original photograph frequently throughout the lesson. Point out new details as vocabulary expands.\n- **Safety with living dragonflies:** If observing live dragonflies, emphasize **gentle observation only—no capturing or touching** without supervision. Many schools and nature centers have permission procedures.\n- **Habitat context:** Emphasize that the structures students are learning about are *adaptations to aquatic and aerial life*. The plants in the photograph are not incidental—they represent the dragonfly's true habitat.\n- **Cross-curricular link:** Consider pairing this lesson with a reading unit on animal adaptations or with math activities measuring wing dimensions or comparing insect sizes.",
