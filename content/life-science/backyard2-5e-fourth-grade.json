Identify at least three external structures of plants (roots, stems, leaves, flowers) and explain what each structure does to help the plant survive.\n2. Describe how the garden habitat provides food, water, shelter, and space for different plants and animals to live.\n3. Compare how different plants have different structures that help them survive in the same garden environment.\n4. Construct a simple argument using evidence from the photograph to explain why plants need certain structures to grow and survive.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the backyard garden (or display on interactive board)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph prominently** where all students can see clearly. Say: \"Today, we're going to be garden detectives. This garden is like a neighborhood where lots of living things have their homes!\"\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause for 10-15 seconds after each to allow think-pair-share):\n   - \"What living things can you see in this garden? Where are they?\"\n   - \"What do you notice about the different plants? How are they different from each other?\"\n   - \"If you were a tiny ant or a bee, what might you find in this garden that you need to live?\"\n   - \"Why do you think someone planted so many different plants close together in one place?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations** on chart paper as a class \"wonder list\":\n   - What students notice about the plants\n   - Questions they have (\"Why are the flowers different colors?\" \"Where do the roots go?\")\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"Today, we're going to investigate what special parts plants have that help them live, grow, and make more plants. Let's become detectives and look for clues!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"In a few minutes, you'll get to explore real plants and figure out what different parts do. First, let's go outside (or to our plant station) and investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover plant structures through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4-5 potted plants or plant specimens (some flowering, some with visible roots; examples: impatiens, daisies, herbs, or small vegetable plants — match variety shown in photo if possible)\n- Hand lenses (one per pair of students)\n- Paper towels or newspaper (to protect desks)\n- Rulers or measuring tape\n- Student observation sheets (see directions below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Clipboards\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs** and assign each pair a plant station with one specimen.\n\n2. **Provide this step-by-step investigation protocol:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Gently examine the roots. (If visible in soil, ask: \"What do you notice about the roots? Are they long or short? Thin or thick? Why might roots need to be this way?\")\n   - **Step 2:** Observe the stem. (Ask: \"Is the stem thick or thin? Hard or soft? What do you think the stem does?\")\n   - **Step 3:** Look closely at the leaves with a hand lens. (Ask: \"How big are they? What color? What shape? Feel the texture. What do you observe?\")\n   - **Step 4:** If flowers are present, examine them. (Ask: \"How many petals? What color? What parts do you see?\")\n   - **Step 5:** Measure the height of your plant and count how many leaves (or flowers) it has.\n\n3. **Student documentation task:**\n   - Provide a simple observation sheet with sections for each plant part (Root, Stem, Leaf, Flower).\n   - Students draw or write what they observe in each section.\n   - Students write one sentence about what they think each part does (e.g., \"I think roots help the plant get water from the dirt\").\n\n4. **Connection to the photograph:** Ask students to point to their assigned plant part in the garden photograph: \"Can you find a stem like this one in the big garden photo? How is it the same or different?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each station and ask guiding questions without providing answers:\n  - \"What do you notice about the texture?\"\n  - \"Why do you think this part is shaped this way?\"\n  - \"Where would this part be if it were in the garden?\"\n- Redirect observations toward function: \"What job do you think this part does for the plant?\"\n- Ensure students are handling plants gently and recording observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students complete observation sheets with drawings and predictions about plant part functions.\n- Students can verbally describe at least two external structures of their plant.\n- Students begin connecting observations to survival (e.g., \"Roots get water\" or \"Leaves get light\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled diagrams of plant parts\n- Photograph of the garden (displayed again)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Vocabulary cards (with pictures and words)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students for group share-out** (sitting where all can see the garden photo and chart paper):\n   - Call on 3-4 student pairs to describe one observation from their plant.\n   - Ask the class: \"Did anyone else notice something similar in their plant?\"\n   - Create a class list: \"What all plants seem to have...\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions and labels on chart paper:\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Roots** | The part of the plant that grows underground and soaks up water and nutrients from the soil. Roots also help the plant stay in the ground. |\n   | **Stem** | The part that holds up the plant above ground. It carries water from the roots up to the leaves and flowers. |\n   | **Leaves** | The flat green parts that catch sunlight. Plants use sunlight, air, and water to make food and grow. Leaves are like the plant's food makers. |\n   | **Flowers** | The colorful parts that make seeds so new plants can grow. Flowers attract bees and other insects that help plants make seeds. |\n   | **Habitat** | A place where a plant or animal lives. It has everything the plant or animal needs: water, food, air, light, and shelter. |\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the garden photo: \"The purple flowers you see here are like the flowers we just studied. Why are they there?\"\n   - \"The soil you see in this garden has roots growing in it. What do those roots do?\"\n   - \"This garden is a habitat for plants. What does this habitat provide that plants need?\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding with these questions:**\n   - \"If a plant didn't have roots, what problem would it have?\"\n   - \"Why do you think a flower might be colorful?\"\n   - \"What would happen to a plant if its leaves were covered with dirt?\"\n   - Students can answer with thumbs up/down or turn-and-talk to a partner.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Roots:** Underground parts that absorb water and anchor the plant\n- **Stem:** Above-ground support structure that transports water\n- **Leaves:** Green structures that use sunlight to make food\n- **Flowers:** Reproductive structures that create seeds\n- **Habitat:** An environment that provides everything an organism needs to survive\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the four main external plant structures.\n- Students can match each structure to its function (support, water uptake, food-making, reproduction).\n- Students understand that the garden is a habitat that meets plant needs.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by analyzing plant adaptations in the garden.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Garden photograph (displayed)\n- Plant adaptation worksheet or chart\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: real plant samples brought from a similar garden or greenhouse\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present a real-world scenario:**\n   - \"Look at this garden again. You see many different plants right next to each other. They're all living in the same habitat—the same backyard. But they look very different! Their leaves are different sizes and shapes. Some plants are tall, some are short. Some have big flowers, some have tiny flowers.\"\n   - \"Why would plants have different structures if they all live in the same garden?\"\n\n2. **Guide a brief discussion about adaptation:**\n   - Show specific plant pairs in the photo (e.g., the tall dark ornamental grass next to the short purple flowers).\n   - Ask: \"These two plants live side by side. How are they different? How might those differences help each plant survive?\"\n   - Introduce: \"When a plant has special structures that help it survive in its habitat, we call that an adaptation.\"\n\n3. **Adaptation exploration task:**\n   - Provide students with a comparison chart or worksheet with two plants from the photo (or use real samples).\n   - Students fill in: Plant A vs. Plant B\n     - Leaf size and shape\n     - Stem thickness/height\n     - Flower size and color\n     - Prediction: \"How might these differences help each plant survive in the garden?\"\n   - Example: \"Plant A has tiny leaves (uses less water in hot sun). Plant B has big leaves (catches more light in shade).\"\n\n4. **Extended thinking:**\n   - Ask: \"If we moved one of these plants to a different spot in the garden (shadier or sunnier), do you think it would still survive? Why or why not?\"\n   - Students sketch and label the plant in its current location and write a prediction.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to notice patterns without directly telling them the answers.\n- Ask: \"What do you notice about plants in sunny spots vs. shady spots?\"\n- Use the garden photo to highlight specific examples.\n- Validate observations: \"You noticed that the yellow flowers are bright yellow—how might that help insects find them?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students complete adaptation comparison charts.\n- Students can explain that different structures help plants survive in different parts of the garden.\n- Students use evidence from the photograph or real plants to support their thinking.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant structures and their functions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observation checklists during Explore phase (Can students identify and describe plant parts? Do their drawings show accurate structures?)\n- Questioning during Explain phase (Can students match structures to functions? Do they understand habitat concept?)\n- Completed observation sheets and adaptation charts (Do students describe functions accurately?)\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (end of Lesson 1 or Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with this prompt and a half-sheet of paper:\n\n---\n\n**\"You are teaching a younger student about the garden. Draw and label a plant from the photograph. Next to each part (roots, stem, leaves, flower), write ONE sentence explaining what that part does to help the plant survive.\"**\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies and labels at least 3 plant structures\n- ✓ Student explains that each structure has a job (function)\n- ✓ Explanations relate to survival (getting water, making food, staying up, making new plants)\n- ✓ Student uses evidence from the photograph or Explore activity\n\n**Alternative Assessment (if students need more support):**\n- Multiple-choice matching: \"Match the plant part to what it does\"\n  - Roots → A. Makes food from sunlight\n  - Leaves → B. Gets water from soil\n  - Stem → C. Holds plant up\n\n**Alternative Assessment (for advanced learners):**\n- \"Construct an Argument\" task:\n  - \"Explain why a plant that lives in a very hot, dry desert might have different leaf structures than the plants in this garden. Use what you know about how leaves help plants survive.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes — Students Meet Objectives If They:**\n1. Can name plant structures (roots, stem, leaves, flowers) and point to them in the photo\n2. Can explain at least two functions of plant structures (e.g., \"Roots get water; leaves make food\")\n3. Can describe the garden as a habitat that provides water, light, and soil for plants\n4. Can support an idea with evidence from the photo or their exploration\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visuals:**\n   - Provide a one-page reference sheet with large, color-coded diagrams of plant parts and their functions.\n   - Use shorter definitions: \"Roots = get water. Stems = hold up. Leaves = make food.\"\n   - Pair student with a visual reference card during Elaborate phase.\n\n2. **Guided observation sheets:**\n   - Provide pre-drawn plant diagrams with blanks to fill in rather than requiring students to draw from scratch.\n   - Use sentence frames: \"The roots help the plant by _______.\"\n   - Offer a choice of answers: \"Does the stem (a) hold up the plant or (b) fly away?\"\n\n3. **Shorter exploration time:**\n   - Reduce the number of plant structures to observe (focus on 2-3 instead of 4).\n   - Provide a checklist format instead of open-ended observation sheet.\n   - Allow use of hand lens to magnify details (scaffolds observation skills).\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper analysis of adaptation:**\n   - Provide a second photograph of a garden in a different climate (desert, rainforest, or arctic).\n   - Ask: \"Compare plant structures in this garden vs. the new garden. How are they different? Why?\"\n   - Students research one plant from the garden and prepare a 2-3 minute presentation on how its structures help it survive.\n\n2. **Extended thinking about systems:**\n   - Task: \"Create a diagram showing how the root, stem, and leaves work together to help the plant survive. Use arrows to show how water and food move.\"\n   - Ask: \"What would happen to the whole plant if one part was damaged?\" (Systems thinking)\n\n3. **Real-world application:**\n   - Task: \"Design a garden for a specific place (sunny roof, shady patio, dry corner). Choose plants from the photo that would survive there and explain your choices using what you know about plant structures.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"If I Were an Insect\" Perspective Role-Play:**\n   - Students choose one flower from the garden photo and imagine being a bee or butterfly landing on it.\n   - Task: \"Draw what the flower looks like from the insect's perspective. Why would the insect visit this flower? How do the flower's structures help the insect?\"\n   - Students share drawings and explanations in a gallery walk.\n\n2. **Seed Exploration and Planting Project:**\n   - Collect seeds from flowers visible in the photo (or use similar garden flowers).\n   - Students observe seeds with hand lenses and make predictions: \"What will this seed grow into? What structures will it need first?\"\n   - Plant seeds in small cups and track growth over 2-4 weeks, recording observations of roots, stem, and leaves as they emerge.\n   - Connect to the photograph: \"This is how the plants in the garden got started!\"\n\n3. **Design a Classroom Habitat Garden:**\n   - Using the garden photo as inspiration, students design a small potted \"garden\" in a container.\n   - Task: \"Choose 3-4 different plants that have different structures. Explain why these plants would work well together in one pot.\"\n   - Students predict and observe how the plants grow and interact over time.\n   - Photo the result and compare to the original garden photo: \"What's the same? What's different?\"\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
