Identify and describe at least three external structures of a praying mantis and explain how each structure helps the animal survive.\n2. Explain how the praying mantis uses its senses (eyes, antennae) to detect and respond to information in its environment.\n3. Construct an argument using evidence from the photograph that the mantis's structures are well-suited for its role as a predator.\n4. Compare and contrast how different animals use similar structures (such as eyes or legs) for different survival functions.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal structures and survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the praying mantis on flowers\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Index cards with images of various predators (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or document camera without initial explanation. Allow students 30 seconds to silently observe.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (allow think-pair-share time before whole-group responses):\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? How do you know it's a living creature?\"\n   - \"Look at this animal's front legs—why do you think they look different from other insects' legs? What could they be used for?\"\n   - \"If you were a small insect flying near these flowers, would this animal be easy to spot? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What do you think this animal needs to do to survive, and how might its body help it?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what superpowers this insect has that help it catch its food. Let's investigate!\"\n\n4. **Record student observations** on chart paper under the headings \"What We See\" and \"What We Wonder.\"\n\n**Transition:** Today we're going to become animal detectives and investigate how this amazing hunter's body helps it survive in the garden.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how animal structures support survival through observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of the praying mantis (at least 8.5\" × 11\") or access to the image on tablets/computers\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per pair or group)\n- Worksheet: \"Mantis Detective Sheet\" (see below)\n- 3D model materials: green pipe cleaners, straws, googly eyes, and craft paper (optional, for second session)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Detailed Observation (First Session)**\n\n1. **Distribute the photograph and magnifying glasses** to small groups (2-3 students per group).\n\n2. **Direct students to investigate specific structures** using this guided exploration:\n   - \"Use your magnifying glass to look very closely at the mantis's head. What do you notice about its eyes? How many eyes do you see? Where are they positioned?\"\n   - \"Now examine the front legs. What makes them different from regular legs? Are there any special features you notice?\" (Students should note the spiny texture, the way they fold, the sharp points.)\n   - \"Look at the antennae (the long, thin feelers on top of the head). Why might an animal need these if it already has eyes?\"\n   - \"What color is the mantis? How might this color help it survive in a garden full of flowers and leaves?\"\n\n3. **Students record observations** on the \"Mantis Detective Sheet\" by:\n   - Drawing and labeling the mantis's external structures\n   - Writing 2-3 words describing each structure (e.g., \"eyes—large, round, facing forward\")\n   - Making predictions: \"I think the _____ helps the mantis because _____\"\n\n4. **Circulate and ask guiding questions** (without providing answers):\n   - \"What do you notice about how the legs are shaped?\"\n   - \"If you were the mantis's prey, would you see it hiding on this flower?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the eyes might be positioned on the sides of the head instead of on the back?\"\n\n**Part B: Sense Simulation (Second Session)**\n\n1. **Set up three sensory stations** around the room:\n\n   **Station 1 – Vision:** Provide two objects (e.g., a toy insect and a leaf) of similar green color. Students wear a headband with one eye covered and try to locate the insect. They record: \"Can I catch prey with one eye? With two eyes?\"\n\n   **Station 2 – Antennae/Touch:** Students close their eyes while you gently wave a hand near (not touching) their face. They try to detect the movement. Record: \"Can I feel movement near me? Where do I sense it?\"\n\n   **Station 3 – Leg Structure:** Students manipulate green pipe cleaners bent at angles to simulate raptorial legs. They practice \"grabbing\" small objects and record: \"How do the bent legs help trap prey?\"\n\n2. **Record findings** on a class chart: \"How the Mantis's Senses Help It Hunt.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Observe without correcting student observations.\n- Ask open-ended questions to guide thinking: \"What do you think would happen if the mantis's eyes faced backward?\"\n- Ensure all students engage with the photograph and materials.\n- Note observations for the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce labeled drawings of the mantis identifying at least 3 key structures.\n- Students write predictions connecting specific structures to survival functions.\n- Students discover through sensory simulation that forward-facing eyes aid depth perception and that antennae detect environmental changes.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to scientific concepts about animal structures and sensory adaptation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with prepared vocabulary definitions\n- \"Structure-Function Match\" cards (pre-made)\n- Projected photograph of the mantis\n- Optional: Short video clip (2-3 minutes) of a praying mantis hunting (Nature/Discovery Channel clips available online)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Call on 2-3 groups to share their observations from the Explore phase.\n   - Record key findings on class chart under \"What We Discovered.\"\n   - Validate observations: \"Great noticing! Let's learn the scientific names for what you found.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7-10 minutes):**\n\n   Present and define these terms using the photograph as a visual reference:\n\n   - **External structures:** Body parts on the outside of an animal that help it survive (point to mantis's legs, eyes, antennae).\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment (the mantis's green color is an adaptation for hiding).\n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals (the mantis is a predator).\n   - **Sensory information:** Messages the brain receives from the eyes, ears, antennae, and other sense organs (the mantis's big eyes send sensory information about moving prey).\n   - **Camouflage:** Coloring or body shape that helps an animal hide by blending with its surroundings (the mantis's green body is camouflage).\n\n3. **Make Connections Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - \"The mantis's *external structures* are specifically shaped for hunting. Its forward-facing eyes are an *adaptation* that lets it see prey clearly. Its green color is *camouflage* that helps it hide among flowers. When the mantis's *sensory information* from its eyes and antennae tells it prey is near, its powerful legs respond by striking.\"\n   - Show 2-3 minute video clip (optional) of mantis hunting to reinforce how structures support behavior.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - **Exit question:** \"If a mantis is a predator that hunts insects, which of its external structures do you think is MOST important for survival—its eyes, legs, or color? Explain your thinking.\"\n   - Collect responses to gauge understanding before moving to Elaborate.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **External structures** | Body parts on the outside of an animal's body that help it do important things like catch food, move, or hide |\n| **Adaptation** | A special part of an animal's body or a special way an animal acts that helps it survive and live successfully in its environment |\n| **Predator** | An animal that hunts and eats other animals |\n| **Sensory information** | Messages that come to an animal's brain from its eyes, ears, nose, antennae, and other body parts that help it understand what's happening around it |\n| **Camouflage** | Colors, patterns, or body shapes that help an animal hide by looking like its surroundings |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use new vocabulary to describe mantis structures.\n- Students explain the relationship between at least two structures and survival.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that external structures and sensory abilities work together to support predatory behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students deepen understanding by applying knowledge to a new context and constructing evidence-based arguments.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Comparison cards or photos of other predators (hawk, cat, wolf, or other mantis species)\n- \"Structure Detective\" comparison chart (pre-made template)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Index cards for argumentation activity\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Predator Comparison (Recommended for most learners)**\n\n1. **Display photographs of 2-3 other predators** (e.g., hawk, cat, spider) alongside the mantis image.\n\n2. **Guide students to complete a comparison chart:**\n   - Rows: \"Animal Name,\" \"Eyes/Vision,\" \"Legs/Feet,\" \"Other Special Structures,\" \"Type of Prey\"\n   - Columns: Praying Mantis, [Predator 2], [Predator 3]\n\n3. **Facilitate discussion:**\n   - \"How are the eyes of a hawk different from a mantis? Why?\"\n   - \"Do all predators have the same leg structure? Why might they be different?\"\n   - \"What does this tell us about how animals' structures are designed for their specific lifestyles?\"\n\n4. **Conclude:** Different predators have different structures because they hunt in different ways and hunt different prey.\n\n**Option B: Build-and-Test Investigation**\n\n1. **Students design a \"hunting chamber\"** using a small box, tissue paper, and craft materials.\n\n2. **Challenge:** Build a fake insect using pipe cleaners and hide it in the chamber using camouflage strategies.\n\n3. **Other students use \"mantis claws\"** (pipe cleaners taped to a dowel or pencil) to locate and \"catch\" the hidden prey.\n\n4. **Debrief:** How did camouflage affect whether prey was found? How did the \"mantis claw\" structure affect hunting success?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate comparisons without leading to a single \"correct\" answer.\n- Encourage students to justify their observations with evidence from the images.\n- Ask: \"What evidence from the photograph supports your comparison?\"\n- Circulate and record examples of strong reasoning for the Evaluate phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify structural similarities and differences among predators.\n- Students explain why different predators have different structures (adapted to their hunting style and prey).\n- Students apply understanding of structures and functions to a new context.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how external structures support animal survival and how sensory information supports behavior.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during the Engage discussion questions.\n- Review the \"Mantis Detective Sheet\" drawings and predictions for accuracy and depth of thinking.\n- Listen to student explanations during the Explore sensory stations.\n- Assess vocabulary use and accuracy during the Explain phase.\n- Note quality of reasoning during the Elaborate comparison activity.\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with an index card or digital form and ask them to respond to **all three questions**:\n\n1. **Structure-Function Connection:** \"Draw or describe one external structure of the praying mantis and explain how it helps the mantis survive.\"\n\n2. **Sensory Response:** \"The mantis's eyes and antennae help it sense things in its environment. Explain how the mantis might respond if its eyes detect a moving insect and its antennae sense vibrations.\"\n\n3. **Argumentation:** \"Is the praying mantis well-adapted (well-suited) to be a predator? Use evidence from the photograph to support your answer. (Hint: Think about its color, eyes, and legs.)\"\n\n**Success Criteria – Students Demonstrate Understanding When They:**\n\n- ✓ Identify at least 2 external structures with accurate labels (eyes, legs, antennae, head shape, color).\n- ✓ Explain how at least one structure supports a survival function (hunting, detecting prey, hiding, moving).\n- ✓ Use vocabulary correctly (external structure, adaptation, predator, sensory information, camouflage).\n- ✓ Make a claim and support it with specific evidence from the photograph (e.g., \"The mantis is a good predator because its forward-facing eyes help it see prey, and its powerful legs help it catch them\").\n- ✓ Show understanding that sensory information (from eyes, antennae) leads to behavioral responses (striking, hunting).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will correctly identify and describe 2-3 structures and their functions.\n- Many students will construct a multi-part argument connecting at least two structures to predatory success.\n- Some students will demonstrate sophisticated understanding of how sensory input triggers behavioral response.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Detective Sheet:** Provide a worksheet with labeled diagrams of the mantis (pre-drawn) where students only need to fill in blanks: \"This is the mantis's _____. It looks like _____. I think it helps the mantis _____.\" Offer a word bank with options: (eyes/legs/antennae), (sharp/green/big), (see prey/catch food/hide).\n\n2. **Guided Sensory Stations:** Pair struggling students with a peer buddy or aide who asks guiding questions at each station. Provide sentence starters: \"I noticed that my eyes can _____ better when _____.\" \"The bent pipe cleaner helps me because _____.\"\n\n3. **Visual-Heavy Exit Ticket:** Allow students to draw their response to the exit ticket questions instead of writing, with verbal explanation to the teacher for scoring the \"sensory response\" and \"argumentation\" portions.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-Species Comparison:** Provide images of 4-5 different insect predators (mantis, dragonfly, robber fly, antlion). Challenge students to: (a) Sort them by shared structures, (b) Hypothesize which has the best vision, (c) Predict which hunts in which environment, and (d) Defend their predictions with structural evidence.\n\n2. **Sensory Limitations Investigation:** Present scenarios: \"What if the mantis lost one eye?\" \"What if its legs were straight instead of bent?\" \"What if its body turned bright red instead of green?\" Students predict and explain how each change would affect survival and hunting success.\n\n3. **Design-a-Predator Challenge:** Students sketch a fictional creature adapted to hunt a specific prey (e.g., \"an insect that hunts fish in water\"). They must include at least 4 external structures, label them, and justify each choice with evidence about how it supports hunting or survival in that environment.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Mantis Lifecycle Investigation:** Students research the complete life cycle of a praying mantis (egg, nymph stages, adult) and create a poster or digital presentation explaining how external structures change as the mantis grows and how these changes affect survival at each stage. (Connects to understanding growth and life cycles.)\n\n2. **Garden Food Web:** Using the mantis as a central organism, students research and diagram a complete food web showing what the mantis eats (prey), what eats the mantis (predators), and what plants support the insects the mantis hunts. They identify how each organism's structures help it survive in this interconnected system. (Connects to ecosystems and organism relationships.)\n\n3. **Mantis vs. Other Hunters:** Students select a different predator (bird, spider, snake) and create a comparison poster or presentation showing how that animal's external structures are adapted differently from the mantis—even though both hunt. They explain why different structures work for different environments and hunting strategies. (Connections to adaptation and environmental diversity.)\n\n4. **Sensory Simulation Experiments:** Design controlled experiments testing how changes to sensory input affect hunting success (e.g., \"Can I catch prey with my eyes closed?\" \"Does distance affect how well I can spot camouflaged prey?\"). Students collect data and create bar graphs showing results. (Strengthens scientific investigation skills and quantitative reasoning.)\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- Live praying mantises are excellent to have in the classroom (if available locally), but photographs provide safe, manageable observation opportunities.\n- The mantis photograph's sharp detail of external structures makes it ideal for meeting 4-LS1-1 (identifying structures and their functions).\n- The proximity of the mantis to flowers and other insects in the photograph naturally invites discussion about sensory detection and predatory behavior, supporting 4-LS1-2.\n- This lesson sets a foundation for future learning about ecosystems, food chains, and how organism adaptations reflect evolutionary responses to environmental pressures.",
