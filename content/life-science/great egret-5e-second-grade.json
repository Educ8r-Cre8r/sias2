Identify and describe special body parts of the great egret that help it survive in water habitats.\n2. Compare animals and plants that live in water habitats with those that live in other places.\n3. Explain why the egret's long legs and beak are important for living near water.\n4. Make observations of different habitats and describe how animals and plants fit in each one.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by introducing an unusual animal and activate thinking about how animals fit their habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large projected or printed image of the great egret (photograph provided)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. I want you to notice something very interesting about this bird.\"\n\n2. **Ask these specific questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you notice about this bird's legs? Why do you think they are so long?\"\n   - \"Look at its beak. What shape is it? Why do you think it looks like that?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this bird lives? What clues do you see in the picture?\" (Point to water, plants, rocks.)\n   - \"What do you think this bird eats, and how might its body help it find food?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Say, \"I wonder… if this bird had short, stubby legs like a chicken, would it be able to live in the water like this? Why or why not? Turn to a partner and share your ideas.\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper. Validate all responses without correcting yet.\n\n**Transition:** \"You have great ideas about why this bird looks the way it does! Let's do an activity where we explore how special body parts help animals survive.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover through investigation how different body structures help animals live in different places.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Per student pair:\n  - Small plastic cup or container filled with water (4–6 inches deep)\n  - Small pebbles or beads (to represent small fish or food)\n  - Four straws of different lengths (cut to: 2 inches, 4 inches, 6 inches, and 8 inches)\n  - One paper clip or clothespin (to represent a \"beak\")\n  - Paper towels\n  - Recording sheet with simple drawings of the cups and straws (pre-drawn outlines)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Fill your cup with water. Put 5–8 pebbles on the bottom. These pebbles represent little fish that an egret eats.\"\n\n2. \"We're going to test which 'leg length' helps catch food best! Take the shortest straw first (2 inches). Slide the paper clip onto the end. This is your 'beak.'\"\n\n3. \"Try to pick up pebbles from the bottom of the water using just your straw 'beak' and 'legs.' Count how many pebbles you can pick up in 30 seconds. Write or draw the number on your paper.\"\n\n4. \"Empty your caught pebbles back into the cup. Now try the 4-inch straw. Repeat. Then try the 6-inch and 8-inch straws. Each time, count and record.\"\n\n5. \"Talk with your partner: Which leg length helped you catch the most food? Why?\"\n\n**How this connects to the photograph:**\n\"The egret in the picture has very long legs—just like our longest straws! This helps it reach deeper into the water to find food.\"\n\n**What students should record:**\n- A simple chart or drawing showing how many pebbles were caught with each straw length\n- A picture or words about which length worked best\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Which straw helped you reach deeper?\" \"Did longer legs catch more food? Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answer; let them discover through trial.\n- Manage water spills with paper towels; keep activity hands-on and playful.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents will discover that longer \"legs\" (straws) allow them to reach deeper water and \"catch\" more \"food\" (pebbles). They will make the connection that body structures matter for survival.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and help students understand how the egret's body is perfectly adapted for its habitat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- Photograph of the egret (displayed again)\n- Simple habitat chart showing water habitat vs. land habitat\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask pairs to share one discovery: \"What did you learn about which leg length caught the most food?\" Create a simple class chart showing results. Celebrate that most discovered longer is better.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** using student-friendly definitions:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds what it needs (food, water, shelter). |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or way of acting that helps an animal survive in its habitat. |\n| **Beak** | The hard, pointed mouth part of a bird used to catch and eat food. |\n| **Wetland** | A wet, watery habitat with water, plants, and muddy ground where birds like egrets live. |\n| **Body Structure** | The shape and parts of an animal's body. |\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the egret's legs: \"The egret has LONG legs. This is an adaptation. It helps the egret walk in deep water without getting wet. It helps the egret catch fish!\"\n   - Point to the beak: \"The egret's beak is long and pointy. This is also an adaptation. It works like a spear to catch slippery fish!\"\n   - Point to the water in the photo: \"This is a wetland habitat. The egret is perfectly built for living here.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:** Ask:\n   - \"Can anyone show me the egret's adaptation for catching food?\" (Point to beak and legs.)\n   - \"Why is the water in this picture the egret's habitat?\"\n   - \"If we gave the egret short legs, would it be happy in this wetland? Why not?\"\n\n**Vocabulary Summary:** Display or point to the vocabulary chart. Have students repeat terms aloud together once.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents understand that the egret's long legs and pointed beak are adaptations that help it live and eat in a water habitat. They can use the word \"adaptation\" and \"habitat\" correctly in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by comparing how different animals are adapted to different habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of 4–5 different animals (great egret, duck, owl, squirrel, and one more—e.g., rabbit or turtle)\n- Habitat cards showing water, forest, and grassland\n- Chart paper labeled \"What Body Parts Help Animals Survive?\"\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the comparison task:** \"Now we know that the egret's body is perfect for living in water. But not all animals live in water! Let's think about how other animals are built for their habitats.\"\n\n2. **Display picture cards** one at a time. For each animal, ask:\n   - \"Where does this animal live?\" (Students point to or name the habitat.)\n   - \"What body parts help it survive there?\" (Encourage observations: wings, claws, thick fur, etc.)\n   - \"How is it different from the egret?\"\n\n3. **Create a class comparison chart:**\n   - Draw or write: \"Egret has long legs for wading. Duck has webbed feet for swimming. Owl has big eyes for seeing at night. Squirrel has sharp claws for climbing trees.\"\n   - Keep language simple and visual.\n\n4. **Reflect together:** \"Every animal has special body parts for its home. The egret is built for water. The squirrel is built for trees. Neat, right?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion without lecturing; ask questions that prompt observation.\n- Accept all reasonable answers about body-part functions.\n- Write student observations on the chart in their own words when possible.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents can identify at least 2 other animals, name their habitats, and describe one body part adaptation for each. They recognize that different habitats need different body structures.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal adaptations and habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- Observe during the Explore phase: Can students predict that longer straws catch more food?\n- Listen during group discussions: Do students use the words \"adaptation\" and \"habitat\" correctly?\n- Circulate and ask: \"Why do you think the egret needs long legs?\" Grade understanding on a scale: *Not yet / Developing / Proficient.*\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with a simple sheet that includes:\n- A picture of the egret\n- Three questions (use pictures + words or have students draw):\n\n1. **Draw or write:** What does the egret use to catch fish?\n   - *Success criterion:* Student points to or draws the beak and/or legs.\n\n2. **Draw or write:** Why does the egret have long legs?\n   - *Success criterion:* Student indicates it helps the egret reach into water or walk in water.\n\n3. **Choose one:** The egret lives in a _____ habitat. \n   - Options: water, forest, sky\n   - *Success criterion:* Student selects \"water.\"\n\n**Alternative Exit Ticket (verbal, for English language learners or struggling students):**\nAsk one-on-one: \"Show me the egret's legs. Why are they long?\" Accept one-word or gesture answers; record their response.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly identify the egret's beak and legs as adaptations.\n- Students explain (in words, drawings, or gestures) that long legs help the egret survive in water.\n- Students identify water as the egret's habitat.\n- At least 80% of students meet these success criteria.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Reduce the number of straws in Explore:** Use only 2–3 straw lengths (2 inches and 6 inches) instead of four. This simplifies the comparison.\n\n2. **Use a picture sequence card during Explain:** Provide a laminated card showing: \"Long legs → reach water → catch fish → survive.\" Have students trace or point to each step as you explain.\n\n3. **Pair with a strong partner:** During activities, assign a supportive peer who can model thinking aloud: \"I think the longer straw will work because…\"\n\n4. **Simplify vocabulary:** Use \"long legs,\" \"pointy mouth,\" \"water home\" instead of technical terms initially. Introduce formal vocabulary after concrete understanding develops.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Extend the Explore investigation:** Ask: \"What if the water was very shallow? What if it was super deep? How would that change what leg length works best?\" Have students predict and test with cups of different water depths.\n\n2. **Compare three habitats in depth:** Provide pictures of a saltwater marsh, freshwater pond, and river. Ask: \"How might an egret's body be different if it lived in each habitat? Why?\" Encourage detailed drawings or written explanations.\n\n3. **Introduce food chains:** \"The egret eats fish. What do fish eat? What eats the egret?\" Create a simple food chain diagram with student input.\n\n4. **Research extension:** Provide a short, illustrated paragraph about another water bird (heron, crane, stork). Ask: \"How is this bird like the egret? How is it different? Why?\" Have students create a Venn diagram or comparison poster.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Habitat Diorama:** Students build a small water habitat scene using a shallow box, blue paper (water), clay plants, rocks, and a paper egret model. They label adaptations and describe why the habitat is the egret's home. (30–45 minutes)\n\n2. **\"If I Were an Egret\" Creative Writing:** Students draw or write about a day in the life of an egret, including what it eats, where it walks, and how its body helps it. Primary students can dictate to you or use a sentence frame: \"My legs are long so I can ___. My beak is pointy so I can ___.\" (20–30 minutes)\n\n3. **Wetland Habitat Walk:** If your school has access to a pond, marsh, or garden (like the one in the photograph), take a nature walk. Students observe real plants, water, and animals. They draw or photograph examples and discuss: \"What bodies do these animals have? How do they fit here?\" (45–60 minutes, location-dependent)\n\n4. **Interactive Read-Aloud:** Read an age-appropriate picture book about wetland birds (e.g., *The Lonely Egret* by Linda Ashman or *National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Animals*). Pause to discuss adaptations and habitats. (20–30 minutes)\n\n5. **Adaptation Sort Game:** Create cards with animal pictures and adaptation cards (e.g., \"long beak,\" \"webbed feet,\" \"sharp claws\"). Students match animals to their adaptations and explain why each pairing makes sense. (15–20 minutes)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** Supervise water activities closely to prevent spills and slipping. Have paper towels readily available.\n- **Inclusivity:** The hands-on Explore phase works well for kinesthetic learners. Verbal discussions support language development. Visual supports (pictures, charts) help all learners.\n- **Authentic connection:** The photograph is from a real garden habitat, which makes the learning tangible. If possible, show students the reflection of water or plants in the photo to deepen observation.\n- **Timing flexibility:** This lesson can be split across two 45-minute sessions: Day 1 = Engage + Explore; Day 2 = Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate. Or run as one extended 90-minute block with a movement break between Explore and Explain.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson honors the 5E model by building from curiosity to hands-on discovery to formal explanation and application, all grounded in the rich details of the photograph.",
