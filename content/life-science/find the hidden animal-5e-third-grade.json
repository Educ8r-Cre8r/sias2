ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the rocky habitat with lizards\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"I Spy\" thinking sheet (simple printed form with columns for \"What I See\" and \"What I Wonder\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as printed copies (one per pair). Do NOT tell students what the focus is yet.\n\n2. **Pose an intriguing challenge:** \"I'm going to show you a picture, and I want you to look very, very carefully. There are **animals hiding in this picture**. Your job is to find them! Take 1-2 minutes and try to spot any living things.\"\n\n3. **Use these specific discussion questions** (pause after each to allow thinking time):\n   - \"Did you find anything? What did you see that made you think it was an animal?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this animal is so hard to see? What colors do you see in the picture?\"\n   - \"How might hiding help this animal stay safe?\"\n   - \"What other animals do you know that hide? How do they hide?\"\n\n4. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** \"Scientists call it **camouflage** when animals blend into their surroundings so predators can't see them easily. I wonder: **What color would an animal need to be to hide in this rocky place?**\"\n\n5. **Record student responses** on chart paper. Save this chart for the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Now you're going to be explorers and discover how animals hide by creating your own camouflage challenge.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small plastic or toy animals (or hand-drawn paper animals) in various colors: bright red, bright blue, green, tan, brown, gray, white\n- Small pebbles, gravel, and sand (enough for pairs to have a shallow tray or shallow box lid)\n- Index cards or white paper (to create a simple background habitat)\n- Data recording sheet with columns: \"Animal Color,\" \"Easy to Find?\" (Yes/No), and \"Why?\"\n- Optional: timer or stopwatch\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"You and your partner will create a rocky habitat like the one in the picture. Fill your tray or box lid with gravel, pebbles, and sand. Mix them up so it looks jumbled.\"\n\n2. \"Your teacher will give you animals in different colors. One partner will close their eyes while the other **places one animal in the habitat and hides it as best as they can** (it can stick out a little, but try to blend it in).\"\n\n3. \"The partner with closed eyes will open them and try to **find the animal in 30 seconds** (or use a timer). Record whether it was easy or hard to find on your data sheet.\"\n\n4. \"Switch roles. Try this with **at least 5 different colored animals**. Record your results each time.\"\n\n5. \"After trying all the animals, look at your data and talk with your partner: **Which colors were hardest to find? Which were easiest? Why?**\"\n\n**How the activity connects to the photograph:**\nJust as the lizards in the rocky habitat blend in with tan, brown, and gray tones, students will discover that animals matching the habitat's colors are harder to spot.\n\n**What students should record:**\n- A simple data table showing which animal color, whether it was found easily, and a reason why\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to listen to student thinking, but **do not guide them to \"correct\" answers yet**\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why do you think that color was easy/hard to find?\" and \"What colors does your habitat have?\"\n- Ensure all students get a turn finding and hiding animals\n- Observe which students make connections between animal color and habitat color\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents discover that animals with colors matching their habitat (brown, tan, gray) are harder to find than bright colors (red, blue). They develop the concept that **matching the environment helps survival**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Photograph of the rocky habitat (displayed again)\n- Chart with vocabulary and simple illustrations\n- Picture cards of animals in their habitats (optional: camouflaged animals like a fawn in tall grass, moth on bark, stick insect on branch)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Ask pairs to share one finding:\n   - \"What color animal was hardest to find in your habitat?\"\n   - \"Why do you think that color worked best?\"\n   \n   Record responses on a new chart titled \"Why Some Animals Hide Better.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary** with Third Grade-friendly definitions and connect to the Explore activity:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Camouflage:** Colors, patterns, or shapes on an animal's body that help it blend into its habitat so it's harder to see. (Point to the photograph: \"The lizards have tan and brown colors, just like the rocks, so predators have trouble spotting them.\")\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives that has the food, water, and shelter it needs. (Point to the rocks and gravel: \"This rocky place is the habitat where these animals live.\")\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. (Explain: \"The lizard's brown color is an adaptation that helps it survive in rocky places.\")\n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts other animals for food. (Ask: \"Why would a lizard need to hide from a predator?\")\n   - **Variation:** Small differences in how animals look, even if they're the same kind of animal. (Look at the photograph: \"All these rocks are different colors and shapes—animals look different too!\")\n\n3. **Connect back to photograph and Explore:**\n   - Show the photograph again. \"Just like in your exploration, the lizards in this real habitat have colors that match the rocks. The ones with colors that match survive better because predators can't find them as easily.\"\n   - Ask: \"If a bright red lizard lived here, what do you think would happen?\" (Students predict: a bird or snake would spot it easily and eat it.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your thumbs: Do you think an animal with camouflage has a better chance of surviving? Thumbs up, down, or sideways if you're not sure.\"\n   - Ask individual students: \"Tell me one reason why the brown lizard is harder to find than a red one.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents understand that camouflage is an adaptation that helps animals survive in specific habitats. They connect the colors and patterns they observed in the Explore phase to real survival advantages.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Different habitat pictures (forest with leaves, sandy desert, snowy landscape, green grass meadow) — printed or shown on screen\n- Animal cards with pictures of various animals (some realistic, some you create) in different colors\n- \"Habitat Match\" sorting activity sheet or cards to manipulate\n- Optional: colored pencils and paper for students to design their own camouflaged animal\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Matching Challenge**\n1. Show students a new habitat (e.g., a snowy landscape).\n2. Ask: \"Which animal would survive best here? A white rabbit, a brown rabbit, or a red rabbit? Why?\"\n3. Use picture cards to sort animals into habitats where they would survive well vs. poorly.\n4. Have students explain their thinking: \"This animal would survive in this habitat because...\"\n\n**Option B: Design Your Own Camouflaged Animal**\n1. Show students a new habitat picture (e.g., sandy desert, green forest).\n2. Prompt: \"Design an animal that could hide in this habitat. What color(s) would it be? What shape?\"\n3. Students sketch/draw and label their animal.\n4. Write or tell: \"My animal survives in _____ because it is _____ colored so it can hide from _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Why did you choose that color?\" \"What predators might hunt in this habitat?\"\n- Push deeper thinking: \"Would that animal survive just as well in a different habitat? Why or why not?\"\n- Affirm reasoning: \"I like how you matched the animal's color to the habitat!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents apply the camouflage concept to new contexts. They construct claims about which organisms can survive in specific habitats based on their characteristics (connecting to 3-LS4-3).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Observe which students recognize connections between animal color and habitat blending. Listen for use of color/hiding vocabulary.\n- **During Explain:** Check responses to thumbs-up prompts and individual explanations. Are students using the word \"camouflage\" correctly?\n- **During Elaborate:** Review student drawings and explanations. Do they match habitat colors logically? Do explanations reference survival/hiding?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n\nProvide students with **one of these options** (choose based on your class):\n\n**Option 1: Picture & Question (Non-readers supported)**\n- Show a picture of an animal in a habitat (e.g., a green frog on a leaf).\n- Ask: \"Why can't a bird easily see this frog? Circle one: *Its color matches the leaf* / *It's very loud* / *It sleeps all day*\"\n- Ask: \"What would happen if this frog was bright orange?\" (Short answer or drawing)\n\n**Option 2: Short Response**\n- \"Look at this picture of a rabbit in the grass. Explain why a brown rabbit survives better in this habitat than a white rabbit.\" (2-3 sentences with support as needed)\n\n**Option 3: Show Your Thinking**\n- \"Draw an animal in a habitat where it can hide well. Label the animal and the habitat. Write one sentence: 'This animal survives here because...'\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Student correctly identifies a color-matching relationship between an animal and habitat.\n✓ Student uses the word \"camouflage\" OR explains hiding/blending in their own words.\n✓ Student provides a reason why matching colors helps survival (e.g., \"harder to see,\" \"predators can't find it\").\n✓ Student applies the concept to a different animal or habitat (Elaborate).\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Review exit tickets for evidence of camouflage understanding and habitat-matching reasoning.\n- Use the rubric: Does the student show understanding of *why* animals need camouflage? Do they explain *how* it helps survival?\n- Students who meet criteria can progress to extension activities; those needing support can participate in differentiation strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary & Visuals**\n   - Use only 2-3 vocabulary words (camouflage, habitat, hide). Skip \"predator,\" \"variation,\" and \"adaptation\" initially.\n   - Provide picture-heavy handouts with simple labels rather than reading-heavy materials.\n   - Pair with a stronger reader during partner activities.\n\n2. **Reduced Data Collection**\n   - In the Explore phase, have students try only **3 animal colors instead of 5**. Record yes/no answers without lengthy explanations.\n   - Provide a pre-made chart with color names and spaces to simply circle or check.\n\n3. **Guided Questioning**\n   - Use \"closed\" questions first (\"Is the brown animal easy to find? Yes or no?\") before open-ended reasoning.\n   - Provide sentence starters for explanations: \"This animal is hard to find because it is _____ colored like the _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-Habitat Comparison**\n   - Give students **3-4 different habitat photos** (forest, desert, snow, ocean rocks). Ask them to predict and test which animals would survive best across all habitats.\n   - Prompt: \"Can the same animal survive in all these places? Why or why not?\"\n\n2. **Design-Test-Refine Cycle**\n   - Have students design a camouflaged animal on paper, then *physically hide* a colored object in the classroom to match their design.\n   - Challenge: \"Design an animal that would be hard to find in THIS classroom (not just in nature).\"\n\n3. **Real-World Application & Research**\n   - Assign short research: \"Find a real animal that uses camouflage. Draw it in its habitat and explain how it survives.\" (May require teacher library support or guided web search.)\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if that animal's habitat changed (e.g., humans cleared the forest)? Could it still hide?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Camouflage Scavenger Hunt Outdoors**\n   - Take students outside (playground, garden, or natural area). Challenge them to find objects that blend into their surroundings (a brown leaf on brown bark, a green stick in grass, etc.).\n   - Discuss: \"Nature has lots of camouflage! What animals do you think hide using these colors?\"\n   - *Connection:* Real-world habitat observation; deepens understanding of adaptation in actual ecosystems.\n\n2. **Create a Camouflage Mobile or Display**\n   - Students cut out or draw animals and hang them on a \"habitat\" backdrop that matches the animal's color/pattern (tissue paper, painted cardboard, or collage).\n   - Label each with the animal name, habitat, and one sentence: \"This animal hides by _____.\"\n   - Display in classroom or hallway; classmates guess which animals they can find.\n   - *Connection:* Visual learning; peers practice spotting camouflaged animals.\n\n3. **Predator-Prey Role-Play Game**\n   - One student is a \"predator\" (with closed eyes) while others are \"camouflaged animals\" hiding behind or within classroom objects/structures.\n   - Reveal: animals matching the environment colors/textures hide longer; bright animals get \"caught\" first.\n   - Debrief: \"What did we learn about why colors matter for survival?\"\n   - *Connection:* Kinesthetic, engaging way to reinforce why camouflage matters; introduces predator-prey dynamics.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Pacing:** If time is tight, combine Engage and Explore into one session, then Explain-Elaborate-Evaluate in a second session.\n- **Material Prep:** Gather gravel/pebbles and toy animals in advance. Dollar stores often have inexpensive plastic animals.\n- **Photograph:** If students cannot spot the lizards in the image, let them know they're there, then point them out gradually. The difficulty in finding them **IS the lesson point**.\n- **Connection to NGSS:** This lesson emphasizes that variations in appearance (color, pattern) provide survival advantages in specific habitats, directly addressing 3-LS4-2 and 3-LS4-3.",
