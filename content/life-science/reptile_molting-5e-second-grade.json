Observe and describe the external body parts of a lizard and explain what each part helps the animal do.\n2. Compare the features of a lizard to other animals and identify how those features help them survive in plant-filled habitats.\n3. Explain why different animals have different body shapes and colors depending on where they live.\n4. Classify animals based on observable characteristics they observe in pictures or videos.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the lizard in the photograph and activate prior knowledge about animal body parts and habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the lizard on a plant (the provided photograph)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or whiteboard. Do not explain what you see yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to look carefully** and sit quietly for 10 seconds, just observing.\n\n3. **Pose these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - *\"What animal do you see in this picture? How do you know it's a lizard?\"*\n   - *\"What parts of the lizard's body can you see? Point to them.\" (Guide attention to the head, eyes, legs, tail, skin.)*\n   - *\"Why do you think the lizard is on a green plant? What might it be doing there?\"*\n   - *\"How is this lizard's color different from yours? Why might having that color help the lizard?\"*\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** *\"This lizard has four legs, a long tail, and special skin. Why do you think lizards have these body parts? What do you think they help the lizard do?\"*\n\n5. **Chart student responses** (do not correct; simply record their ideas to revisit later).\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become animal detectives and learn more about lizards by looking at real pictures and thinking about how their bodies help them survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students observe and investigate the external features of lizards and other animals, discovering how different body parts help animals survive in different habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed images or photos of: a lizard, a bird, a squirrel, a fish, and a snake (one set per pair of students, or displayed on document camera)\n- Observation recording sheets (see below)\n- Pencils and crayons\n- Optional: hand lenses (magnifying glasses)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs or small groups.**\n\n2. **Distribute the animal image set** to each group (or project images one at a time).\n\n3. **Model observation first** using the lizard photo:\n   - *\"I see the lizard has four legs. Let me draw them on my paper.\"*\n   - *\"The lizard has a long tail. I'll label that.\"*\n   - *\"The lizard's skin has a brown and white pattern. I'll color my drawing to match.\"*\n\n4. **Give student directions:**\n   - *\"Look at each animal picture carefully. Draw or write down the body parts you see.\"*\n   - *\"For each animal, answer these questions on your sheet:*\n     - *What body parts do you see? (legs, tail, wings, fins, etc.)*\n     - *How many legs does it have?*\n     - *What colors is it?*\n     - *Where do you think this animal lives? (In a tree? In water? On the ground?)\"*\n\n5. **Students record observations** using a simple table or drawing with labels:\n\n   | Animal | Body Parts | Number of Legs | Colors | Habitat Clues |\n   |--------|------------|----------------|--------|---------------|\n   | Lizard | legs, tail, eyes, skin | 4 | brown, white | green plants |\n\n6. **Circulate and facilitate** without giving answers:\n   - *\"What do you notice about the legs?\"*\n   - *\"How is this animal different from the lizard?\"*\n   - *\"Why might those body parts be important?\"*\n\n7. **Group discussion (5 min):** Bring the class back together and ask: *\"Which animals have legs like the lizard? Which animals are different? Why do you think they're different?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will document 3-4 observable features of each animal (legs, tail, wings, color, texture).\n- Students will notice differences and similarities (e.g., lizards and birds have legs; fish don't).\n- Students will begin to infer connections between body parts and habitats (e.g., lizards climb plants, birds fly).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific explanations for why different animals have different body features based on their habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Lizard photograph (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- Simple habitat cards or pictures (forest, grassland, water)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Review student observations** from the Explore phase:\n   - *\"Great detectives! You found that animals have different body parts. Let's talk about why.\"*\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions:\n   - **External parts (or body parts):** The parts of an animal you can see on the outside—like legs, eyes, tail, skin, wings, fins.\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and live in its home.\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives (forest, pond, grassland, desert).\n   - **Diversity:** Different kinds of animals that look different from each other.\n\n3. **Explain using the lizard photograph:**\n   - *\"The lizard has four legs. This is an adaptation! The legs help the lizard hold onto plants and climb. Without legs, the lizard couldn't stay on this leaf.\"*\n   - *\"The lizard's tail is long and thin. Why might that help? The tail helps the lizard balance and also helps it move quickly if something scary comes near.\"*\n   - *\"Look at the colors—brown and white patches. This helps the lizard hide among plants! We call this camouflage. It's an adaptation that helps the lizard stay safe.\"*\n\n4. **Compare to other animals** (use images from Explore):\n   - *\"A fish doesn't have legs—it has fins! Fins help the fish move through water. The lizard couldn't breathe underwater, but the fish can. Different animals, different adaptations!\"*\n   - *\"A bird has wings. The lizard has legs. Why? Because birds live in the air and trees; lizards live on the ground and plants. Each animal's body parts fit its home.\"*\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - *\"Turn to a partner: Why do you think the lizard has four legs instead of two legs like a person?\"*\n   - *\"Thumbs up if you think: adaptations help animals survive. Thumbs sideways if you're not sure.\"*\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **External parts** | The parts of an animal's body you can see on the outside (legs, tail, eyes, skin) |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or way of acting that helps an animal live in its home |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives (like a forest, pond, or grassland) |\n| **Diversity** | Many different kinds of things; having lots of variety |\n| **Camouflage** | Colors and patterns that help an animal hide by blending in with its surroundings |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will understand that different animals have different body parts because they live in different places.\n- Students will use the term \"adaptation\" to describe body features that help animals survive.\n- Students will recognize that diversity means animals look different for good reasons.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by matching animals to habitats and predicting what body parts would help animals survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Animal cards (pictures of: lizard, fish, bird, squirrel, snake—printed or digital)\n- Habitat cards (pictures of: forest, grassland, pond/water, desert, tree)\n- Chart paper\n- Optional: Drawing paper and crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Matching Game (15 min)**\n\n1. **Display habitat pictures** on the board: forest, grassland, pond, desert, tree.\n\n2. **Explain the task:** *\"We're going to match animals to their homes. Think about what body parts would help each animal live in that habitat.\"*\n\n3. **Show an animal card** (e.g., a fish).\n\n4. **Ask:** *\"Which habitat does the fish live in? Why? What body parts help it live there?\"*\n\n5. **Students respond with reasons** tied to body parts:\n   - *\"The fish lives in the pond. It has fins to swim, and gills to breathe underwater.\"*\n\n6. **Continue with 3-4 more animals**, always asking students to explain their choice using adaptations.\n\n7. **Record on chart:** Create a simple table showing each animal, its habitat, and 1-2 key adaptations.\n\n**Option B: Design a New Animal (15 min)**\n\n1. **Pose a challenge:** *\"Imagine a new animal that lives in the grassland where it's very hot and dry. What body parts would it need to survive?\"*\n\n2. **Students draw or describe their animal:**\n   - What color would it be? (Why?)\n   - How many legs would it have? (Why?)\n   - Would it have fur, scales, or something else? (Why?)\n\n3. **Share and explain:** Students present their designs and explain each body part choice using adaptations.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion without giving correct answers; guide with questions: *\"Why did you choose that body part?\"* and *\"How would that help the animal survive?\"*\n- Record student thinking on a chart to display.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will match at least 3 animals correctly to habitats and provide reasoning based on body parts.\n- Students will create a design or explanation showing that they understand the connection between adaptations and habitat.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students can observe animal features, compare them across species, and explain how adaptations relate to habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage discussion (Do they notice body parts?).\n- Review Explore observation sheets (Can they identify and record external features?).\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain and Elaborate (Do they use vocabulary correctly?).\n- Use thumbs-up/sideways/down checks for understanding.\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal for struggling readers):\n\n1. **Show the lizard photograph again.**\n\n2. **Ask students to answer (draw or write):**\n   - *\"What are two body parts you see on the lizard?\"*\n   - *\"How does one of those body parts help the lizard survive?\"*\n   - *\"Why does the lizard look different from a bird?\"*\n\n**Example Acceptable Responses:**\n\n| Question | Acceptable Response |\n|----------|-------------------|\n| Body parts? | \"Legs and tail\" or \"Eyes and skin\" |\n| How does it help? | \"The legs help it climb the plant\" or \"The tail helps it balance\" |\n| Why different from bird? | \"The lizard lives on plants; the bird flies. They need different body parts.\" |\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student identifies at least 2 external body parts correctly.\n- Student explains (in simple terms) how at least one body part helps the animal survive.\n- Student makes a basic comparison showing understanding that different animals have different adaptations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will identify basic body parts and describe simple functions.\n- Students demonstrating mastery will connect adaptations explicitly to survival and habitat.\n- Students needing support will identify body parts but may need prompting to explain function.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce choices:** Instead of showing 5 animals, focus on just 2-3 during exploration (e.g., lizard vs. fish). This makes comparison clearer.\n\n2. **Provide sentence stems:**\n   - *\"The lizard has _____, which helps it _____.\"*\n   - *\"The _____ lives in _____ because it has _____.\"*\n\n3. **Use hand lenses during observation:** Magnification helps students see details they might miss and increases engagement.\n\n4. **Pair with a peer mentor:** Pair students needing support with a student who is confident with observations; assign the struggling student the role of \"recorder\" so they stay engaged.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Introduce camouflage deeply:** Challenge students to find or draw animals that are camouflaged in their habitats. Ask: *\"Can you hide this animal in a picture so it blends in? Why does it blend in so well?\"*\n\n2. **Research and present:** Have advanced students research a specific lizard species (e.g., anole, gecko, horned lizard) and present one unique adaptation they found. Use simple online resources or library books.\n\n3. **Design a habitat:** Challenge students to design an ideal habitat for a specific animal, showing where it would hide, find food, and stay safe—all based on its adaptations.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom Animal Observation Walk:** Take students on a nature walk (or observe a window garden/plant) to spot insects, spiders, or small animals. Have them sketch or photograph observed creatures and record body parts they notice. Discuss: *\"What habitat does this animal need? What body parts help it live here?\"*\n\n2. **Animal Adaptation Sort:** Create a card sort game where students group animals by adaptation type (animals with wings, animals with long tails, animals with camouflage coloring, etc.). Discuss why some animals share adaptations.\n\n3. **Create a \"Meet the Animals\" Class Book:** Each student draws a different animal and writes one sentence about one of its adaptations. Bind into a class book titled *\"How Animals Fit Their Homes: Our Class Book of Adaptations.\"* Read aloud during circle time and leave in the class library for repeated reading.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
