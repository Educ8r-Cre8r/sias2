This lizard is in soil and leaf litter, which is its natural habitat.\n- **Camouflage and Adaptation:** The lizard's bumpy, dark-colored skin helps it blend into its rocky, sandy, and earthy surroundings, keeping it safe from predators.\n- **Biodiversity in Local Habitats:** Different animals live in different places. A garden, yard, or woodland area contains many types of plants and animals living together.\n- **Animal Needs:** Lizards need shelter (like soil and leaf litter), food (insects), water, and warmth from the sun to survive.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Where Do Lizards Live? Discovering Habitats Underground**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or three 30-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-LS4-1: Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n  - 2-LS2-2: Develop a simple model that mimics the function of an animal in dispersing seeds or pollinating plants. *(connection to how animals move through habitats)*\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- **Observe and describe** the characteristics of a lizard and its natural habitat by examining the photograph.\n- **Identify and list** at least three things that lizards need to survive in their habitat (shelter, food, water, warmth).\n- **Compare** two different habitats and explain which animals might live in each one.\n- **Create a simple model** of a lizard's habitat using natural and classroom materials.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animals and where they live using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed image of the lizard in soil/leaf litter (large enough for all students to see)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small branch or rock for passing around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or hold it up for all students to see. Ask students to sit in a circle or on the carpet where everyone has a clear view.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions** (allow 30-60 seconds of think time before calling on students):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is the animal doing?\"\n   - \"Where is this lizard? What is around it?\" *(Guide them to notice soil, leaves, rocks, sticks, darkness)*\n   - \"Why do you think the lizard is in this place? What does it need here?\" *(Listen for responses about shelter, hiding, food)*\n   - \"Have you ever seen a lizard? Where was it?\"\n\n3. **Make a wonder chart** on chart paper. Write the heading \"Questions About Lizards and Their Homes.\" Invite students to share wonderings: *\"I wonder why lizards hide in dirt...\" or \"I wonder what lizards eat.\"* Write 4-5 student wonderings on the chart. Display it throughout the lesson.\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today, we're going to discover what lizards need to live in their habitat. A habitat is the home where an animal lives. Turn to a partner and predict: What do you think a lizard needs in its habitat to stay safe and healthy?\" Allow 1-2 minutes of partner talk.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Let's explore what we learned about habitats by creating our own lizard home.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what elements make up a lizard's habitat and discover that animals need shelter, food sources, and other conditions to survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One clear plastic container (shoe box or small bin) per pair/small group\n- Potting soil or garden soil (damp, not wet)\n- Leaf litter, small twigs, bark pieces, dead leaves\n- Rocks or pebbles\n- Optional: grass clippings, plant cuttings (non-toxic)\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Hand lenses (magnifying glasses)\n- Observation sheets (pre-printed with labeled drawings: soil, rocks, leaves, shelter)\n- Pencils and crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Build the Habitat (10 minutes)**\n- Distribute one container to each pair or small group.\n- Give students these directions:\n  - \"Spread about 2 inches of soil in the bottom of your container.\"\n  - \"Add rocks, twigs, and leaves on top, just like in the picture.\"\n  - \"Create a small 'hiding place' by piling leaves and soil in one corner.\"\n  - \"Lightly spray the soil so it's a little damp (like after rain).\"\n\n- **Teacher circulates:** Ask guiding questions like *\"Why did you put that rock there? What is the lizard hiding from?\"* and *\"What do you think the lizard might eat in this habitat?\"* Do not answer directly.\n\n**Step 2: Observe and Record (10-15 minutes)**\n- Give students observation sheets with simple drawings of a soil area, rocks, leaves, and space to draw what they built.\n- Provide hand lenses and ask:\n  - \"Look closely at your habitat with the magnifying glass. What do you see?\"\n  - \"Draw or color the hiding places in your habitat.\"\n  - \"Circle the places where a lizard might find food (bugs, insects).\"\n  - \"Mark the parts that keep the lizard cool and safe.\"\n\n- Students sketch their habitat and label parts: soil, rocks, leaves, shelter.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without revealing answers. Ask students to explain *why* they built each part.\n- Prompt observations: *\"What do you notice about the damp soil compared to the dry rocks? Where might a lizard go if it gets too hot?\"*\n- Encourage students to discuss with partners: *\"What does your lizard habitat have that the photograph shows?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students build a multi-layered model containing soil, shelter, and natural materials.\n- Students observe and document features of a habitat (shelter, moisture, places to hide).\n- Students begin to understand that habitats have specific things animals need.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts about habitats and animal needs after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The original lizard photograph\n- Picture cards showing: soil, rocks, leaves, insects/food, sun\n- Vocabulary anchor chart (prepared or created with students)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes)**\n- Invite 2-3 student pairs to show their habitat models to the class.\n- Ask each group: *\"What did you include in your lizard's home? Why did you choose those things?\"*\n- Record their answers on a new chart labeled \"What Lizards Need to Survive\":\n  - Shelter (hiding places, soil, rocks)\n  - Food (insects, bugs)\n  - Water (damp soil, moisture)\n  - Warmth (sun during the day)\n\n**Step 2: Introduce Key Vocabulary**\nCreate an anchor chart with student-friendly definitions and simple pictures:\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Habitat** | The home or place where an animal lives. It has everything the animal needs. |\n| **Shelter** | A safe place where an animal can hide and rest. |\n| **Camouflage** | When an animal's colors or bumpy skin help it blend in and hide from other animals. |\n| **Adaptation** | A special feature of an animal's body that helps it survive in its habitat. |\n| **Predator** | An animal that hunts and eats other animals. |\n\n**Step 3: Connect to the Photograph**\n- Show the original lizard photo again.\n- Point to different parts and make connections:\n  - *\"The lizard's dark, bumpy skin is an adaptation. It looks like the soil and rocks around it. This is camouflage. It helps the lizard hide from predators. Why is hiding important?\"* (Safety)\n  - *\"The lizard is in the soil and leaf litter. This is its shelter. It's dark and cool here. What else might the lizard find in the soil?\"* (Food like insects and worms)\n  - *\"Is the lizard getting sun here? No—but it can crawl out onto the rocks or ground to warm up. Lizards need warmth from the sun.\"*\n\n**Step 4: Check for Understanding**\nUse **think-pair-share:**\n- \"Think: What is one thing a lizard needs in its habitat?\"\n- \"Pair: Turn and tell your neighbor.\"\n- \"Share: I'll call on a few pairs to share with the class.\"\n\nRecord their answers and affirm correct responses.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Habitat:** The home where an animal lives that has everything it needs.\n- **Shelter:** A safe, protected place for an animal to rest and hide.\n- **Camouflage:** Colors, patterns, or bumpy skin that help an animal blend in with its surroundings.\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive where it lives.\n- **Predator:** An animal that hunts other animals for food.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that a habitat includes multiple components (shelter, food, water, warmth).\n- Students can explain what camouflage is and why it helps the lizard survive.\n- Students recognize that the lizard's bumpy, dark skin is an adaptation.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by comparing two different habitats and predicting which animals might live there.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of different habitats: desert, forest, pond edge, garden, rocky area\n- Animal picture cards: lizard, frog, butterfly, beetle, salamander, mouse\n- Two large circles drawn on chart paper (Venn diagram template)\n- Habitat comparison worksheet (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Habitat Comparison (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Show students two habitat pictures side by side: **A Desert** and **A Shady Forest Floor**.\n\n2. Create a simple comparison chart on the board:\n\n   | Feature | Desert | Forest Floor |\n   |---------|--------|--------------|\n   | Sunlight | Lots of sun | Shade, shadows |\n   | Water | Very dry | Damp, wet soil |\n   | Shelter | Rocks, sandy soil | Leaves, logs, trees |\n   | Temperature | Hot | Cool |\n\n3. **Ask comparison questions:**\n   - \"Which habitat is more like the place where we found the lizard in the photo?\" (Forest floor or shady area)\n   - \"Could a lizard live in a hot desert? What would it need?\" (More shade, still needs water)\n   - \"What's different between these two habitats? Why might different animals live in each one?\"\n\n**Part B: Animal Matching Activity (5-10 minutes)**\n\n1. Display habitat picture cards (desert, forest, pond, garden, rocky area).\n2. Show animal cards one at a time (lizard, frog, butterfly, beetle, salamander, mouse).\n3. Ask students to hold up the habitat picture where that animal would most likely live.\n4. After each response, ask: *\"Why does this animal live there? What does it need in that habitat?\"*\n\nExamples:\n- **Frog → Pond/Wet Area** (\"Frogs need water and wet places.\")\n- **Lizard → Desert or Rocky Area** (\"Lizards need sun and rocks to hide under.\")\n- **Beetle → Forest Floor** (\"Beetles live under leaves and in soil, just like in our habitat model.\")\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide thinking without giving away answers. Use questions like *\"What do you notice about where this animal lives? What does it have there?\"*\n- Help students see patterns: animals live where they can find shelter, food, and water.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different habitats support different animals.\n- Students explain connections between an animal's needs and its habitat.\n- Students use prior knowledge (from Explore phase) to make predictions about new habitats.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitats, animal needs, and adaptations.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** As students build their habitats (Explore phase), observe whether they include:\n  - ☐ Shelter (hiding places, layered soil)\n  - ☐ Multiple materials (soil, rocks, leaves, twigs)\n  - ☐ Moisture (damp soil)\n  \n- **Listen to responses** during Explain and Elaborate phases:\n  - Can students name at least two things a lizard needs?\n  - Do they understand what camouflage is?\n  - Can they explain why a habitat matters?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\nProvide students with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal for struggling readers):\n\n**Option 1: Drawing with Labels**\n- Draw a lizard in its habitat.\n- Label: shelter, food, water, and sun.\n- Write or dictate one sentence: \"A lizard needs _________________ to survive.\"\n\n**Option 2: Sentence Frames** (for students who need support)\n- Complete these sentences:\n  1. \"A lizard lives in a _________________ (habitat/home).\"\n  2. \"The lizard needs _________________ to hide and stay safe.\" (shelter/soil/rocks)\n  3. \"The lizard's dark skin helps it _________________ from predators.\" (hide/camouflage/blend in)\n\n**Option 3: Quick Verbal Assessment**\nAsk individual students (while others work on their drawing):\n- \"Show me in your habitat where the lizard would sleep/hide.\"\n- \"Why is the soil in the habitat wet/damp?\"\n- \"Why did you put rocks in your habitat?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n✓ Student can identify at least **two things a lizard needs** (shelter, food, water, sun)\n✓ Student understands **habitat = a place where an animal lives with what it needs**\n✓ Student explains **why camouflage helps** (hiding, staying safe)\n✓ Student **compares** at least two habitats and identifies differences\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding through their habitat models, drawings, and verbal explanations.\n- Exit tickets show students can apply vocabulary (habitat, shelter, camouflage) correctly.\n- Students make reasonable connections between an animal's adaptations and its needs.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-teach Vocabulary:** Before Engage phase, show students pictures of each vocabulary word and repeat definitions multiple times. Create a personalized vocabulary card set they can reference during activities.\n\n2. **Simplified Habitat Model:** Provide a partially pre-built habitat container so the student only needs to add materials and observe. Offer a picture guide showing step-by-step what to add. Use a checklist instead of open-ended observation sheets.\n\n3. **Sentence Stems for Speaking:** Provide frames during discussions:\n   - \"The lizard lives in a _____.\"\n   - \"The lizard hides in _____ to stay safe.\"\n   - \"The _____ is camouflage because _____.\"\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Research and Extend:** Assign research on a **specific type of lizard** (bearded dragon, anole, horned lizard). Students create a detailed habitat diagram showing how that specific lizard's adaptations match its natural environment. Have them present to the class.\n\n2. **Predict and Test:** Challenge students to predict which materials in their habitat (soil type, moisture level, shelter depth) a lizard would prefer. Design a simple observation plan: *\"If we put two types of shelters in the habitat, where would the lizard spend more time and why?\"*\n\n3. **Compare Multiple Habitats:** Instead of two habitats, have advanced students compare three or four (desert, rainforest, temperate forest, grassland) and create a more complex Venn diagram showing which animals could survive in overlapping regions.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Field Observation Walk:**\n   - Take students on a nature walk around the school grounds, garden, or local park.\n   - Have them search for evidence of animal habitats (logs with insects underneath, shaded areas, wet spots).\n   - Collect (without harming) specimens like leaves, soil samples, insects to add to a large classroom habitat display.\n   - Discuss: \"Which habitats did we find? What animals might live here?\"\n   - *Connection: 2-LS4-1 (observing plants and animals in different habitats)*\n\n2. **Create a Classroom Habitat Poster Series:**\n   - Assign small groups different habitats (desert, forest, pond, mountains).\n   - Students create a large poster showing: the habitat, 3-4 animals that live there, 3-4 plants, and what each animal needs.\n   - Display around the classroom. Students do a gallery walk to compare habitats.\n   - Writing extension: \"Why do you think [animal] lives in [habitat]?\"\n\n3. **Pollinator & Seed Disperser Investigation:**\n   - Connect to 2-LS2-2 by showing how animals move through habitats to find food and spread seeds.\n   - Demonstration: Use a small toy lizard or insect to simulate how animals move through different terrain (soil, plants, rocks).\n   - Question: \"When the lizard walks through the garden and brushes against plants, what might stick to its body? How might seeds travel to new places?\" *(Mimics animal dispersal function)*\n   - Simple model: Students glue seeds and small twigs to a toy or stuffed lizard cutout to show how animals help spread plants as they move through habitats.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- If a live lizard is available (or a reptile handler can visit), students would benefit from safe, supervised observation. Always prioritize the animal's welfare and have students' hands clean and movements gentle.\n- The habitat models can be kept for 2-3 weeks in a classroom habitat corner, allowing continued observation and documentation of changes. This extends learning and supports scientific practices like sustained observation.\n- Soil and leaves naturally attract small invertebrates (bugs, worms). This is developmentally appropriate for second graders and models a real ecosystem. If insects appear, use it as a teachable moment: *\"What do you think the lizard will eat? It will eat these bugs!\"* Reinforce that all living things are food chains.",
