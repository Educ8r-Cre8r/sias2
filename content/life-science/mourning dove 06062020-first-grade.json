Green plants and white flowers grow around the bird in the dirt.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image captures the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of animal habitat selection and foraging behavior. The mourning dove is demonstrating how animals choose specific environments that meet their survival needs. The bird is likely foraging for seeds, insects, or small stones (grit) that help with digestion. This behavior occurs because animals have evolved specific adaptations that help them find food and shelter in environments where they can successfully survive and reproduce.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Animal Needs:** All animals need food, water, shelter, and space to survive, and they choose places that provide these things.\n\n2. **Habitat Features:** Gardens provide birds with food (seeds, insects), water, and materials for nesting, making them good habitats.\n\n3. **Animal Behavior:** Birds use their senses to find food and safe places, showing how animals interact with their environment.\n\n4. **Plant-Animal Relationships:** Gardens with plants create homes for many different animals, showing how living things depend on each other.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"See, Think, Wonder\" thinking routine with this image. Have students observe what they see, share what they think is happening, and ask questions about what they wonder. This builds scientific observation skills.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to share observations: verbal descriptions, drawings, acting out the bird's movements, or using simple sentence frames like \"I see...\" and \"The bird is...\"</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n**Zoom In:** Inside the bird's body, special muscles help move its wings and legs. The bird's eyes can see colors and movement that help it spot food and danger. Its beak is shaped perfectly for picking up small seeds and insects from the ground.\n\n**Zoom Out:** This garden is part of a larger neighborhood ecosystem where many animals live. Birds like this dove help plants by spreading seeds to new places when they fly. The dove is also food for larger animals like hawks, showing how energy moves through the food web.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"Birds only live in trees and fly all the time.\"\n   **Clarification:** Many birds spend lots of time on the ground looking for food, and some birds don't fly very much at all.\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"All birds eat the same food.\"\n   **Clarification:** Different birds have different shaped beaks and eat different foods - some eat seeds, some eat insects, and some eat fish.\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"Animals choose where to live randomly.\"\n   **Clarification:** Animals carefully choose places that give them food, water, shelter, and safety.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 1-LS1-1. Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-LS1.A]] - All organisms have external parts that they use to perform daily functions.\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-LS1.D]] - Animals use their external parts to help them find and take in food, water, and air.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] - The shape and stability of structures are related to their function.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you think this bird is looking for in the garden soil? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. How do you think the bird's feet help it walk on the ground? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n3. What other animals might live in this garden with the bird? (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 3)\n\n4. Why do you think gardens are good homes for birds? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs to survive.\n* **Foraging:** When animals search for and find food.\n* **Adaptation:** Special body parts or behaviors that help animals survive.\n* **Environment:** All the living and non-living things around an animal.\n* **Shelter:** A safe place where animals can hide and rest.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Are You My Mother?* by P.D.
