Students can observe that plants produce seeds as a method of reproduction and dispersal.\n- **Seed dispersal mechanisms:** The visible seeds and their packaging within the fruit demonstrate how plants protect and disperse their offspring to new locations.\n- **Internal plant structures and function:** The cutaway view reveals the relationship between the fruit flesh, internal cavity, and seed arrangement—showing students how different plant parts work together to support reproduction.\n- **Materials cycling through plants:** Seeds require nutrients and water from soil and air to develop; the fruit flesh represents stored energy that supports seed growth and potential dispersal.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n**Seeds Inside: Discovering How Plants Make and Spread New Life**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-LS1-1: Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.\n  - 5-LS2-1: Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Identify and describe** the internal structures of a fruit and explain the function of each part in seed development and dispersal.\n2. **Explain** how plants use air and water to grow seeds and develop fruits, supporting the argument with observable evidence.\n3. **Model** the movement of water, nutrients, and energy through a plant as it grows and produces seeds.\n4. **Analyze** how seed dispersal helps plants spread to new environments and compete for resources.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about plant reproduction and activate prior knowledge about seeds and fruits.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Printed or projected photograph of the cut squash halves\n  - Real whole squash or pumpkin (if available) to pass around\n  - Chart paper and markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n  Display the photograph of the two cut squash halves side by side on a large screen or printed poster. Ask students to look carefully before speaking.\n  \n  **Discussion Questions:**\n  1. \"What do you notice inside this fruit that you might not have expected to see?\"\n  2. \"Why do you think these seeds are nestled in all that stringy, orange stuff? What job might that do?\"\n  3. \"If you were a seed, what would you need to grow into a new squash plant?\"\n  4. \"How do you think this seed might travel from the garden where this squash grew to a completely different place?\"\n\n  **Prediction Prompt:** \"In your science notebook, sketch what you think happens inside a squash plant underground and in the air while it's growing fruit and seeds. Label the parts you think matter most.\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become scientists and investigate the hidden world inside fruits to understand how plants make babies and send them out into the world.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students investigate fruit and seed structure firsthand, discovering the relationship between plant parts and their functions.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - 1 whole squash, pumpkin, or melon per pair of students (or halved in advance for safety)\n  - 1 sharp knife per pair (teacher-provided and supervised, or pre-cut)\n  - Paper plates\n  - Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n  - Paper towels\n  - Small containers to collect and sort seeds\n  - Science notebook or exploration worksheet\n  - Spoons for scooping seeds and pulp\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n  1. **Observe the outside:** Before cutting, examine the whole fruit. What color is it? Is it smooth or bumpy? How heavy does it feel? Record your observations in your science notebook with a quick sketch.\n\n  2. **Cut and explore (with teacher supervision or using pre-cut halves):** Carefully slice your fruit in half. Look inside without removing anything yet. What do you see? Draw a labeled diagram showing the fruit wall, the inside cavity, the stringy fibers, and the seeds.\n\n  3. **Separate the parts:** Using a spoon, carefully scoop out the seeds and the stringy, fibrous material (placenta) into a paper plate. Observe how the seeds are attached or embedded in this material. Why do you think they're packed in so tightly?\n\n  4. **Examine individual seeds:** Use a hand lens to look closely at a single seed. Describe its shape, color, size, and surface texture. Do all seeds look identical? Record variations you notice.\n\n  5. **Feel the fruit flesh:** Touch the inner wall of the fruit (the orange or yellow flesh). Is it firm or soft? Watery or dry? Taste a small piece if appropriate and safe. What does this flesh taste like? Why might a plant make this sweet, fleshy coating around seeds?\n\n  6. **Think about protection and travel:** Hold a seed in your hand. Imagine this seed alone in dry soil—would it survive? Now imagine it still wrapped in the moist, nutrient-rich pulp. How is it better protected? How might this fruit help the seed get to a new place?\n\n  7. **Document your thinking:** In your notebook, answer: *\"What is the job of the fruit flesh? What is the job of the stringy fibers? What is the job of the seed itself?\"*\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate to ensure safe cutting and handling.\n  - Ask guiding questions without giving answers: *\"What do you notice about how the seeds are arranged?\" \"Why might that arrangement matter?\" \"What would happen to a seed if it fell out of the fruit right here on the concrete?\"*\n  - Prompt students to compare observations: *\"Does every pair's fruit look the same inside? Why or why not?\"*\n  - Encourage use of senses (safe observation only): *\"Describe what you smell. What might that smell tell us about what's happening inside the fruit?\"*\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students will recognize that seeds are surrounded by protective, nutrient-rich tissue.\n  - Students will observe that multiple seeds are produced in a single fruit.\n  - Students will begin to infer relationships between fruit structure and seed protection/dispersal.\n  - Students will record detailed observations and labeled diagrams in their science notebooks.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and connect observations to plant reproduction and material movement in ecosystems.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Diagram of plant structure (root, stem, leaves, flower, fruit, seed)\n  - Vocabulary cards or poster\n  - Samples from Explore phase (if available, or photographed versions)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Group Share-Out:**\n  Invite 3-4 student pairs to briefly share one observation or discovery from their exploration. Write key words and ideas on chart paper as students share. Examples: *seed, protection, water, nutrients, dispersal, fruit flesh, fiber.*\n\n  **Introduce Key Vocabulary and Concepts:**\n\n  Display each term visually (using the photograph or actual fruit samples) and provide student-friendly definitions:\n\n  - **Seed:** The part of a plant that contains a baby plant (called an embryo) and stored food. Seeds need water, air, and the right temperature to grow into new plants.\n  \n  - **Fruit:** The ripened part of a flowering plant that holds and protects seeds. The fruit flesh is often sweet or nutritious to attract animals that help spread seeds.\n  \n  - **Placenta (in plants):** The spongy, stringy tissue inside the fruit that connects seeds to the fruit and holds nutrients and water to keep seeds healthy.\n  \n  - **Dispersal:** The way seeds travel from the parent plant to new places where they might grow. This can happen by wind, water, animals, or gravity.\n  \n  - **Pollination/Reproduction:** The process by which a flowering plant makes seeds. Pollen from one flower fertilizes another flower, creating seeds and eventually fruit.\n\n  **Connection to Image and Explore Activity:**\n  *\"When you cut open that squash, you were looking at a fully grown fruit packed with seeds. Each of those seeds started as a tiny flower part. The plant used water from the soil and nutrients from the air (through photosynthesis) to grow the fruit flesh and feed the developing seeds. The fruit is like a lunchbox—it protects the seeds and gives them energy. When an animal eats that fruit or it rots on the ground, the seeds can spread to a new place where they might grow into new squash plants!\"*\n\n  **Check for Understanding:**\n  Ask questions that require students to apply their learning:\n  - *\"If we plant a squash seed in dry soil with no water, what might happen? Why?\"*\n  - *\"A squash plant has leaves, roots, flowers, and fruit. Which parts do you think get materials from air and water?\"*\n  - *\"How does the stringy pulp inside help the seed get the materials it needs?\"*\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Seed:** A package containing a baby plant and stored food; needs water and air to grow.\n  - **Fruit:** The part of a plant that grows around seeds to protect and disperse them.\n  - **Placenta (plant):** Spongy tissue that connects seeds to the fruit and supplies them with water and nutrients.\n  - **Dispersal:** The movement of seeds away from the parent plant to new locations.\n  - **Embryo:** The tiny baby plant inside a seed.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students will understand that seeds need water and air to develop and that fruits are adaptations for seed protection and dispersal.\n  - Students will connect their observations to the concept of how plants move nutrients through their structures.\n  - Students will begin to recognize that all parts of a plant (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits) work together to support reproduction.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding by modeling how water and nutrients move through a plant during fruit and seed development.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Tall clear glasses or plastic cups (1 per student or pair)\n  - Celery stalks with leaves attached\n  - Water\n  - Food coloring (red, blue, or green)\n  - Paper towels\n  - Scissors\n  - Science notebook\n  - Optional: white carnations or other white flowers\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Celery Capillary Action Demonstration/Experiment:**\n\n  Introduce the activity: *\"We watched the fruit grow and fill with seeds. But how does water and nutrients actually get from the soil where the roots are all the way up to where the fruit and seeds grow? Let's model this journey.\"*\n\n  **Step-by-Step Directions:**\n\n  1. Fill a clear cup about 3/4 full with water and add several drops of food coloring. Stir gently.\n\n  2. Cut the bottom inch off a fresh celery stalk at an angle (to maximize surface area).\n\n  3. Place the celery stalk in the colored water. Make a prediction: *\"How high do you think the colored water will travel up the celery in the next 24 hours? What part of the plant do you think will show the color first—the leaves, the stalk, or somewhere else?\"*\n\n  4. Observe the setup immediately and record what you see. Leave it undisturbed for 24 hours (or overnight).\n\n  5. **After 24 hours** (Day 2 of lesson or as a follow-up):\n     - Examine the celery. You should see colored water in the leaves and throughout the stalk.\n     - Cut the stalk crosswise and look at the circular end. You'll see colored dots or lines—these are the vascular tubes (like tiny highways) that carried the water upward.\n     - Optional: Cut the stalk lengthwise and observe the colored tubes running the full length.\n\n  6. **Connection to Real Plants:**\n     *\"When a squash plant grows, water and nutrients travel from the roots in the soil up through these same kinds of tubes. The water carries minerals from the soil. The leaves use sunlight to make sugar (food). All of this—water, minerals, and food—travels throughout the plant to feed growing flowers, then fruits, then seeds. Without these materials from air and water, the seeds could never develop.\"*\n\n  7. **Record in Your Notebook:**\n     - Draw and label what you observed.\n     - Explain: *\"What does this experiment teach us about how plants use water? Why is this important for making seeds?\"*\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Set up the celery experiment and facilitate observation.\n  - Ask students to explain connections: *\"How is this celery like a real squash plant? Where do the roots connect in a real plant? What journey does the water take?\"*\n  - Encourage prediction and hypothesis-testing thinking.\n  - Guide students to link this mechanism to the Explore phase: *\"The colored water in the celery is like the nutrients and water that had to reach the seeds inside your squash to help them grow.\"*\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students will observe evidence that water moves upward through plant structures.\n  - Students will connect the movement of water in plants to the concept of material movement (5-LS2-1).\n  - Students will deepen their understanding that plants require water and materials from air to grow seeds.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant reproduction, seed structure, and the role of water and air in plant growth.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n  - Observation of student questions and discussions during Explore phase.\n  - Review of sketches and labels in science notebooks.\n  - Listen for understanding during group share-out and explanation phase.\n  - Monitor responses to check-for-understanding questions.\n\n  **Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket:**\n  Provide students with a brief written and/or illustrated exit ticket. Ask them to respond to **at least three** of the following prompts:\n\n  1. **Labeled Diagram:** Draw the inside of a fruit. Label: seed, fruit flesh, fiber/placenta. Next to your diagram, write one sentence explaining what job each part does.\n\n  2. **Argument with Evidence:** *\"Plants need air and water to grow seeds. What evidence from today's investigation supports this claim?\"* (Encourage students to reference the celery experiment and the fruit they dissected.)\n\n  3. **Explanation of Movement:** *\"Explain how water from the soil travels through a plant to help seeds develop inside a fruit.\"*\n\n  4. **Application Question:** *\"Why would a squash plant make sweet, orange flesh around its seeds instead of just protecting them with a hard shell?\"* (This prompts thinking about dispersal and animal ingestion.)\n\n  5. **Reflection:** *\"What surprised you most about what you found inside your fruit? Why?\"*\n\n  **Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n  - ✓ Student accurately identifies and labels internal fruit structures (seed, flesh, fiber).\n  - ✓ Student explains that water and air are necessary for seed and fruit development, using evidence from exploration.\n  - ✓ Student describes or models the movement of water through plant structures.\n  - ✓ Student connects fruit structure to seed protection and dispersal.\n  - ✓ Student demonstrates curiosity and careful observation throughout the lesson.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Most students will articulate that seeds need water and air to grow.\n  - Students will provide evidence-based explanations of how fruit protects seeds.\n  - Students will understand that plant materials (fruit, seeds) come from nutrients absorbed by roots and energy captured by leaves.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n1. **Sentence Starters for Written Responses:** Provide pre-written sentence frames for exit tickets:\n   - *\"The seed needs _____ and _____ to grow.\"*\n   - *\"The fruit flesh helps by _____.\"*\n   - *\"Water travels through the plant by _____.\"*\n\n2. **Simplified Labeling Task:** Offer a partially labeled diagram where students only need to add 2-3 labels instead of creating their own diagram from scratch. Provide word banks with pictures.\n\n3. **Guided Observation During Explore:** Assign a peer partner or provide a structured observation checklist with boxes to check instead of open-ended documentation. Example:\n   - ☐ Seeds are soft / hard (circle one)\n   - ☐ Seeds are all the same size / different sizes\n   - ☐ The fruit flesh tastes sweet / bitter\n   - ☐ The stringy parts are wet / dry\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n1. **Seed Germination Mini-Experiment:** Have students plant seeds from the fruit they dissected and design an experiment to test which conditions (sunlight, water, temperature) are most critical for germination. They can compare the fruit seeds to store-bought seeds to ask questions about cultivated varieties.\n\n2. **Research Seed Dispersal Strategies:** Assign students to investigate and present on different dispersal methods (animal dispersal via fruit, wind dispersal via winged seeds, water dispersal, etc.). Have them identify which strategy the squash uses and hypothesize why.\n\n3. **Model the Full Nutrient Cycle:** Challenge students to create a more detailed model (poster, diagram, or written explanation) showing how water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients from soil and air move through the squash plant system—from roots → stems → leaves → flowers → fruits → seeds, and how decomposers eventually return nutrients to soil. This connects to 5-LS2-1.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Sprouting Challenge:** Provide each student with 5-10 seeds (squash, bean, or pumpkin seeds work well). Have them plant seeds in small cups with soil, water regularly, and observe germination and growth over 2-4 weeks. Students measure plant height weekly, sketch development stages, and journal about what they observe. Connect observations back to the lesson: *\"Where did the energy for this plant to grow come from? (Answer: from the seed, which grew from the fruit, which was made by the plant using water and air.)\"*\n\n2. **Fruit Dissection Gallery Walk:** If you dissected multiple types of fruits (squash, melon, apple, pepper, avocado), create a classroom gallery with students' observations, diagrams, and questions displayed at each station. Conduct a gallery walk where students examine different fruits, note similarities and differences in seed structure and fruit flesh, and answer reflection questions: *\"How are seeds protected differently in an apple vs. a squash? Why might these differences exist?\"*\n\n3. **Create a Food Web Model:** Expand 5-LS2-1 by having students create a diagram or poster showing how water, nutrients, and energy move through an ecosystem featuring the squash plant. Include: soil → roots → plant tissue → fruit (eaten by animals) → animal waste → decomposers → soil. Students can illustrate or write explanations for each step.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
