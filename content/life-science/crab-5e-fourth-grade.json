ENGAGE (12–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about the crab's unusual appearance and activate prior knowledge about how animals survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the crab (displayed on smartboard, projector, or printed large)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Video clip (30 seconds) of a crab moving on sand or using its claws\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Introduce:** Project the photograph large so all students can see the crab clearly. Ask students to sit in a semicircle where they can all view comfortably.\n\n2. **Pose an Engaging Question:** \"What do you notice about this animal? What looks unusual or interesting?\" (Allow 2–3 students to share initial observations without correcting or elaborating yet.)\n\n3. **Discussion Questions to Build Curiosity:**\n   - \"Why do you think this crab has those long, thin sticks sticking up from its head?\" (eyestalks)\n   - \"What could those big claws be used for? Why would a crab need them?\"\n   - \"This crab lives on a sandy beach. How might its color and hard shell help it survive there?\"\n   - \"If you were a crab and you saw danger coming, what would you do? How would your body help you?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if a crab's eyestalks help it see danger, what other body parts might help it sense or survive?\" Record student wonderings on chart paper.\n\n5. **Hook Statement:** \"Today, we're going to explore how every part of a crab's body—from its claws to its shell to those eyestalks—is specially designed to help it survive on the beach.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become crab detectives and investigate how each of these body parts works.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate crab structures and functions through hands-on exploration and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed crab diagram (unlabeled) for each student or pair (1 copy per 2 students)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Hand lenses (optional, for close inspection)\n- Video clip or image showing: crab digging, crab using claws, crab eyestalks moving\n- Chart showing \"Crab Body Parts Observation Sheet\" (teacher-prepared)\n- Sticky notes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Crab Structure Detective Work (10 minutes):**\n   - Display the crab photograph again and provide each student pair with an unlabeled diagram of a crab (side view, showing claws, eyestalks, legs, shell, antennae).\n   - Students use hand lenses to examine the photograph closely and identify as many external body parts as they can see.\n   - Using sticky notes, students label or write the name of each part they identify on or near the diagram (claws, eyestalks, legs, shell, antennae, walking legs, etc.).\n   - Teacher circulates and asks guiding questions: \"What do you think that part does?\" \"Why might a crab need that?\" (Do not provide answers yet.)\n\n2. **Video Evidence Observation (5 minutes):**\n   - Show a short video or image sequence showing crabs using their claws, eyestalks, or legs in action (digging, eating, sensing, defending).\n   - Students record on the observation sheet what they see each body part *doing*.\n\n3. **Small-Group Discussion (5–10 minutes):**\n   - In pairs or small groups, students discuss: \"What do you think this crab is using each body part for? How is it helping the crab survive?\"\n   - Students record their predictions on the observation sheet.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate by asking open-ended questions (\"What do you notice?\" \"What is it doing with that?\") without providing answers.\n- Encourage students to use evidence from the photograph.\n- Record student ideas on a class chart to refer back to during Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 5–7 external structures (claws, eyestalks, legs, shell, antennae).\n- Students make predictions about what each part does.\n- Students generate questions like: \"Do the eyestalks move?\" \"Are the claws strong?\" \"Can the shell protect the crab?\"\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and concepts; introduce the relationship between structure and function.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Labeled crab diagram (color or digital)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms written large\n- Photograph of crab\n- Reference video or image showing crab behavior (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out and Clarification (5–7 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3–4 student pairs to share one prediction or observation about a crab body part.\n   - After each share, teacher validates and clarifies: \"Yes! Those claws help the crab do [this specific function].\"\n   - Display the correct labeled diagram alongside student diagrams for comparison.\n\n2. **Teach Key Vocabulary with Definitions (5–8 minutes):**\n   - Present each term in student-friendly language using the photograph as visual reference:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **External Structure** | A body part on the outside of an animal that helps it survive, like legs, claws, or a shell. |\n| **Function** | The job or purpose that a body part does to help an animal live, eat, move, or protect itself. |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home (habitat). |\n| **Eyestalk** | The long, thin tube on a crab's head that has an eye at the tip, helping the crab see and sense danger around it. |\n| **Exoskeleton** | A hard shell on the outside of an animal's body that protects it, like the crab's shell. |\n| **Sensory Information** | Messages from the world around us that we receive through our eyes, ears, nose, skin, and mouth (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste). |\n\n3. **Connect Structure to Function (3–5 minutes):**\n   - Point to each structure on the labeled diagram and explicitly state its function:\n     - **Claws (chelipeds):** Used for catching food, defending against predators, and communicating with other crabs.\n     - **Eyestalks:** Hold the eyes high so the crab can see danger and food even while hiding in sand.\n     - **Legs:** Used for walking quickly across the sand and digging burrows to hide in.\n     - **Hard Shell (exoskeleton):** Protects the soft body inside from predators and keeps the crab from drying out.\n     - **Antennae:** Sense touch and smell, helping the crab find food buried in the sand.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students: \"Why would a crab living on a sandy beach *need* an eyestalk? What would happen if it didn't have one?\" (Probing for: \"It would be hard to see danger or find food.\")\n   - Ask: \"How do the crab's claws help it survive?\" (Expected: \"They catch food, defend against enemies, etc.\")\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that each external structure has a specific function related to survival.\n- Students can explain why a crab's body is adapted to life on a sandy beach.\n- Students use vocabulary like \"external structure,\" \"function,\" and \"adaptation\" correctly in context.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Deepen understanding by applying concepts to animal sensing and responding, and by comparing adaptations across animals.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Role-play scenario cards (printed or projected)\n- Picture cards of other animals (seagull, sand flea, octopus, sea turtle, starfish)\n- \"Animal Adaptation Comparison Chart\" (template)\n- Optional: Access to books or tablets for quick research\n\n**Activity:** **Choose one or both options below:**\n\n**Option A: Crab Sensory Response Model (12–15 minutes)**\n\nStudents act out or create a model showing how a crab senses and responds to its environment:\n\n1. **Scenario Role-Play (7–8 minutes):**\n   - Divide class into small groups of 3–4.\n   - Give each group a scenario card:\n     - *Scenario 1:* \"You are a crab. You sense vibrations in the sand that might be food falling. What do you do?\"\n     - *Scenario 2:* \"You are a crab. You see a seagull shadow above you. What do you do?\"\n     - *Scenario 3:* \"You are a crab. You smell food buried under the sand nearby. How do you find it?\"\n   \n2. **Create a Model (5–7 minutes):**\n   - Students physically demonstrate or draw the sequence:\n     - **Sense** (eyestalk sees / antennae smell / skin feels vibrations)\n     - **Brain processes** (animal \"decides\" what to do)\n     - **Respond** (move toward food / hide / dig / use claws)\n\n3. **Share and Discuss:**\n   - Each group briefly acts out or describes their model.\n   - Teacher labels each step: \"First, the crab *sensed* information. Then its brain *processed* it. Finally, it *responded* by...\"\n\n---\n\n**Option B: Animal Adaptation Comparison (12–15 minutes)**\n\nStudents compare crab structures to other beach/ocean animals:\n\n1. **Display Picture Cards (3 minutes):**\n   - Show images of: seagull, sand flea, octopus, sea turtle, starfish.\n   - Ask: \"These animals also live on the beach or in the ocean. How are their bodies different from the crab's?\"\n\n2. **Compare Adaptations (7–8 minutes):**\n   - Provide a comparison chart:\n\n| Animal | Habitat | External Structure | What It's Used For |\n|--------|---------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Crab | Sandy beach | Claws, eyestalks, hard shell | Catching food, sensing danger, protection |\n| Seagull | Beach/air | Wings, sharp beak, feet | Flying, catching prey, walking |\n| Sand flea | Sand | Curved body, long antennae | Jumping, burrowing, sensing |\n| (Student fills in...) | | | |\n\n   - Students fill in the chart for 1–2 other animals (use provided pictures or brief research).\n   - Discussion: \"Why does a seagull have wings instead of claws? Why does a crab have a hard shell instead of feathers?\"\n\n3. **Reasoning & Discussion (2–3 minutes):**\n   - Synthesize: \"Animals have *different* body parts because they live in *different* habitats and need to survive in *different* ways.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group discussions without providing answers; ask probing questions.\n- For role-play, help groups sequence their sensory-response model accurately.\n- For comparison, guide students to recognize that adaptations match habitats and survival needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding of the sense-brain-respond cycle.\n- Students explain that different animals have different adaptations because of their different habitats.\n- Students construct a simple argument: \"The crab has [structure] because it needs to [function] to survive on [habitat].\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5.

Write or draw:\n- *What is the structure?* (name and describe what it looks like)\n- *What does it do?* (explain its function)\n- *Why does a crab need it?* (explain how it helps the crab survive on the sandy beach)\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Identifies a specific external structure.\n- Describes its function accurately.\n- Provides a reason connected to survival or habitat.\n\n---\n\n**Option 2: Sense-Respond Model (Recommended for 4-LS1-2)**\n\"A crab is on the beach. It smells food buried in the sand. Draw or write what happens next:\n1. *The crab senses* (what does it sense with? what information does it get?)\n2. *The crab's brain* (what does the crab decide to do?)\n3. *The crab responds* (what does the crab do? which body parts does it use?)\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Correctly identifies a sensory structure (antennae for smell).\n- Describes a logical decision-making process.\n- Explains a response that uses appropriate body parts (claws, legs for digging).\n\n---\n\n**Option 3: Comparison/Application**\n\"You are designing a new animal that must survive on a sandy beach. What three external structures would it need? For each one, explain what it would do and why the animal would need it.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Lists three realistic external structures.\n- Explains function of each.\n- Connects function to beach survival.\n\n---\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students accurately identify and label at least 4 external structures of the crab.\n- Students explain the function of each structure in terms of survival (feeding, sensing, moving, protecting).\n- Students construct a simple argument using evidence: \"The crab has [structure] because [function] helps it survive because [reason].\"\n- Students demonstrate understanding of sensory input and behavioral response: sense → process → respond.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**SUPPORT (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Labeled Diagram Scaffold:**\n   - Provide a pre-labeled diagram with images of crab body parts at the top and blank lines below.\n   - Students match pictures to labels and copy terms, reducing the cognitive load of independent identification.\n   - Provide a sentence frame for writing function: \"The crab uses its _____ to _____.\"\n\n2. **Graphic Organizer:**\n   - Use a simple three-column chart: \"Body Part | Picture | What It Does.\"\n   - Pre-fill one or two rows as an example.\n   - Students complete remaining rows by selecting from a provided word bank of functions (catch food, dig, see, protect, smell).\n\n3. **Buddy Support:**\n   - Pair struggling readers/writers with proficient peers during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n   - Assign the struggling student a specific role (e.g., \"You hold the hand lens and point out the body parts; your partner writes down what you find\").\n\n4. **Simplified Exit Ticket:**\n   - Provide a multiple-choice version: \"Which body part helps a crab catch food? A) Legs  B) Claws  C) Eyestalk\"\n   - Allow verbal responses or drawing-only responses instead of writing.\n\n---\n\n**CHALLENGE (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Internal Structure Connection:**\n   - Ask: \"A crab has muscles inside its claws. Why would a crab need strong muscles there? What would happen if the muscles were weak?\"\n   - Encourage students to research and explain how internal structures support external structures.\n\n2. **Habitat & Evolution Exploration:**\n   - Provide images of different crabs (hermit crab, fiddler crab, coconut crab, horseshoe crab).\n   - Ask: \"Each of these crabs looks different. Why? What different habitats might they live in? How are their external structures different from our sandy beach crab?\"\n   - Students create a poster or presentation comparing crab adaptations across species.\n\n3. **Design Challenge:**\n   - \"Design a new creature that must survive on a rocky ocean shore instead of a sandy beach. What external structures would it need? Why? How would they be different from a sandy beach crab?\"\n   - Students sketch and label their design with explanations of each structure's function in the rocky habitat.\n\n4. **Research Extension:**\n   - Have students research a specific adaptation in depth (e.g., \"Why are some crabs blue and others brown?\" or \"How do crabs regenerate lost claws?\").\n   - Students write a brief informational paragraph or create a digital presentation.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n**For Early Finishers, Homework, or Follow-Up Lessons:**\n\n1. **Crab Behavior Observation Video:**\n   - Provide a link to a short nature documentary clip (3–5 minutes) showing crabs in their natural habitat.\n   - Students complete a \"Crab Behavior Observation Sheet\" listing all the behaviors they see and which body parts the crab uses for each behavior.\n   - Tie to 4-LS1-2: \"How does the crab respond to what it senses?\"\n\n2. **Create a Crab Field Guide:**\n   - Students work in pairs or small groups to create a \"field guide\" or illustrated fact sheet about crabs.\n   - Include: labeled diagram, description of each external structure, function, habitat, and interesting facts.\n   - Display in the classroom or digitize as a class ebook.\n   - Connection: Reinforces vocabulary and deepens understanding of adaptations.\n\n3. **Design an Ocean Animal Fact File Project:**\n   - Students choose a different ocean or beach animal (sea star, shrimp, sea turtle, octopus, etc.).\n   - They research and create a fact file including: habitat, external structures, function of each structure, and how it's adapted to survive.\n   - Present findings to the class in a poster, slide show, or short talk.\n   - Connection: Extends comparison of adaptations across species (4-LS1-1 in broader context).\n\n4. **Interactive Crab Game or Simulation:**\n   - Use or create a simple digital game where students control a crab, using its body parts to find food, avoid predators, and complete tasks on a beach.\n   - After playing, students write or discuss: \"Which body part did you use most?
