ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the snail on moss (or digital display)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: magnifying glasses (one per student or pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Ask students to sit together on the carpet so all can see clearly.\n\n2. **Introduce with curiosity:** \"Today we're going to be snail detectives! Look carefully at this photograph. What do you see moving along the moss?\"\n\n3. **Ask these discussion questions one at a time** (allow think-pair-share time between questions):\n   - \"What is this creature? Does anyone know its name?\" (Accept responses; guide to \"snail\")\n   - \"What parts of the snail's body can you see? Point to the picture and tell a neighbor.\"\n   - \"Do you see that hard bump on the snail's back? What do you think that is? Why do you think the snail has it?\"\n   - \"The snail is on green moss. Why do you think the snail likes to be there? What might it be looking for?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... how does this snail move so slowly? What helps it stick to the moss without falling? Let's find out today!\"\n\n5. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper titled \"Our Snail Questions.\" This validates curiosity and creates anticipation.\n\n**Transition:** \"Snails are amazing animals with special body parts that help them survive. Let's explore what makes snails so special!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Living snails (1–2 per small group, if available from school science supply or pet store) *OR* high-quality snail video/images if live specimens unavailable\n- Clear plastic observation containers or shallow trays with moist soil/moss\n- Wet paper towels\n- Small pieces of lettuce or cucumber\n- Magnifying glasses\n- Observation sheet (template provided below with simple pictures and labels)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Live Snail Observation (Preferred)**\n\n1. **Organize students into small groups** (3–4 students per group).\n\n2. **Distribute one snail in a moist container** to each group. Emphasize: \"Be very gentle. Snails are living creatures. We observe and touch softly.\"\n\n3. **Provide these student-friendly directions:**\n   - \"Watch your snail for 2–3 minutes without touching it. Where does it go? What does it do?\"\n   - \"Use your magnifying glass. Look at the snail's shell. What shape is it? What color is it?\"\n   - \"Gently touch the snail's body (if it's out of the shell). What does it feel like? Is it wet or dry?\"\n   - \"Count and circle the snail's tentacles (long feelers) on your observation sheet. How many do you see?\"\n   - \"Place a small piece of lettuce near the snail. Does the snail move toward it? Does it eat? Draw what you see.\"\n\n4. **Document observations:** Students draw and label snail body parts on a simple illustration worksheet. Provide labels for students to copy: **shell, foot, tentacles, mouth.**\n\n5. **Rotate groups** if time permits so all students can observe multiple snails.\n\n**Option B: Snail Video Observation (If Live Specimens Unavailable)**\n\nUse a short (3–5 minute) high-quality snail video showing the snail moving and eating. Show it twice—first for pure observation, then guide students to notice specific parts using the same observation sheet.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups and ask probing questions without giving answers:\n  - \"What do you notice about how the snail moves?\"\n  - \"Why do you think the snail might use its shell?\"\n  - \"What happens when the snail touches the food?\"\n- Encourage peer discussion: \"What does your neighbor observe?\"\n- Ensure snails remain moist and safe; return them to proper habitat after observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students complete observation sheets with drawings labeled with snail body parts.\n- Students describe (orally or with drawings) snail movement, texture, and feeding behavior.\n- Students begin to infer that different body parts do different jobs.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of snail (displayed again)\n- Snail body-parts poster or prepared anchor chart\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather the group** and invite students to share their observations:\n   - \"What did you discover about the snail's shell?\"\n   - \"Tell me about the snail's movement. Was it fast or slow?\"\n   - \"What surprised you about the snail?\"\n\n2. **Build vocabulary together** using the photograph and student observations. Introduce and display these five terms on an anchor chart with simple illustrations:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Shell:** The hard covering on the snail's back that protects its soft body inside. It's like a snail's house!\n- **Foot:** The soft, muscular bottom part of the snail that it uses to move slowly along the ground.\n- **Tentacles (or eye stalks):** The long, thin feelers on the snail's head that help it feel and see where it's going.\n- **Slime (or mucus):** The wet, slimy liquid that comes out of the snail's body. It helps the snail move and stay moist.\n- **Adapt (or adaptation):** Special body parts or behaviors that help an animal survive in its home.\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph:** Point to the snail in the image and say:\n   - \"See the shell on this snail's back? That shell keeps the snail safe. The snail can pull inside when danger comes.\"\n   - \"Look at the snail's foot at the bottom of its body. It's gliding slowly across the moss. The slime helps it slide!\"\n   - \"Those long things on its head? Those are tentacles. They help the snail explore and find food.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Play a simple game: Show snail body parts on the photograph and ask: \"What is this? What does it help the snail do?\"\n   - Have students point to their own \"foot\" or \"head\" to show they can distinguish body parts.\n   - Use a thumbs-up/sideways/down signal: \"Do you know what a snail's shell does?\" All show thumbs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students use correct vocabulary (with teacher support) to identify snail body parts.\n- Students can explain in simple terms that different body parts help the snail survive.\n- Students understand that snails are different from humans and other animals they know.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Art supplies: construction paper, markers, crayons, scissors\n- Cardboard paper towel tubes or rolled construction paper (for shell)\n- Pasta, beads, or foam pieces (optional decoration)\n- Tape and glue\n- Picture cards showing different animals (rabbit, bird, fish, snail—printed images)\n- Chart paper with \"Body Parts Help Us Survive\" heading\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the design challenge:** \"Snails use their shells to stay safe and their slimy feet to move. Today, we're going to create our own snail using art materials! Or, we can think like engineers and design something that protects like a snail's shell.\"\n\n**Option A: Snail Art Creation**\n- Students create a snail using craft materials (rolled paper tube for shell, construction paper for body and tentacles).\n- As they build, ask: \"Why are you making the shell like this? How does it protect?\"\n- Display finished snails on a classroom \"Snail Garden\" bulletin board.\n\n**Option B: Shell Protection Design**\n- Introduce the challenge: \"A toy has to travel down a slide without breaking. How could you design a shell that protects it, like a snail's shell protects its body?\"\n- Provide materials and let students design and test a protective \"shell\" for a small toy or egg.\n\n2. **Comparison activity:** Display picture cards of different animals (rabbit, bird, fish, snail). \n   - Ask: \"These animals all have feet or ways to move, but are they the same as the snail's foot? Why or why not?\"\n   - Create a simple comparison chart on paper: **\"What's the Same? What's Different?\"** comparing two animals.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Guide students with prompts, not answers: \"What part of the snail's shell could protect in your design?\"\n- Encourage explanations: \"Tell me why you chose this material for your shell.\"\n- Document student thinking with photos or written observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students design or create a model that mimics snail body parts (especially the shell or foot).\n- Students explain their design choice by referring to what they learned about snails.\n- Students compare snails to other animals and note that body parts are different across species.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student drawings and labels from the Explore phase—do they accurately show snail body parts?\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain phase—can they name and describe body parts?\n- Watch students during Elaborate phase—do they connect design choices to snail adaptations?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nAdminister one of the following (adjust based on class literacy level):\n\n**Option A: Picture Pointing (Non-Readers)**\n- Show a photograph of a snail.\n- Ask three questions, student points or says the answer:\n  1. \"Point to the snail's shell. Why does the snail have a shell?\" (Accepts: \"Protect\" or \"Safe\")\n  2. \"Show me the snail's foot. What does the snail use its foot for?\" (Accepts: \"Move\" or \"Crawl\")\n  3. \"Can you find the tentacles? What do tentacles help the snail do?\" (Accepts: \"Feel\" or \"Find food\")\n\n**Option B: Draw and Label (Emerging Readers)**\n- Provide a simple outline of a snail.\n- Students label or draw three body parts and write or dictate one word about what each part does.\n\n**Option C: Sentence Stem (For More Advanced First Graders)**\n- Provide sentence stems and students complete orally or with drawing:\n  - \"A snail's shell helps it _______.\"\n  - \"The snail moves with its _______.\"\n  - \"Snails are different from other animals because _______.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents have met the learning objectives if they can:\n- ✓ Identify and name at least two snail body parts (shell, foot, tentacles)\n- ✓ Explain that body parts help the snail survive (move, eat, protect itself)\n- ✓ Recognize that snails have different body parts than familiar animals (pets, humans)\n- ✓ Apply knowledge by designing or creating something that mimics a snail body part\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- 80% of students accurately identify the shell as protective and the foot as helping movement.\n- Students can state one way a snail's body parts are different from a pet they know.\n- Students engage in the design/creation activity and explain their thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Focus on just **three** terms (shell, foot, tentacles) rather than five. Use repetition and visual anchor charts with large images.\n\n2. **Guided Observation:** Pair students with a partner or assign to a teacher-led small group during Explore. Provide a simplified observation sheet with just three blanks to fill: shell color, shell shape, what the snail does.\n\n3. **Sentence Stems and Frames:** During Explain and Elaborate, provide sentence stems so students can participate orally:\n   - \"The snail's shell is _______.\"\n   - \"The snail uses its foot to _______.\"\n   - This reduces the cognitive load of generating complete responses.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Inquiry:** Ask: \"Why do you think snails need a shell but rabbits don't? Where do snails live vs. where rabbits live?\" Lead students to infer that animals adapt to their environments. Provide a simple Venn diagram comparing snail and rabbit habitats.\n\n2. **Multi-Animal Comparison:** Provide images of 4–5 animals (snail, caterpillar, turtle, hedgehog, fish). Challenge students to categorize them by defense strategies (has shell, has spikes, can hide, etc.). Create a simple chart together.\n\n3. **Design Engineering Challenge:** \"Design a backpack or protection for a toy animal that travels through different environments (wet moss, dry sand, rocky ground) like a snail does. Which environment is hardest to travel in? Why does a snail's slime help?\" Students iterate and explain their design choices.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Snail Life Cycle Investigation:** Read aloud a picture book about snails (e.g., *A Snail's Pace* by John L. Riddle or *The Smallest Snail* by Sheila Samton). Ask: \"What do baby snails look like? Do they have shells? Are they the same as their parents?\" Connect to **1-LS1-2** (observing parent-offspring relationships). Have students predict whether baby snails look like adult snails and draw their predictions.\n\n2. **Snail Habitat Creation:** In a jar or terrarium, create a snail habitat with moist soil, moss, and leaves. Check on it daily. Students observe and record: Does the snail eat? Does it grow? Where does it hide? Keep a simple pictorial journal for two weeks. This extends 1-LS1-1 (designing solutions using animal structures) by having students design the *best* habitat.\n\n3. **Comparative Body Parts: Snail vs. Me:** Create a large Venn diagram on paper. On one side, draw/list snail body parts (shell, foot, tentacles, slime). On the other, draw/list human body parts (arms, legs, skin, head). In the middle, ask: \"What parts are the same idea?\" (Both move with lower body, both have heads, both have coverings). Students draw or label to show understanding that animals have similar functions but different structures. This reinforces **1-LS3-1** (young animals are like but not exactly like their parents, extended to inter-species comparison).\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Live Snails:** Order 48 hours in advance from a biological supply company or pet store. Keep them in a cool, moist container. Return or release them after the lesson (follow school policy).\n- **If live snails unavailable:** The lesson works well with high-quality video (YouTube has excellent slow-motion snail videos). Show the same video twice—once for pure observation, once with guided questions.\n- **Safety:** Wash hands after touching snails. Ensure no snails are crushed or harmed. Some snails carry parasites, so avoid touching your face after contact; hand-washing solves this.\n- **Engagement:** First graders love tactile experiences. The wet, slimy texture of snails fascinates them—embrace this curiosity!\n- **Vocabulary Depth:** You don't need students to memorize \"mucus.\" \"Slime\" is perfectly acceptable and age-appropriate. Add formal terms gradually.\n- **Accessibility:** Students who are non-verbal or use AAC can participate fully by pointing, nodding, or using visual communication boards to identify body parts.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson grounds itself in the snail photograph while building deep understanding of how animal body structures support survival. It's hands-on, aligned to First Grade NGSS, and ready to teach tomorrow.",
