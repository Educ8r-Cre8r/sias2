Observe and describe the special structures that vines use to climb (such as tendrils and twining stems).\n2. Explain how a vine's climbing ability helps it survive by reaching sunlight and space to grow.\n3. Compare the traits of different climbing plants and identify how these traits are adaptations to their environment.\n4. Construct an argument with evidence that the vine's climbing behavior is an advantage for its survival.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about plant adaptations and climbing growth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, clear photograph of the climbing vine on fence (displayed on smartboard, printed poster, or document camera)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: actual vine cutting or potted climbing plant (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about how this plant is growing? Why do you think it's growing this way instead of straight up from the ground?\"\n   - \"Look at the thin curly parts of the plant. What do you think those are for? How might they help the plant?\"\n   - \"If this plant was growing on flat ground instead of a fence, do you think it would look the same? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What does the plant need to survive? How might growing on a fence help it get those things?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge** by asking: \"Has anyone ever seen plants climbing on a fence, wall, or trellis? What did they look like? How were they different from plants in a garden bed?\"\n\n4. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"I'm wondering why some plants climb and some plants don't. What do you think? Let's investigate to find out!\"\n\n5. **Record student ideas** on chart paper under headings: \"What We Observe\" and \"Why We Think Plants Climb.\" Keep this visible for the entire lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become plant detectives and explore how climbing plants have special tricks for growing strong and tall. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate climbing plant structures and test how different materials mimic plant climbing adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Rope or string (cut into 12-inch pieces, 1 per student pair)\n- Pencils, wooden dowels, or branches (to represent fence posts)\n- Paper towel tubes or PVC pipe sections (to represent fence rails)\n- Tape (painter's tape or masking tape)\n- Curled paper strips or ribbon (to represent tendrils)\n- Chart paper or large paper sheets\n- Real vine cuttings or images of different climbing plants (clematis, bean vines, ivy, morning glory)\n- Magnifying glasses\n- Hand-drawn simple plant drawings students can annotate\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide students into pairs.** Give each pair a rope and pencil or dowel. Ask: \"Use the rope to show me how you think a plant would climb this 'fence post.' What does the rope need to do to stay up?\"\n\n2. **Allow 5 minutes of exploration.** Students experiment with wrapping, coiling, and positioning the rope. Teacher circulates, asking: \"What's working? What's tricky? How is your rope staying attached?\"\n\n3. **Introduce climbing structures.** Show real vine cuttings or high-quality images of:\n   - Tendrils (thin, curly structures that wrap around supports)\n   - Twining stems (stems that spiral around objects)\n   - Adhesive structures (like climbing ivy's sticky pads—show image)\n\n4. **Second investigation:** Give students a curl of paper ribbon to represent a tendril. Ask them to wrap it around their pencil. Discuss: \"How does this curly piece help the plant grab the fence? What would happen if it was straight?\"\n\n5. **Documentation:** Have students draw or label a simple vine diagram showing:\n   - Where the tendrils are\n   - How the stem grows\n   - Where leaves are positioned to catch sunlight\n\n6. **Comparison activity:** Display images of 3-4 different climbing plants (bean vine, clematis, ivy, morning glory). Ask students to identify similarities and differences in how each one climbs. Record answers on chart paper.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions instead of giving answers: \"What happens when you try this? Can you show me another way?\"\n- Prompt observation: \"What do you notice about how the tendril is shaped? Why might that shape be helpful?\"\n- Encourage testing: \"Try wrapping it tighter. Does that work better?\"\n- Do not demonstrate the \"correct\" way; let students discover through trial.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that rope/string can wrap around supports to climb.\n- Students understand that curly tendrils are better at gripping than straight stems.\n- Students create labeled drawings of vine structures.\n- Students recognize that different plants have different climbing strategies.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of plant adaptations with direct connection to the photograph and exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original photograph of climbing vine (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms written in large letters\n- Student handout with vocabulary and illustrations (optional)\n- Visual anchor chart with labeled vine diagram\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 3-4 pairs to share their rope-climbing discoveries with the class. Ask: \"What worked best? Why do you think that worked?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (write each on chart paper with a simple illustration):\n   - **Tendril:** A thin, curly part of a plant that wraps around things to help the plant climb.\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps a living thing survive in its environment.\n   - **Trait:** A characteristic or feature that an organism has (like curly tendrils, green leaves, or a climbing ability).\n   - **Environment:** The place where a plant or animal lives, including things like sunlight, water, soil, and structures like fences.\n\n3. **Return to the photograph.** Point out specific features:\n   - \"Look at these curly parts—those are tendrils, an adaptation. Why would tendrils be useful on this fence?\"\n   - \"Notice the green leaves catching sunlight. The vine climbs up the fence to reach more light. That's an adaptation too!\"\n   - \"See how the stem wraps around itself and the fence? That's a trait this plant inherited from its parent plants.\"\n\n4. **Connect to exploration:** \"When you wrapped the rope around the pencil, you discovered what tendrils do naturally. The curly shape is a trait that helps the plant climb and survive.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Can someone tell me what a tendril is in their own words?\"\n   - \"Why do you think climbing is an important adaptation for a plant?\"\n   - \"If this vine didn't have tendrils, what problem might it have?\"\n\n6. **Reinforce the life cycle connection:** \"We can see this vine is in the growth stage. It's growing taller, producing new leaves, and soon it will make flowers and fruit. That's all part of the plant's life cycle.\"\n\n**Vocabulary (Student-Friendly Definitions):**\n- **Tendril:** A thin, springy part of a plant that curls and wraps around things to help pull the plant up as it grows.\n- **Adaptation:** A special feature that helps a plant or animal live and survive better in the place where it grows.\n- **Trait:** A body part or ability that something has—like the ability to climb, or having green leaves, or having curly tendrils.\n- **Environment:** The place where something lives and all the things in that place (like sun, rain, soil, fences, and other plants).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define adaptation and tendril in simple terms.\n- Students understand that the vine's climbing ability is an adaptation that helps it get sunlight.\n- Students recognize that traits (like curly tendrils) are inherited and shaped by environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by analyzing variation among climbing plants and constructing arguments for how adaptations help survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of 5-6 different climbing plants (or students may observe real ones if available): pole beans, clematis, morning glory, ivy, grape vine, passion flower vine\n- Comparison chart template (can be drawn on board or printed)\n- Chart paper for group argument\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce a real-world scenario:** \"Imagine you're a farmer growing beans. You want them to climb up a tall pole so they're easy to pick. Would you choose a plant with tendrils or without? Why?\"\n\n2. **Variation investigation:** Display 5-6 images of different climbing plants. Create a comparison chart on the board with columns:\n   - Plant Name\n   - How It Climbs (tendrils, twining stem, sticky pads, etc.)\n   - Why This Is Good for Survival\n   - Environment It Lives In\n\n3. **Small group task (3-4 students per group):** Assign each group two different climbing plants to compare. Ask:\n   - \"How are these two plants' climbing methods different?\"\n   - \"Why might each plant's way of climbing be helpful in its own environment?\"\n   - \"If we switched these plants' environments, would both adaptations still work? Why or why not?\"\n\n4. **Construct an argument:** Each group writes or draws their answer to: \"Why do you think different climbing plants have different ways of climbing? How does each method help the plant survive?\"\n\n5. **Gallery walk or presentation:** Groups share their findings. Discuss how the same goal (climbing to reach sunlight) is solved in different ways by different plants.\n\n6. **Real-world connection:** \"Gardeners understand these adaptations. They choose climbing plants that fit their gardens. A plant with sticky pads works great on a wall, but a plant with tendrils needs something it can wrap around.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group discussion by asking: \"Why did this plant evolve tendrils? What problem does that solve?\"\n- Encourage comparison: \"How is this plant's solution different from that plant's solution?\"\n- Push thinking: \"Would this adaptation work in a different habitat? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students articulate that different plants have different adaptations for climbing.\n- Students construct a basic argument connecting adaptation to survival advantage.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that environment influences which traits are most helpful.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant adaptations, traits, and survival advantages.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative assessment during lesson:**\n   - Listen to student explanations during group discussions.\n   - Observe how students labeled their vine diagrams in Explore phase.\n   - Ask probing questions: \"Tell me why a curly tendril is better than a straight stem for climbing.\"\n   - Check responses to vocabulary definitions.\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (provide at end of session 1 or 2):**\n   \n   **For students to answer (verbally, with drawing, or written):**\n   - \"Look at this picture of a climbing vine. Label the tendril. Why do you think the plant has tendrils?\"\n   - \"How does climbing help a vine survive? (Hint: Think about sunlight.)\"\n   - \"Is the tendril an adaptation? How do you know?\"\n   \n   **Alternative exit ticket for students needing differentiation:**\n   - \"Draw a vine climbing a fence. Circle the part that helps it climb.\"\n   - \"Why is climbing good for a plant?\"\n\n3. **Summative assessment (can be completed individually or in pairs):**\n   \n   **Performance task:** Show a photograph of a plant that does NOT climb (like a tomato plant or sunflower). Ask:\n   - \"This plant doesn't climb. What traits does it have that help it survive instead?\"\n   - \"If we wanted to make a climbing plant, what structures would we add to this plant? Why?\"\n   - \"How would the environment need to change for a vine to grow better than this plant?\"\n\n4. **Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n   - ✓ Student can identify tendrils or other climbing structures in images.\n   - ✓ Student can explain at least one way that climbing helps a plant (e.g., \"It gets more sunlight,\" \"It saves space on the ground\").\n   - ✓ Student understands that climbing ability is a trait that helps survival.\n   - ✓ Student can describe how the environment (like a fence or wall) influences whether a climbing adaptation is useful.\n   - ✓ Student recognizes that different plants have different climbing adaptations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will correctly identify tendril structures and explain basic survival advantages.\n- Students will demonstrate that they understand adaptation as a trait shaped by both inheritance and environment.\n- Advanced students will articulate nuanced comparisons between different climbing strategies and explain how environment determines which adaptation is most advantageous.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary with visuals:** Before the lesson, use real vine samples or close-up photos to familiarize students with terms like \"tendril\" and \"adapt.\" Use consistent, concrete examples.\n\n2. **Simplify exploration:** Instead of comparing 5-6 plants, focus on just 2 contrasting types (e.g., vine with tendrils vs. vine that twines). Pair student with stronger peer during Explore phase.\n\n3. **Provide scaffolded exit ticket:** Give students a sentence frame: \"The tendril helps the vine because ______.\" or \"Climbing is good for the plant because ______.\" Offer choice between picture or word response.\n\n4. **Use manipulatives consistently:** Keep rope, pencil, and paper curls available during Explain phase so kinesthetic learners can re-demonstrate understanding.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Comparative analysis:** Have students research and compare how humans have copied plant climbing adaptations (e.g., Velcro inspired by sticky plant pods, rock climbing gear inspired by plant tendrils). Create a poster or presentation.\n\n2. **Environmental variation hypothesis:** Ask: \"If we grew the same vine in three different environments—a dark greenhouse, a bright sunny yard, and a rocky hillside—what differences might we see in how it grows? Why?\" Have students draw predictions and write explanations.\n\n3. **Evolutionary thinking:** Introduce the idea of natural selection: \"Why do you think some plants evolved tendrils while others didn't? What might have happened in their environments?\" Students draw a comic strip showing a plant species evolving a climbing adaptation over time.\n\n4. **Design challenge:** \"Design a new plant adaptation that would help it climb. Draw it and explain why it would work. What problems does it solve?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Plant Adaptation Trading Cards:** Students create \"trading cards\" for 5-6 different climbing plants. Each card includes: plant name, drawing of the plant, type of climbing structure (tendril/twining/adhesive), habitat, and one fun fact. Students trade and discuss cards with peers.\n\n2. **Create a Classroom Climbing Plant Journal:** Over 2-3 weeks, students observe a potted climbing plant (bean vine, morning glory, or small ivy) placed in the classroom. Students sketch and record weekly: new growth, changes in leaf size, height gained, and any structures they observe developing. Write captions explaining how the plant is adapting to the classroom environment.\n\n3. **Adaptation Scavenger Hunt:** Take students on a walk around the school grounds or nearby park. Challenge them to find 3-4 examples of plants or animals adapted to their specific environment. For each, students photograph or sketch it and write: \"What adaptation helps this living thing survive here?\"\n\n4. **Vine and Trellis Engineering Challenge:** Provide craft materials (straws, pipe cleaners, string, paper) and ask small groups to design a structure that would help a climbing plant grow. Test structures by \"growing\" a vine (piece of string) along it. Discuss which designs work best and why.\n\n5. **Family Connection:** Send home a simple observation sheet asking families to notice climbing plants in their neighborhood. Students bring back photos, sketches, or plant samples (with parent notes) to share. Create a class \"Climbing Plant Field Guide\" from family contributions.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Safety Consideration:** When collecting real vine samples, check for poisonous plants (e.g., poison ivy). Stick to known edible/non-toxic plants like bean vines, clematis, or ornamental ivy.\n- **Pacing:** If students are deeply engaged in Explore, you may extend that phase into a second day. The lesson is flexible and can be spread across three shorter sessions instead of two longer ones.\n- **Connection to Next Lessons:** This lesson builds foundation for understanding inheritance (3-LS3-1), where students can later investigate whether climbing ability appears in offspring of climbing plants.\n- **Inclusive Language:** Use \"plant detectives\" and \"scientists\" when addressing students to encourage growth mindset and identity with science.",
