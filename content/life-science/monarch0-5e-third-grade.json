ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph to spark curiosity about butterfly life cycles.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image (or printed 8.5\" x 11\" copies, one per student or pair)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or document camera. Show only the image without any text labels initially. Allow students 30 seconds of silent looking time.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** to the whole group:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the creature in the middle.\"\n   - \"Why do you think this caterpillar has yellow and black stripes? What do those stripes do for the caterpillar?\" (Guide toward: they make it stand out, they warn animals it might taste bad)\n   - \"What is that clear, empty shell-like thing on the left? Have you ever seen something like this before?\" (Activate prior knowledge about butterflies and chrysalis)\n   - \"If this is a caterpillar now, what do you think it will become when it grows up?\"\n\n3. **Record student predictions and wonderings** on chart paper. Use the heading \"What We Wonder About Caterpillars and Butterflies.\" Examples: \"Will it turn into a butterfly?\" \"How long does it take?\" \"Does it have to stay on the wall?\"\n\n4. **Ask:** \"Let's find out how caterpillars actually turn into butterflies and why those stripes are so important!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to explore the amazing journey a caterpillar takes to become a butterfly, and we'll discover why that special striped pattern is so clever.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the monarch butterfly life cycle through hands-on model-building and pattern analysis.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper plates (1 per student or pair) or large paper circles (8\" diameter)\n- Colored markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Pre-cut paper shapes (optional): small circles for eggs, long ovals for caterpillars, heart/teardrop shapes for chrysalis, butterfly wing templates\n- Glue sticks\n- Photos or illustrations of monarch eggs, caterpillars, chrysalis, and adult butterflies (printed or displayed digitally) — one set per pair or small group\n- **Life Cycle Diagram Handout** (provided by teacher, showing the four stages with images)\n- Sentence strip cards with stage names: \"Egg Stage,\" \"Caterpillar Stage,\" \"Chrysalis Stage,\" \"Butterfly Stage\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute Life Cycle Diagram Handout** (or show images on screen). Explain: \"Monarchs go through four special stages. Let's look at each one.\"\n\n2. **Work through each stage together briefly:**\n   - **Egg Stage:** Tiny, cream-colored egg laid on a milkweed leaf (the caterpillar's food)\n   - **Caterpillar Stage:** Striped caterpillar that eats and eats and grows bigger and bigger\n   - **Chrysalis Stage:** The caterpillar makes a protective shell and changes inside (like in our photo!)\n   - **Butterfly Stage:** Adult butterfly with wings emerges and can fly\n\n3. **Students create a life cycle wheel:**\n   - Give each student/pair a paper plate divided into four sections (pre-draw lines if needed)\n   - In each section, students draw or glue a picture of one stage\n   - They label each section with the stage name\n   - Around the outside, they write or draw one thing about what happens at each stage (e.g., \"Egg: Mom lays it,\" \"Caterpillar: Eats lots!\" \"Chrysalis: Hiding inside,\" \"Butterfly: Has big wings!\")\n\n4. **Demonstrate the striped pattern exploration:**\n   - Show the caterpillar photo again\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think this caterpillar has such bright, bold stripes?\"\n   - Explain: \"Many animals that eat caterpillars have learned: 'If it has those colors, don't eat it — it might make me sick!'\" (The monarch caterpillar eats milkweed, which tastes bad to predators.)\n   - Have students draw or color their own caterpillar with bold stripes on the life cycle wheel\n\n5. **Circulate as students work:**\n   - Ask guiding questions: \"What happens after the egg hatches?\" \"Why does the caterpillar need to eat so much?\" \"What do you think is happening inside the chrysalis?\"\n   - **Do not** directly tell them answers; help them think through the sequence\n\n**Teacher Role:** Facilitate discovery by asking probing questions, displaying reference images, and allowing time for student thinking. Provide encouragement and redirect misconceptions gently (\"That's a great idea! Let's check it against this picture...\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Each student/pair completes a labeled life cycle wheel with visual representations of all four stages\n- Students can verbally sequence the stages in correct order\n- Students indicate awareness that the striped pattern is a protection strategy\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and deepen understanding of the life cycle and adaptations after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Life cycle anchor chart (prepared beforehand or co-created with students)\n- Vocabulary cards with images (egg, larva/caterpillar, pupa/chrysalis, adult)\n- Original photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Short video clip (2-3 minutes) of monarch metamorphosis (available free on YouTube or National Geographic Kids)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share student life cycle wheels** (2-3 volunteers share their work with the class). As students share, affirm correct sequencing and highlight key observations.\n\n2. **Introduce and discuss key vocabulary:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Life Cycle:** The different stages a living thing goes through from birth until it dies (egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly → adult lays eggs → cycle repeats)\n   - **Caterpillar (or Larva):** The stage where the butterfly looks like a worm with many legs; it eats a lot and grows bigger\n   - **Chrysalis (or Pupa):** A hard shell the caterpillar makes around itself; inside, the caterpillar's body changes into a butterfly\n   - **Metamorphosis:** The amazing change that happens when a caterpillar turns into a butterfly (use hand motions to show transformation)\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive (like the caterpillar's warning stripes that tell predators \"Don't eat me!\")\n\n3. **Create a class anchor chart** showing:\n   - Four boxes labeled with each stage\n   - Simple drawings or photos for each\n   - One sentence per stage explaining what happens\n   - Emphasis on: All four stages are part of ONE life cycle; every living thing has a life cycle\n\n4. **Return to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the caterpillar: \"This is the larva stage — it's eating and growing.\"\n   - Point to the chrysalis: \"This empty shell is where the magic happens — inside, the caterpillar is becoming a butterfly!\"\n   - Discuss the stripes again: \"Those bright colors say, 'I'm not good to eat!' That's an adaptation.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I show you a picture of a chrysalis, can you tell me what's happening inside?\" (Listen for: caterpillar is changing, becoming a butterfly, it's protected by a shell)\n   - Ask: \"Why do caterpillars have those bold stripes?\" (Listen for: protection, predators avoid them, warning colors)\n   - Ask: \"What comes before the chrysalis? What comes after?\" (Sequence check)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary terms (life cycle, caterpillar/larva, chrysalis/pupa, metamorphosis, adaptation) with teacher scaffolding\n- Students verbally explain that all living things go through stages of growth and change\n- Students articulate that the striped pattern protects the caterpillar\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by comparing life cycles and thinking about real-world scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or printed photos of other organisms at different life stages:\n  - Human (baby, child, adult)\n  - Frog (tadpole, froglet, adult frog)\n  - Dog (puppy, adult dog)\n  - Chicken (egg, chick, adult chicken)\n  - Plant (seed, sprout, flowering plant)\n- **Life Cycle Comparison Chart** handout or chart paper\n- Scenario cards with questions (see below)\n\n**Activity Option 1: Comparing Life Cycles**\n\n1. **Display pictures of different organisms** (humans, frogs, dogs, chickens, plants).\n\n2. **Ask:** \"Do all living things go through changes like the monarch butterfly? Let's find out!\"\n\n3. **Work through each organism together:**\n   - Frogs: Egg → Tadpole → Froglet → Adult (like butterflies, but tadpoles live in water)\n   - Humans: Baby → Child → Adult (very different from butterflies!)\n   - Dogs: Puppy → Adult Dog (fewer stages than butterflies)\n\n4. **Complete a comparison chart together:**\n   \n   | Organism | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Stage 4 |\n   |----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n   | Monarch Butterfly | Egg | Caterpillar | Chrysalis | Adult |\n   | Frog | Egg | Tadpole | Froglet | Adult |\n   | Human | Baby | Child | Teenager | Adult |\n\n5. **Discuss:** \"All living things are born, grow, and change. But the butterfly's changes are more dramatic — it's called metamorphosis. A caterpillar doesn't just get bigger; it completely changes shape!\"\n\n**Activity Option 2: Real-World Problem Scenario**\n\n1. **Present a scenario:**\n   - \"A farmer plants milkweed flowers near his garden to help monarch butterflies. But then he learns that milkweed spreads very fast and might take over his garden. What should he do? Should he keep the milkweed, take it out, or find a middle answer?\"\n\n2. **Discuss as a class:**\n   - Monarchs *need* milkweed to survive (caterpillars only eat it)\n   - Without milkweed, there will be no monarchs\n   - But too much milkweed might harm the farm\n   - What's a fair solution?\n\n3. **Students can draw or write their solution** and explain: \"I think the farmer should... because...\" (This connects to 3-LS4-4: making claims about solutions when the environment changes)\n\n**Teacher Role:** Guide thinking without providing the \"right\" answer. Ask: \"What does the caterpillar need?\" \"What does the farmer need?\" \"Is there a way to help both?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that all living things have life cycles with birth, growth, and change\n- Students note similarities and differences between life cycles\n- Students apply knowledge to a real-world situation and propose reasonable solutions\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students understand the monarch life cycle, can sequence stages, identify adaptations, and recognize that all organisms have life cycles.\n\n**Formative Assessment During the Lesson:**\n- **Observation during Explore phase:** Did students sequence the stages correctly on their life cycle wheels? Can they explain what happens at each stage?\n- **Questioning during Explain phase:** Listen to student responses to comprehension checks (sequencing, stripe function, vocabulary use)\n- **Small group checks:** During Elaborate, listen to students' reasoning about the frog life cycle comparison and the milkweed scenario\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket**\n\n**Provide each student with an exit ticket (can be oral, written, or drawn based on student ability).** Choose one or adapt based on your students:\n\n**Option A (Written/Drawn):**\n- Draw or write the four stages of the monarch butterfly life cycle in order\n- Label the stages (Egg, Caterpillar, Chrysalis, Butterfly)\n- Write one sentence about what happens at the chrysalis stage\n\n**Option B (Multiple Choice + Short Answer):**\n1. \"What does a caterpillar do inside a chrysalis?\"\n   - A) Sleep\n   - B) Eat leaves\n   - C) Change into a butterfly\n   - D) Lay eggs\n   *(Correct answer: C)*\n\n2. \"Why does the monarch caterpillar have bright yellow and black stripes?\"\n   - A) To look pretty\n   - B) To tell predators it's not good to eat\n   - C) To help it hide\n   *(Correct answer: B)*\n\n3. \"All living things have a life cycle. Name another animal and tell one stage of its life cycle.\"\n   *(Look for any living thing with at least one identifiable stage — demonstrates understanding of the broader concept)*\n\n**Option C (Oral Interview — 2-3 minutes per student):**\nAsk:\n- \"Can you tell me the four stages of a monarch butterfly's life in order?\"\n- \"Why is the chrysalis important?\"\n- \"Do you think humans have a life cycle like butterflies? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n✓ Students can sequence all four stages of the monarch life cycle correctly  \n✓ Students understand that the chrysalis is where transformation happens  \n✓ Students recognize that the striped pattern is an adaptation for protection  \n✓ Students can identify life cycles in other organisms and name at least one stage  \n✓ Students understand that ALL living things grow, change, and have life cycles (though they look different)\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- All four learning objectives are addressed through the exit ticket\n- Students who can sequence correctly and explain at least 2 stages have mastered the minimum expectation\n- Students who connect the butterfly life cycle to other organisms and discuss adaptations show deeper understanding\n- Use exit ticket data to identify students needing additional support before moving to new topics\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Provide a sequencing template:** Pre-drawn boxes labeled \"1st,\" \"2nd,\" \"3rd,\" \"4th\" with partial images or sentence frames. Students match or complete rather than create from scratch. Sentence frame example: \"At this stage, the caterpillar ___.\" or \"Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar ___ to become a butterfly.\"\n\n2. **Use manipulatives and repetition:** Create a physical life cycle with students using craft materials (cotton ball for chrysalis, pipe cleaner for caterpillar). Have them manipulate and arrange pieces while narrating each stage aloud multiple times.\n\n3. **Provide simplified vocabulary cards with pictures:** Focus only on the four stage names with clear, uncluttered images. Use these visuals consistently and allow students to reference them during all activities.\n\n4. **Partner struggling students with stronger peers** during Explore and Elaborate to provide peer modeling and encouragement without direct adult direction for every step.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research and present:** Assign a specific monarch migration fact or the role of milkweed in the monarch ecosystem. Students research (with teacher guidance) and teach a 2-minute lesson to the class or small group. This extends to 3-LS4-3 (habitat and survival requirements).\n\n2. **Compare metamorphosis types:** Introduce the concept of \"incomplete metamorphosis\" vs. \"complete metamorphosis.\" Show a grasshopper life cycle (incomplete: nymph gradually becomes adult) and compare to the butterfly. Students create a Venn diagram showing similarities and differences. Discussion question: \"Why do you think metamorphosis is different for different insects?\"\n\n3. **Design an adaptation challenge:** \"Imagine you are a caterpillar in a world with a new predator that has never seen a monarch before. Design a NEW adaptation (not stripes) that could protect you. Draw it and explain how it works.\" (Connects to 3-LS4-2)\n\n4. **Investigate real data:** Provide a graph of monarch population changes over 10 years and have advanced students analyze patterns: \"What do you notice? What could cause these changes? What would you want to investigate?\" (Bridges toward data interpretation in later grades)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Monarch Habitat Garden Project:**\n   - If time and space allow, start milkweed seeds indoors (in cups on a windowsill) during or after the lesson\n   - Students care for seedlings and can plant them in a school garden or donate to a local pollinator garden\n   - Label the plants and monitor for real caterpillars or other visitors\n   - Document observations in a \"Garden Journal\" with drawings and predictions\n   - (Connects to 3-LS1-1, 3-LS4-3: understanding habitat needs and survival)\n\n2. **Butterfly Life Cycle Flip Book or Animation:**\n   - Students create a small flip book (5-6 index cards stapled together) showing the four stages\n   - Each page has a drawing that transitions slightly; flipping quickly creates animation\n   - Alternatively, use a digital tool (Canva, Google Slides, or simple stop-motion apps) to create a short animated sequence\n   - Share completed books/videos with the class\n   - (Supports visual learners and provides a take-home resource for family sharing)\n\n3. **Monarch Migration Simulation Game:**\n   - Set up a large outdoor space or gym with \"stations\" representing stages of the migration/life cycle\n   - Students move through stations, facing challenges (wind, lack of food, predators, cold weather)\n   - At each station, they complete a task or draw a card that affects their \"survival\"\n   - Afterward, discuss: \"Which stages were most dangerous? Why do monarchs need to migrate? What adaptations help them survive?\"\n   - (Extends to 3-LS4-3: understanding how organisms survive in particular habitats and 3-LS4-4: environmental change impacts)\n\n4. **Family Connection: \"Life Cycle Interview\"**\n   - Send home a simple template asking families to draw and label a family member's (or pet's) life cycle\n   - Include guiding questions: \"What stages have you lived through? What comes next?\" or \"How does your pet grow and change?\"\n   - Compile responses into a class book titled \"Many Life Cycles\"\n   - Share and compare with the monarch butterfly life cycle: \"How are they similar? How are they different?\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Implementation Tips\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson is designed for two 45-minute blocks. If you have longer periods (e.g., 90 minutes unbroken), you can combine phases. If shorter, split across 3 days: Day 1 (Engage + Explore), Day 2 (Explain + Elaborate), Day 3 (Evaluate + Extension).\n\n- **Real monarchs:** If monarchs are in season in your region, consider purchasing a butterfly kit (Insect Lore, Carolina Biological) so students can observe live caterpillars and chrysalis. The real-world observation is transformative and highly motivating. Kits typically cost $25–40 and include everything needed for a full classroom.\n\n- **Photograph integration:** Keep returning to the original photo throughout the lesson. Use it as a reference point: \"Remember the caterpillar we saw on the wall? That's the stage where...\" This maintains concrete connection to the abstract concept of metamorphosis.\n\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Third graders benefit from hearing and using new words multiple times across contexts. Use vocabulary consistently across the 5E phases and refer to the anchor chart frequently.\n\n- **Cultural and family connections:** Many cultures have folklore about butterflies. Invite families or community members to share stories or significance of monarchs in their heritage. This adds relevance and respect for diverse perspectives on nature.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
