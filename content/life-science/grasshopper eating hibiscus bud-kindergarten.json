The flower has green leaves around it.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of herbivory - when animals eat plants for food. The grasshopper is consuming the hibiscus flower bud because it needs energy and nutrients to survive. This represents a feeding relationship where the grasshopper acts as a primary consumer, obtaining energy directly from plant material. The grasshopper's specialized mouthparts allow it to chew and process plant tissue, while the plant represents a food source in the local ecosystem.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Animals need food to survive** - The grasshopper must eat plants to get energy for growing and moving\n2. **Living things interact with each other** - The grasshopper and plant have a relationship where one eats the other\n3. **Animals have body parts that help them get food** - The grasshopper has strong jaws and legs to hold and eat the plant\n4. **Plants and animals live together in the same place** - Both the grasshopper and flower are part of the same outdoor environment\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use this image to help students make connections to their own eating habits. Ask them to compare how they eat food to how the grasshopper eats the flower, emphasizing that all living things need food to survive.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to express their observations - through drawing, acting out the grasshopper's movements, or using simple words. Consider having students use magnifying glasses to examine real plants and look for signs of insect feeding.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** Inside the grasshopper's mouth are tiny cutting edges that work like scissors to slice through plant material. The grasshopper's digestive system breaks down the plant cells to release nutrients and energy.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This feeding relationship is part of a larger food web where grasshoppers may be eaten by birds, spiders, or other predators. The grasshopper helps control plant growth while also serving as food for other animals in the ecosystem.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"The grasshopper is hurting the plant on purpose or being mean.\"\n   **Clarification:** The grasshopper is just trying to get food to survive, just like when we eat vegetables.\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"Only big animals eat plants.\"\n   **Clarification:** Many small animals like insects, caterpillars, and grasshoppers eat plants too.\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"The plant will die if the grasshopper eats it.\"\n   **Clarification:** Plants can often grow back after being eaten, and many plants can survive losing some parts.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** K-LS1-1 - Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:K-LS1.C]] - All animals need food in order to live and grow\n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns in the natural world can be observed and used as evidence\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you notice about how the grasshopper is using its body parts to eat? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n2. Why do you think the grasshopper chose to eat this flower instead of something else? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n3. What other animals have you seen eating plants? (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n4. How is the way the grasshopper eats similar to or different from how you eat? (Bloom's: Compare | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Grasshopper:** A jumping insect that eats plants\n* **Herbivore:** An animal that only eats plants\n* **Energy:** The power living things need to grow and move\n* **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy\n* **Consumer:** A living thing that eats other living things for food\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle\n- What Do Insects Do? by Susan Canizares\n- From Seed to Plant by Gail Gibbons\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- \"Grasshoppers for Kids\" - Educational video showing grasshopper body parts and behaviors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\n- \"Animals Need Food - Science for Kids\" - Simple explanation of why animals eat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
