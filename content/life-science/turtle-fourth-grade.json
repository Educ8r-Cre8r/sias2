  "content": "Look at this incredible box turtle exploring its forest habitat! Box turtles are reptiles that can live for over 100 years and carry their home on their back wherever they go. Notice how its beautiful shell has growth rings like a tree, and how its orange and brown colors help it blend in with fallen leaves. This turtle is searching for food like insects, berries, and mushrooms among the plants and rocks. What do you think this turtle might discover on its slow journey through the forest?",
