Identify and name three external body parts of a frog and explain what each part helps the frog do.\n2. Observe and describe how a frog's body is different from a tadpole's body.\n3. Design or draw a frog body part that helps it survive in its habitat.\n4. Use movement and role-play to demonstrate how frogs use their bodies to catch food and escape predators.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, clear image of the frog photograph (printed 8.5\" × 11\" or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- A small toy frog or frog figurine (optional, to pass around)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around printed copies. Allow 1-2 minutes of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions in sequence** (pause for student responses after each):\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? What do you notice about it?\"\n   - \"Look at the frog's eyes. Why do you think frogs have such big eyes? What do they use them for?\"\n   - \"The frog is sitting on a green leaf. What color is the frog? Why might that be helpful for the frog?\"\n   - \"If you had to pick ONE part of this frog's body that helps it survive, what would it be? Why?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what this frog's body looked like when it was just born. Do you think it looked like this? Let's find out together!\"\n\n4. **Chart student ideas** on a piece of paper titled \"What We Wonder About Frogs.\" Keep this visible for the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Now let's explore frog bodies up close by becoming frogs ourselves and then looking at real pictures of how frogs change.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how frog body parts function through movement and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart showing or pictures of: adult frog, tadpole, and frog with legs developing\n- Open floor space or gymnasium\n- Index cards with frog body part labels (EYES, LEGS, MOUTH, SKIN) — one per student or pair\n- Student science notebooks or paper for recording\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Movement Exploration (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the activity:** \"We're going to move like frogs to see what their bodies do. Pay attention to what BODY PARTS you use when you move like a frog.\"\n\n2. **Guide students through these movements in sequence** (2-3 minutes each, with 30-60 seconds of practice):\n   - \"Hop like a frog. What body parts are helping you move? (legs!) Feel those strong muscles in your legs.\"\n   - \"Now look at something across the room like a frog watching for bugs. Where are your eyes pointing? (forward!) Frogs' big eyes help them see bugs to eat.\"\n   - \"Open your mouth and pretend to catch a bug flying past. Snap!\"\n   - \"Make your body very still and quiet. Frogs are green and sit still on leaves so animals don't see them. Can you blend in like a frog?\"\n\n3. **Debrief the movement:** Ask, \"Which frog body parts did we use? What did those parts help us do?\" (Chart responses: **Legs = hopping/escaping; Eyes = seeing bugs; Mouth = catching food; Skin color = hiding.**)\n\n**Part B: Frog Life Cycle Observation (8-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display pictures or chart showing tadpole → tadpole with legs → young frog → adult frog.**\n\n2. **Ask observation questions:**\n   - \"Look at the tadpole. What body parts do you see?\" (head, tail, no legs)\n   - \"Look at the frog. What body parts do you see?\" (head, body, four legs, no tail)\n   - \"What is different? What is the same?\"\n\n3. **Student recording:** In their science notebook or on paper, students **draw a tadpole on one side and a frog on the other side.** They can label or copy these simple labels:\n   - Tadpole: tail, body, head, mouth\n   - Frog: legs, body, head, eyes\n\n4. **Circulate and ask:** \"Tell me one thing that's different. Tell me one thing that's the same.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- During movement, model each action clearly and encourage full participation. Do not correct \"wrong\" movements—frogs vary!\n- During observations, ask guiding questions rather than telling students the answer: \"What do YOU notice?\"\n- Help students record by providing sentence starters: \"A tadpole has ____. A frog has ____.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students physically experience how frogs use body parts.\n- Students produce labeled drawings showing tadpole-to-frog changes.\n- Students articulate at least 2 differences and 1 similarity between tadpoles and frogs.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts using student discoveries.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The frog photograph (from Engage)\n- Chart paper with student observations from Explore\n- Large, colorful vocabulary cards (one per word, with pictures)\n- Student science notebooks\n- Optional: a short picture book about frogs (e.g., \"From Tadpole to Frog\" by Wendy Pfeffer, or similar)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 students to show their tadpole/frog drawings.\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover? Which body parts did you draw for the tadpole? For the frog?\"\n   - Highlight the key idea: \"Tadpoles and frogs have different body parts because they live differently.\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n   Display and discuss these five terms using the photograph and drawings as reference:\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Connection** |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Tadpole** | A baby frog that lives in water and has a tail instead of legs. | Show in the life cycle chart. |\n   | **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. | \"The frog's strong legs are an adaptation for hopping away from danger.\" |\n   | **Camouflage** | When an animal's color or pattern helps it hide from other animals. | \"The frog in the photo is green like the leaf—that's camouflage!\" |\n   | **External body parts** | Parts on the outside of an animal's body that help it live and grow. | \"Eyes, legs, skin—these are external parts. They're on the outside!\" |\n   | **Metamorphosis** | The big changes a tadpole goes through to become a frog. | \"Tadpoles change A LOT. That change is called metamorphosis.\" |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the frog in the original photo.\n   - \"This frog uses its **external body parts** — its big eyes, its legs, its colored skin — to **survive**. Its color is a kind of **camouflage**. It's an **adaptation**.\"\n   - \"This frog went through **metamorphosis**. It started as a **tadpole** in the water. Now it has legs and can hop on land!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Point to the frog's adaptation in this picture. (legs, eyes, green color—any answer showing understanding is correct.)\"\n   - Ask: \"Which body part does a tadpole have that a frog doesn't?\" (tail)\n   - Ask: \"Show me with your body an external part of a frog.\" (Students point to/demonstrate eyes, legs, mouth, etc.)\n\n**Vocabulary List:**\n- **Tadpole:** A young frog that lives underwater and has a tail.\n- **Adaptation:** A body part or way an animal acts that helps it stay alive in its home.\n- **Camouflage:** Colors or patterns that help an animal hide.\n- **External body parts:** Parts you can see on the outside of an animal's body.\n- **Metamorphosis:** Big changes that happen as an animal grows.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use at least 2-3 vocabulary words correctly in context.\n- Students point to or name at least 2 external body parts of a frog and explain what one part does.\n- Students describe the difference between a tadpole and a frog using the word \"legs\" or \"tail.\"\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by designing a frog body part or solving a survival problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Paper plates, construction paper, markers, crayons, colored pencils\n- Pipe cleaners, pom-poms, googly eyes, tape, glue sticks (optional, for 3D frog craft)\n- Design challenge worksheet or card (see below)\n- Pictures of different frog habitats (rainforest, pond, desert) — optional\n\n**Activity: Two Options (Choose one based on your class and time)**\n\n**Option A: Design a Frog to Survive (Recommended for strong engagement)**\n\n1. **Present a challenge:** \"A new frog species needs to live in a muddy pond where it's hard to see. It needs to catch fast bugs and hide from herons (birds that eat frogs). What body parts should this frog have? Design a frog that can survive!\"\n\n2. **Students sketch or build a frog** with these requirements:\n   - At least ONE body part for catching food (mouth, tongue, etc.)\n   - At least ONE body part for moving (legs, etc.)\n   - At least ONE color or pattern for hiding (camouflage)\n   \n3. **On their drawing or next to their model, students write or dictate:**\n   - \"This frog has _____ to help it _____ .\"\n   - Example: \"This frog has big legs to help it hop away from the heron.\"\n\n4. **Gallery walk (if time permits):** Post designs and have students walk around observing 2-3 peers' frogs, with sticky note comments: \"I like your _____ because _____.\"\n\n**Option B: Frog Body Part Matching (Quick, collaborative alternative)**\n\n1. **Create cards with frog body parts** (LEGS, EYES, MOUTH, SKIN) and survival needs (CATCHING FOOD, HOPPING AWAY, SEEING BUGS, HIDING).\n\n2. **Students work in pairs** to match body parts to survival needs.\n\n3. **Ask:** \"How do these body parts match what frogs need to do to survive?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask students to explain their design choices: \"Why did you give your frog those legs?\"\n- Help students connect design features to real adaptations: \"That's like the green skin of the frog in our photo!\"\n- Encourage all attempts; emphasis is on thinking about function, not artistic quality.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce a design with at least 2-3 labeled body parts.\n- Students explain (verbally or in writing) how at least 1 body part helps the frog survive.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that body structure connects to survival function.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of frog adaptations and life cycle changes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student participation in Engage discussions and Explore movement.\n- Review tadpole-to-frog drawings for evidence of understanding differences and similarities.\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain vocabulary checks.\n- Circulate during Elaborate and record 2-3 student statements about how body parts help frogs survive.\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\nGive each student a card or paper with **three tasks**:\n\n1. **Draw a frog and label THREE external body parts.** (Students draw and write or copy words: eyes, legs, mouth, skin, etc.)\n\n2. **Answer this question** (you can read it aloud):\n   - \"How does a frog's body help it catch food and stay safe?\"\n   - *Accept any answer showing a body part (eyes, mouth, legs, color) connected to survival.*\n   - Examples of correct responses:\n     - \"The frog has big eyes so it can see bugs.\"\n     - \"The frog has strong legs so it can hop away.\"\n     - \"The frog is green so other animals can't see it.\"\n\n3. **Draw a tadpole and an adult frog. Show ONE way they are different.**\n   - *Look for evidence that the student identifies the tail in the tadpole and legs in the frog.*\n\n**Success Criteria for Mastery:**\n\n| **Criterion** | **Developing** | **Proficient** | **Advanced** |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Identifies frog body parts** | Names 1-2 parts with support | Names 2-3 parts independently | Names 4+ parts and describes their functions |\n| **Explains body part function** | Responds with vague answers (\"It helps\") | Connects 1 body part to 1 survival need (\"Legs help hopping\") | Connects 2+ body parts to multiple survival functions |\n| **Describes tadpole-to-frog difference** | Names vague differences with prompting | Identifies 1 clear difference (legs, tail) | Identifies 2+ differences and understands progression |\n| **Uses vocabulary** | Rarely uses lesson vocabulary | Uses 1-2 terms (adaptation, tadpole, external) | Uses 3+ terms correctly in context |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 80% of students successfully label 2 frog body parts.\n- At least 70% of students articulate how at least 1 body part helps a frog survive.\n- At least 75% of students identify at least 1 difference between a tadpole and a frog.\n- Students demonstrate understanding of the lesson's core concept: **Frogs' bodies are specially designed to help them survive.**\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary during Explain:** Before whole-group vocabulary instruction, work one-on-one with students who need support. Use the photograph and simplified definitions: \"This frog's green color is like camouflage—it helps the frog hide.\"\n\n2. **Provide sentence starters and word banks:** During Elaborate, give students pre-written options: \"This frog has _____ (legs/eyes) to help it _____ (hop/see).\" Students fill in blanks rather than generating from scratch.\n\n3. **Use hand-over-hand modeling during Explore movement:** For students struggling with following directions, physically demonstrate hopping or eye-tracking movements, then guide the student through the action with physical support.\n\n4. **Simplify exit ticket:** Ask only two questions instead of three, or allow oral responses instead of written.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extend the design challenge:** \"Your frog needs to survive in TWO habitats—a pond AND a forest. What body parts would it need? Can you design a frog that could live in both places?\" Students sketch and explain trade-offs.\n\n2. **Research and compare frog species:** Provide images or facts about 3-4 different frogs (tree frog, bullfrogs, poison dart frogs). Students sort by adaptations: \"Which frog has camouflage? Which frog can climb? Why?\"\n\n3. **Predict metamorphosis stages:** Show pictures of frog metamorphosis in random order (eggs, tadpole, tadpole with back legs, tadpole with all four legs, young frog, adult frog). Ask students to sequence them and explain: \"What changes first? What happens next? Why do these changes help?\"\n\n4. **Create a \"Frog Survival Field Guide\":** Advanced students write and illustrate a simple guide: \"A frog's legs help it _____. A frog's eyes help it _____. A frog's color helps it _____.\" Pages become part of a class or personal book.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Tadpole-to-Frog Life Cycle Sequencing Game:**\n   - Print or draw pictures of frog metamorphosis stages (4-6 pictures). Laminate them.\n   - Students work in pairs to arrange the pictures in order and explain what's happening at each stage.\n   - Can be played multiple times and stored for future use.\n   - *Connects to 1-LS3-1 (observing changes in young animals).*\n\n2. **Frog Habitat Diorama:**\n   - Students create a shoebox or paper habitat for a frog (pond, forest, etc.).\n   - Include plants, water or mud, and a frog made from craft materials.\n   - Students label the habitat and explain why it's a good home for a frog.\n   - *Bridges to ecosystems and habitats (extends beyond Grade 1 standards but natural progression).*\n\n3. **Class Book: \"Frogs Are Amazing!\"**\n   - Each student contributes one page with: a picture of a frog, a labeled body part, and a sentence: \"This frog uses its _____ to _____.\"\n   - Bind pages into a class book for repeated reading in the classroom library.\n   - *Reinforces vocabulary and provides take-home familiarity with content.*\n\n4. **Listen and Act: Frog Movement Story**\n   - Read or tell a simple story about a frog's day: \"A tadpole is swimming in the pond. Now it grows legs! It hops onto a lily pad. Its green skin helps it hide. A fly comes. The frog's big eyes see it. Snap! It catches the fly!\"\n   - Students act out each part as you narrate.\n   - *Multi-sensory reinforcement for kinesthetic learners.*\n\n5. **Frog Adaptations in Nature Hunt (outdoor or picture-based):**\n   - Take students outside and have them find places where frogs could hide (under leaves, in grass, near water).\n   - Ask: \"Why would a green frog be safe here?\" \n   - If outdoor access is limited, use pictures of natural settings and have students draw frogs camouflaged in each.\n   - *Real-world application of camouflage concept.*\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Pacing:** This lesson works best split across two sessions. Do Engage + Explore on Day 1, Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2. This allows better retention and reduces cognitive load.\n- **Frog sources:** If possible, arrange a visit from a local naturalist with a live (non-toxic) frog, or show a short video clip of a frog hunting or hopping. First graders respond powerfully to live animals.\n- **Safety:** Ensure any physical movement activity has adequate space and clear boundaries. No students should be bumped or hurt during hopping activities.\n- **Inclusivity:** The 5E model provides multiple entry points—visual learners benefit from the photograph and drawings; kinesthetic learners from the movement exploration; verbal learners from discussion and vocabulary instruction.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly addresses NGSS 1-LS1-1 by having students **design and explain** how frog body parts help frogs survive, and 1-LS3-1 by having students **observe and articulate** differences between tadpoles and adult frogs. The photograph serves as the concrete anchor throughout, and all vocabulary and concepts are calibrated for First Grade cognitive development.",
