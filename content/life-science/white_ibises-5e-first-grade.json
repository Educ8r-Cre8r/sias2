ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how animals' body parts help them survive by introducing the ibis photograph and connecting to their own experiences.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of white ibises (displayed on board, projector, or printed)\n- Chart paper and marker (for recording student observations)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** where all students can see it clearly. Allow them 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions** (one at a time, allowing 20-30 seconds of think time for each):\n   - \"What do you notice about this bird's beak? Why do you think it looks like that?\"\n   - \"Look at the bird's legs. How are they different from our legs? What do you think the bird uses those long legs for?\"\n   - \"These birds are standing in mud and water. How does the bird's beak help it find food in places we couldn't reach with our hands?\"\n   - \"If you had to pick food out of mud using only your mouth, what tool or shape would help you?\"\n\n3. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"I'm thinking about how this bird's special beak shape helps it survive. What do you predict this beak helps the ibis do?\" Accept all student ideas—write 2-3 on chart paper.\n\n4. **Show student engagement:** Celebrate curiosity with enthusiasm: \"Great questions! Today we're going to become scientists and discover how this bird's body parts are like special tools that help it stay alive.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore how we can use our hands and tools to discover what the ibis beak does so well!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students physically investigate how a curved tool can find hidden objects in mud/soil, mimicking how an ibis uses its beak.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- 1 small plastic container or cup\n- 2–3 cups of wet sand or potting soil\n- 1 straight stick or pencil\n- 1 curved tool: a wooden spoon, plastic spoon, or pipe cleaner bent into a curve\n- Small objects hidden in the soil: pasta pieces, small stones, or wrapped candy (10–15 pieces per container)\n- Paper towel or newspaper (to contain mess)\n- Observation sheet (see below) or clipboard with pencil\n- Wet cloth to wipe hands\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Prepare stations:** Before the lesson, fill containers 3/4 full with moist sand/soil and hide small objects throughout (2–3 inches deep).\n\n2. **Introduce the exploration:** \"Today you're going to use two different tools to dig in mud, just like an ibis! One tool is straight (like a pencil) and one tool is curved (like a spoon). You'll discover which tool works better for finding food hidden in the mud—and why.\"\n\n3. **Demonstrate proper technique** (teacher models first):\n   - Take the straight stick and try to dig/probe into the wet soil. Show how it pokes straight down.\n   - Take the curved spoon and show how it can scoop and feel around in the mud. Lift a small amount of soil.\n   - Say: \"Watch how the curved tool helps me scoop and feel. The straight tool just pokes.\"\n\n4. **Student directions (read aloud; write steps on board with pictures if possible):**\n   - Partner A will use the **straight tool** for 2 minutes to find as many hidden objects as possible. Count them!\n   - Partner B will use the **curved tool** for 2 minutes to find as many hidden objects as possible. Count them!\n   - Switch tools and repeat (2 more minutes).\n   - Record your counts on the observation sheet.\n   - Talk with your partner: \"Which tool found more objects? Why do you think the curved tool worked better (or the same)?\"\n\n5. **Observation Sheet** (simple, with pictures and words):\n   ```\n   WHICH TOOL FOUND MORE FOOD?\n   \n   Our straight tool found: ____ objects\n   Our curved tool found: ____ objects\n   \n   The curved tool worked better because: ________________\n   \n   Draw the tool that worked best:  [DRAWING BOX]\n   ```\n\n6. **Teacher Role During Explore:**\n   - Circulate and **listen** without giving answers.\n   - Ask questions to prompt thinking: \"What did you notice when you used each tool?\" \"Can you describe the difference?\" \"Why might the ibis have a curved beak instead of a straight one?\"\n   - Encourage persistence: \"Try that again. What happens when you push harder? When you twist?\"\n   - Ensure safety: Check for hand-washing after exploration.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that the curved tool (spoon) scoops and finds more objects than the straight tool.\n- Students begin to understand that the shape of a tool affects how well it works.\n- Students make a connection: \"The ibis's curved beak is like our curved spoon!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Build vocabulary and connect students' discoveries to how the ibis's body parts help it survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of ibis (same as Engage phase)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: Picture cards of ibis body parts (beak, legs, feathers, eyes)\n- Simple reference poster or diagram labeling ibis parts (teacher-made or printed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out** (5 minutes):\n   - Ask pairs to share results: \"Which tool found more? Who wants to show us with your curved tool?\"\n   - Guide them to notice: \"What was different about the curved tool?\" (It scoops, cups food, holds things better)\n   - Record patterns on chart: \"Why the curved tool works: It scoops. It holds. It fits into small spaces.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions** (use the photograph to point):\n\n   **Beak:** The hard, pointed or curved mouth part of a bird that it uses to catch, hold, and eat food.\n   - Point to the ibis's beak in the photo: \"See this red, curved beak? That's what helps this bird find food!\"\n\n   **External body parts:** The parts of an animal we can see on the outside (like the beak, legs, wings, tail, feathers).\n   - Point: \"Look at the ibis. We can see its beak, its long legs, its white feathers. These are external parts.\"\n\n   **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n   - \"The ibis's beak helps it survive because it helps the bird find and eat food. No food = no survival!\"\n\n   **Adapted / Special for a purpose:** Body parts that work in a special way to help an animal do something.\n   - \"The curved beak is adapted to dig in mud. Our straight pencil isn't adapted for that—but the ibis beak is!\"\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph** (5 minutes):\n   - Display the ibis photo again. Ask: \"Look at all these ibises. What body parts do you see that help them survive?\"\n   - Have students point or call out: beaks, long legs, feathers.\n   - Explain: \"All these ibises have curved beaks because those beaks are perfect for finding food in the water and mud. Their long legs help them wade without getting stuck. Their white feathers help them hide in bright sunlight. Every body part has a job!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding** (3 minutes):\n   - Ask individual students: \"Why does the ibis have a curved beak and not a straight beak?\" (Accept answers: \"To dig in mud,\" \"To find food,\" \"Because it works better.\")\n   - Show a picture of a different bird (straight-beaked bird like a robin or hummingbird) and ask: \"Would an ibis beak work the same way? Why or why not?\" (Guide them to see: different habitats, different foods = different beak shapes.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Beak:** The hard mouth part of a bird that catches and eats food.\n- **External body parts:** Parts of an animal you can see on the outside (beak, legs, feathers, eyes, wings).\n- **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n- **Adapted:** Body parts that work in a special way to help an animal live in its home.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can point to and name the ibis's external body parts (beak, legs, feathers).\n- Students understand that the curved beak is a special tool that helps the ibis find food and survive.\n- Students can explain: \"The beak's curved shape helps dig in mud\" or \"The long legs help the bird walk in water.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a tool that mimics the ibis's beak and solves a new problem.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Playdough or modeling clay (enough for 2–3 oz. per group)\n- Craft materials: pipe cleaners, popsicle sticks, straws, plastic spoons, or wooden dowels\n- 1 new container with wet sand/soil and hidden small objects (same setup as Explore, with fresh items to find)\n- Ruler or tape measure (to measure tool length)\n- Observation sheet for design challenge (see below)\n- Tape, scissors (teacher-supervised)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the design challenge** (2 minutes):\n   - \"Now you're going to be engineers! The ibis has a curved beak that works perfectly. Your job is to design and build your own tool that works like an ibis beak. Your tool must:\n     - Be curved or bent (like the ibis beak)\n     - Be able to find hidden food in mud\n     - Be longer than 4 inches (so you don't have to reach so far)\n   - After you build it, you'll test it!\"\n\n2. **Design and build phase** (8 minutes):\n   - Provide students with materials and allow them to choose and combine: pipe cleaners bent into curves, spoons, playdough molded around sticks, etc.\n   - Students work in pairs. Each pair builds one tool.\n   - Teacher circulates: \"Tell me about your tool. Why did you make it curved? What does it remind you of?\"\n   - Encourage sketches: \"Draw your tool before you build it, so you remember your idea.\"\n\n3. **Test phase** (5 minutes):\n   - Bring students to the testing container (fresh mud with hidden objects).\n   - Each pair gets 1–2 minutes to test their tool and count how many objects they find.\n   - Ask: \"Does your tool work? Is it like the ibis beak? What would you change to make it better?\"\n\n4. **Reflect and share** (3 minutes):\n   - Ask 2–3 pairs to show their tools and describe: \"Why is your tool curved? What does it help you do?\"\n   - Celebrate design choices: \"That curved pipe cleaner is perfect—just like a real ibis beak!\"\n\n**Design Challenge Observation Sheet:**\n```\nDESIGN YOUR OWN IBIS BEAK TOOL\n\nSketch your tool before you build it:\n[DRAWING BOX]\n\nWhat materials did you use? _____________________\n\nIs your tool curved? Yes / No\n\nHow many objects did your tool find? ____\n\nDoes your tool work like an ibis beak? \nCircle one: YES   SORT OF   NO\n\nWhat would you change? _________________________\n```\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without solving the problem for students.\n- Ask: \"What do you notice about the shape? How does that shape help?\" rather than \"Make it more curved.\"\n- Celebrate all attempts equally—focus on learning, not perfection.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully design and build a curved tool inspired by the ibis's beak.\n- Students understand that the **shape of a tool matters**—curves work better for scooping.\n- Students test and reflect on whether their designs work and why.\n- Students can verbally explain: \"My curved tool works like the ibis beak because...\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how external body parts help animals survive and meet their needs.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Listen to student explanations as they compare tools. Record student language: Do they notice the curved shape? Do they compare to the ibis?\n- **During Explain:** Check responses to questions: \"Why does the ibis have a curved beak?\" Correct misconceptions gently.\n- **During Elaborate:** Observe whether students design curved tools and can explain why.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket** (administered at end of Session 2, take-home, or verbal for first graders who struggle with writing):\n\n**Option 1: Drawing + Dictation (best for early first grade)**\n- Prompt: \"Draw the ibis's beak. Tell me one way the beak helps the ibis stay alive.\"\n- Teacher scribes student response or student writes simple words.\n\n**Option 2: Multiple-Choice Observation Task (teacher-led or independent)**\nShow the ibis photo and ask:\n1. \"What does the ibis use its curved beak for? Circle one:\n   - [Picture of bird eating]\n   - [Picture of bird building nest]\n   - [Picture of bird flying]\"\n\n2. \"The ibis has long legs. Why? (Teacher reads options aloud)\n   - To run very fast\n   - To walk through deep water without getting stuck\n   - To kick other birds away\"\n\n3. \"Do you think a baby ibis has a curved beak like its parents? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify the ibis's beak and describe it as curved or long.\n- ✓ Student can explain ONE way the beak helps the ibis (catch food, dig in mud, find food).\n- ✓ Student can compare their tool to the ibis beak and explain the similarity (both curved, both help find food).\n- ✓ Student observes that young ibises look similar to adults (beaks, legs, feathers).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can point to the ibis's beak and correctly answer: \"It helps the bird find food.\"\n- 70% of students can explain why a curved shape works better than a straight shape (for scooping, digging, holding).\n- All students can name one external body part of the ibis and describe its function.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use consistent, short phrases instead of complex words. Use the same words repeatedly: \"The curved beak finds food. The curved tool finds food. Your curved tool is like the ibis beak.\"\n2. **Hand-over-hand modeling:** If a student struggles with the exploration task, demonstrate by placing your hand over theirs and guiding the tool together. Ask: \"Feel how the curve scoops?\"\n3. **Pair with a buddy:** Pair students with stronger peers who can model language (\"The curved tool found more!\") and encourage participation.\n4. **Visual supports:** Use picture cards labeling body parts. Point to the photo repeatedly when introducing vocabulary. Draw simple arrows on the photo showing how the beak moves.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n1. **Compare other bird beaks:** Show pictures of different birds (hummingbird, woodpecker, pelican, duck) and ask: \"Why does each bird have a different beak shape? What does each beak help the bird do?\" Students predict and research what each bird eats.\n2. **Design for different habitats:** \"If an ibis lived in the forest instead of the mud, what would its beak need to be like? Why?\" Students sketch and explain adaptations to new habitats.\n3. **Measure and document:** Students measure the length of their designed tools and the ibis's beak (from photos), record data, and compare: \"Is a longer beak better? Why or why not?\"\n4. **Inheritance observation:** Ask: \"Do all baby ibises look exactly like their parents, or are they a little different?\" Provide photos of parent and baby ibises and have students list similarities and differences (size, feather pattern, beak exact shade).\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Beak Diversity Hunt:** Bring in multiple images of different bird beaks (robin, hummingbird, woodpecker, flamingo, pelican). Students sort by beak shape and match to habitat pictures or food pictures. Discussion: \"Why do you think different birds need different beaks?\" Creates connections to adaptation and habitat.\n\n2. **Ibis Behavior Observation Journal:** Over one week, if possible, have students observe a local habitat (park, garden, pond) or watch a short video clip of ibises feeding in nature (3–5 min). Students sketch and write: \"What did the ibis do? How did its beak help?\" This extends 1-LS1-2 (patterns in animal behavior).\n\n3. **Family Similarity Activity:** Students bring in photos of themselves and a family member (parent, sibling, grandparent) and compare external features: \"What features look the same? What looks different?\" Connect to 1-LS3-1: Young animals look like their parents but aren't exactly the same. Create a class poster: \"We Look Like Our Families!\"\n\n---",
