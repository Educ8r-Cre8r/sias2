Observe and describe the lizard's body parts using simple words (colors, bumpy skin, four legs, tail, pouch).\n2. Explain how the lizard's body parts help it survive (hide from predators, stay warm, climb).\n3. Identify things a lizard needs to live (warmth, rocks, branches, insects).\n4. Recognize that different animals have different body shapes and colors that help them live in their homes.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animals and how they are built.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large photograph of the lizard (printed 11×14\" or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Small stuffed animal or toy lizard (optional, for holding)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** at eye level where all students can see it clearly. Do NOT explain what it is yet.\n\n2. **Ask these curiosity-sparking questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about it.\" (Listen for color, body parts, pattern)\n   - \"Do you know what animal this is? What makes you think that?\"\n   - \"Look at that bright red and orange belly. Why do you think this lizard has such a colorful patch on its tummy?\" (Accept all guesses; write them on chart paper)\n   - \"What body parts can you point to? Can you find legs, eyes, a tail?\" (Have students point to their own matching body parts)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder why this lizard has bumpy skin and a puffy red belly. Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Today we're going to become animal detectives and discover how this special lizard's body helps it live and survive.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate animal body parts and their purposes through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the lizard (printed copy at each table or on screen)\n- Picture cards of lizard body parts (6-8 enlarged pictures): head, eye, legs, tail, bumpy skin, red dewlap/belly\n- Real items to touch that match the lizard's environment: small smooth rocks, bark/branches, rough fabric, smooth fabric\n- Hand lenses (1 per pair of students)\n- Student observation worksheet (see template below)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station Setup (or whole-group if space is limited):**\nStudents work in pairs or small groups of 3. Rotate through 2-3 stations if time allows.\n\n**Station 1: Body Parts Detective**\n- Display the lizard photo and the body part picture cards (mixed up).\n- **Student directions:** \"Match the body part card to the same part on the lizard in the picture. Talk about what you notice. Does it look rough or smooth? What color is it? Point to this part on your own body if you have it.\"\n- Students record by drawing what they see or pointing to the part on a body diagram worksheet.\n\n**Station 2: Feel the Lizard's Home**\n- Set out small rocks, bark, rough fabric, and smooth fabric.\n- **Student directions:** \"Touch each item carefully. Is it bumpy like the lizard's skin? Is it smooth? Is it rough? The lizard lives on rocks and branches. Which items feel like places where a lizard might hide?\"\n- Students touch and sort items, explaining choices to their partner.\n\n**Station 3: Color Detective**\n- Display the lizard photo.\n- Provide colored pencils (gray, tan, red, orange, yellow).\n- **Student directions:** \"Look at the lizard's colors. Find your own colored pencils that match. The lizard uses colors to hide and to show strength. Can you color a circle to match the lizard's belly pouch?\"\n- Students color a provided outline or create their own colored pattern.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each station. Ask open-ended questions: *\"What does this feel like?\" \"Where else have you seen this color?\" \"How does this help the lizard?\"*\n- Do NOT tell students answers. Guide them to observe and think.\n- Use think-pair-share: Have students tell their partner what they found before sharing with the group.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 4+ body parts on the lizard.\n- Students describe textures and colors using simple words (bumpy, smooth, red, orange).\n- Students make a connection between the lizard's appearance and its environment (rocks, branches).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and tie observations back to survival and adaptation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Large lizard photograph\n- Picture cards of what lizards need (sun, rocks, insects, water, branches—printed or drawn)\n- Vocabulary word cards (printed or handwritten, with simple pictures)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on the carpet.** Display the lizard photograph again.\n\n2. **Share-out from Explore:**\n   - \"Who found a bumpy body part? Tell us what you discovered.\"\n   - \"What colors did you see? Which color was brightest?\"\n   - \"Which item from our station felt like the lizard's home?\"\n   - Record student observations on chart paper under headings: *Colors*, *Body Parts*, *Feelings*, *Home*.\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary (5 key terms, with student-friendly definitions):**\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Connection to Photo** |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Adaptation** | A special body part or color that helps an animal survive. | The lizard's red belly and bumpy skin are adaptations. |\n   | **Dewlap** | A fancy name for the colorful pouch or flap under an animal's chin or belly. | We can see the lizard's red and orange dewlap in the picture. |\n   | **Camouflage** | Colors and patterns that help an animal hide from bigger animals. | The lizard's gray and tan body blends with rocks. |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives with things it needs. | A lizard's habitat has rocks, branches, sunshine, and insects. |\n   | **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy. | The lizard uses its body and home to survive. |\n\n4. **Make explicit connections:**\n   - Point to the photo: \"This lizard's bumpy, gray-and-tan skin helps it hide on rocky ground. That's camouflage. It helps the lizard survive!\"\n   - Point to the red belly: \"This bright dewlap shows other lizards that it is strong. It can also scare enemies away.\"\n   - \"The lizard needs a warm, dry place with rocks and branches. That's its habitat.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your fingers how bumpy this lizard's skin is.\" (Students make bumpy fingers)\n   - \"If a lizard is hiding on a rock, what color would help it? Why?\" (Connect to camouflage)\n   - \"What does a lizard need to live?\" (Accept any answer; reinforce habitat items)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use 2-3 vocabulary words correctly in simple sentences.\n- Students can point to and name at least 5 body parts.\n- Students understand that body parts help animals survive.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply and extend understanding by exploring other animals' adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pictures of 4-5 other animals with clear adaptations: penguin (black and white), zebra (stripes), giraffe (long neck), frog (bumpy skin), snake (scales)\n- Chart labeled *\"How Does This Animal's Body Help It Survive?\"*\n- Index cards with animal names\n- Crayons and white paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce other animals:** \"We learned how the lizard's body helps it survive. Other animals have special bodies too. Let's be detectives and find their adaptations!\"\n\n2. **Show 4-5 animal pictures one at a time.** For each animal:\n   - Ask: *\"What colors and patterns do you see? What body parts are special? How might this help the animal stay safe and healthy?\"*\n   - Record observations on a class chart.\n   - Example: \"The penguin is black and white. Black on top helps hide in dark water. White on the belly helps hide in the snow and ice.\"\n\n3. **Drawing activity:** \n   - \"Pick your favorite animal from the pictures. Draw it on your paper and show ONE special body part that helps it survive.\"\n   - Students draw and dictate (or write with teacher support) one sentence: *\"The [animal]'s [body part] helps it [survive by...]\"*\n   - Examples: *\"The giraffe's long neck helps it eat leaves from high trees.\" \"The zebra's stripes help it hide in tall grass.\"*\n\n4. **Share drawings:** 2-3 volunteers show their drawing and explain.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to notice patterns and connections without giving away answers.\n- Validate all observations; scaffold toward adaptation concepts.\n- Celebrate connections to the lizard lesson.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify adaptations in 2-3 different animals.\n- Students produce a labeled drawing with a simple explanation of how a body part helps an animal.\n- Students apply vocabulary (adaptation, camouflage, body part, survive) in new contexts.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of animal body parts, adaptations, and survival needs.\n\n**Activities:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore stations:\n  - ☐ Student identifies body parts on the lizard\n  - ☐ Student describes textures using sensory words\n  - ☐ Student makes connection between lizard appearance and environment\n  \n- **Question prompts during Explain:**\n  - \"Why do you think the lizard has this color?\" (Listen for camouflage, hiding, or blending in)\n  - \"What does the lizard need to stay alive?\" (Listen for warmth, food, rocks, branches)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes):**\nChoose ONE format based on your students' abilities:\n\n**Option A: Picture Sort (non-readers)**\n- Show 4 pictures: (1) rocks/branches, (2) bright sun, (3) insects, (4) water droplet\n- Ask: \"Which of these does a lizard need to survive?\" \n- Students point or paste onto a chart labeled *\"Lizard Needs\"*\n- Success: Student identifies 3+ items lizards need\n\n**Option B: Verbal Interview (small group)**\n- Sit with 1-2 students and ask:\n  - \"Tell me about the lizard's bumpy skin.\"\n  - \"Why does the lizard have a red belly?\"\n  - \"Where does a lizard live?\"\n- Record responses on an interview sheet\n- Success: Student answers 2/3 questions with detail (color, body part, habitat reference)\n\n**Option C: Draw and Tell (mixed ability)**\n- Provide a simple worksheet with a lizard outline\n- Ask: \"Draw or point to one special body part that helps this lizard survive. Tell me why it's important.\"\n- Teacher scribes student explanation\n- Success: Student identifies a body part and gives a reason (e.g., \"The tail helps it climb\" or \"The bumpy skin helps it hide\")\n\n**Success Criteria for Lesson Mastery:**\n- ✓ Student describes 2+ lizard body parts\n- ✓ Student explains how at least 1 body part helps the lizard survive\n- ✓ Student identifies 2+ things a lizard needs to live\n- ✓ Student uses 1-2 vocabulary words (adapt, habitat, camouflage, survive) in context\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only *color*, *body part*, *home*, *safe* instead of full list. Introduce *adaptation* through repetition and visuals only.\n\n2. **Paired exploration:** Always pair with a stronger student or peer buddy. Provide a **picture-based observation sheet** with labeled diagrams instead of blank paper. Student points or matches rather than writes.\n\n3. **Reduce choices:** At elaborate station, show only 2 animals instead of 5. Ask simpler question: *\"Is this animal's body light or dark? Does that help it hide?\"*\n\n4. **Extend processing time:** Provide 5-10 extra seconds of wait time after each question. Use think-pair-share so student can talk to partner before answering whole group.\n\n5. **Tactile/kinesthetic access:** Let students **feel real reptile scales** (if available, from a safe, handled bearded dragon or snake shed skin) or rough sandpaper to match the photo's texture.\n\n---\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper \"why\" questions:** \n   - \"The lizard's dewlap is red. What other animals use bright colors to send messages? Why?\"\n   - \"If the lizard lost its tail, could it still survive? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"Deserts are hot and dry. How does the lizard's bumpy skin help it in the desert?\"\n\n2. **Compare and contrast:** Provide photos of a **desert lizard** and a **tree frog** side-by-side.\n   - \"Which animal's skin looks rougher? Which looks wetter? Why would they be different if they live in different places?\"\n\n3. **Camouflage investigation:** Create a **\"Camouflage Hunt\"** game.\n   - Print the lizard photo. Hide it in a poster with rocks and branches as background.\n   - Challenge: \"Find the lizard in this rocky picture. Why is it hard to see?\"\n   - Extend: \"Can you draw a lizard in a tree? Would its colors be the same as a lizard on rocks? Why?\"\n\n4. **Research extension:** \"What other lizards exist? Do they all have dewlaps? Do they all live in the same habitat?\" (Provide picture cards of 2-3 other lizard species; discuss differences.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Sensory Adaptation Station (5-10 min follow-up or small group):**\n   - Set up 5 mystery boxes with items matching different senses: rough bark, soft fabric, smooth rock, warm water, cool water, strong-smelling herb\n   - Label each: *\"How does this help a lizard?\"*\n   - Students explore and guess which sense helps the lizard find food, stay warm, or hide\n   - Reinforces: Lizards use all their senses to survive\n\n2. **Lizard Habitat Diorama (take-home or extended project, 20-30 min):**\n   - Provide a small shoebox, construction paper, real rocks, twigs, and magazines\n   - Students build a \"home\" for a lizard with all things it needs to survive (sun, rocks, branches, insects drawn/cut from magazines)\n   - Write or dictate label cards: *\"This is a lizard's habitat. It has ___.\"*\n   - Reinforces: Understanding of specific habitat needs and survival\n\n3. **Animal Adaptation Book (can extend over 2-3 days, 15 min per session):**\n   - Each page has one animal (penguin, zebra, butterfly, frog, bird, snake)\n   - Student draws the animal and completes sentence frame: *\"The [animal]'s [body part] helps it [action] to survive.\"*\n   - Create a class Big Book with all students' pages\n   - Reinforces: Adaptations across animal kingdom; vocabulary reinforcement; writing/dictation practice\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Pacing:** The full lesson (70-90 min) can be split across 2 days: Day 1 = Engage + Explore (40 min), Day 2 = Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate (50 min).\n- **Photo visibility:** Print or display the lizard photo in high resolution so small details (scales, dewlap texture) are visible from 6+ feet away.\n- **Safety note:** If using a live or handled reptile as a comparison, ensure it is calm, safe, and handled only by trained staff. Do NOT rush this; let students observe from a comfortable distance.\n- **Home connection:** Send home the \"Lizard Fact Sheet\" (1 page) and ask families to find and sketch an animal near their home and describe one special body part. Students share in week 2.\n- **Assessment collection:** Save drawings, observation sheets, and exit ticket responses in each student's science portfolio to track understanding of adaptations across the year.",
