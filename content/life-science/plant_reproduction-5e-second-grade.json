Observe and describe the structures of seeds and identify their purpose in plant reproduction.\n2. Explain that plants make seeds so that new plants can grow in different places.\n3. Develop a simple model showing how seeds travel from one place to another (seed dispersal).\n4. Compare different types of seeds and discuss why seeds look different depending on how they travel.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about seeds and how plants make new plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of cut squash halves displayed on a screen, smartboard, or printed poster\n- Real squash (if available) or other large seeds (pumpkin, melon) in a bowl to pass around\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph prominently.** Show students the image of the cut squash with visible seeds and have them observe quietly for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Open with an engaging question:** \"What do you think this is, and where have you seen something like it before?\" Allow 2-3 students to share.\n\n3. **Ask discovery questions to build curiosity:**\n   - \"What are all these little things inside? Why do you think they're there?\"\n   - \"Do you think seeds are alive? What makes you think that?\"\n   - \"How do you think a seed gets to a new place to grow into a new plant?\"\n   - \"If I planted this seed in my garden, what would grow? How would a baby squash plant get started from something so tiny?\"\n\n4. **Prediction and wonder prompt:** \"Let's pretend you're a tiny seed. How would YOU travel to find a new home to grow? Could you roll? Blow in the wind? Stick to an animal's fur? Turn and talk with a partner about your ideas.\"\n\n5. **Record student ideas on chart paper** to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become seed detectives! We'll open up seeds, look closely at them, and discover how plants use seeds to make new plants in different places.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate seeds hands-on and discover structures and differences through observation and experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One whole squash or large pumpkin (pre-cut in half by teacher before class)\n- Small bowls (one per pair or small group)\n- Squash or pumpkin seeds (fresh, with pulp still attached)\n- Paper towels\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Observation sheets (simple picture diagram with labels: seed, pulp, cavity)\n- Real examples of other seeds: sunflower seeds, bean seeds, small pea pods, apple seeds (pre-arranged on a display table)\n- Ziplock bags (optional, for taking seeds home)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Seed extraction (teacher-led with student participation):**\n   - Display the cut squash halves from the photograph.\n   - Ask: \"How can we get the seeds out? What do we need to do?\"\n   - Demonstrate gently scooping seeds into a bowl, separating them from the pulp with hands or a spoon.\n   - Pass the bowl around so each student can feel the seeds and pulp texture.\n\n2. **Observation stations (students work in pairs or small groups):**\n   - **Station 1 - Squash/Pumpkin Seeds:** Students receive a small bowl with seeds and pulp. They use hand lenses to observe closely and sketch/label what they see on their observation sheet. Guiding questions: \"What shape are the seeds? What color? What does the pulp feel like? Why is the seed hard?\"\n   - **Station 2 - Seed Comparison:** Students observe 3-4 different seed types (sunflower, bean, apple seed, pea) arranged on a table with hand lenses. They complete a chart comparing size, shape, color, and texture.\n\n3. **Hands-on investigation activity:**\n   - Give each pair or group a selection of the different seeds (cleaned squash seeds, sunflower seeds, beans, etc.).\n   - Task: \"Predict which seeds are heavy and which are light. Now test your prediction by gently tossing each type of seed in the air or rolling them. Record what happens.\"\n   - This introduces the concept that different seeds travel differently.\n\n4. **Student recording:**\n   - Observation sheets with simple drawings and labels\n   - A comparison chart showing seed types and their properties\n   - Notes on \"How does this seed travel?\" for each type\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among stations asking open-ended questions: \"Tell me about that seed. What does it feel like? Why do you think it looks that way?\"\n- Do NOT provide answers; instead, guide observation: \"Look very closely with the hand lens. What else do you notice?\"\n- Help students articulate observations in simple language.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that squash seeds are hard, flat, oval-shaped, and have a protective outer layer.\n- Students notice that different seeds look different and may predict that these differences help seeds travel in different ways.\n- Students document observations through drawings and simple labels.\n- Students begin connecting seed structure to function (e.g., \"This seed is light and flat, so maybe it can blow in the wind\").\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration; connect findings to plant reproduction.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms and simple illustrations\n- Photograph of the squash (displayed again)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: picture book or short video clip (2-3 minutes) showing seeds growing into plants (e.g., a fast-forward time-lapse of a seed sprouting)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out and discussion:**\n   - Ask pairs/groups to share one thing they observed: \"What was the most interesting thing you discovered about seeds?\"\n   - Record observations on chart paper as a class \"Seed Discovery Chart.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do all these seeds look different? Let's think about that together.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions and simple illustrations:**\n\n   - **Seed:** A tiny plant waiting inside a protective coat that grows into a new plant when it has water, soil, and sunlight.\n   - **Dispersal (or dispersing):** The way seeds travel from one place to another to find a new home to grow.\n   - **Pulp:** The soft, wet part around seeds inside a fruit; it protects the seeds and sometimes helps them travel.\n   - **Germination:** When a seed wakes up and starts to grow roots and a tiny green shoot.\n   - **Reproduction:** When living things make babies or new versions of themselves; plants make new plants using seeds.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph and exploration:**\n   - Show the photograph again. \"This squash has MANY seeds inside. Why do you think a plant makes so many seeds? Does every seed need to grow into a plant?\"\n   - Discuss: \"If ALL the seeds grew near the mother plant, they would be crowded. They would fight for water and sunlight. So plants have ways to send their seeds far away. That's called dispersal.\"\n   - Ask: \"What are some ways these seeds could travel?\" (Refer back to student predictions from Engage phase and compare with what they observed.)\n\n4. **Mini-lesson: Seed Dispersal Methods**\n   - Use simple illustrations or quick demonstrations to show three main ways seeds travel:\n     - **Wind dispersal:** Light seeds with flat shapes (like squash seeds) or seeds with wings/fluff can blow away.\n     - **Animal dispersal:** Seeds with hooks or prickles stick to fur; animals eat fruit and drop seeds far away.\n     - **Water dispersal:** Seeds float or sink down rivers to new places.\n   - Place the observed seeds into these categories together as a class.\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"Why do you think seeds need to leave their mother plant?\" (Allow 2-3 responses.)\n   - Show a picture of a sunflower and ask: \"How might these seeds travel?\"\n   - Ask: \"Do all the seeds you looked at travel the same way? Why not?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Seed:** A tiny plant waiting inside a protective coat that grows into a new plant when it has water, soil, and sunlight.\n- **Dispersal:** The way seeds travel from one place to another to find a new home to grow.\n- **Pulp:** The soft, wet part around seeds inside a fruit that protects seeds.\n- **Germination:** When a seed wakes up and starts to grow.\n- **Reproduction:** When living things make babies or new versions of themselves.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain in simple terms that seeds help plants make new plants.\n- Students understand that seeds need to travel to new places to grow and that they travel in different ways.\n- Students can match seed types to dispersal methods (e.g., \"Light seeds blow in the wind\").\n- Students use new vocabulary in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by creating a model of seed dispersal and making connections to real-world examples.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Craft materials: construction paper, tape, cotton balls, small seeds, markers, pipe cleaners, or feathers\n- Squash seeds (cleaned and dried)\n- String or yarn\n- Shallow trays or baskets\n- Optional: access to a window with a breeze or an outdoor area\n- Paper bags or containers (for collecting real seeds from school grounds)\n\n**Activity: Create a Seed Dispersal Model**\n\n1. **Teacher introduces the challenge:** \"We're going to create a model that shows how ONE kind of seed travels. You can pick a seed we studied, and we'll build something that helps it move from one place to another, just like it does in nature.\"\n\n2. **Student choice of dispersal method to model:**\n   - **Wind travelers:** Students create \"spinning\" seeds by attaching paper wings or cotton fluff to a squash seed using tape and pipe cleaners. They test by dropping from a height and observing how it falls/spins.\n   - **Animal travelers:** Students design a \"sticky seed\" by adding small craft materials or velcro-like texture to a seed to show how it might stick to fur. They test by rolling it across a fuzzy surface (fake fur or felt).\n   - **Water travelers:** Students float seeds in shallow water trays, observing which seeds float and which sink. They discuss how water carries seeds.\n\n3. **Testing and observation:**\n   - Students test their models and record what happens: Does it spin? Does it stick? Does it float?\n   - Ask: \"Does your model work like the real seed? How is it the same? How is it different?\"\n\n4. **Seed hunt (optional, outdoor connection):**\n   - Take students on a brief \"seed safari\" around the school grounds or playground.\n   - Challenge: \"Find seeds on the ground, plants, or trees. Look for seeds that might blow away, seeds that stick to things, or seeds near water.\"\n   - Collect examples in paper bags to bring back to class.\n   - Discuss: \"Where did these seeds come from? How did they travel?\"\n\n5. **Gallery walk (optional):**\n   - Display student models around the classroom.\n   - Have students walk around and see how their classmates modeled different seed dispersal methods.\n   - Ask: \"Which method helps seeds travel farthest? Which is most interesting?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide open-ended challenges rather than step-by-step instructions.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"How could you make it spin more? What if you added something light to it?\"\n- Encourage testing and refinement: \"That didn't work the first time. What could you change?\"\n- Connect models back to the photograph and the real squash: \"Remember the seeds in the squash? How is your model like those seeds?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a working model that demonstrates one method of seed dispersal.\n- Students explain how their model represents a real seed traveling in nature.\n- Students identify that different seeds travel in different ways and understand why.\n- Students engage in hands-on problem-solving and testing.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of seed structures, plant reproduction, and seed dispersal methods.\n\n**Activity: Formative and Summative Assessment**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore phase:** Watch for students who can identify seed structures and make predictions about how seeds travel.\n- **Listen to group discussions during Explain phase:** Note students who use vocabulary correctly and understand the purpose of seeds.\n- **Circulate during Elaborate phase:** Observe students testing their models and ask clarifying questions to gauge understanding.\n- **Check-in questions:** Ask individuals: \"Why do seeds need to leave their plant? Show me a seed you think travels by wind.\"\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (end of Lesson 2)**\n\nProvide each student with a simple worksheet or have them respond orally:\n\n1. **Picture prompt:** Show a picture of a seed inside a fruit (or use the original squash photograph). Ask: \"What is this? What will happen to these seeds?\"\n\n2. **Matching exercise:** Show three pictures (a light, flat seed; a seed with hooks; a floating seed) and three travel methods (wind, animal fur, water). Have students draw lines to match or point.\n\n3. **Short-answer or verbal response:** \"Tell me one way a seed can travel to a new place. Why does it need to travel away from its mother plant?\"\n\n4. **Drawing prompt:** \"Draw a seed and show one way it might travel.\" (Students may draw and label or describe their drawing.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student can identify seeds in the photograph and name one way they might travel.\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student understands that seeds are made by plants and explains that seeds need to travel to grow in new places. Student can match at least two seed types to dispersal methods.\n\n✓ **Advanced:** Student explains the connection between seed structure (shape, weight, texture) and how it travels. Student predicts how an unfamiliar seed might disperse based on its characteristics.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that seeds are part of plant reproduction.\n- Students can explain at least one way seeds disperse to new locations.\n- Students show growing ability to match seed structures to their dispersal methods.\n- Students who struggled during Explore/Explain phases show progress through successful modeling in Elaborate phase.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce complexity during Explore:** Provide pre-sorted seed samples and simpler observation sheets with picture labels and checkboxes instead of open-ended drawing. Use fewer seed types for comparison (just squash vs. sunflower, for example).\n\n2. **Provide sentence stems during discussions:** Offer language frames such as:\n   - \"This seed is _____.\" (hard/soft, big/small, smooth/bumpy)\n   - \"I think this seed travels by _____.\" (wind/animal/water)\n   - \"Seeds need to travel so they can _____.\" (find water/sunlight/space)\n\n3. **Use real objects and repetition:** Allow students extra time to handle seeds, observe them multiple times, and use hand lenses. Pair with a peer buddy or assistant who can narrate observations.\n\n4. **Simplified models during Elaborate:** Offer pre-made seed models or provide more structured directions (e.g., \"Tape this cotton ball to this seed\"). Focus on testing and observing rather than creating from scratch.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research extension:** Ask advanced students to investigate additional seeds or plants. Provide picture books or simple websites to research how specific seeds disperse (milkweed, maple helicopters, coconuts, berries). Have them present findings to the class.\n\n2. **Deeper questioning:** Challenge students to think about why different plants evolved different dispersal methods. Ask: \"If all seeds just fell straight down, what would happen? Why do you think some seeds have wings and others stick to fur?\"\n\n3. **Complex modeling:** Ask advanced students to create a model that shows TWO ways a single seed might travel (e.g., a squash seed eaten by an animal, then pooped out and dispersed by water). Have them test both pathways.\n\n4. **Seed collection and classification:** Challenge students to go on an extended seed hunt, collect 5+ types of real seeds, and classify them by dispersal method. Have them create a labeled display or simple field guide.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grow it! Plant a seed:** Give each student a squash or bean seed to plant in a small cup with soil. Over several weeks, students observe and sketch the germination process (roots, sprout, first leaves). Connect back to the lesson: \"This came from the tiny seed we saw. It needed water, soil, and sunlight—just like we learned!\"\n\n2. **Seed art and sorting centers:** Create classroom stations where students sort seeds by color, size, or dispersal method using charts, graphs, or simple Venn diagrams. Students can create a \"Seed Diversity Poster\" showing all the different seeds they found or collected around school.\n\n3. **Read-aloud story connections:** Share picture books about seeds and plants (e.g., *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle, *A Seed Is Sleepy* by Dianna Hutts Aston, or *How a Seed Grows* by Helene J. Jordan). After reading, ask: \"What did the character seed do? How did it travel? How is it like the seeds we studied?\" This connects to standard 2-LS4-1 by exploring diverse plants in different habitats.\n\n4. **Dramatization: Be a seed!** Students act out being a seed traveling by different methods. One child is a seed, another is the wind, another is an animal. They move around the classroom showing how the seed travels. This kinesthetic activity deepens understanding of dispersal and engages different learning styles.",
