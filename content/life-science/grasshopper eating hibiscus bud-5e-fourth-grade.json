ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of grasshopper on hibiscus bud (or printed 8.5\" × 11\" copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: live grasshopper in a clear observation container (if available—grasshopper can be released after lesson)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently on the board or screen. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Open with wonder:** Say: *\"Look closely at this photograph. What do you notice the grasshopper is doing? What do you think it's thinking right now?\"*\n\n3. **Pose discovery questions** (ask these one at a time, allowing brief think-pair-share time):\n   - *\"What parts of the grasshopper's body can you see in the picture? How do you think each part is helping it?\"*\n   - *\"If you were a tiny grasshopper, how would you find something good to eat?\"*\n   - *\"What do you think the grasshopper's long antennae might be used for?\"*\n   - *\"Why do you think the grasshopper might have picked this red bud to eat instead of other parts of the plant?\"*\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** Invite students to write or draw a prediction: *\"What senses do you think the grasshopper is using right now to help it survive?\"* Display predictions on chart paper without judgment.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to explore how grasshoppers' body parts and senses work together to help them find food and survive—and we'll discover why plants matter so much to their survival.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Per student or pair:**\n  - One printout of the grasshopper photograph (or access to projected image)\n  - One printed diagram of a grasshopper with unlabeled external parts (antennae, legs, eyes, mouth, body segments)\n  - Colored pencils or markers\n  - Magnifying glass (optional but recommended)\n  - One \"Grasshopper Observation & Investigation Sheet\" (template provided below)\n  \n- **Teacher-led demo setup:**\n  - Live grasshopper in clear observation container (optional)\n  - Images of various plants (hibiscus, grass, leaves)\n  - Picture cards showing: antennae, compound eye, legs, mandibles\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and display as a visual sequence):**\n\n1. **Look carefully** at the grasshopper photograph. If you have a magnifying glass, use it to zoom in on the grasshopper's head and body.\n\n2. **On your Grasshopper Observation Sheet**, sketch or label the following parts of the grasshopper:\n   - Antennae (the long, thin feelers on its head)\n   - Eyes (compound eyes on the sides of its head)\n   - Legs (six legs on the underside—count them!)\n   - Mouth (the part eating the red bud)\n\n3. **For each body part you labeled**, write or draw one thing you think that part helps the grasshopper do. For example: \"The legs help the grasshopper...\" or \"The antennae help the grasshopper...\"\n\n4. **Study the red hibiscus bud.** Why might the grasshopper want to eat this instead of the green leaf or stem? Write your thinking in the box labeled \"Why This Food?\"\n\n5. **Draw an arrow** showing the path you think the grasshopper took to find this bud. What senses would it use first?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and listen to student reasoning without correcting.\n- Ask guiding questions only: *\"What do you think that part does? How might it help?\"* or *\"What would happen if the grasshopper didn't have antennae?\"*\n- Encourage students to **justify** their thinking with observations from the photo.\n- If students struggle to identify parts, point to the labeled diagram and ask them to find the same parts on the photograph.\n- Record student language and observations to share during Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students identify 3–4 external grasshopper parts.\n- Students connect at least 2 body parts to survival or food-finding behaviors.\n- Students recognize that the grasshopper is actively using its body to interact with the plant.\n- Students make observations about sensory awareness (eyes, antennae).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with grasshopper illustration\n- Markers (multiple colors)\n- Photograph displayed on screen\n- Pre-made vocabulary anchor chart (or create during this phase)\n- Optional: diagram showing grasshopper sensory system\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students** for group discussion. Display the grasshopper photograph again.\n\n2. **Invite sharing:** Ask 3–4 students to share one body part they identified and what they think it does. Record their ideas on chart paper in simple language.\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary formally** (point to each part on the photograph as you define):\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Antennae** (an-TEN-ee): Long, thin feelers on the grasshopper's head that detect smells and touches in the air. They help the grasshopper know what food is nearby. *(Analogy: Think of them like your nose, but even more powerful!)*\n   - **Compound Eyes:** Large, dark eyes on the sides of the grasshopper's head. They help the grasshopper see movement and color. *(Unlike humans, grasshoppers see in many directions at once.)*\n   - **Mandibles** (MAN-duh-bulz): The grasshopper's mouth parts. They are like tiny scissors that help the grasshopper bite off and chew food.\n   - **Legs:** The grasshopper has six strong legs that help it jump, climb, and hold onto plants where it eats.\n   - **Adaptation** (ad-ap-TAY-shun): A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment. *(Simple definition: Special tools that help animals stay alive.)*\n\n4. **Make connections back to photograph:** \n   - *\"In this picture, the grasshopper is using its antennae and eyes to find the bud. Its mouth is eating. Its legs are holding it on the stem. All of these body parts are working together!\"*\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show the photograph again. Ask: *\"Which body part is the grasshopper using RIGHT NOW to eat the bud?\"* (Mandibles)\n   - *\"What body part helped the grasshopper find this food?\"* (Antennae and eyes)\n   - *\"If a grasshopper didn't have strong legs, what problem might it have?\"* (Hard to climb, might fall, hard to escape predators)\n\n6. **Introduce the big idea:** \n   - *\"Plants and animals both have special body parts that help them survive. The grasshopper's mouth parts, antennae, and legs are its tools. They help it find food, eat, and escape danger. The plant provides food for the grasshopper. Both the plant and the grasshopper need each other!\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can name and locate 4–5 external grasshopper parts using correct vocabulary.\n- Students understand that each body part has a specific survival function.\n- Students see the grasshopper–plant relationship as interdependent.\n- Students can explain why adaptations matter for survival.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Per student or pair:**\n  - Index card or half-sheet of paper\n  - Colored pencils or markers\n  - Diagram showing grasshopper + plant interaction (template provided)\n  - Optional: live grasshopper in container (grasshoppers eat lettuce, grass, or hibiscus leaves in class)\n  \n- **For whole class:**\n  - Images of other insects (cricket, beetle, butterfly) and their external parts\n  - Chart paper labeled \"Senses in Action\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Grasshopper Needs Chart (Recommended for whole group)**\n\n1. Create a T-chart on the board or chart paper:\n   - **Left side:** \"What the Grasshopper Needs to Survive\"\n   - **Right side:** \"Which Body Part Helps?\"\n\n2. **Prompt:** *\"Let's think about all the things a grasshopper needs to do to stay alive. What does it need? What body part helps it do that?\"*\n\n3. Guide students to fill in the chart collaboratively:\n\n   | What the Grasshopper Needs | Which Body Part Helps? |\n   |---------------------------|----------------------|\n   | Find food | Antennae and eyes |\n   | Eat the food | Mandibles (mouth) |\n   | Stay on the plant | Legs and claws |\n   | Move away from danger | Strong legs for jumping |\n   | Know if danger is near | Antennae (feel vibrations), Eyes (see movement) |\n\n4. **Deepen thinking:** *\"What would happen if the grasshopper lost one of these body parts? Could it still survive?\"* Allow discussion.\n\n**Option B: Sense Detective Activity (For pairs or small groups)**\n\n1. Provide each pair with an image of the grasshopper and a card that says:\n   - *\"The grasshopper SEES something...\"*\n   - *\"The grasshopper FEELS something...\"*\n   - *\"The grasshopper SMELLS something...\"*\n\n2. Students draw or write what the grasshopper might sense using that sense, based on the photograph.\n\n3. Share out: *\"If the grasshopper SEES the red bud, what might it think? If it SMELLS the bud, what might it know?\"*\n\n**Option C: Adaptation Comparison (For more advanced learners)**\n\n1. Show images of 2–3 other insects (cricket, beetle, butterfly).\n\n2. *\"These animals also need to find food and survive. Look at their body parts. What do YOU notice? How are they the same as or different from the grasshopper?\"*\n\n3. Students record similarities and differences on a Venn diagram or comparison chart.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate discussion by asking: *\"How do these body parts work together?\"* and *\"Why is this body part important?\"*\n- Validate all observations; encourage evidence-based reasoning.\n- If students use words like \"helps\" or \"helps it survive,\" affirm that language.\n- Record key student insights to reinforce later.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students articulate connections between body parts and survival functions.\n- Students apply concepts to new situations (e.g., \"If the grasshopper couldn't see, it might eat the wrong plant part\").\n- Students begin to understand adaptation as a design feature for survival.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of structures, functions, and survival relationships.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist:** As students complete the Explore and Elaborate activities, note:\n  - Can they identify at least 3 grasshopper body parts?\n  - Can they connect each part to a survival or feeding function?\n  - Do they use sensory language (see, feel, smell)?\n  - Can they explain WHY adaptations matter?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (At the end of the lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with an **Exit Ticket** (printed or projected). Students can respond by drawing, writing, or speaking (accommodate for writers at different levels):\n\n---\n\n**GRASSHOPPER SURVIVAL EXIT TICKET**\n\n**Name: ___________________     Date: _______________**\n\n**Look at the photograph one more time. Then answer these questions:**\n\n1. **Which body part of the grasshopper is it using to EAT the bud?**\n   - (Draw it or write the name: ___________________________)\n\n2. **Why do you think the grasshopper has long antennae? How do antennae help it survive?**\n   - (One sentence or drawing: ___________________________)\n\n3. **Imagine a grasshopper without legs. What problem would it have?**\n   - (One sentence or drawing: ___________________________)\n\n4. **Why does the grasshopper need the plant? Why does the plant matter?**\n   - (One sentence or drawing: ___________________________)\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ Student identifies at least 1 grasshopper body part and its function (Q1–2).\n- ✓ Student explains how a missing body part would affect survival (Q3).\n- ✓ Student recognizes the grasshopper–plant relationship as necessary for survival (Q4).\n- ✓ Student uses evidence from the photograph or the lesson in their response.\n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n- **Objective 1 (Identify external structures and their functions):** Students correctly name and describe 3+ grasshopper parts. *(Exit Ticket Q1–2, Elaborate activities)*\n- **Objective 2 (Use senses to describe animal behavior):** Students explain how antennae and eyes help locate food. *(Exit Ticket Q2, Explore activity, group discussion)*\n- **Objective 3 (Explain specialized body parts):** Students articulate that different structures have different jobs. *(Exit Ticket Q3, Elaborate chart)*\n- **Objective 4 (Construct argument about plant–animal interdependence):** Students describe why the grasshopper needs the plant and why both matter. *(Exit Ticket Q4, group discussion)*\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary anchor:** Provide a visual reference card with pictures and one-word labels (antennae, eyes, legs, mouth). Students can point to or circle these instead of writing or drawing.\n\n2. **Sentence frames for Explore & Exit Ticket:** Provide sentence starters:\n   - *\"The antennae help the grasshopper ____________.\"*\n   - *\"The legs help the grasshopper ____________.\"*\n   - *\"Without legs, the grasshopper couldn't ____________.\"*\n\n3. **Peer pairing:** Pair with a student who can scribe or discuss ideas aloud before recording.\n\n4. **Focus on fewer body parts:** Ask these students to focus on only 2–3 parts (antennae, legs, mouth) rather than all five.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-sensory prediction:** *\"A grasshopper also has body parts inside (organs, a brain, a digestive system). Based on what you see, predict: What do you think happens to the food AFTER the grasshopper chews it? Where does it go?\"* Have them sketch a simple path.\n\n2. **Adaptation in other insects:** Provide images of a cricket, locust, dragonfly, and butterfly. Ask: *\"These insects all need to find food, but their body parts look different. Why might nature have designed them differently? What do you predict each one eats?\"*\n\n3. **Cause-and-effect chain:** Have them create a flow chart:\n   - Grasshopper SEES red bud → Grasshopper moves TOWARD it (using legs) → Grasshopper SMELLS it (using antennae) → Grasshopper EATS it (using mandibles) → Grasshopper survives and grows.\n\n4. **Research extension:** *\"Find out one more thing about how grasshoppers see or communicate. What do you discover?\"* (e.g., compound eyes, sound-making with legs, jumping distance).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Live Observation Center (Optional but powerful):**\n   - Keep a live grasshopper in a clear plastic container with grass or lettuce in the classroom (for a few days or one week, then release).\n   - Students observe the grasshopper's behaviors throughout the day: How does it move? What does it eat? How does it interact with plants?\n   - Create a class observation log. This reinforces that grasshoppers are real animals with behaviors we can study.\n   - **Safety note:** Ensure container has air holes, is not in direct sun, and that students know to observe gently (no squishing or rough handling).\n\n2. **Adaptation Illustration Project:**\n   - Provide each student or pair with a large outline of a grasshopper on poster board.\n   - Students color, label, and decorate their grasshopper, adding arrows and labels that explain what each body part does.\n   - Example annotations: *\"Strong legs for jumping away from predators,\" \"Antennae to smell food from far away,\"* etc.\n   - Display as a hallway gallery with a title: *\"How Grasshoppers Survive: External Structures That Help.\"*\n\n3. **Grasshopper & Plant Food Web:**\n   - Expand the ecosystem perspective by creating a simple food web showing:\n     - **Plant → Grasshopper → Bird (or other predator) → (Optional: Larger predator)*\n   - Discuss: *\"If all the plants disappeared, what would happen to the grasshopper? If grasshoppers disappeared, what would happen to birds?\"*\n   - This bridges to Ecosystem concepts and can tie to later units on food chains (2nd half of 4th grade or 5th grade standard 5-LS2-1).\n\n---\n\n## Grasshopper Observation & Investigation Sheet Template\n\n*(Print one per student or pair)*\n\n---\n\n**GRASSHOPPER OBSERVATION & INVESTIGATION**\n\n**Name: ___________________     Date: _______________**\n\n**Part 1: Labeling**\n\nIn the box below, draw the grasshopper or paste a photo. Label and color these parts:\n- Antennae\n- Eyes\n- Legs (circle all 6)\n- Mouth\n\n[**SPACE FOR DRAWING OR PHOTO**]\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: What Does Each Part Do?**\n\n| Body Part | What I Think It Does |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| Antennae | |\n| Eyes | |\n| Legs | |\n| Mouth | |\n\n---\n\n**Part 3: Why This Food?**\n\n*The grasshopper is eating a red hibiscus bud. Why might it choose this over a green leaf?*\n\n**My thinking:**\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\n---\n\n**Part 4: The Path**\n\n*Draw an arrow showing how you think the grasshopper found this bud. Label what senses it used:*\n- **First, it might SMELL the bud using its _______________**\n- **Then, it might SEE the bud using its _______________**\n- **Finally, it used its _______________ to eat it**\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Summary\n\n| NGSS Standard | How This Lesson Addresses It |\n|---------------|------------------------------|\n| **4-LS1-1** (external structures support survival) | Students identify grasshopper adaptations (antennae, mandibles, legs) and explain how each supports finding food, eating, moving, and escaping danger. The photograph and Explore activity directly show a structure in use. |\n| **4-LS1-2** (animals use senses to process info & respond) | Students investigate how the grasshopper uses its eyes and antennae to locate food (input), process the location (brain decision), and respond (movement to eat). The Exit Ticket explicitly asks students to explain how senses help the grasshopper survive. |\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Safety reminder:** If using a live grasshopper, brief students on gentleness and supervise closely.\n- **Timing:** This lesson is flexible. You can do Engage + Explore on Day 1 and Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2, or condense into a single 90-minute block.\n- **Accessibility:** Provide magnifying glasses for students with vision needs. Offer sentence frames for writers at different levels. Allow verbal responses or drawings if writing is a barrier.\n- **Connection to standards:** This lesson deeply scaffolds students toward understanding adaptation and ecosystem relationships, which are tested in 4th and 5th grade.\n- **Photo quality:** Print the photograph in color if possible. The red bud and green grasshopper are key visual details.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is ready to teach. Print the Exit Ticket and Observation Sheet, gather your materials, and enjoy the wonder of learning how body parts save lives!**",
