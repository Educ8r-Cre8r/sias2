ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about how animals hide in nature and activate prior knowledge about animal survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital projection of the deer photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks or paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen without giving away what it shows. Ask students to look carefully for one minute in silence.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice in this picture? What do you see first?\"\n   - \"Is there an animal hiding here? Can you find it?\" (Give students time to search; the deer is visible in the lower right.)\n   - \"Why do you think this animal's color looks similar to the grass and trees around it?\"\n   - \"What might happen to this animal if its fur were bright red or blue instead of brown?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... if this animal's color wasn't brown like the dried grass, would it be safe out here? Why or why not?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper. Accept all ideas without judgment.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to discover how animals use their bodies to hide and stay safe. Let's explore this together!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate camouflage through hands-on discovery and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed images of 5–6 different animals in their natural habitats (lion in savanna, white rabbit in snow, green frog on lily pad, striped fish in coral, spotted leopard in dappled forest)\n- Large sheets of white, tan, and green paper or card stock\n- Small toy animals or hand-drawn animal cutouts (pre-made by teacher in various colors)\n- Crayons, colored pencils, markers\n- Student observation sheets (see below)\n- Clipboards\n- Real items from outdoors (if available): sticks, dried leaves, grass, twigs in a small container\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Animal Habitat Matching (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Display one habitat image at a time (just the background: grass, snow, forest, water, etc.—without the animal visible yet).\n\n2. **Student task:** Each student receives 3–4 small toy animals or colored animal cutouts. They place the animals on the habitat image (or draw them on a paper replica) where they think the animal would be \"hardest to see.\"\n\n3. **Reveal the actual animal** and compare. Discuss why that animal's color helps it survive in that specific place.\n\n4. Students record on their observation sheet: \"What colors help this animal hide?\" and \"What does this animal's habitat look like?\"\n\n**Part 2: Create-a-Camouflaged-Creature (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. Provide each student with:\n   - One colored sheet of paper (white, tan, or green)\n   - A pre-drawn animal outline or the option to draw a simple animal shape\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Your sheet of paper is your animal's habitat (white = snow, tan = desert sand, green = forest).\n   - Look at the real items in the center of the table (sticks, leaves, grass).\n   - Design your animal to match this habitat as much as possible. You can:\n     - Color it to match the background\n     - Add patterns (spots, stripes, speckles) that match the environment\n     - Add textures by gluing small pieces of the real materials to your animal drawing\n   - The goal: Make your animal as hard to see as possible!\"\n\n3. **What students record:** Observation sheet prompts:\n   - \"What color did you make your animal? Why?\"\n   - \"What patterns or textures did you add?\"\n   - \"Will this animal be easy or hard to find in its habitat? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What colors do you see in this habitat?\" \"How could you make your animal blend in even more?\"\n- Avoid telling students what to do; instead, redirect them to observe the habitat carefully.\n- Note students who understand the concept quickly (for challenge activities later).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create animals that show intentional color/pattern matching to the habitat.\n- Observation sheets will show reasoning about how external structures (color, patterns) relate to survival.\n- Students will articulate why matching colors matter (\"So the predator won't see it\").\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to camouflage as an adaptation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The original deer photograph (enlarged)\n- Vocabulary posters or word cards (see Vocabulary section)\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gallery walk (5 minutes):** Display all student camouflaged creatures around the room. Have students do a quick walk and notice patterns: \"What colors did most students use for the forest habitat? For the snow?\"\n\n2. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** \n   - Ask 3–4 volunteers: \"Tell us about your animal. What habitat did you create it for? What color did you pick and why?\"\n   - Affirm observations: \"Yes! You noticed that brown matches the dried grass, just like in our deer photo.\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary (5 minutes):** Display and explain these terms using the deer photo and student work as examples:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment. (Example: \"The deer's brown fur is an adaptation that helps it hide.\")\n- **Camouflage:** When an animal's color, pattern, or texture helps it blend in with its surroundings so it's hard to see. (Example: \"The deer's brown fur provides camouflage in the dried grass.\")\n- **External structures:** Body parts on the outside of an animal that help it survive. (Example: \"Fur, skin color, and body shape are external structures.\")\n- **Habitat:** The specific place where an animal lives, including the plants, weather, and other animals there. (Example: \"The woodland with dried grass is the deer's habitat.\")\n- **Predator:** An animal that hunts other animals for food. (Example: \"Wolves are predators that hunt deer.\")\n\n4. **Make connections back to the photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at the deer again. Its brown fur is an **external structure** that acts as **camouflage**. This **adaptation** helps it survive in its **habitat** because it's harder for **predators** to see it.\"\n   - Point out that some of the trees are still green, but the deer blends in with the dried grass, not the green—showing that camouflage works best when it matches the specific habitat.\n\n5. **Check for understanding:** Ask students to turn and talk to a partner: \"How does the deer's color help it survive?\" Listen in; reteach if needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that camouflage is an external structure/adaptation.\n- Students can use the word \"habitat\" correctly in context.\n- Students recognize that the deer's brown color is not random—it matches its environment on purpose.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply camouflage concepts to new contexts and deepen understanding of how animals sense danger and respond.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Predator Detective\" scenario cards (teacher-prepared; see below)\n- Images of animals in different seasons or environments (deer in winter vs. summer, Arctic hare in snow vs. on grass, etc.)\n- Student response sheets\n- Optional: short video clip (1–2 minutes) showing a predator hunting an animal using camouflage (e.g., lion hunting gazelle—search \"BBC Life camouflage\" for age-appropriate clips)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Seasonal Camouflage Change (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Show students images of the same animal in two different seasons or environments:\n   - Deer: reddish-brown in summer vs. darker brown in winter\n   - Arctic hare: brown in summer vs. white in winter\n   - Frog: green on lily pads vs. brown on logs\n\n2. **Student task:** \n   - \"This is the same animal in two different habitats/seasons. Why do you think its color is different?\"\n   - Record on worksheet: \"Which color helps the animal survive better in winter? Why?\"\n   - Discuss: Does the animal's body structure change, or just its perception of how well it blends in? (Guide toward: the fur color changes, but the animal's external structure—fur—helps it adapt to seasons.)\n\n**Option B: Predator Detective Scenario (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Provide scenario cards with situations like:\n   - \"A fox is hunting. It sees a white rabbit on brown dirt. Can the fox see the rabbit easily? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"A bird is looking for a green caterpillar on green leaves. Will the bird find it? Why?\"\n   - \"A hunter sees a brown deer in front of brown trees. Is the deer safe? Why or why not?\"\n\n2. **Student task:** \n   - Work in pairs; read each scenario.\n   - Draw a picture showing the predator and the prey, labeling whether the prey is well-camouflaged or not.\n   - Explain: \"How does the prey's color help or hurt its survival?\"\n\n3. **Connection to senses and response:** \n   - \"The predator uses its **sense of sight** to find the prey. If the prey is well-camouflaged, the predator's **brain** has trouble finding it. So the prey has a better chance to **respond** by running away and surviving.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate pair discussions by asking: \"Can the predator see the prey clearly? How do you know?\"\n- If students struggle, ask: \"Is this color the same as the background? What might happen next?\"\n- Affirm connections to 4-LS1-2 (senses → brain → response).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that camouflage works differently in different environments and seasons.\n- Students articulate the sequence: predator sees (sense) → brain processes → predator looks for prey (response) → camouflage prevents predator from seeing prey.\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding that camouflage is both a body structure AND an environmental relationship.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of adaptations, camouflage, and how external structures support survival.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation sheet responses during Explore phase\n- Turn-and-talk listening checks during Explain phase\n- Predator Detective scenario accuracy during Elaborate phase\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) – Choose One Option:**\n\n**Option A: Illustrated Response (works well for mixed writers)**\n- Provide a habitat image (forest, snowy field, or sandy beach).\n- Prompt: \"Draw an animal in this habitat that is well-camouflaged. Label its external structures (fur color, patterns, body shape) and explain how they help it survive.\"\n- Success criteria: Student draws animal that matches habitat colors; labels at least 2 external structures; explains survival connection.\n\n**Option B: Written Response (for stronger writers)**\n- Prompt: \"The photo shows a deer hiding in dried grass. Explain how the deer's external structures (body color, fur) help it survive in this habitat. Use the word 'camouflage' in your answer.\"\n- Success criteria:\n  - Identifies at least one external structure (color, fur)\n  - Explains how this structure helps the deer survive (predators can't see it)\n  - Uses vocabulary correctly (camouflage, habitat, adaptation, or external structure)\n\n**Option C: Think-Pair-Share (for emergent learners or mixed-ability groups)**\n- Prompt (teacher reads aloud): \"If a deer's fur turned bright yellow, would it be safer or in more danger in this habitat? Why?\"\n- Students think (30 seconds), pair-share, then volunteer shares aloud.\n- Success criteria: Student gives a reason; mentions that color would make the deer easy to see.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies camouflage or a related external structure\n- ✓ Student explains connection to survival (\"harder to see,\" \"predators won't find it\")\n- ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary term correctly\n- ✓ Student demonstrates understanding that external structures support survival\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify camouflage as a survival adaptation.\n- 75% of students will explain how the deer's color helps it hide.\n- 70% of students will use vocabulary (camouflage, external structure, habitat, adaptation) correctly in context.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (Scaffolding for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards:** Provide picture-text cards for vocabulary words. Show the deer photo with color-coded labels: \"BROWN FUR = CAMOUFLAGE.\"\n\n2. **Partner-based Explore activity:** Pair students with stronger readers/writers during Explore. Provide a sentence frame for observation sheets: \"This animal is _____ colored so it can hide in the _____.\"\n\n3. **Provide pre-drawn animal shapes:** During the Create-a-Camouflaged-Creature activity, offer pre-drawn animal outlines instead of requiring students to draw. This reduces cognitive load and keeps focus on camouflage concept.\n\n4. **One-step Elaborate scenarios:** Simplify Predator Detective cards to yes/no questions with visual aids: \"Can the predator see the camouflaged animal? YES or NO? Why?\"\n\n#### Challenge (Extensions for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Seasonal adaptation investigation:** Ask advanced students: \"Why do some animals change color with the seasons while others don't? Research one animal that changes color. What is its habitat like?\" Students can create a presentation or poster showing seasonal camouflage changes.\n\n2. **Mimicry vs. camouflage:** Introduce the concept of mimicry—when an animal looks like something dangerous (e.g., butterfly wing spots look like owl eyes) to scare away predators. \"How is this different from camouflage? Which is a better survival strategy and why?\"\n\n3. **Food chain design:** Challenge students to design a complete food chain in a specific habitat. \"Draw a producer (plant), a prey animal (with camouflage), and a predator. Label how the camouflage affects who eats whom.\"\n\n4. **Evaluate camouflage effectiveness:** Provide photos of animals with poor camouflage in mismatched habitats. \"Is this animal's camouflage good for this habitat? Why or why not? What habitat WOULD it be camouflaged in?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Find the Animal\" outdoor hunt:**\n   - Hide stuffed animals or printed animal images around the classroom or playground, some well-camouflaged and some obvious.\n   - Students hunt for them and record: \"I found a _____ hiding in _____. Was it well-camouflaged? Why or why not?\"\n   - Debrief: Why were some easier to find? (Discussion: camouflage effectiveness.)\n\n2. **Camouflage in the classroom:**\n   - Bring in a variety of small objects (erasers, pencils, buttons, paper clips) in different colors.\n   - Place them on different colored papers (e.g., red button on white paper, white eraser on white paper).\n   - Students place objects where they are hardest to see and create a \"camouflage challenge\" poster for other classes.\n\n3. **Design a time-traveling deer:**\n   - Provide images of the same habitat in different time periods (e.g., forest in autumn, winter, spring, summer).\n   - \"Design what the deer might look like in each season. How would its camouflage need to change to survive?\"\n   - Create a four-panel illustration with color descriptions for each season.\n\n4. **Camouflage craft: Paper-bag animal mask or puppet**\n   - Students create a camouflaged animal mask or puppet (brown paper bag colored and textured to match a habitat they choose).\n   - Use for a retelling activity: \"My animal is hiding in a _____ because its color is _____.\"\n\n5. **Parent letter + homework:** Send home a letter asking families to find photos of camouflaged animals in nature and bring them in. Create a class \"Camouflage Gallery.\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Photograph discussion:** The deer's camouflage is most obvious when the photo is shown at a distance or when students search for it—use this to create genuine discovery rather than immediately pointing it out.\n- **Vocabulary reinforcement:** Create a word wall with camouflage vocabulary. Reference it daily and have students use terms in complete sentences.\n- **Real-world connection:** If possible, take students on a nature walk and ask them to find animals or describe where animals might hide based on camouflage. (Even a walk around the schoolyard works!)\n- **Cross-curricular link:** This lesson pairs well with art (color mixing, texture, observation drawing) and language arts (writing animal descriptions, creating camouflage riddles).\n- **NGSS alignment note:** This lesson emphasizes 4-LS1-1 (external structures supporting survival) primarily. The senses/response component (4-LS1-2) is woven in during Elaborate and Evaluate to show how animals detect danger and respond—though a deeper 4-LS1-2 lesson could focus more on sensory systems.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is ready to teach.
