The vine has long, smooth pods hanging down and big heart-shaped leaves. You can see the vine is climbing up and over the fence, reaching toward the sun and sky.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why do plants grow upward and wrap around things?\n\nPlants are living things that grow toward light and sometimes climb on structures for support. This vine is demonstrating **phototropism**—the plant's natural tendency to grow toward sunlight. Additionally, the vine exhibits **thigmotropism** (growth in response to touch), as the tendrils and stems wind around the fence for structural support. The plant's growth is driven by a combination of seeking light energy for photosynthesis and finding stable support to reach higher toward sunlight sources.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Plants are living things that grow** – This vine is alive and growing larger over time. It needs sunlight, water, and soil nutrients to survive and develop.\n\n2. **Plants grow toward light** – The vines reach upward and sprawl across the fence because they are seeking sunlight. This helps them make food through photosynthesis.\n\n3. **Plants use structures to climb and adapt** – Vines have tendrils and flexible stems that wrap around supports (like fences). This helps them grow tall without having thick, woody stems like trees.\n\n4. **Living things change their environment** – As the vine grows, it covers the fence and creates shade. It also provides shelter and food for small animals and insects.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFor Kindergarteners, avoid the technical terms \"phototropism\" and \"thigmotropism\" in direct instruction. Instead, use concrete language: \"Plants reach toward the sun\" and \"Plants hold onto things to help them grow tall.\" Use hand motions to show vines wrapping and reaching—kinesthetic learning is powerful at this age.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Accessibility:** Provide multiple means of engagement by offering tactile exploration (feel real vines or rope), visual observation (photos and the actual plant), and verbal description. Students with visual impairments can feel textured leaves and stems. English Language Learners benefit from picture cards showing vine growth stages paired with simple captions.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**  \nK-LS1-1: Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-LS1.A]] – All organisms have basic needs such as water, materials to make structures, and energy\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-ESS2.E]] – Plants depend on water and light to grow\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-LS1.C]] – Many characteristics of an organism are inherited from parents, and some are learned or influenced by the environment\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] – Observe that plants grow in predictable patterns toward light and upward\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] – The vine's flexible stem and tendrils help it climb and grow\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think this vine needs to stay alive and healthy?** (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why do you think the vine is growing upward on the fence instead of staying on the ground?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If we moved this fence to a shady spot with no sun, what do you predict would happen to the vine over time?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **How do you think the vine helps other living things, like bugs or birds?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Vine:** A plant with a long, thin stem that grows along the ground or climbs up things like fences or trees.\n\n* **Leaf (leaves):** The green parts of a plant that catch sunlight and help the plant make food.\n\n* **Grow:** To become bigger and taller over time; what living things do when they get food, water, and sunlight.\n\n* **Sunlight:** Bright light and warmth that comes from the sun; plants need it to live and make food.\n\n* **Tendril:** A thin, curly part of a vine that wraps around things to help the plant climb.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Observe a Climbing Plant (Hands-On Exploration)**  \n   Bring a potted vine or climbing plant into the classroom (such as a *Pothos* or *Philodendron*). Have students observe its leaves, count how many tendrils they can see, and gently feel the texture. Over 2-3 weeks, let students draw pictures of the plant weekly to track how it grows. Tape it next to a sunny window and watch where it reaches.\n\n2. **Build a Vine Climbing Path (Engineering Activity)**  \n   Provide students with string, yarn, or pipe cleaners. Set up a \"fence\" using a small cardboard box or wooden frame. Have students wrap and weave their string around the structure to mimic how vines climb. Ask, \"What helps your vine stay attached?\" This builds understanding of plant structures while practicing fine motor skills.\n\n3. **Read and Dramatize Plant Growth (Language + Science Integration)**  \n   Read a simple plant growth book aloud, then have students act out being seeds, sprouting, growing leaves, and reaching toward the sun. Use scarves or ribbons as \"vines\" that students can twirl and wrap around each other, dramatizing how vines climb. This combines movement, imagination, and science learning.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle – A wonderful story about a seed's journey and growth toward the sun\n- *From Seed to Plant* by Gail Gibbons – Simple, illustrated non-fiction about how plants grow\n- *What Do Roots Do?* by Kathleen V.
