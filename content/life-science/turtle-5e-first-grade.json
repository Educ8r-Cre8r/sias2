Identify the shell as an external body part that protects a turtle.\n2. Describe how a turtle's shell helps it survive and stay safe.\n3. Explain that young turtles have shells similar to their parent turtles, but smaller.\n4. Design a simple protective covering using materials, mimicking how a turtle's shell works.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the turtle (enlarge or display on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pointer or laser pointer (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** in a way all students can see clearly. Keep it covered or hidden for 10 seconds, then reveal it suddenly to spark interest.\n\n2. **Ask these questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe what the animal looks like?\"\n   - \"Look at the hard, bumpy thing on the turtle's back. What do you think that is, and why do you think the turtle has it?\"\n   - \"If something tried to hurt the turtle, how do you think that bumpy thing would help keep the turtle safe?\"\n   - \"Where does the turtle live? What do you see around it?\" (Guide them to notice plants, soil, shadows/shelter.)\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder... do you think the turtle's shell is soft or hard? Why do you think so?\" Write student predictions on chart paper. Celebrate curiosity.\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Turtles have special body parts that help them stay safe and live in nature. Today, we're going to be turtle scientists and discover why shells are so important!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small plastic eggs or hollow plastic containers (1 per student or pair)\n- Uncooked eggs (1-2 for demonstration only)\n- Soft materials: cotton balls, foam pieces, fabric scraps, crumpled paper\n- Hard materials: construction paper, cardboard pieces, plastic shells (if available), aluminum foil\n- Tape, glue sticks, scissors (safety scissors)\n- Large table or floor space\n- Washable markers for labeling\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Soft vs. Hard Protection (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show students two uncooked eggs** (or use plastic egg comparison).\n   - \"These eggs are fragile—they break easily. Imagine this is a baby turtle with NO shell yet. What could protect it?\"\n\n2. **Divide students into pairs.** Give each pair:\n   - One plastic egg (representing a turtle without a shell)\n   - A collection of soft materials (cotton, foam, fabric)\n   - A collection of hard materials (cardboard, plastic, foil)\n\n3. **Direct the task:**\n   - \"You're going to build a protection home for your egg-turtle! You can use the soft things OR the hard things—or both!\"\n   - \"Wrap and cover your egg with materials. Make it as protected as you can.\"\n   - Students work for 5-7 minutes, taping and securing materials.\n\n**Part B: Testing (5-7 minutes)**\n\n4. **Gently drop test:** On a soft mat or carpet:\n   - \"Now, let's see which materials protected the egg best! I'm going to gently drop each egg from my hand to the floor. The egg that doesn't crack is the winner!\"\n   - Carefully drop each wrapped egg and observe results.\n\n5. **Record observations:**\n   - Ask: \"Which material worked better—soft or hard? Why?\" \n   - Write responses on chart paper: \"Hard materials like _____ protected the egg better because _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions without giving answers: *\"Why did you choose that material? What do you think will happen when we drop it?\"*\n- Encourage all attempts; emphasize that this is like a turtle's shell protecting its body.\n- Support students who need help taping or wrapping materials.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that hard/rigid materials provide better protection than soft ones.\n- They will make the connection: \"The turtle's shell is hard and protects the turtle inside, just like our hard materials protected the egg.\"\n- Students will record observations and begin to understand shell function.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage and Explore phases\n- Printed photograph of turtle (displayed)\n- Large diagram or simple illustration of a turtle with labels\n- Picture books (optional): *Shelly the Turtle* (Christy Mihaly) or *The Turtle and the Bumblebee* (selected pages)\n- Whiteboard or large paper for vocabulary anchor chart\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 student pairs to briefly share their experience: *\"What did you wrap your egg in? Did it protect your egg? How?\"*\n   - Listen for language about hard, soft, protection, safe.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (5 minutes):**\n   - Create an anchor chart with these four key terms:\n   \n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Shell** | A hard, bony covering that grows on a turtle's back and belly. It is part of the turtle's body. |\n| **Protect** | To keep someone or something safe from harm or danger. |\n| **External part** | A body part you can see on the outside of an animal (like eyes, legs, shell). |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives that has food, water, and shelter. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the turtle in the photo with a pointer.\n   - \"Look! This is a real turtle. See its hard shell? It's just like the hard materials you used. The shell grows with the turtle and protects it from danger—bugs, bigger animals, and bumps!\"\n   - \"The turtle lives in a habitat with plants and soil. Its shell helps it survive in this home.\"\n   - Point out: \"This turtle has four legs, a head, and a shell. The shell is an **external part** that **protects** it.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2-3 minutes):**\n   - \"Show me with your hands—is the shell hard or soft?\" (Students make hard, tight fists.)\n   - \"What does the shell do? It _____ the turtle!\" (Students say \"protects\".)\n   - \"If a turtle needs to stay safe, what body part helps it?\" (Students point to their \"shell\" area and say \"shell\".)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and identify a turtle's shell.\n- They understand that the shell is hard and protects the turtle.\n- They can use the word \"protect\" in context.\n- They recognize the shell as an external body part.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture books showing young turtles and adult turtles (e.g., from National Geographic Kids, Scholastic, or teacher-provided images)\n- Paper plates (small and large)\n- Markers, crayons, colored pencils\n- Magazines for cutting (optional)\n- Glue sticks, scissors\n- Chart paper labeled \"Baby Turtles vs. Adult Turtles\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Real-World Application: Baby and Adult Turtles (15-20 minutes)**\n\n1. **Read aloud or show pictures (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Share 2-3 pages from a picture book showing baby turtles and adult turtles.\n   - Examples: *National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Animals* (turtle section) or custom images.\n   - Ask: \"What do you notice? Are the baby turtles the same size as the adult turtles?\"\n\n2. **Guided discussion (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Baby turtles are TINY and have shells too!\"\n   - \"The baby turtle's shell is small, but it works the same way—it protects the baby just like the big turtle's shell protects the big turtle.\"\n   - \"As the baby turtle grows, its shell grows with it. Parent turtles have big shells; baby turtles have small shells.\"\n\n3. **Hands-on application—\"Grow a Turtle Shell\" (8-10 minutes):**\n\n   **Student Task:**\n   - Give each student one small paper plate (representing a baby turtle) and one large paper plate (representing an adult turtle).\n   - Students draw a turtle body on the small plate and color/decorate the \"small shell\" with markers.\n   - Then, they draw the same turtle on the large plate and color/decorate the \"big shell.\"\n   - Optional: Students can label or dictate: \"This is my baby turtle. This is my baby turtle when it grows up. Its shell got bigger!\"\n\n4. **Gallery walk (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Post all student turtle plates around the room.\n   - Quick walk to observe how shells \"grow\" with turtles.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the read-aloud with expression and pause for predictions.\n- Circulate during drawing and offer encouragement and prompts: *\"Tell me about your baby turtle's shell. What will happen to it as it grows?\"*\n- Help students make the connection: \"Just like your baby turtle's shell grows, your shell grew too when you were little!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will understand that young turtles and adult turtles are similar (both have shells) but not exactly alike (different sizes).\n- Students will recognize that shells grow with the turtle.\n- Students will apply the concept of growth and adaptation to their own understanding of life cycles.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of turtle body parts, shell function, and young vs. adult turtles.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Do students test their wrappings? Do they discuss which materials work better?\n- Questioning during Explain phase: Can students point to and name the shell? Do they understand it protects the turtle?\n- Participation in Elaborate phase: Can students describe how a baby turtle's shell relates to an adult turtle's shell?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes):**\n\nChoose ONE or use both:\n\n**Option 1: Draw and Label (Non-verbal for early readers)**\n- Give each student a half-page with a simple outline of a turtle.\n- Ask: \"Draw a circle around the turtle's shell. The shell keeps the turtle ______.\" (Provide word bank: safe, happy, warm, protected)\n- Students circle \"protected\" or point to it. Record responses.\n\n**Option 2: Verbal Assessment (One-on-one or small group)**\n- Ask each student 2-3 questions:\n  1. \"Show me the shell on this turtle picture. What does the shell do?\"\n  2. \"Are a baby turtle and a grown-up turtle exactly the same? What is different?\"\n  3. \"If you needed protection, what could you build that works like a turtle's shell?\"\n- Record student responses to track understanding.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify the shell on a turtle.\n- ✓ Student can explain that the shell protects the turtle (uses word \"protect\" or shows understanding through gesture/pointing).\n- ✓ Student recognizes that baby and adult turtles have similar shells but different sizes.\n- ✓ Student can give an example of a protective covering (hard hat, blanket, coat) inspired by a shell.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can identify a turtle's shell and state one way it helps the turtle.\n- 70%+ of students can compare baby and adult turtles.\n- 75%+ of students can articulate or demonstrate that the shell's purpose is protection.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visual supports:**\n   - Use real turtle pictures with large, bold labels (\"SHELL,\" \"LEGS,\" \"HEAD\").\n   - Create a personal vocabulary card set with images and one-word labels that students can carry or reference.\n   - Pair with a peer buddy during Explore to provide language modeling.\n\n2. **Reduce task complexity in Explore:**\n   - Pre-wrap one egg partially so the student only needs to add materials.\n   - Offer only 3 material choices instead of 5+ to reduce decision fatigue.\n   - Provide tactile support: Let students feel hard vs. soft materials before wrapping and explicitly name them (\"This is HARD; this is SOFT\").\n\n3. **Check-in questions tailored to individual level:**\n   - \"Is this hard or soft?\" (Point to shell)\n   - \"Does the shell keep the turtle safe?\" (Yes/No question)\n   - \"Can you touch your shell?\" (Gesture to back/shoulders to relate to own body)\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extend the comparison to other animals:**\n   - \"Other animals have protection too. Crabs have shells. Armadillos have hard armor. Can you find a picture of another animal with a hard shell or covering?\"\n   - Students research and draw 2-3 animals with protective shells/coverings and create a comparison chart.\n\n2. **Design a \"superpower\" protective structure:**\n   - \"You're an inventor! Design a backpack or helmet inspired by a turtle's shell that could protect a toy from dropping. What materials would you use? Why?\"\n   - Students sketch or build with blocks/boxes and explain their design choices.\n\n3. **Investigate shell growth with measurement:**\n   - Provide paper plates in multiple sizes (extra small, small, medium, large).\n   - \"Arrange these in order from baby turtle to great-grandpa turtle. Measure them with hand spans or string. How much bigger does the shell grow?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Turtle Habitat Diorama:**\n   - Provide a small shoebox or paper cup habitat.\n   - Students create a turtle's home using soil, leaves, small plants, and a shelter (rock, log).\n   - Place a toy or drawn turtle inside.\n   - Display with labels: \"A turtle's habitat has ____, ____, and ____.\"\n   - Connects to 1-LS1-1 by exploring how habitats provide what animals need.\n\n2. **Read-Aloud: Turtle Books Series**\n   - Follow up with picture books over the next week: *Shelly* (Christine McDonnell), *The Turtle* (Kate Banks), or *Turtle and Hare* picture adaptations.\n   - After each read, ask: \"How did the turtle's shell help it?\" Extend discussions about survival and adaptation.\n\n3. **Outdoor Investigation Walk:**\n   - Take students outside to search for small creatures in their habitats (under logs, in grass, near water if available).\n   - Observe: insects, worms, slugs.\n   - Ask: \"Do these animals have shells or hard coverings? How do they protect themselves?\"\n   - Discuss different protective strategies (shells, speed, hiding).\n   - **Safety note:** Use a magnifying glass; do not let students pick up unknown insects. Observe from a distance, then gently return creatures to their habitat.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Prior experience:** Many First Graders may have seen turtles at zoos, in books, or as pets. Activate this knowledge during Engage with the question: \"Has anyone ever seen a turtle? Where?\"\n- **Safety during Explore:** Use plastic eggs only (not real eggs initially) to keep the classroom clean and prevent raw egg handling.\n- **Inclusive language:** Frame the lesson around all body parts—shells, legs, heads—so students with various abilities can participate in discussions and activities.\n- **Cross-curricular link:** This lesson pairs well with literacy (animal books), math (comparing sizes, measuring), and art (decorating and designing).\n\n---\n\n**This lesson plan directly addresses the photograph's content—a turtle in its ground habitat—and develops First Grade students' understanding of how external body parts (shells) help animals survive. The 5E flow ensures engagement, hands-on discovery, formal learning, application, and assessment.**",
