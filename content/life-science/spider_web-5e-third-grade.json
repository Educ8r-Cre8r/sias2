ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about spiders and their webs using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy of the spider web photograph (one per student or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Students' science notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph without revealing the title. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. Ask students to turn and talk with a partner: \"What do you see in this picture? How do you think this was made?\"\n\n3. Facilitate a brief whole-group discussion using these guiding questions:\n   - *\"What is the object in the center of the picture?\"* (Listen for: web, net, design, pattern)\n   - *\"Why do you think a spider would build something like this?\"* (Accept initial ideas without correcting)\n   - *\"If you were a tiny insect flying near this web, what might happen to you?\"* (Guide toward: caught, trapped, stuck)\n   - *\"Do you think all spider webs look exactly the same? Why or why not?\"* (Encourage wondering about differences)\n\n4. Create a class \"Wonder Wall\" on chart paper. Record 2-3 student questions such as:\n   - \"How does a spider make its web?\"\n   - \"Why are some webs different shapes?\"\n   - \"Does the spider get stuck in its own web?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today and tomorrow, we're going to investigate spiders and their amazing webs to answer some of these questions. Let's explore what makes a spider web such a perfect tool for survival!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate spider web structure and design through hands-on activity and discover how environmental factors influence web building.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Geoboards or 8×8 inch cardboard squares\n- String or yarn (various colors)\n- Tape\n- Pictures of 3-4 different types of real spider webs (orb webs, funnel webs, sheet webs)\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring)\n- Observation sheets (provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Web Building Simulation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide students into pairs or small groups of 3.\n\n2. Give each group a geoboard (or cardboard square) and string/yarn. Explain: \"You are going to design your own spider web. A spider uses silk threads to build a web that helps it catch insects for food.\"\n\n3. Provide these building parameters:\n   - Build a web design on your board using string\n   - Make your web as wide and strong as you can\n   - Try to make a pattern that would catch a small moving object\n\n4. While students build, circulate and ask:\n   - *\"Why did you choose that pattern?\"*\n   - *\"What happens if you make the spaces bigger/smaller?\"*\n   - *\"Is your web strong? How do you know?\"*\n\n5. After 8 minutes, ask students to stop and observe a neighbor's web. Ask: *\"How is your web similar to or different from this one?\"*\n\n**Part B: Analyzing Real Spider Web Variations (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Display pictures of different spider web types (orb web, funnel web, sheet web, cobweb).\n\n2. Provide each group with 2-3 images to examine. Have students discuss:\n   - What is the same about all these webs?\n   - What is different?\n   - Where might you find this type of web? (In a garden? In a dark corner? Between branches?)\n\n3. Students record 2-3 observations on their exploration sheet:\n   - One thing all spider webs have in common\n   - One way spider webs are different from each other\n   - One reason a spider might build a web in one place instead of another\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Observe web constructions without judging \"correctness\"\n- Ask probing questions to deepen thinking about structure and purpose\n- Guide students to notice patterns and variations without explicitly teaching them yet\n- Document student observations and language for the Explain phase\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create functional web designs showing understanding that webs have a purpose (trapping)\n- Students identify similarities and differences in real web types\n- Students begin to notice that web shape and location vary based on environment (location of plants, space available, type of prey)\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after exploration; connect back to the photograph and student discoveries.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of spider web from lesson introduction\n- Real spider (optional, in a safe container—observe from distance)\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out (5 minutes):** Ask 2-3 groups to briefly share their web design and one discovery from comparing real webs. Record key observations on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):** Define and display these terms with student-friendly explanations. Include simple drawings or the photograph as visual support:\n\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and find food. *Example: A spider's spinnerets (special body parts) let it make silk for its web.*\n   \n   - **Inherited Trait:** Something a baby animal gets from its parents that helps it survive. *Example: Baby spiders know how to build webs even without being taught—they inherit this ability from their spider parents.*\n   \n   - **Variation:** Differences among animals of the same kind. *Example: Some spider webs are round, some are funnel-shaped, and some are flat sheets. Different spiders build different types of webs.*\n   \n   - **Environment:** All the things around an animal, like plants, rocks, weather, and space. *Example: A spider builds a web where there are plants for support and insects to catch.*\n\n3. **Make Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Point back to the original photograph: \"This spider web is an **adaptation** that helps spiders **survive**. The web catches insects, which are food for spiders.\"\n   - Explain: \"Building webs is an **inherited trait**. Baby spiders learn how to spin webs from their parents' genes—they don't need anyone to teach them!\"\n   - Show variations: \"Not all spiders build the same type of web. This is **variation**. Different spider species have slightly different abilities.\"\n   - Discuss environment: \"Where a spider builds its web depends on the **environment**—the plants and spaces around it. A spider won't build a web in an empty room; it needs support!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Turn to your neighbor and explain: Why is web-building a helpful adaptation for spiders?\"\n   - Listen for: Spiders catch food, trap insects, survive, get meals.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive.\n- **Inherited Trait:** A characteristic that a baby animal receives from its parents.\n- **Variation:** Differences in how similar animals look or act.\n- **Environment:** All the living and non-living things around an animal.\n- **Spinnerets:** Special body parts on a spider's abdomen that produce silk for web-making.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that web-building is an inherited adaptation that helps spiders survive\n- Students recognize that not all spider webs are identical (variation)\n- Students begin to understand that environment influences where and how webs are built\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by explaining why certain spiders thrive in specific habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Three habitat scenario cards (provided below)\n- Evidence collection sheet\n- Pencils\n- Optional: Habitat pictures or small models\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present Three Habitat Scenarios (2 minutes):**\n\n   **Scenario A - The Garden:** A sunny garden with many flowering plants, bushes, and insects (butterflies, flies, small wasps).\n   \n   **Scenario B - The Empty Garage:** A dark, empty garage with concrete walls and no plants—but some moths attracted to the light bulb.\n   \n   **Scenario C - The Tree Branches:** A thick tree with many branches, leaves, wind, and small insects.\n\n2. **Divide into Three Groups (1 minute):** Assign each group one scenario.\n\n3. **Investigation Task (12 minutes):** Each group answers:\n   - *\"Would a spider survive well in this habitat? Why or why not?\"*\n   - *\"What kind of web might this spider need to build?\"*\n   - *\"What challenges would this spider face?\"*\n   - *\"What advantages would this spider have?\"*\n\n4. **Provide Evidence Support:**\n   - Guide students to use the vocabulary: adaptation, inherited traits, variation, environment\n   - Ask: \"Does this habitat have what the spider needs? (Plants for anchoring? Insects for food? Protection?)\"\n   - Encourage students to draw or write their explanation\n\n5. **Gallery Walk & Discussion (3 minutes):**\n   - Post each group's explanation around the room\n   - Do a quick gallery walk where students see all three habitats\n   - Discuss: *\"Which habitat is best for spiders? Why? Which would be hardest?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate small-group thinking with targeted questions\n- Help students make evidence-based claims (\"I know this because...\")\n- Connect back to the original photograph: \"Just like this spider in the photo found the perfect spot for its web...\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students explain why certain habitats support spider survival better than others\n- Students use vocabulary to construct evidence-based arguments\n- Students understand that adaptations (like web-building) work best in specific environments\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of inherited traits, adaptations, and environmental influences on spiders.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Turn-and-Talk Observations:** Monitor partner discussions during Engage and Explain phases for understanding of web function\n- **Exploration Sheets:** Review student observations from Part B of Explore phase to assess their ability to identify variations\n- **Questioning:** Observe student responses to teacher questions about \"why\" spiders build webs and how environment matters\n- **Group Explanations:** Listen to Elaborate group discussions for evidence of understanding\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket containing one or more of these prompts:\n\n**Option 1 (Written or Drawn):**\n\"Look at this picture of a spider web. Write or draw to answer: Why is a web a good adaptation for helping spiders survive?\"\n\n**Option 2 (Written or Verbal):**\n\"Baby spiders know how to build webs without anyone teaching them. What is this ability called? Is it an inherited trait or something they learn? Explain your thinking.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Evidence-Based):**\n\"A spider finds a corner in a garage with no plants. Can the spider build a web there? Why or why not? Use the word 'environment' in your answer.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery if they:\n- ✓ Identify the web as an **adaptation** that helps spiders catch food and survive\n- ✓ Explain that web-building is an **inherited trait** passed from parent spiders to baby spiders\n- ✓ Recognize **variation** in spider webs (acknowledge that not all webs look the same)\n- ✓ Use **environment** to explain why spiders build webs in certain locations\n- ✓ Provide **evidence** for their claims (e.g., \"Spiders need plants to anchor their webs\")\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nMost third graders will:\n- Use the word \"adaptation\" or \"adaptation helps spiders catch food\"\n- Recognize that different spiders build different types of webs\n- Explain that a spider chooses where to build based on available plants or space\n- Connect inherited traits to the idea that \"spiders are born knowing how to do this\"\n\nAdvanced students may:\n- Use multiple pieces of evidence in a single explanation\n- Explain why certain web variations are better for specific environments\n- Predict what would happen if the environment changed\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Provide a Word Bank:** During Explain and Elaborate phases, display vocabulary cards with pictures (adaptation, inherited trait, variation, environment) for students to reference and use in their explanations.\n\n2. **Use Sentence Frames:** Offer sentence starters for the exit ticket:\n   - \"A spider web helps spiders survive because _______________.\"\n   - \"Baby spiders know how to build webs because they have an _______________.\"\n   - \"A spider would not build a web in a garage because _______________.\"\n\n3. **Pair with a Peer or Adult:** During Explore and Elaborate phases, pair struggling students with a supportive peer or adult to discuss observations and record ideas together.\n\n4. **Simplify Habitat Scenarios:** Use only one or two habitat scenarios instead of three; provide pictures to support understanding.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Research Extension:** Ask advanced students to research and present on one specific spider species—its web type, habitat, and how it is adapted to that environment. Have them create a visual comparison showing adaptation, variation, and environment connections.\n\n2. **Design Challenge:** Challenge students to design a new web type for a spider that lives in windy environments. Ask them to explain how their design is an **adaptation** that helps the spider survive the wind better than a traditional orb web.\n\n3. **Environmental Change Scenario:** Present this challenge: \"If a spider's habitat changes—for example, if all the plants are cut down—how would the spider's survival be affected? What might happen?\" Have students write or draw a hypothesis and explain using evidence.\n\n4. **Variation Investigation:** Provide pictures of 5-6 different spider webs. Ask advanced students to categorize them by type, measure variations in web size/pattern, and explain why spiders might build different sizes.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Spider Web Art with Mathematics:** Students create their own geometric spider web designs using string and paper plates. They measure angles, count sections, and explore the mathematical patterns spiders use naturally. Display finished webs and compare patterns—reinforcing the concept of variation.\n\n2. **Outdoor Web Hunt:** If possible, take students outside to observe real spider webs (from a safe distance). Have students photograph or sketch webs they find, note the location and environment, and create a class chart showing \"Where We Found Spider Webs.\" This extends learning to real-world observations and reinforces environmental influence on web placement.\n\n3. **Spider Life Cycle Poster Project:** Extend to 3-LS1-1 (life cycles) by having students research and create a poster showing the life cycle of a spider: egg, spiderling, juvenile, adult. Include how web-building ability develops and changes as spiders grow. This connects inherited traits to development over time.\n\n4. **Food Web Investigation:** Expand to ecosystem thinking by creating a food web showing spiders as predators of insects. Ask: \"If spiders disappeared from this food web, what would happen?\" This connects to survival advantages and environmental relationships.\n\n5. **\"Why This Web?\" Debate:** Provide students with scenarios (e.g., \"You are a spider. You can build either a round orb web or a funnel web. You live in a windy location with tall trees.\"). Have students debate and defend which web type would be better, using evidence about adaptations and environment.",
