  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Hummingbirds and Flowers\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Energy flow in ecosystems:** Hummingbirds obtain energy (in the form of nectar) from flowering plants, demonstrating how energy moves from plants to animals through feeding relationships.\n- **Plant-animal interdependence:** The hummingbird's specialized beak and the flower's structure show how plants and animals depend on each other—the bird gets food, and the flower gets pollinated (matter and energy exchange).\n- **Matter cycling:** Nectar (a product made from water, minerals, and sugars that the plant obtains from air and soil) is consumed by the hummingbird and becomes part of the bird's body, demonstrating movement of matter between organisms and the environment.\n- **Specialized adaptations for survival:** The hummingbird's rapid wing movement, long beak, and the flower's bright color and nectar production are structural features that enable survival and feeding.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**The Hummingbird-Flower Connection: Tracking Energy and Matter**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-50 minute sessions (approximately 90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-LS1-1: Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water\n  - 5-LS2-1: Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Support an argument explaining where plants get the materials (water, air, minerals) they use to make nectar that hummingbirds drink.\n2. Develop a model showing how matter (nectar) moves from the plant to the hummingbird and how this represents energy and nutrient flow in an ecosystem.\n3. Describe the relationship between hummingbirds and flowering plants and explain why both organisms depend on each other for survival.\n4. Trace the path of matter (water and nutrients from soil/air) as it moves through the plant and into the hummingbird's body.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about plant-animal relationships using the hummingbird-flower photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed or projected image of the hummingbird and flowers\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Allow 30-45 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Pose these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice the hummingbird is doing near the flower? What might it be eating?\"\n   - \"Where do you think the flower gets the sweet liquid (nectar) that the hummingbird is drinking? Does the flower make it from the soil, the air, or somewhere else?\"\n   - \"Why would a hummingbird visit a flower? What does it need from the flower?\"\n   - \"If the hummingbird eats nectar from the flower, where do you think that nectar ends up inside the hummingbird's body?\"\n\n3. **Record student ideas** on chart paper without correcting them. This reveals prior conceptions and builds community knowledge.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder: If a hummingbird drinks nectar that comes from a plant's roots, air, and water, how does the matter from those places end up inside the hummingbird's body? Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to trace the journey of matter—starting in the soil and air, moving through the flower, and ending up inside the hummingbird. We'll create a model to show this amazing pathway.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate where plants get materials for growth and how those materials move through the plant-animal system.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Plant with roots, stem, and leaves (or diagram of plant structure with labels)\n- 3 different colored yarn pieces or string (to represent water, air/minerals, and nectar)\n- Large poster board or chart paper\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Labels: \"soil,\" \"air,\" \"roots,\" \"stem,\" \"leaves,\" \"flower,\" \"nectar,\" \"hummingbird\"\n- Tape\n- Optional: fresh flowers (carnations work well) and food coloring to observe water movement\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **Observe the plant structure.** Examine the plant's roots, stem, leaves, and flowers. Discuss: \"What part of the plant is in the soil? What parts are in the air?\"\n\n2. **Trace the journey of water.** Using blue yarn, create a pathway showing where water comes from (soil → roots → stem → leaves → flowers). Tape the yarn onto your chart paper and label each part.\n\n3. **Trace the journey of nutrients/minerals.** Using green yarn, show how minerals and nutrients from the soil travel the same path (soil → roots → stem → leaves → flowers).\n\n4. **Trace the journey of air.** Using yellow yarn, show how gases from the air enter through the leaves and are used by the plant.\n\n5. **Add the nectar path.** Using red yarn, show how nectar (made from water, minerals, and energy the plant created) moves from the flower to the hummingbird. Attach a hummingbird cutout at the end.\n\n6. **Label everything.** Ensure each part of the pathway is labeled so your model clearly shows where materials come from and where they go.\n\n7. **Record in your notebook:** Answer these questions:\n   - What materials does the plant get from the soil?\n   - What materials does the plant get from the air?\n   - What is made inside the plant using water and air?\n   - Where does the nectar go after the hummingbird drinks it?\n\n**How this connects to the photograph:** The hummingbird in the image is drinking nectar that the plant created using water from the soil and gases from the air. Your yarn model shows this complete journey.\n\n**What students should record or document:**\n- A labeled diagram/model showing the pathway of matter from soil and air through the plant and into the hummingbird\n- Written answers explaining where plants get the materials they need\n- Drawings or labels showing each step of the journey\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Where does the root get water?\" \"What do you think the plant does with the water it absorbs?\" \"How do you think the nectar helps the hummingbird?\"\n- Avoid giving direct answers; instead, ask follow-up questions that guide thinking\n- Help students connect their yarn pathways to the actual plant structure\n- Ensure all students label their models completely\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual model showing water and minerals traveling from soil through the plant\n- Students identify air as a source of materials for plants\n- Students show nectar (made from plant materials) moving from the flower to the hummingbird\n- Students begin to understand that matter moves through an ecosystem\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after exploration, connecting student discoveries to plant growth and energy/matter flow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with pre-written vocabulary list\n- Colored markers\n- Printed diagrams showing plant anatomy (optional)\n- The original hummingbird-flower photograph (displayed again)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Ask 2-3 pairs to briefly share their models. Have them explain one pathway they traced. As they share, highlight the connections to the standards:\n   - Student A: \"We showed water going from soil to the flower.\"\n   - Teacher: \"Excellent! That water is one of the **materials** plants need to grow.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):** Write each term on chart paper. Define each using student-friendly language and reference the photograph:\n\n   - **Nectar:** A sweet liquid made by flowers that contains water, sugars, and nutrients. Bees and hummingbirds drink nectar for energy.\n   - **Absorption:** When plant roots take in water and minerals from the soil. Plants need to absorb water to make food and nectar.\n   - **Photosynthesis (grade-level adaptation):** The process where plants use sunlight, water, and air to make their own food (sugar) and grow. The sugar becomes part of the nectar.\n   - **Matter:** Anything that takes up space and has mass—like water, nutrients, air gases, and nectar. Matter moves from one place to another in nature.\n   - **Ecosystem:** A community of living things (plants, animals, fungi) and the non-living environment (soil, air, water) all working together. The hummingbird and flower are part of the same ecosystem.\n\n3. **Make explicit connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again. \"The hummingbird in this picture is drinking nectar. Where did that nectar come from? From the flower. Where did the flower get the materials to make nectar? From the soil (water and minerals) and the air (gases the plant breathes in). So the matter in the hummingbird's body started in the soil and air!\"\n   - Draw a simple arrow diagram on the board: **Soil + Air + Water → Plant → Nectar → Hummingbird**\n   - \"This is called the **movement of matter.** Matter doesn't disappear; it moves from place to place in nature, from living things to non-living things and back again.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2 minutes):** Ask:\n   - \"Thumbs up if you can explain where plants get water. Thumbs sideways if you're not sure. Thumbs down if you need help.\" (Adjust instruction based on responses.)\n   - \"Who can name one material plants get from the soil?\" (Wait for answers: water, minerals, nutrients)\n   - \"Who can name one material plants get from the air?\" (Oxygen, carbon dioxide)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Nectar:** A sweet liquid produced by flowers containing water, sugars, and nutrients; food for hummingbirds and other pollinators.\n- **Absorption:** The process by which plant roots take in water and nutrients from the soil.\n- **Matter:** Anything that has mass and takes up space; can move between living and non-living parts of an ecosystem.\n- **Photosynthesis:** The process plants use to convert sunlight, water, and air into food (sugar) for growth and energy.\n- **Ecosystem:** All the living organisms and non-living things in an area that interact with each other.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define where plants get materials for growth (soil and air)\n- Students understand that matter (water, minerals, nectar) moves from plants to animals\n- Students can explain the relationship between the hummingbird's feeding and the plant's survival (pollination and seed dispersal benefit the plant)\n- Students connect the photograph to the scientific concepts\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18-22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by creating a more detailed ecosystem model and exploring the complete matter cycle.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster board (11\" × 14\" or larger)\n- Colored pencils, markers, colored paper\n- Scissors\n- Glue stick\n- Pre-drawn or printed images: hummingbird, flower, decomposer (mushroom or bacteria), soil, sun, rain clouds, leaves\n- Optional: small branches, fabric scraps, or natural materials for texture\n- Student notebooks for written reflections\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the expanded model (3 minutes):** \n   - \"We've traced how matter moves from soil and air to plants to hummingbirds. But what happens next? When a hummingbird's body eventually breaks down, where does all that matter go?\"\n   - Display a simple diagram showing: **Plant → Hummingbird → Decomposer (fungi/bacteria) → Soil → Plant again**\n   - \"This is called a **cycle.** Matter keeps moving in a circle, never disappearing—it just changes form and location.\"\n\n2. **Students create an expanded ecosystem model (13-15 minutes):**\n   - **On the poster board, create a scene showing:**\n     - Soil at the bottom (with water droplets and minerals labeled)\n     - A flower plant with roots in soil, stem, leaves, and flower\n     - A hummingbird hovering near the flower\n     - Sun in the sky (energy source)\n     - Clouds and rain (water source)\n     - Optional: decomposers (mushrooms, bacteria) breaking down dead matter\n   \n   - **Use arrows to show matter moving:**\n     - From soil → through plant → to hummingbird\n     - From air/sun → through plant\n     - From hummingbird → back to soil (after decomposition)\n   \n   - **Label each stage** with the material being transferred (water, nectar, energy, nutrients)\n\n3. **Written reflection (3-4 minutes):** In their notebooks, students answer:\n   - \"How does the matter in the nectar support the hummingbird's life? (What does the hummingbird use it for?)\"\n   - \"If a hummingbird dies, what happens to all the matter in its body? Where does it go?\"\n   - \"Why do plants need hummingbirds, and why do hummingbirds need plants? Explain the relationship.\"\n\n4. **Gallery walk (optional, if time permits):** Display models around the classroom. Students do a silent walk and leave sticky notes with observations or questions on peers' work.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without giving answers; ask questions like: \"What happens to dead organisms in nature?\" and \"If water comes from the soil, does it stay there forever or does it move somewhere else?\"\n- Help students see that this is a **cycle**, not a one-way path\n- Prompt students to think about energy (the sun powers the plant; the plant feeds the hummingbird)\n- Ensure all students understand that matter is **conserved**—it doesn't disappear, it transforms\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a detailed, labeled model showing matter moving through multiple organisms and back to the environment\n- Students write explanations showing they understand the cycle of matter\n- Students can articulate why plants and hummingbirds need each other (interdependence)\n- Students demonstrate understanding that matter keeps moving in ecosystems\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of where plants get materials and how matter moves through ecosystems.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Observe student models and listen to explanations. Ask probing questions to assess understanding.\n- **During Explain:** Use thumbs-up/sideways/down checks. Ask individual students to explain one pathway.\n- **During Elaborate:** Review student-written reflections for evidence of understanding cause-and-effect (plant growth from soil/air materials; hummingbird feeding; matter cycling).\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with this assessment. Students can draw and write answers.\n\n---\n\n**EXIT TICKET: Hummingbirds and Matter**\n\n**Name:** ________________________     **Date:** _______________\n\n**Question 1:** Look at this diagram showing a hummingbird drinking nectar from a flower.\n\n[Simple drawing: flower → hummingbird]\n\n**Where did the water in the nectar originally come from?**\n- [ ] From the flower petals\n- [ ] From the soil\n- [ ] From the hummingbird\n- [ ] From the sun\n\n**Explain your answer:** _________________________________________________________\n\n**Question 2:** A plant's leaves are green. Plants use sunlight, water from the soil, and gases from the air to make food (sugar) that helps them grow. This food becomes part of the nectar.\n\n**Name TWO materials that plants get from the soil or air that help make nectar.**\n\n1. ________________________\n2. ________________________\n\n**Question 3:** Imagine this scenario: A hummingbird drinks nectar and becomes strong. Later, the hummingbird dies. Decomposers (like bacteria and fungi) break down its body.\n\n**Where does the matter from the hummingbird's body go?**\n\nAnswer: ________________________________________________________________\n\n**Question 4 (Draw and label):** Draw a simple diagram showing how matter moves from the soil through a plant to a hummingbird. Use arrows and labels.\n\n[Space for drawing]\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Question 1:** Student selects soil (b) and provides a reasonable explanation (e.g., \"Plants get water from the soil through their roots\").\n\n✓ **Question 2:** Student names at least two materials (water, minerals/nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus, OR air/carbon dioxide, oxygen—accept grade-appropriate descriptions).\n\n✓ **Question 3:** Student indicates matter returns to soil/environment through decomposition (e.g., \"It breaks down and becomes part of the soil\" or \"It goes back to nature\").\n\n✓ **Question 4:** Student diagram shows:\n- Clear pathway from soil → plant → hummingbird\n- Labeled arrows or labels showing direction of matter flow\n- At least 3 labeled parts (soil, plant/flower, hummingbird)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- 80% of students correctly identify soil as the water source and explain basic absorption.\n- 75% of students can name at least two materials plants obtain from soil/air.\n- 70% of students articulate that matter cycles back to the environment through decomposition.\n- 85% of students create labeled diagrams showing matter movement from plant to animal.\n- Students provide written evidence that they understand the interconnection between plants, hummingbirds, and the non-living environment.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary:** Before the lesson, review the terms \"water,\" \"soil,\" \"air,\" \"plant,\" and \"nectar\" using real objects (actual soil in a cup, a live plant, pictures of hummingbirds). Use repetition and multisensory approaches.\n\n2. **Provide sentence frames during Elaborate:** \n   - \"The plant got water from the _______________.\"\n   - \"The hummingbird drank nectar to get _______________.\"\n   - \"When matter moves, it goes from _______________ to _______________.\"\n   \n3. **Use simpler models:** Allow struggling learners to create a 3-part linear diagram (Soil → Plant → Hummingbird) instead of a complete cycle. This reduces cognitive load while still meeting the core objective.\n\n4. **Pair with a peer mentor:** Assign a student who masters the concept early to work alongside a struggling student during Explore, asking guiding questions and explaining their thinking aloud.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Expand to complete food webs:** Have advanced students research and create a food web that includes the hummingbird, the flower, bees (pollinators), decomposers, and herbivores. Ask them to trace multiple pathways of matter and energy.\n\n2. **Quantitative modeling:** Ask students to research and create a diagram showing approximately how much water and nutrients a flowering plant needs to produce a set amount of nectar. They can present this as a ratio or simple mathematical relationship.\n\n3. **Real-world application:** Have students design a hummingbird garden, researching which plants produce the most nectar and how the garden ecosystem would function. They should explain how matter cycles in their designed garden.\n\n4. **Research depth:** Ask advanced students to investigate what happens to nectar that isn't consumed by hummingbirds (e.g., bees, bats, insects pollinate instead). They can create a poster or presentation explaining how different animals affect plant pollination and ecosystem matter cycling.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Nectar Recipe & Hummingbird Feeding Experiment:**\n   Students make a simple nectar solution (1 part white sugar to 4 parts water—no red dye, which is harmful). If available, set up a hummingbird feeder outside the classroom window and observe feeding behavior over several days. Students record observations about how many visits occur, how long the hummingbird stays, and how the nectar level drops. They calculate how much \"matter\" (nectar) the hummingbird consumes and discuss where that energy and matter came from. *Connection: Links matter transfer to observable feeding behavior and energy needs.*\n\n2. **Plant Growth Experiment Over Time:**\n   Set up two flower pots: one with soil and water, one with just water (no soil). Plant seeds in both. Over 2-3 weeks, students observe and measure growth. They record observations and discuss: \"Which plant grew better? Why? What materials was it missing?\" This provides hands-on evidence that plants need materials from soil (minerals and nutrients) to grow well. Students can relate this back to the hummingbird lesson: plants that don't get proper nutrients can't make healthy nectar. *Connection: Reinforces 5-LS1-1 through direct observation of plant growth needs.*\n\n3. **Decomposition Observation (Composting Unit):**\n   Create a small clear container with layers of soil, dead leaves, small food scraps, and decomposer organisms (earthworms, pill bugs, or simply let soil bacteria work). Over several weeks, students observe matter breaking down and returning to the soil. They draw and label diagrams showing how decomposers complete the matter cycle. This directly supports 5-LS2-1 by demonstrating the role of decomposers in moving matter through the ecosystem. *Connection: Extends the cycle shown in the Elaborate phase and emphasizes the role of non-visible organisms.*\n\n---\n\n**END OF LESSON PLAN**",
