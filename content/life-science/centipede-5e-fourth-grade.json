ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the centipede's unusual body structure and sensory abilities.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Centipede photograph (displayed on screen or printed large)\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Wonder question poster template (optional)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Display the photograph** prominently and allow students 30-45 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n  2. **Ask opening questions to spark curiosity:**\n     - \"What do you notice about this animal's body? What looks different from other animals you know?\"\n     - \"Why do you think this centipede has so many legs? What does it need them for?\"\n     - \"Look closely at the head. What do you see sticking out? What might those be used for?\"\n     - \"If you were this centipede living in dark, damp soil, how would you find food or know if danger was coming?\"\n  3. **Invite predictions:** \"If we could watch this centipede move in the dark, what do you predict it could do better than, say, a dog or a cat? Why?\"\n  4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper titled \"Our Questions About Centipedes.\" Save this to revisit during Explain phase.\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today we're going to investigate how a centipede's body is perfectly designed to help it survive. Let's explore what each part does.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate centipede external structures through hands-on observation and model-building.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Pipe cleaners (multiple colors, 6-8 per student/pair)\n  - Googly eyes (small)\n  - Foam ball or modeling clay (walnut-sized, for head)\n  - String or yarn (for antennae)\n  - Centipede diagram handout (unlabeled, showing segments and legs)\n  - Ruler or measuring tape\n  - Observation sheet (see below)\n  - Magnifying glass (if live specimens unavailable)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Distribute the unlabeled centipede diagram** to each student pair. Display the photograph again.\n  2. **Direct students:** \"Your job is to carefully look at the centipede in the photo and label as many parts as you can find on your diagram. Write or draw what you see. What structures do you notice repeated over and over?\"\n  3. **Students work for 5-7 minutes** identifying and labeling:\n     - Head\n     - Antennae\n     - Body segments (rows of rings)\n     - Legs (count how many they can see)\n     - Eyes (if visible)\n  4. **Introduce the model-building challenge:** \"Now let's build a model centipede to understand how its body helps it move and sense. Use your pipe cleaners, foam, and other materials to create a centipede that shows its main structures.\"\n     - The foam ball = head\n     - Pipe cleaners = body segments (link them together)\n     - String = antennae attached to head\n     - Additional pipe cleaner sections bent down = legs attached to each segment\n  5. **As students build (7-10 minutes):**\n     - Ask: \"How does connecting pipe cleaners together help your model move? Can it bend like a real centipede?\"\n     - \"Why does a centipede need legs on almost every segment?\"\n     - Encourage testing movement: \"Try bending your model. Does it move smoothly? Why or why not?\"\n  6. **Have students complete the Observation Sheet:**\n     - Sketch and label your model centipede.\n     - List 3 external structures and write what you think each does.\n     - Write one question you still have about how these structures help the centipede survive.\n\n- **Teacher Role:** \n  - Circulate and ask probing questions: \"What would happen if the centipede only had 4 legs instead of many? Would it move the same way?\"\n  - Encourage observation: \"Look at the photograph. Do you notice anything about how the legs are arranged?\"\n  - Do NOT provide answers; guide curiosity.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students produce labeled diagrams and functional pipe-cleaner models.\n  - Students articulate that multiple segments + multiple legs = flexibility and speed.\n  - Students recognize that antennae are sensory structures (though deeper explanation comes in Explain phase).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific explanations connecting structures to survival functions.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Centipede photograph\n  - \"Structure and Function\" anchor chart (prepared or co-created)\n  - Student observation sheets from Explore\n  - Diagram showing centipede sensory response (optional: simple arrow diagram showing: antenna detects prey → brain processes → legs move toward food)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Invite student share-out (5 minutes):**\n     - \"What did you discover about how your model centipede moved?\"\n     - \"What structures seemed most important for survival?\"\n     - Validate observations and address misconceptions gently.\n  2. **Introduce vocabulary and build anchor chart (8-10 minutes):**\n     - Display photograph again. Point to each structure as you define:\n\n     | **Structure** | **Function** | **Helps the centipede...** |\n     |---|---|---|\n     | **Segments** | Sections of the body connected together | Bend and flex to move smoothly and quickly |\n     | **Legs** | Pairs of limbs attached to each body segment | Run fast to escape predators and chase prey |\n     | **Antennae** | Long sensory \"feelers\" on the head | Sense vibrations and chemicals in the air and soil to find food in the dark |\n     | **Eyes** | Tiny light-sensing organs (mostly in dark-adapted eyes) | See movement and light, though centipedes rely more on antennae |\n\n  3. **Explain structure-function relationship:**\n     - \"A centipede's body is like a train made of connected cars. Each car (segment) has legs. Because it has so many connected segments, the centipede can wiggle and bend its whole body. This helps it squeeze through tiny spaces in soil and run really fast.\"\n     - \"The antennae are like the centipede's telephone line to the world. They pick up information—is there a beetle nearby? Is the ground wet or dry? Should I move toward it or away? The centipede's brain gets this information and tells the legs what to do.\"\n  4. **Connect to survival:**\n     - \"These structures aren't random. They work together because of where and how a centipede lives. It hunts in dark places where it can't rely on sight, so it has amazing antennae. It needs to move fast to catch prey and escape danger, so it has many flexible segments and legs.\"\n  5. **Check for understanding:**\n     - \"Turn to a partner and explain: Why does a centipede need so many legs?\"\n     - \"If a centipede's antennae got damaged, what might happen when it tries to hunt?\"\n     - Listen for student responses; reteach if needed.\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Segment:** One of many connected sections that make up a centipede's body; each segment has legs attached.\n  - **External structure:** A body part on the outside of an organism that helps it survive (like legs, antennae, or eyes).\n  - **Sensory:** Related to the senses—touching, seeing, smelling, tasting, or hearing; antennae are sensory organs.\n  - **Function:** The job or purpose of a body part (e.g., the function of legs is to move).\n  - **Adaptation:** A structure or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students can name and label centipede structures.\n  - Students explain that external structures have specific functions related to survival.\n  - Students understand that a centipede's sensory structures help it gather information and respond to its environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply understanding to compare centipedes with other animals and make evidence-based arguments about structure and function.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Comparison chart template (prepared)\n  - Photos/illustrations of 3-4 other animals: snake, millipede (if possible), beetle, rabbit\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Student argument worksheet (template provided below)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Display comparison photos.** Show images of a centipede, snake, beetle, and rabbit side by side.\n  2. **Guided comparison (5-7 minutes):**\n     - \"The centipede has many legs and antennae. Now look at a snake. Does it have legs? Does it have antennae? How does it move differently?\"\n     - \"A beetle also has legs and antennae. How are a centipede's antennae different from a beetle's?\"\n     - \"A rabbit has 4 legs and long ears. How is this different from a centipede's design?\"\n  3. **Co-create a comparison chart:**\n\n     | **Animal** | **Number of Legs** | **Sensory Structures** | **Where It Lives** | **How Its Structures Help It Survive** |\n     |---|---|---|---|---|\n     | Centipede | Many (30+) | Long antennae | Dark soil, leaf litter | Many legs = fast movement; antennae = find food in darkness |\n     | Snake | 0 | Tongue, heat pits | Various | No legs = squeeze through spaces; tongue = smell |\n     | Beetle | 6 | Antennae, eyes | Many habitats | Few legs = less weight; antennae = find mates/food |\n     | Rabbit | 4 | Long ears, eyes, whiskers | Open fields, burrows | 4 legs = speed in open; ears = hear danger |\n\n  4. **Student argument task (8-10 minutes):**\n     - Distribute **Argument Worksheet:** \n       > \"Choose two animals from the chart. Write or draw an argument answering: **Why does each animal's body structure match where and how it lives?** Use evidence from the chart.\"\n       > \n       > Example: \"A centipede lives in dark soil and hunts small prey. It has many legs and long antennae. The many legs help it run fast through tunnels, and the antennae help it find food in the dark where it can't see. A rabbit lives in open fields where it needs to run from predators. It has 4 powerful legs for speed and long ears to hear danger coming. Each animal's structures match its survival needs.\"\n     - Circulate; prompt students: \"How does this structure help the animal survive? Where does it live?\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Guide comparison thinking without leading to answers.\n  - Help students see the pattern: **Structure = Function = Habitat.**\n  - Support sentence starters for struggling writers: \"The _____ has _____ because it needs to _____.\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students write/draw a comparison showing understanding of structure-function relationships.\n  - Students provide evidence (from the chart or photo) to support their argument.\n  - Students recognize that different animals have different structures because they live different lives.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal structures, sensory systems, and survival functions.\n\n- **Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n  - Observation of model-building: Do students recognize that segments and legs enable movement?\n  - Listen-in during partner talks in Explain phase for accurate vocabulary use.\n  - Review observation sheets from Explore for evidence of structure identification.\n\n- **Exit Ticket (given at end of lesson, allows 5-7 minutes):**\n  \n  Provide each student with an exit ticket:\n  \n  > **EXIT TICKET: Centipede Survival Challenge**\n  > \n  > **1. Label three external structures on this centipede diagram:** (simple unlabeled drawing provided)\n  > \n  > **2. Pick one structure and explain: What does this structure do? How does it help the centipede survive?**\n  > \n  > **3. True or False (circle one):**\n  > - A centipede's antennae help it sense things in the dark. **TRUE / FALSE**\n  > - A centipede has many legs because it looks cool. **TRUE / FALSE**\n  > \n  > **4. If a centipede lived in a bright, open desert (instead of dark soil), what structures might change and why?** (Challenge question for advanced students; others may skip.)\n\n- **Summative Assessment (can be given after lesson or next day):**\n  \n  **Centipede Structure-Function Task:**\n  > You are a wildlife biologist discovering a new insect. It has:\n  > - A long, segmented body\n  > - 15 pairs of legs\n  > - Very short antennae\n  > - Large eyes\n  > \n  > Where do you think this insect lives? What does it eat? Explain your answer using what you know about how structures help animals survive. Use the words: **structure, function, survive.**\n\n- **Success Criteria:**\n  - Students correctly identify and label at least 3 external centipede structures.\n  - Students explain the function of at least 2 structures (e.g., \"legs help it run; antennae help it sense\").\n  - Students make a logical connection between structure and survival (e.g., \"Many legs help it move fast to catch food\").\n  - Students use appropriate vocabulary: structure, function, sensory, external, survival.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - **Proficient:** Students accurately label structures, explain 2+ functions clearly, and connect structure to survival with reasoning.\n  - **Developing:** Students label 2-3 structures, explain function with teacher prompting, make simple structure-survival connections.\n  - **Beginning:** Students identify structures with help, name functions but don't explain clearly, need scaffolding to connect to survival.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (for struggling learners):**\n  1. **Provide a labeled centipede diagram alongside the unlabeled one** during Explore so students can cross-reference while observing the photograph.\n  2. **Use sentence frames during Elaborate:** \"The centipede has _____ because it lives in _____\" and \"The _____ helps the centipede _____.\"\n  3. **Reduce the number of animals in the comparison chart** (focus on centipede vs. one other animal like a snake or beetle) and work through the comparison together as a group before independent work.\n\n- **Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n  1. **Investigate millipedes vs. centipedes:** Provide photos and ask students to research: \"Why might a millipede have more legs than a centipede but move slower? What does this tell us about how structures relate to function?\" (This requires inference and comparative reasoning.)\n  2. **Design an alien creature:** \"Create an organism that hunts fast-moving prey in a bright, open desert. Sketch it and label the structures it would need. Explain why each structure helps it survive in that habitat.\"\n  3. **Sensory system deep-dive:** Have advanced students research and present on: \"How does a centipede's brain process information from its antennae and eyes? What if the antennae were shorter?\" (Connects to 4-LS1-2.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Live Centipede Observation (if available):**\n   Obtain a captive centipede in a safe enclosure (with proper care guidelines). Let students observe how it moves, responds to vibrations, and uses its antennae to investigate food items (cricket, leaf). Have students sketch and annotate behavior observations, noting how structures enable specific responses.\n\n2. **Decomposer Role Investigation:**\n   Research and report: \"Centipedes are important decomposers in soil ecosystems. Why is the centipede's speed and sensory ability important for breaking down dead leaves and finding food in soil?\" Create a poster or short video explaining the centipede's ecological role and how its structures support that role.\n\n3. **Creature Design Challenge (STEM Connection):**\n   \"Design a robot centipede using craft materials (straws, pipe cleaners, cardboard, motors if available) that can move through an obstacle course. Test whether more segments and legs make it faster and more flexible. Record data on speed and flexibility.\"\n\n4. **Comparative Body Structure Research:**\n   Create a reference guide: \"How do different invertebrates (ants, spiders, worms, millipedes) sense their environment? How do their external structures differ? How does this relate to where they live?\" Compile findings in an illustrated class book.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson immerses fourth graders in authentic scientific thinking, moving from observation and hands-on exploration to evidence-based argument. The centipede becomes a compelling case study in how structure, function, and habitat are deeply interconnected—a foundational concept in life science.",
