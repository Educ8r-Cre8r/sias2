Identify external structures of animals (like hooves) visible in tracks and explain how these structures help animals survive.\n2. Analyze evidence from animal tracks to describe what senses an animal used to locate food and survive in its habitat.\n3. Construct an argument that specific animal body parts and behaviors are connected to how that animal meets its survival needs.\n4. Use observational data from tracks to describe how animals respond to information from their environment.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal tracks and how animals survive in nature.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the hoofprints and surrounding vegetation\n- Whiteboard and markers\n- Chart paper labeled \"What We Wonder\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Show students the image of the hoofprints in the soil surrounded by plants, flowers, and grasses. Display it large enough so all students can see clearly.\n\n2. **Pose an Engaging Opening Question:** \"What do you see in this picture? What do you think made these marks in the ground?\"\n\n3. **Discussion Questions (Guide conversation but do NOT provide answers):**\n   - \"What animal do you think made these footprints? What clues help you think that?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this animal was walking through this grassy area? What might it be looking for?\"\n   - \"If you were an animal trying to find food in this place, what would your feet need to do? What would help you walk safely?\"\n   - \"How do you think this animal's feet are different from your feet? Why might those differences be important?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what this animal was doing when it made these tracks. I wonder if its feet are specially designed to help it survive. Let's become animal detectives and find out!\"\n\n5. **Record Predictions:** Ask students to turn to a neighbor and share: \"What do you predict we'll learn about how animals' bodies help them survive?\" Write a few predictions on chart paper.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions and ideas! Now let's explore how animals' bodies are designed to help them survive by making our own animal tracks.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate animal feet and track-making through hands-on exploration, discovering how external structures support animal survival and movement.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Shallow trays or containers filled with sand, soil, or kinetic sand (one per pair or small group)\n- Water spray bottle to dampen soil slightly\n- Animal foot models or hand-drawn animal foot outlines: deer hooves, dog paws, bird feet (printed on cardstock and cut out, or clay models students create)\n- Student feet (for comparison)\n- Magnifying glasses\n- Clipboards and observation sheets\n- Rulers or measuring tape\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set the Stage:** \"We're going to be track detectives. We'll create tracks like the animal in the photo made, and observe what those tracks tell us about the animal.\"\n\n2. **Part A — Making Tracks (10 minutes):**\n   - Assign pairs or small groups one animal type: hoofed animal (deer/elk), canine (dog), or bird.\n   - Provide students with a model foot (or have them make one from clay).\n   - Have students press their model foot firmly into the damp sand/soil.\n   - Have them press it several times, adjusting pressure and angle to see how the track changes.\n   - Students use magnifying glasses to observe the details of their prints.\n\n3. **Part B — Observation and Recording (10 minutes):**\n   - Provide observation sheets with prompts like:\n     * \"Draw what your animal's track looks like.\"\n     * \"Count how many 'toes' or points you see in the track.\"\n     * \"Measure the length and width of the track.\"\n     * \"How deep did the foot sink into the ground? Why might that be?\"\n     * \"What does this foot structure tell you about how this animal walks or runs?\"\n   - Students sketch their tracks and record measurements.\n   - Ask them to compare two different animal tracks: \"Which animal leaves a bigger print? Why do you think that is?\"\n\n4. **Connection to the Photograph:**\n   - \"Look at the hoofprints in our photograph. Do they look similar to or different from the tracks you made? What do you notice about the shape and number of toes?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and observe without immediately correcting or explaining.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the shape? Does this foot look designed for running fast, or for walking on soft ground, or something else? Why do you think so?\"\n- Encourage students to make predictions: \"If this animal needs to walk through muddy areas to find food, what kind of foot would help it most?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create and observe multiple animal tracks.\n- They will recognize that different animals have different foot structures (hooves vs. paws vs. claws).\n- They will begin to see connections between foot shape and the environment (e.g., hooves for firm ground, webbed feet for water).\n- They will generate initial ideas about why these differences matter for survival.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and introduce concepts of external structures, survival functions, and sensory response after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Printed diagram of animal feet (hooves, paws, claws, webbed feet) labeled with key features\n- Real pictures of animals in their habitats (optional but helpful)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share and Connect (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their observations: \"What did you discover about the tracks you made?\"\n   - Record observations on chart paper: \"Track shapes we noticed,\" \"Differences between animal feet,\" etc.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary and Concepts (10 minutes):**\n   - Return to the photograph and point out the hoofprints.\n   - Explain: \"The marks in this photo are called tracks. They show us that an animal passed through this area. We can learn about the animal just by looking at the tracks!\"\n   - Present and define vocabulary using the chart paper or board:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **External Structure:** The outside parts of an animal's body that we can see and touch (like feet, hooves, claws, legs, ears, eyes, nose). These structures help animals survive.\n\n- **Hooves:** Hard, protective coverings on the feet of animals like deer, elk, horses, and cattle. Hooves help these animals walk and run on firm ground without slipping, and they help the animal find and eat plants without hurting its foot.\n\n- **Tracks:** Marks or impressions left in soil, sand, snow, or mud by an animal's feet. Tracks are evidence that tells us an animal was in that place.\n\n- **Sensory Information:** Messages the animal's senses (eyes, ears, nose, touch) pick up from the environment. For example, a deer uses its nose to smell plants it can eat, its eyes to see predators, and its ears to hear danger.\n\n- **Adapt/Adaptation:** Special features or behaviors an animal has that help it survive in its environment. A deer's hooves are an adaptation that helps it move quickly on different types of ground.\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to the hoofprints: \"This animal left hooves-shaped tracks. The soft soil was perfect for preserving this evidence. What can we figure out from these tracks?\"\n   - \"If this animal has hooves, it's probably a deer, elk, or similar plant-eater. The plants all around these tracks are what this animal was probably looking for.\"\n   - \"The animal's nose helped it smell the plants. Its eyes helped it see them. Its hooves helped it walk to them without slipping. All of these external structures work together to help it survive.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can anyone point to an external structure on this animal's feet that helps it survive?\" (hooves)\n   - \"Why would an animal that eats only plants need to be able to walk on soft, muddy ground?\" (so it can reach plants growing in many different places)\n   - \"If we found tracks like these near a forest, what would that tell us about what the animal was doing there?\" (looking for plants to eat, using its senses to find food)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that external structures (hooves, feet, etc.) have specific functions related to survival.\n- They can connect tracks to the animal that made them and understand tracks as evidence of behavior.\n- They recognize that animals use multiple senses to locate food and survive.\n- They see the relationship between body parts, habitat, and survival needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by analyzing animal tracks in a new context and making predictions about animal survival strategies.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Mystery track images (printed photos of various animal tracks: squirrel, rabbit, bear, bird, dog, cat, raccoon)\n- Field guide pages or images showing different animals and their habitats\n- \"Detective Report\" worksheet with the following sections:\n  * Picture of track (or student draws it)\n  * What animal made this track?\n  * What external structures do you see in the track?\n  * Why would this structure help the animal survive?\n  * What senses might the animal have used to reach this spot?\n  * What was the animal probably doing here?\n- Markers and colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Mystery Track Challenge (12 minutes):**\n   - Present students with 3-4 \"mystery tracks\" (different from those studied in Explore).\n   - Working in pairs or small groups, students:\n     * Identify which animal likely made the track (using prior knowledge and visual clues).\n     * Look at the track shape and identify external structures (claws, pads, webbing, etc.).\n     * Make a claim: \"This structure helps this animal survive because...\"\n     * Predict what senses the animal used to get to this location (smell, sight, hearing).\n     * Make an argument about what the animal was probably doing when it made this track.\n\n2. **Share and Defend Reasoning (8 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their \"detective reports.\"\n   - Encourage other students to ask questions: \"Why do you think the claws in this track help the animal? What survival situation would need claws?\"\n   - Facilitate discussion connecting tracks to sensory information: \"If this animal is a raccoon that eats small animals, how would it use its senses to find food?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group work by asking guiding questions rather than providing answers.\n- Encourage evidence-based reasoning: \"What clues in the track support your idea?\"\n- Help students make connections: \"How is this track similar to or different from the hoofprints in our original photo?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding to new animal tracks.\n- They explain how external structures support specific survival behaviors.\n- They make evidence-based arguments connecting body structures to sensory information gathering.\n- They demonstrate deeper understanding by predicting animal behavior from tracks.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of external structures, their survival functions, and how animals use senses to survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observe student discussions and reasoning during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Review observation sheets and detective reports for evidence of understanding.\n- Listen for use of vocabulary (external structures, hooves, tracks, sensory information) in student explanations.\n- Look for students who can connect body structures to survival needs and sensory information use.\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment:**\n\nGive each student an exit ticket with the following three prompts (they can draw and/or write):\n\n1. **Show Your Thinking:** \"Draw or describe an animal's external structure (like a hoof, claw, or foot) that helps it survive. Label the part.\"\n\n2. **Explain the Connection:** \"How does this structure help the animal survive? Use the words 'external structure' and 'survive' in your answer.\"\n\n3. **Describe Sensory Response:** \"If this animal was in the grassy area from our photo, what senses (eyes, ears, nose, etc.) would it use to find food? How would it respond to what it found?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student can identify and draw/name at least one external animal structure.\n- Student explains how that structure supports survival (not just naming it, but explaining function).\n- Student connects sensory information to animal behavior or survival response.\n- Student uses appropriate vocabulary (external structure, survive, senses, or similar terms) accurately.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will demonstrate understanding that animals' external structures have specific functions related to survival.\n- Students will show ability to connect tracks to animal behavior and sensory information gathering.\n- Advanced students will make sophisticated connections between body structure, habitat, and sensory strategy.\n- Struggling students may need prompts to move beyond description to explanation of function.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary and Visuals:** Provide picture cards of animal feet alongside the vocabulary words. Allow students to match pictures to structures during the Explain phase. Use shorter, simpler definitions: \"A hoof is a hard foot that helps animals walk.\"\n\n2. **Guided Observation Sheets:** Create observation sheets with fill-in-the-blank prompts instead of open-ended questions:\n   - \"This animal's foot is shaped like a ______.\"\n   - \"This shape helps it ______ (walk/run/climb).\"\n   - Students can draw or point to pictures to complete these.\n\n3. **Partner with Stronger Peers:** During Elaborate, pair students with struggling comprehension with students who are more confident. Assign the struggling learner a specific role, like \"Picture Drawer\" or \"Predictor.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deep Dive into Adaptation:** Ask advanced students to research a specific animal's track and prepare a \"fact card\" explaining how multiple external structures work together for survival (e.g., hooves + leg length + body weight = ability to travel long distances to find food). Have them present findings to peers.\n\n2. **Design Challenge:** \"Design a new animal foot for a habitat we haven't studied (e.g., rocky mountains, swamp, desert sand). What external structures would it need? Why?\" Students sketch their design and write an explanation of how each feature supports survival.\n\n3. **Track Analysis:** Provide students with a photograph showing multiple overlapping tracks from different animals. Challenge them to:\n   - Identify how many animals passed through\n   - Determine in what order they likely came (which tracks are on top)\n   - Hypothesize what each animal was doing or searching for\n   - Write a \"story\" of the animal interactions at this location based on track evidence\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom Track Collection:** Assign students to be \"Track Detectives\" at home or in their neighborhood for one week. They collect photos of animal tracks (in mud, snow, sand, or chalk on pavement) and bring them to school. Create a class \"Track Identification Guide\" with student-contributed photos, labeled with the animal name, external structures visible, and the habitat where the track was found. Display in the classroom and share with another grade.\n\n2. **Sensory Scavenger Hunt:** Set up a sensory exploration station outdoors or in a safe outdoor space. Hide items that represent what herbivores search for (plants, seeds, water, herbs) in different locations. Blindfold students or have them work with eyes closed, using only their sense of smell to locate the items. Afterward, discuss how animals like deer use their senses to find food and survive, and how their external structures (powerful legs) help them travel to reach these food sources.\n\n3. **Animal Feet Art and Anatomy Project:** Students create a large poster or 3D model of one herbivore's foot, labeling all external structures and writing beside each structure how it helps the animal survive. Include information about what senses the animal uses to find food and how its feet help it reach that food. Hang posters in the hallway or create a \"Gallery Walk\" where students read each other's work.\n\n---",
