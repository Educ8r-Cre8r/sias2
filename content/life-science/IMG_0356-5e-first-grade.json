Identify and name the main external parts of a bean plant (seed, stem, leaves, roots, seed pod).\n2. Describe what a plant needs to grow (water, sunlight, soil, and time).\n3. Explain that a bean seed grows into a bean plant that makes new seeds.\n4. Observe and record changes in a growing plant over time.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the bean plant at multiple life stages\n- White paper towels or poster board for display\n- Optional: A real dried bean seed to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or show a large, clear print of the photograph on a document camera or screen. Place the image where all students can see it comfortably.\n\n2. **Introduce with Wonder:** Say: \"Look at this picture carefully. A scientist found this bean plant, and it looks very different in different parts of the photo. Today, we're going to become plant detectives and figure out what's happening!\"\n\n3. **Discussion Questions** (Ask one at a time, allow 1–2 minutes for responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me everything you notice.\" *(Expect: leaves, stem, roots, seeds, dried parts.)*\n   - \"Do you see something that looks small at the start? Can you point to something that looks big?\" *(Activate prior knowledge about growth and size.)*\n   - \"If I told you all of these parts came from one seed, would you believe me? Why or why not?\" *(Invite skepticism and curiosity.)*\n   - \"What do you think happens to a bean plant when it gets old?\" *(Prompt thinking about plant life cycles.)*\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what this bean plant needed to grow so big from a tiny seed. What could help a seed become a plant?\" Write student ideas on chart paper (don't correct—just record).\n\n**Transition:** \"Great wondering! Let's become plant scientists and grow our own bean plants to watch the changes happen. Then we'll understand the mystery in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- One dry bean seed (kidney bean or pinto bean—large enough to observe)\n- One clear plastic cup or small jar\n- Potting soil or garden soil\n- Water in a spray bottle or small pitcher\n- Paper towel or newspaper (for catching spills)\n- A sunny windowsill or grow light location\n- Optional: Magnifying glasses (1 per student or pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Teacher Setup (5 minutes before students begin):**\nPrepare a planting station with all materials organized in labeled containers. Demonstrate the activity with one student helper so others see the steps.\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and act out):**\n\n1. \"Carefully look at your dry bean seed. Use a magnifying glass if you have one. What do you notice? Draw or write what you see on your paper.\" *(Record: size, color, shape, texture.)*\n\n2. \"Fill your cup about three-quarters full with soil. Pat it down gently—not too hard.\"\n\n3. \"Make a small hole in the soil with your finger, about as deep as your thumb.\" *(Demonstrate with your thumb.)*\n\n4. \"Drop your bean seed into the hole. Gently cover it with soil.\"\n\n5. \"Spray or pour a little water on the soil until it feels damp—like a wrung-out sponge. Not soaking wet!\"\n\n6. \"Put your cup in a sunny spot. We'll take care of it together every day.\"\n\n7. \"Draw a picture of what you planted. Write the date on your paper.\"\n\n**How This Connects to the Photograph:**\n\"The bean plant in our photograph started as a tiny seed just like yours. We're going to watch our seeds do what the plant in the picture already did—grow and change!\"\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- A drawing of the dry seed (before planting)\n- A drawing of the planted seed in the cup\n- The date\n- Observations about what the seed looks and feels like\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each student; assist with hole-making and water amount\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What does your seed feel like? Is it hard or soft? What color is it?\"\n- Do NOT tell students what will happen next—let them wonder\n- Ensure all cups are labeled with student names and placed in a safe, consistently sunny location\n- Assign a rotating \"Plant Watchers\" job chart for watering and observing daily\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each student has planted a bean seed in a labeled cup\n- Students have recorded baseline observations (drawings and descriptions of the dry seed)\n- Students are curious about what will happen next and check on their plants eagerly\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the bean plant (displayed again)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The bean plants students just planted (visible in the room)\n- Optional: A real seedling or sprouted bean seed (brought in advance) to show the next stage\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Gather students in a circle where they can see the photograph and their planted cups\n   - Ask: \"What did you notice about your seed? What did it feel like? What did it look like?\"\n   - Record student observations on chart paper (normalize all responses)\n\n2. **Direct Instruction with Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph and explain: \"This picture shows a plant at *different times* in its life. At the very beginning, there was a tiny seed—just like yours. Then it grew into a baby plant, then a bigger plant. Then it made new seeds. This is called a **life cycle**.\"\n   - Use the photograph to teach vocabulary. Point to each part and name it:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Seed** | A tiny package that holds a baby plant and food to help it start growing. |\n| **Stem** | The green part of the plant that holds up the leaves and carries water from the roots. |\n| **Leaf/Leaves** | Flat, green parts of the plant that catch sunlight and help the plant make food. |\n| **Roots** | The parts of the plant that grow under the soil and drink water to help the plant grow. |\n| **Seed Pod** | A case that grows on the plant and holds new seeds inside. |\n| **Life Cycle** | All the changes a plant goes through, from a tiny seed to a big plant that makes new seeds. |\n\n3. **Connection Back to Photo and Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the green seedling part of the photo: \"Look! That's what your seed will do soon. These are called **cotyledons**, or seed leaves. They're the first leaves that come out. In our picture, you can see them here [point]. That's the baby plant starting to grow!\"\n   - Point to the dried, branchy part: \"And this [point] is what happens when the plant gets really old. It made seed pods to hold new seeds, just like the seed you planted will do someday.\"\n   - Say: \"Your seed is starting its life cycle right now, just like the plant in this picture did!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What do we call the tiny package that starts the plant? Yes—a seed!\"\n   - Ask: \"What does a plant need to grow?\" *(Expected: water, soil, sunlight, time.)*\n   - Ask students to point to or name a plant part in the photo\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least 3 plant parts (seed, stem, leaf, root, or pod)\n- Students understand that seeds grow into plants and plants make new seeds\n- Students recognize the connection between their planted seed and the stages shown in the photograph\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster board or chart paper\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Picture cards or printed images of plant life cycle stages (optional; can draw)\n- Magazines for cutting (optional)\n- Glue sticks and scissors (if using collage method)\n- Students' recorded observations from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Life Cycle Sequencing and Drawing (Recommended for most First Graders)**\n\n1. Give each student or pair a large piece of paper folded into 4 boxes\n2. Label boxes: \"1. Seed,\" \"2. Sprout,\" \"3. Growing Plant,\" \"4. Plant with Seeds\"\n3. Students draw or paste pictures to show the life cycle of a bean plant in order\n4. Students use vocabulary from the Explain phase to label their drawings\n5. Encourage students to reference the photograph and their planted seeds\n\n**Option B: Plant Needs Diagram (For students ready for more challenge)**\n\n1. Draw a simple bean plant on chart paper\n2. Around it, draw symbols or pictures for what the plant needs: sun, water, soil, air, time\n3. Students color and label the diagram\n4. Each student takes home a copy to remind them what their plant needs\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"What comes first in the life cycle?\" and \"What does your plant need to do this?\"\n- Help students use sequence words: *first*, *next*, *then*, *last*\n- Prompt with the photograph if students get stuck: \"Look at our photo. What do you see happening here?\"\n- Accept approximations in drawing—focus is on sequencing and understanding, not artistic accuracy\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce a 4-stage life cycle representation\n- Students can verbally explain the sequence of plant growth\n- Students demonstrate understanding that plants grow from seeds and make new seeds\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant life cycles and growth needs.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing during lesson):**\n- Observe student drawings and labels during Elaborate phase\n- Listen to explanations when students describe their planted seed\n- Use questioning: \"Can you show me the seed in the photo? The leaves? Where will the roots grow?\"\n- Review recorded observations from Explore phase for evidence of careful observation\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5–7 minutes):**\n\nChoose one of the following based on your students' literacy level:\n\n**Option 1: Draw and Label (No writing required)**\n- Give each student a half-sheet of paper\n- Prompt: \"Draw a plant at the beginning of its life cycle and at the end. Label: seed, plant, and new seeds.\"\n- Success Criteria: \n  - Student shows a seed at the start\n  - Student shows a plant in the middle\n  - Student shows seeds at the end\n  - At least 2 labels are present\n\n**Option 2: Respond to Prompts (Teacher reads aloud)**\nAsk each student (individually or small group) and record responses:\n1. \"Show me the seed in this picture [point to photograph]. What is it?\"\n2. \"What does a seed need to grow into a plant? Name one thing.\"\n3. \"When your bean plant grows up, what will it make?\" (Expected: seeds, seed pods, new plants)\n4. \"Is your planted seed alive? How do you know?\" (Expected: it will grow, it needs water and sunlight, etc.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student correctly identifies a seed in the photo\n- Student names at least one plant need (water, sunlight, soil)\n- Student understands that seeds grow into plants\n- Student recognizes that grown plants make new seeds\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most First Graders will demonstrate understanding that:\n  - Seeds are the starting point of plant life cycles\n  - Plants need water, sunlight, and soil to grow\n  - Plants grow and change over time\n  - Mature plants produce new seeds\n- Students will show curiosity about their planted beans and check on them daily\n- Students will connect the photograph to their own growing plant over the following weeks\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Focus:** Concentrate on only 3 key terms instead of 6: *seed*, *plant*, *leaves*. Use consistent hand motions or picture cards for each term to support memory.\n\n2. **Buddy Planting:** Pair each student with a peer buddy or pair with you. The buddy can help with soil, water, and recording observations. This reduces frustration and keeps engagement high.\n\n3. **Repeat the Photo Conversation:** Before Explain phase, show the photograph again and ask the same 2–3 questions: \"What do you see? Is this a big plant or a small plant? Where did it start?\" Repetition reinforces concepts.\n\n4. **Provide a Model Drawing:** Show a simple, labeled example of a 4-stage life cycle during Elaborate. Students can copy your model or add their own details. This scaffolds understanding without lowering expectations.\n\n5. **Oral Responses Only for Exit Ticket:** Allow students to respond to evaluation questions verbally rather than drawing, if drawing is a barrier. Record their responses yourself.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Compare Life Cycles:** Provide picture cards of different plant types (tomato, sunflower, pea, apple tree). Ask: \"How is this plant's life cycle like the bean plant? How is it different?\" Students can create a comparison chart.\n\n2. **Predict Timelines:** Ask: \"How long do you think it takes for a bean seed to grow into a plant that makes new seeds?\" Students make a prediction and keep a daily observation log, counting how many days until they see the first sprout, then the first true leaves, etc.\n\n3. **Research Plant Needs Experiment:** Set up a simple experiment with 2–3 bean plants in different conditions (one with water and sun, one with water only, one with sun only—ensure safety). Over 2–3 weeks, compare growth. Students predict and record results.\n\n4. **Write Plant Care Instructions:** Advanced students can write or dictate a set of care instructions for a classmate's plant: \"My plant needs ___. You should do ___ every day. If you do this, the plant will ___.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Ongoing Observation Journal (Weeks 2–6):**\n   - Students sketch their bean plant weekly in a journal\n   - Record observations: \"This week, my plant is ___ cm tall. I see ___.\"\n   - Create a graph showing plant height over time (introduce data collection informally)\n   - This extends the lesson across several weeks and deepens understanding of growth and change\n\n2. **Bean Plant Lifecycle Poster Gallery Walk:**\n   - Students display their 4-stage life cycle drawings (from Elaborate) around the room\n   - Conduct a \"gallery walk\" where students view each other's work\n   - Ask: \"Which drawings show the same thing? What's different about each one?\"\n   - This builds community, celebrates learning, and allows peer teaching\n\n3. **Seed Dissection and Discovery (Real Seeds):**\n   - After 1–2 weeks, when sprouting is visible, dissect a sprouted bean seed with magnifying glasses\n   - Identify the seed coat, cotyledon (seed leaf), root, and shoot (baby stem)\n   - Compare to a dry seed: \"What changed? Why did it need water?\"\n   - This activity deepens understanding of internal plant structures and why seeds need water\n\n4. **Harvest and Replant Project (Weeks 8–12):**\n   - If time allows, let plants mature until they flower and produce new seed pods\n   - Harvest the dried seed pods together\n   - Open them and count the seeds: \"How many new seeds did your plant make? What will you do with them?\"\n   - Students can plant new seeds again, completing the full cycle and reinforcing the concept\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Implementation Tips\n\n- **Timing:** Seeds typically sprout in 5–7 days. Schedule the lesson 2–3 days into growth if possible so students see visible change during the next follow-up session. Otherwise, expect the \"sprout phase\" to occur during the week following the lesson.\n- **Safe Material Handling:** Bean seeds are safe; verify no allergies before handling. Soil should be clean potting soil to avoid mold or pests.\n- **Consistency:** Assign a rotating watering schedule (2 students per day) to keep plants alive and maintain engagement.\n- **Connection to Real World:** Mention that beans and other seeds people eat (peas, corn, sunflowers) follow the same life cycle. \"Your apple came from a tree that started as a seed!\"\n- **Growth Mindset:** Normalize that some plants won't survive. If a plant dies, say: \"This seed tried its best, but it didn't get what it needed. What might we change next time?\"\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is designed to be reusable, year after year, with real growing plants that students can observe and nurture. The photograph serves as both the inspiration and the proof that their small seed will become something remarkable.",
