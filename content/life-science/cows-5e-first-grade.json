ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (or projected image) of cows in the pasture\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Picture cards of cow body parts (optional: pre-drawn or printed images of cow eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hooves, tail)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Display and Introduction:**\nDisplay the photograph prominently where all students can see. Say: \"Today we're going on a farm adventure! Look at this picture. What do you see?\"\n\n**Discussion Questions (Ask one at a time; allow 30-45 seconds for thinking and sharing):**\n1. \"What animals do you see in this picture? Have you ever seen a cow before? Where?\"\n2. \"Why do you think the cows are in this big grassy field? What do they need here?\"\n3. \"Look at the cows' bodies. What parts can you name? Point to a body part on a cow in the picture.\" (Guide students to notice: head, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, legs, hooves, tail, body)\n4. \"Do you see a baby cow in this picture? How is it like the big cows? How is it different?\"\n\n**Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n\"If you were a cow, how would you use your body parts to eat, walk, and stay safe? Let's be detectives and find out!\"\n\n**Transition:**\n\"Now we're going to explore how cows use their amazing bodies to live on a farm.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper labeled \"Cow Body Parts Help Cows Survive\"\n- Markers (multiple colors)\n- Picture cards or drawings of cows (one per pair/small group of students)\n- Optional: **\"Cow Parts Hunt\"** cards with body part names (EYES, EARS, NOSE, MOUTH, LEGS, HOOVES, TAIL)\n- The farm photograph (still visible)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **\"Look carefully at the photograph again.\"** Display the image. Ask: \"What body parts do you see on the cows?\"\n\n2. **\"Work in small groups or pairs.\"** Distribute one labeled diagram or picture of a cow per pair. (If unavailable, draw a simple cow shape on chart paper while students watch.)\n\n3. **\"Find and circle (or point to) each body part I name.\"** Call out slowly:\n   - \"Circle the EYES. Why do cows need eyes?\" (Students respond: to see)\n   - \"Circle the EARS. What do ears do?\" (to hear)\n   - \"Circle the NOSE. Why does a cow need a nose?\" (to smell)\n   - \"Circle the MOUTH. What does a cow use its mouth for?\" (to eat, to drink)\n   - \"Circle the LEGS and HOOVES. What do these do?\" (to walk, to run, to stand)\n   - \"Circle the TAIL. What might a tail do?\" (Students may say: swat flies, show feelings)\n\n4. **\"Draw or write about one body part.\"** Give each student/pair a blank paper. Say: \"Pick ONE body part you learned about. Draw the body part. Draw what the cow does with it. You can write or tell me about it.\"\n\n5. **\"Share your discovery.\"** Have students hold up their drawings and tell one sentence: \"My cow uses its ____ to ____.\"\n\n**How It Connects to the Photograph:**\nStudents physically identify body parts they see in the real image, making the connection concrete and observable.\n\n**What Students Should Record or Document:**\n- Circled or labeled body parts on their diagram\n- A simple drawing showing a cow using one body part\n- Oral or written sentence about the body part's function\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and listen to students' ideas without correcting them yet\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"Tell me more. How does the cow use that part?\"\n- Encourage students to point to the photograph for evidence\n- Provide sentence frames if needed: \"The cow uses its ____ to ____.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 3-5 major cow body parts correctly\n- Students can explain in simple terms what each part does\n- Students recognize connections between body structure and survival need (e.g., mouth = eating)\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with pre-drawn simple cow outline\n- Markers\n- Large picture of a cow (or continued use of the farm photograph)\n- Optional: Body part labels on sentence strips (EYES, EARS, NOSE, MOUTH, LEGS, HOOVES, TAIL)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\nGather students. Say: \"Let's share what we discovered! Who found an interesting body part?\" Call on 3-4 volunteers to share their drawings and explain their body part. As they share, write or draw their ideas on the chart paper cow outline.\n\n**Key Vocabulary Introduction:**\nIntroduce 4-5 terms with First Grade-friendly definitions. Post vocabulary with simple drawings or pictures:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n1. **Body Parts** = All the different pieces that make up an animal's body (head, legs, tail, etc.)\n2. **Survive** = To stay alive and healthy\n3. **Habitat** = A place where an animal lives that has everything it needs (food, water, shelter, space)\n4. **Grazing** = When an animal eats grass or plants\n5. **Offspring** = A baby animal; a young animal that looks like its mother or father\n\n**Connections Back to the Photograph:**\nPoint to the photograph. Say:\n- \"These cows use their MOUTHS to GRAZE—to eat grass in this pasture. The pasture is their HABITAT. It has grass, water from rain, trees for shade, and lots of space.\"\n- \"See the baby cow (calf) next to the mother? The baby looks like the mother—same shape, same kind of color. That baby is the OFFSPRING. Parents teach their babies how to survive.\"\n- \"The cows' BODY PARTS help them SURVIVE here. Strong LEGS for walking to food. Sharp HOOVES for standing on muddy ground. A good NOSE for smelling water.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\nAsk these yes/no and open-ended questions:\n- \"Do cows use their mouths to graze?\" (Yes)\n- \"What does 'habitat' mean? Can you point to the cows' habitat in this picture?\" (Students point to pasture)\n- \"Show me with your body how a cow walks on its hooves.\" (Students demonstrate)\n- \"Which body part helps a cow see where to find food?\" (Eyes)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name 3-4 body parts and their functions\n- Students understand that animals need habitats with food, water, and shelter\n- Students recognize that baby animals look like their parents\n- Students use vocabulary in simple sentences (with support)\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding in a new context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Role-play props (optional but recommended):\n  - Green paper or felt (to represent grass)\n  - Blue paper or cup (to represent water)\n  - Brown paper or block (to represent shelter/barn)\n  - Picture cards of cows and calves\n  - Chart paper labeled \"What Cows Need to Survive\"\n- OR: \"Cow Survival Needs\" worksheet (simple matching or picture sort)\n\n**Activity (Choose One):**\n\n**Option A: Role-Play \"Build a Farm for Cows\" (Recommended for high engagement)**\n\n1. **Set the stage:** Say, \"Now we're going to help a farmer build a farm to keep cows healthy! Cows need four things to survive: FOOD (grass), WATER, SHELTER (a place to rest and be safe), and SPACE (a big area to move around). Let's put them in the right places!\"\n\n2. **Arrange the habitat:** \n   - Clear a space on the floor or table\n   - Give groups of 3-4 students materials: green paper (grass), blue cup (water), brown block (shelter), and picture cards of cows\n   - Say: \"Work together to arrange these things so a cow can survive. Put the grass where the cow can eat it. Put the water nearby. Put the shelter where the cow can rest. Give the cow space to move.\"\n\n3. **Students arrange and explain:** As they build, ask: \"Why did you put the water there? Can the cow reach the food? Where is the shelter?\"\n\n4. **Compare to the photograph:** Display the farm photo again. Say: \"Look—the real farm has all four things! See the grass? The water comes from rain. The trees are shelter. And look how much space the cows have to walk and run!\"\n\n**Option B: Picture Sorting Activity (If time/materials are limited)**\n\n1. Provide students with picture cards showing:\n   - Cows eating grass\n   - Cows drinking water\n   - Cows resting under trees\n   - Cows walking in open space\n\n2. Ask: \"Which picture shows cows getting FOOD? Which shows WATER? Which shows SHELTER? Which shows SPACE?\"\n\n3. Students sort and glue/draw on a \"Cow Needs\" chart.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate small group collaboration\n- Ask probing questions: \"What would happen if the cow had no water?\" \"Would the cow be happy without shelter?\"\n- Encourage students to think about their own needs as parallels: \"You need food, water, rest, and space too!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify all four survival needs (food, water, shelter, space)\n- Students understand that habitats provide these needs\n- Students can explain why each need is important in simple terms\n- Students recognize the farm in the photograph meets cow needs\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of learning objectives.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe participation during Engage discussion (students naming body parts, predicting)\n- Listen during Explore small group work (students explaining body part functions)\n- Monitor during Explain vocabulary check (students answering yes/no and open-ended questions)\n- Watch Elaborate role-play or sorting (students identifying survival needs)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (Choose One):**\n\n**Option A: Oral Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\nAsk each student these three questions as they line up or prepare to leave:\n1. \"Show me a body part on a cow and tell me what it does.\" (Point to picture or demonstrate)\n2. \"What does a cow eat? How does it get food?\" (Expects: grass; uses mouth/grazing)\n3. \"What do cows need to survive? Can you name two things?\" (Expects: food, water, shelter, space)\n\n**Option B: Picture-Based Exit Ticket (If group administration)**\nShow students the farm photograph one final time and ask:\n- \"Point to where the cow gets food.\" (grass)\n- \"Point to where the cow might drink water.\" (field, or infer from rain)\n- \"Where does the cow rest and stay safe?\" (near trees/shelter)\n- \"Does this place give the cow everything it needs to survive? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Option C: Draw and Label Exit Ticket**\nGive each student a half-page with a simple cow outline. Say: \"Draw or label THREE body parts that help the cow survive. Write or tell me what each part does.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✅ **Developing:** Student names 1-2 body parts and can explain one function; identifies 1-2 survival needs\n- ✅ **Proficient:** Student names 3-4 body parts with accurate functions; identifies 3-4 survival needs; makes simple connections (e.g., \"The cow eats grass in the field\")\n- ✅ **Advanced:** Student names 5+ body parts with detailed explanations; explains all four survival needs; makes complex connections (e.g., \"The cow uses its strong legs to walk far to find water,\" or \"Baby cows learn from their mothers how to find food\")\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Evidence to Look For |\n|---|---|\n| Identify and name 3 cow body parts + functions | Students correctly label eyes, ears, mouth, legs, hooves; explain that eyes see, mouth eats, legs walk, etc. |\n| Describe 2 ways cows use body parts to survive | Students explain: \"The cow uses its mouth to eat grass\" and \"The cow uses its legs to walk to water\" (or similar) |\n| Compare baby cows to mother cows | Students note: \"The calf looks like the mother cow\" or \"The baby is smaller but has the same shape\" |\n| Explain why cows need food, water, shelter, space | Students identify each on the farm photo or in their habitat creation; explain why (e.g., \"Cows need water to drink to stay healthy\") |\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce body part vocabulary:** Focus on just 3 major parts (mouth, legs, eyes) instead of 5-6. Use repetition and multi-sensory learning: \"Point to your mouth. Point to the cow's mouth. Cows use mouths to EAT.\" (Repeat with actions.)\n\n2. **Provide pre-drawn diagrams with labels:** Instead of asking students to identify body parts on blank diagrams, give them pre-labeled images so they can focus on function. Ask: \"The cow's mouth is for ___? (eating/grazing)\" and provide 2-3 visual choices.\n\n3. **Pair with peer mentor or adult:** During Explore activities, pair struggling learners with a fluent peer or assign brief one-on-one check-ins. Model the explanation: \"I see the cow's nose. Noses help cows SMELL. Can you tell me what the nose does?\" Then have the student repeat or point.\n\n4. **Use visual sentence frames:** Post frames like:\n   - \"The cow uses its _____ to _____.\"\n   - \"Cows need _____ to survive.\"\n   - \"The baby cow is like the mother cow because _____.\"\n   Students can point to or copy the frame to respond.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper observation of young vs. adult cows:** Have advanced students compare specific features in the photograph: \"How are the calves' legs different from the adult cows' legs? Why might they be different?\" Guide toward understanding that young animals are smaller and less developed but becoming like parents.\n\n2. **Research extensions:** Provide picture books or short videos about cow behavior (grazing habits, how calves learn from mothers, seasonal habitat changes). Ask: \"What behaviors do cows do to survive? How do mothers teach babies?\"\n\n3. **Problem-solving scenario:** Present a scenario: \"A cow's habitat is broken. There is no grass, the water dried up, and there is no shelter. What could the farmer do to help the cow survive?\" Students brainstorm solutions and draw or explain their ideas.\n\n4. **Create a detailed habitat diagram:** Have advanced students create a labeled diagram of a complete cow habitat showing where each survival need is found and how the cow accesses it (e.g., paths from grazing areas to water, shelter location, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Visit or Virtual Farm Tour (At-Home or Classroom Connection)**\n   - If possible, arrange a visit to a local farm or petting zoo to observe cows, calves, and their habitat firsthand. If not possible, watch a short, age-appropriate video of a working farm (many are available free on educational sites like National Geographic Kids or PBS Kids). Have students observe: Where do cows eat? Where do they drink? Where do they rest? What body parts do they use? Students can draw or discuss observations afterward and compare to the lesson photograph.\n\n2. **\"I Am a Cow\" Movement Activity**\n   - Play a game where students role-play as cows. Call out scenarios: \"Show me how a cow walks on its hooves!\" \"Show me how a cow uses its mouth to graze!\" \"Show me how a cow swings its tail to swat flies!\" Students demonstrate with their bodies. This reinforces body part function through kinesthetic learning and is a great indoor activity for rainy days.\n\n3. **Animal Body Parts Comparison Chart**\n   - Extend to other farm animals: Show pictures of a pig, horse, sheep, and chicken alongside the cow. Students compare: \"How are the cow's legs different from the horse's legs?\" \"Why might the chicken's feet be different from the cow's hooves?\" Create a simple chart: *Animal | Body Parts | What Helps It Survive*. This builds on the foundation to explore how different animals are adapted to different habitats.\n\n4. **Family Interview: \"What Do Animals Need?\"**\n   - Send home a simple worksheet asking: \"Ask a family member: What does a pet (or farm animal) need to survive?\" Students return with responses (e.g., \"My mom said our dog needs food, water, a bed, and playtime\"). Compare family answers to what cows need. This bridges home-to-school learning and validates family knowledge.\n\n5. **Sensory Exploration: Grass, Water, and Texture**\n   - Bring in real grass (or hay) and let students feel, smell, and observe it as the food cows eat. Pour water and talk about why it's necessary. Let students smell different grains or hay. This multi-sensory approach deepens understanding of the actual habitat conditions and animal needs beyond the photograph.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Pacing:** This lesson can be delivered across two 45-minute sessions (Engage + Explore on Day 1; Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2) or broken into five shorter 15-20 minute blocks throughout a week, depending on your schedule.\n- **Photograph usage:** Return to the farm photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. It is your primary teaching tool and evidence source for First Graders.\n- **Safety reminder:** If role-playing with students as \"cows,\" keep movements gentle and ensure adequate space to prevent collisions.\n- **Inclusive language:** Some First Graders may have limited experience with farms or animals. Use the photograph and descriptive language to make the experience accessible to all learners.\n- **Assessment tone:** Formative assessments should be conversational and low-pressure. First Graders learn best when they feel safe to share ideas, even if imperfect.",
