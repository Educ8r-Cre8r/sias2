Discovering Frog Superpowers!**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or one 90-minute block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 3-LS4-2 (Variations in characteristics provide advantages in surviving)\n  - 3-LS4-3 (Some organisms survive well in particular habitats; others cannot)\n  - 3-LS2-1 (Animals have unique body structures for survival)\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Identify** specific body parts of a tree frog (toe pads, eyes, skin) and explain how each part helps the frog survive on plants and trees.\n2. **Describe** how a tree frog's physical features are different from ground-dwelling frogs and why these differences matter for survival.\n3. **Explain** that tree frogs are well-suited to live in trees, while other animals might struggle in the same habitat.\n4. **Compare and contrast** how different types of frogs (tree frogs, ground frogs, water frogs) have different body structures suited to their habitats.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital photograph of the tree frog (enlarge or project)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Introduce:** Project or display the photograph of the green tree frog on a large leaf. Ask students to look carefully for 15 seconds without talking. Say: *\"This is a real frog. Look at where it is and how it's positioned.\"*\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (ask one at a time, allowing 30 seconds for thinking and sharing):**\n   - *\"What do you notice about this frog? Where is it sitting?\"* (Expected: It's on a leaf; it's green; it's small.)\n   - *\"How do you think this frog stays on the smooth, slippery leaf without falling off?\"* (Activate prior knowledge about how things grip or stick.)\n   - *\"What parts of the frog's body do you think help it hold onto the leaf?\"* (Guide observation toward feet, skin, eyes.)\n   - *\"Do you think all frogs live on plants and leaves, or do different frogs live in different places?\"* (Introduce habitat variation.)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Have students turn to a partner and complete this sentence: *\"I wonder why this frog's feet are different from my feet...\"* Collect 3-4 responses aloud and write them on chart paper under a heading: **\"Our Frog Questions.\"**\n\n**Transition:** *\"Great questions! Today we're going to become frog detectives and discover how this tree frog's body is specially designed to survive on leaves and trees.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Smooth leaves or thick paper cut into leaf shapes (one per student)\n- Small objects to represent \"frog feet\": \n  - Felt circles or foam stickers (with sticky dots on back)\n  - Velcro dots (hook side)\n  - Small rubber erasers\n  - Cotton balls\n- Tape (masking and clear)\n- Students' hands/fingers as a comparison tool\n- Investigation record sheets (template provided below)\n\n**Activity: \"Sticky Feet Challenge\"**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. *\"Look at your smooth leaf (or paper leaf). Try to make it stand up at an angle or hold it sideways. Can your fingers slide off? Try again.\"*\n\n2. *\"Now, let's test different 'frog feet.' Each pair will try three different materials to see which one sticks best to the leaf.\"*\n\n3. **Station 1 – Felt Circles:** *\"Stick the felt circle to your leaf using the sticky dot. Try to slide it. Does it grip the leaf? Does it stay in place? Record: Does it work? Yes or No.\"*\n\n4. **Station 2 – Velcro (hook side):** *\"Place the hook-side Velcro on the leaf. Does it catch the leaf surface? Try to slide it. Record your results.\"*\n\n5. **Station 3 – Rubber Eraser:** *\"Tape the rubber eraser to the leaf. Does it grip? Try rubbing it gently on the leaf to test the grip. Record your results.\"*\n\n6. *\"Which 'frog foot' worked best? Which material is most like what a real tree frog's feet might be? Draw or write your answer.\"*\n\n**Connection to Photograph:**\nShow students the tree frog's foot pads close up (if available) or describe them: *\"Real tree frogs have special toe pads that are sticky and grippy—kind of like the material that worked best in your experiment! That's how they stick to leaves without falling.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each station and ask guiding questions: *\"Why do you think this material works better? What is the surface like—smooth or bumpy? How is it different from your finger?\"*\n- Do **not** tell students which material is \"correct.\" Let them discover through testing.\n- Encourage students to handle materials and make observations aloud.\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Draw or check boxes for each material tested\n- Write or draw: \"This material works best because...\"\n- One sentence: \"This is like a tree frog's feet because...\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that sticky or grippy materials work better than smooth ones on smooth surfaces\n- Students begin to understand that special body structures help animals survive\n- Students generate evidence that foot pads need texture to grip leaves\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of tree frog (from Engage)\n- Enlarged diagram of frog body parts (optional)\n- Chart paper\n- Three pictures of different frogs (tree frog, bullfrog/pond frog, ground toad) printed or from reliable sources\n- Vocabulary cards with images\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 pairs: *\"Which material worked best? Why?\"* \n   - Validate observations: *\"You discovered that bumpy, sticky materials grip better than smooth ones. That's exactly how real tree frogs' feet work!\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n   \n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. *Example: A tree frog's sticky toe pads are adaptations that help it live on leaves.*\n   \n   - **Toe Pads (or Adhesive Discs):** Special, sticky, bumpy circles on a tree frog's toes that help it grip smooth leaves without falling. *Like tiny suction cups that stick to leaves!*\n   \n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. *A tree frog's habitat is in trees and on leaves in the rainforest.*\n   \n   - **Structural Adaptation:** A special body part that helps an animal survive. *Tree frogs' toe pads, large eyes, and green color are structural adaptations.*\n   \n   - **Survival:** Staying alive and healthy in your habitat. *A tree frog survives by using its sticky feet to stay safe on high leaves.*\n\n   **Display Strategy:** Write each vocabulary word on a card with a student-friendly definition AND a simple picture. Post on a \"Word Wall\" or keep visible throughout the lesson.\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Display the tree frog photo again.\n   - Point to specific body parts: *\"See these toe pads? They're bumpy and sticky—just like the felt material that worked best! See the large eyes? They help the frog see at night in the trees. See the green color? It helps the frog hide on green leaves. Every part helps it survive!\"*\n\n4. **Introduce Multiple Frog Types (2 minutes):**\n   - Show pictures of three different frogs side by side: tree frog, bullfrog (pond frog), and toad (ground frog).\n   - *\"All three are frogs, but look how different they are! The bullfrog has smooth skin and lives in ponds. The toad has bumpy skin and lives on the ground. The tree frog has sticky toe pads and lives in trees. Their bodies match their habitats!\"*\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If we put a tree frog in a desert, do you think it would survive? Why or why not?\"* (Students should reason: Tree frogs need trees, leaves, and water—deserts don't have these things.)\n   - Ask: *\"Could a bullfrog survive in a tree like our green frog? Why or why not?\"* (Guide thinking: Bullfrogs don't have sticky toe pads, so they'd fall.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that specific body parts (adaptations) help animals survive in specific places (habitats)\n- Students can name and describe at least 2-3 adaptations of tree frogs\n- Students begin to reason that different habitats require different adaptations\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of various animals (bird, lizard, fish, squirrel, snake, insect) and habitats (tree, pond, ground, sky)\n- Chart paper or individual paper\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- Optional: Picture books showing frogs in different habitats\n\n**Activity: \"Adaptation Match-Up and Survival Detective\"**\n\n**Part 1: Matching Game (8 minutes)**\n\n1. Display pictures of 3-4 different animals and 3-4 different habitats (mixed up).\n   - Animals: Tree frog, bullfrog, ground toad, tree squirrel\n   - Habitats: Tree with leaves, pond, forest floor, tree branches\n\n2. *\"Work with a partner. Match each animal to the habitat where it survives best. Then, tell me ONE body part that helps it live there.\"*\n\n3. Examples of expected responses:\n   - Tree frog → Tree with leaves → *\"It has sticky toe pads to hold on.\"*\n   - Bullfrog → Pond → *\"It has webbed feet for swimming.\"*\n   - Toad → Forest floor → *\"It has short, strong legs for hopping on ground.\"*\n\n4. Discuss as a class: *\"Why doesn't a bullfrog live in trees? Why can't a toad climb like a tree frog?\"* (Guide toward: They don't have the right body parts for those habitats.)\n\n**Part 2: \"Adaptation Story\" (7 minutes)**\n\n1. Present a scenario: *\"Imagine a baby tree frog is born. It needs sticky toe pads to survive. Why? Because it lives in trees and needs to hold onto leaves. If it didn't have sticky toe pads, what would happen?\"*\n\n2. Have students draw or write a short sentence answer:\n   - *\"If the tree frog didn't have sticky toe pads, it would...\"* (Expected: fall off; get hurt; not survive; not find food.)\n\n3. Ask: *\"Is this a fair reason to say that toe pads help a tree frog survive?\"* (Yes! This is evidence.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the matching game by asking: *\"What does this animal eat? Where would it find food? Does its body match that place?\"*\n- During the story activity, accept all reasonable answers and validate the reasoning.\n- Prompt deeper thinking: *\"How would that frog get food if it fell all the time? Could it hide from predators?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply adaptation concepts to new animals\n- Students provide reasoning for why certain body parts help survival\n- Students generate evidence-based explanations (even if simple)\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity: \"Frog Detective Assessment\"**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Observe whether students are testing materials systematically and recording results.\n- **During Explain:** Monitor responses to check-for-understanding questions (Can they explain why toe pads help survival? Can they describe a habitat?)\n- **During Elaborate:** Note whether students can match animals to habitats with reasoning.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes at end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet or digital form with these items:\n\n---\n\n**\"Frog Detective Challenge\" – Answer 3 questions:**\n\n**Question 1 (Multiple Choice):**\n*Why does a tree frog have sticky toe pads?*\nA) To make it pretty  \nB) To help it grip leaves and not fall  \nC) To help it swim faster  \nD) To help it hear better  \n\n**Expected Answer:** B\n\n---\n\n**Question 2 (Short Answer with Drawing):**\n*Draw a tree frog in its habitat (on a leaf or in a tree). Label ONE body part that helps it survive. Write one sentence explaining why that body part is important.*\n\n**Expected Student Response Example:**\n- Drawing shows frog on a leaf or branch\n- Labels toe pads (or eyes, green color)\n- Sentence like: *\"The toe pads help the frog stick to the leaf so it doesn't fall.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Question 3 (Reasoning):**\n*Can a bullfrog (pond frog) survive in a tree like a tree frog? Why or why not?*\n\n**Expected Student Response:**\n*No, because it doesn't have sticky toe pads. It would fall. Tree frogs are made for trees, not ponds.* (Or similar reasoning.)\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Students correctly identify 1-2 adaptations of tree frogs\n- ✓ Students explain (with words or pictures) how at least one adaptation helps survival\n- ✓ Students show reasoning that different habitats require different body structures\n- ✓ Students use evidence from the lesson (exploration, photograph, explanations)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly answer Question 1\n- Most students will provide drawings with labeled body parts and age-appropriate explanations\n- Most students will provide simple reasoning for Question 3 (e.g., *\"It would fall\"* or *\"It doesn't have sticky feet\"*)\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Sentence Starters:**\n   - Provide frames like: *\"This frog survives because it has ______.\"*\n   - Or: *\"This body part helps the frog ______.\"*\n   - These scaffold writing while maintaining the cognitive demand of reasoning.\n\n2. **Anchor Chart Reference:**\n   - Create and keep visible throughout all phases: A two-column chart with \"Frog Body Part\" and \"How It Helps Survival\" filled in with drawings and simple words. Students can reference this during activities.\n\n3. **Paired Exploration:**\n   - Pair struggling readers/writers with stronger students during the Explore phase so they can participate verbally and with hands-on materials while their partner records.\n\n4. **Simplified Exit Ticket:**\n   - Offer a choice: draw a picture showing the frog's sticky feet and how they help, OR answer the multiple-choice question only.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Comparative Adaptation Research:**\n   - Provide 2-3 pictures of different tree frog species (varying colors, sizes, toe pad sizes). Ask: *\"These are all tree frogs living in different parts of the rainforest. How are their adaptations different? Why might each adaptation work better in their specific location?\"*\n   - Have students write a short explanation or create a labeled comparison poster.\n\n2. **Life Cycle Extension:**\n   - Introduce the idea that tree frogs start as tadpoles in water (without toe pads). Ask: *\"What changes happen to a tadpole so it can become a tree frog? When do you think the sticky toe pads develop?\"*\n   - Have them sequence or draw the life cycle: egg → tadpole → tadpole with legs → young frog → adult frog.\n\n3. **Problem-Solving Scenario:**\n   - Present: *\"Imagine a scientist wants to create a frog that can survive both in a tree AND in water. What adaptations would it need? Draw or describe your frog and explain why each body part would help.\"*\n   - This encourages critical thinking about multiple adaptations for multiple habitats.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Habitat Explorer\" Classroom Project (for homework or follow-up lesson):**\n   - Send students home with a simple worksheet: *\"Find an animal that lives in a specific habitat (tree, backyard, park, etc.). Draw it. Label one adaptation. Bring it back to share.\"*\n   - Create a classroom \"Adaptation Gallery\" where students post their animals and explain their adaptations to classmates.\n   - This extends learning to local ecosystems and reinforces the adaptation concept.\n\n2. **\"Frog Life Cycle\" Dramatization and Writing:**\n   - Have students act out the life cycle of a tree frog: start as an egg (curled up), become a tadpole (wiggle and swim), grow legs, develop toe pads (reach up high), climb onto a leaf (become an adult).\n   - Then, have them write or draw the stages with one sentence for each: *\"I start as an egg in the water. Then I become a tadpole and swim. I grow legs. My toe pads grow. Now I climb trees!\"*\n   - This integrates 3-LS1-1 and reinforces the concept that adaptations develop over a frog's life.\n\n3. **\"Design Your Own Frog\" Creative Project (STEM Connection):**\n   - Challenge: *\"You're going to invent a new frog for a new habitat! Imagine a frog that needs to live on sandy desert ground (OR in a dark cave, OR on ice). What adaptations would it need? Draw your frog and label its special features. Explain why each feature helps it survive.\"*\n   - Students can use craft materials (clay, paper, markers) to build a 3D model with labels.\n   - This integrates creativity with deep understanding of adaptation principles and allows for differentiated complexity based on student choice of habitat.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Photograph Power:** Return to the tree frog photograph at least 3 times during the lesson. Each time, students will notice new details and make deeper connections.\n- **Real-World Connection:** If possible, show a brief video clip (30 seconds) of a tree frog climbing a leaf or tree in its natural habitat. This brings the concept to life.\n- **Vocabulary Persistence:** The term \"adaptation\" may be new. Use it repeatedly and pair it with visual examples. Don't worry if students don't use the term perfectly yet—understanding the concept matters most in Grade 3.\n- **Safe Exploration:** If considering a live animal visit, tree frogs are delicate. A photo-based lesson is engaging and science-appropriate without the stress of animal care.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is designed to be inquiry-driven, hands-on, and deeply rooted in observable evidence from the photograph. Students move from curiosity → exploration → explanation → application, building a robust understanding of how organisms are suited to their habitats.**",
