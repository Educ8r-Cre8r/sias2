ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about animal adaptations and activate prior knowledge about how animals' body parts help them survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital display of the green iguana photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Sticky notes (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a poster where all students can see it clearly. Do not provide any labels or identification yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to look closely** and respond to these discussion questions:\n   - \"What animal do you think this is, and what clues from its body help you guess?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this animal is so green? What might it need to hide from or hide in?\"\n   - \"Look at the scales covering its body. Why might scales be helpful to an animal instead of smooth skin?\"\n   - \"If you were this animal living in trees, what body parts would you need to survive and stay safe?\"\n\n3. **Collect student predictions and wonderings** on chart paper. Record answers without judgment—the goal is to activate thinking about how animal body parts (traits) match their needs.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder if all iguanas look exactly the same, or if some might be bigger, smaller, or have slightly different colors than others. Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"To explore these questions, we're going to become animal detectives and look closely at how this iguana's body is built for survival.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate visible traits on the iguana and discover how specific features help it survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Iguana photograph (printed copy for pairs or small groups, or displayed on screen)\n- Trait Investigation Worksheet (teacher-created, see below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Magnifying glasses (optional, to examine details in photo)\n- Chart paper for group observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Trait Hunt (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into pairs or small groups.** Provide each group with a printed or projected view of the iguana photograph.\n\n2. **Distribute the Trait Investigation Worksheet** with the following prompts:\n   - \"Draw or point to the iguana's scales. What do they look like? Why might they be useful?\"\n   - \"Look at the iguana's eye and head shape. What does this tell you about what it might see or do?\"\n   - \"Find the iguana's claws/feet. Why would these be important for a tree-climbing animal?\"\n   - \"Look at the iguana's coloring. Where would it hide best in nature? Why?\"\n   - \"The iguana has a long tail. Make a guess about what this tail helps it do.\"\n\n3. **Students record observations** through drawings, labels, or written descriptions (according to their writing ability).\n\n4. **Circulate as students work.** Ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n   - \"What do you notice about that part? Why do you think the iguana has that?\"\n   - \"How might that trait help the iguana in its habitat?\"\n\n**Part B: Group Share-Out (10 minutes)**\n\n5. **Gather the class.** Invite 2-3 groups to share one trait they observed and explain how it might help the iguana survive.\n\n6. **Record key traits on chart paper:**\n   - Scales (protection, water-resistant skin)\n   - Green color (camouflage in trees/leaves)\n   - Sharp claws (gripping branches)\n   - Long tail (balance, movement)\n   - Alert eyes (spotting danger and food)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Listen actively and validate all observations.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"How does that help the iguana stay alive?\"\n- Write student ideas verbatim to show their thinking is valued.\n- Guide without correcting—save formal explanations for the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 3-4 visible traits from the photograph.\n- Students make reasonable (though not always accurate) predictions about how each trait helps survival.\n- Students understand that an animal's body is \"built\" for its environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain how inherited traits give animals survival advantages.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with trait list from Explore phase\n- Picture cards of different iguana varieties (if available, or teacher-drawn sketches showing size/color variation)\n- Vocabulary cards with definitions\n- Trait-to-Survival matching activity (on board or paper)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Review the Explore findings.** Point to the chart paper with student observations and say: \"You found some amazing body parts! These are called **traits**—special features that help animals survive.\"\n\n2. **Introduce and define key vocabulary:**\n\n   | Vocabulary | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Trait** | A special body part or feature that an animal has, like color, size, or shape. |\n   | **Inherited** | Traits that a baby animal gets from its parents. Just like you might have your mom's eyes, baby iguanas inherit traits from their iguana parents. |\n   | **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. Scales are an adaptation for iguanas. |\n   | **Advantage** | Something that helps an animal do better than others. A green color gives an iguana an advantage because predators don't see it in trees. |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives, like a tree or forest. |\n\n3. **Explain connections to the photograph:**\n   - \"The iguana in this photo has green scales. Where did it get that trait? From its parents! Green iguanas have babies that are also green because being green helps them hide in trees—their habitat. This is an inherited trait.\"\n   - \"Not all iguanas are exactly the same green. Some might be darker or lighter. This variation helps different iguanas survive in different parts of the forest. An iguana that is darker green might hide better in shadowy branches, while a lighter green one might hide better in sunlight.\"\n   - \"The iguana's sharp claws are inherited too. Baby iguanas are born with tiny claws that grow bigger. These claws give the iguana an advantage—it can grip tree branches and climb safely.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to your partner and explain one trait we saw in the photo and why it helps the iguana survive.\"\n   - Listen to pair discussions and address misconceptions.\n   - Call on 2-3 pairs to share.\n\n5. **Matching Activity (5 minutes):** Display trait-to-benefit matches and have students repeat or confirm the connection:\n   - Scales → Protects skin, keeps water in\n   - Green color → Camouflage in trees (predators can't see it)\n   - Sharp claws → Climbing and gripping branches\n   - Long tail → Balance while moving in trees\n   - Good eyesight → Finds food and spots danger\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|---|---|\n| **Trait** | A special feature of an animal's body, like color, size, or shape. |\n| **Inherited** | Passed down from parents to babies. |\n| **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive. |\n| **Advantage** | Something that helps an animal do better or survive longer. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal naturally lives. |\n| **Variation** | Small differences between animals of the same kind. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that traits are body features.\n- Students connect inherited traits to survival advantages.\n- Students recognize that the iguana's traits match its tree-dwelling habitat.\n- Students use vocabulary (trait, inherited, adaptation, advantage) appropriately in short explanations.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by comparing how different traits suit animals to different habitats and predicting survival success.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or sketches of 3-4 different animals (e.g., white rabbit, brown deer, penguin, desert scorpion) OR descriptions of these animals\n- Habitat cards (forest, snow, desert, water)\n- Large paper for sorting activity\n- Trait Advantage Recording Sheet (teacher-created)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Application:**\n\n1. **Present the scenario:** \"Imagine we have three iguanas: one is very green, one is brownish-green, and one is bright yellow-green. They all live in different parts of the forest.\"\n\n2. **Ask students to predict:**\n   - \"Which iguana would survive best in a dark, shadowy part of the forest? Why?\"\n   - \"Which iguana might have an advantage in a sunlit area with yellow-green leaves?\"\n   - \"Why might all three iguanas still survive, even though they look a little different?\"\n\n3. **Guide discussion toward understanding variation:** \"Even though these iguanas look a little different, they are all iguanas with the same inherited traits from their families. The small differences—variation—mean that different iguanas do well in different parts of their habitat. This is actually helpful for iguanas as a group!\"\n\n**Comparative Habitat Activity (if time allows):**\n\n4. **Show images or drawings of 2-3 different animals** (e.g., a green iguana, a white arctic fox, a brown bear).\n\n5. **Ask:** \"How are these animals' traits different? Which traits help each one survive in *its* habitat?\"\n\n6. **Students complete a simple Trait-Habitat matching worksheet:**\n   - Animal: _____\n   - Habitat: _____\n   - Trait that helps it survive: _____\n   - Why that trait is an advantage there: _____\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask probing questions to deepen thinking: \"Could a bright yellow iguana survive in a dark forest? Why or why not?\"\n- Affirm connections students make between traits and habitats.\n- Encourage students to use new vocabulary.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students explain how variation in traits (different shades of green) still provides advantages.\n- Students compare how the same trait (color) helps different animals in different habitats.\n- Students understand that an animal's traits must match its habitat to survive well.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of inherited traits, variation, and survival advantages.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe pair and small-group discussions during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Listen for use of vocabulary: trait, inherited, advantage, habitat.\n- Note whether students connect body parts to survival functions (e.g., \"Claws help it climb\").\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (can be oral, drawn, or written based on ability) with one of these prompts:\n\n**Version A (Drawing + Verbal):**\n- \"Draw one trait of the iguana and tell me how it helps the iguana survive in trees.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student identifies a visible trait, draws or names it, and explains at least one survival function (e.g., \"claws for climbing,\" \"green color to hide\").\n\n**Version B (Short Response):**\n- \"Why is the iguana green? How does being green help it survive?\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student mentions hiding/camouflage and/or safety from predators; response shows understanding that color is an inherited trait that provides an advantage.\n\n**Version C (Comparative):**\n- \"If an iguana had blue scales instead of green scales, would it survive better or worse in a tree forest? Explain why.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student predicts \"worse\" and gives a reason related to camouflage or predator detection.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can name at least one iguana trait and explain how it helps survival.\n- 70% of students use vocabulary terms (trait, inherited, advantage, habitat) appropriately.\n- Students recognize that the iguana's body is well-suited to its tree habitat.\n- Students understand that traits are inherited from parents and provide survival advantages.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Provide a trait list with images.** Instead of finding traits independently, offer a visual checklist with labels pointing to claws, scales, eyes, color, and tail. Students circle or point to traits during Explore.\n\n2. **Use sentence frames for explanations.** Provide starter sentences like:\n   - \"The iguana's _____ helps it _____ in trees.\"\n   - \"This trait is an advantage because _____.\"\n   - \"The iguana inherited _____ from its parents.\"\n\n3. **Pair with a stronger reader/speaker.** During Explore and Elaborate, pair struggling students with classmates who can help record observations and discuss ideas aloud before writing.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate variation in detail.** Provide images of multiple iguana individuals (if available) and ask: \"How are these iguanas the same? How are they different? Why might these differences matter for survival?\" Students create a detailed comparison chart or written explanation.\n\n2. **Predict and justify environmental change scenarios.** Present scenarios like: \"If the forest became darker due to more clouds, which iguana color would have a better advantage? Explain.\" Students write or draw detailed predictions with evidence-based reasoning.\n\n3. **Extend to other species.** Ask: \"Find another animal that lives in trees like iguanas. What inherited traits does it have? Does it have any of the same traits as iguanas? Why?\" Students research and present findings to the class.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Iguana Life Cycle Model (3-LS1-1 Connection):**\n   - Students create a simple model (drawings, photos, or physical craft) showing the life stages of an iguana: egg, hatchling (baby), juvenile, adult.\n   - Include: \"What traits does a baby iguana inherit from its parents? Show what changes as it grows.\"\n   - This extends understanding to complete life cycles while reinforcing inherited traits.\n\n2. **Habitat Design Challenge:**\n   - Present the prompt: \"Design a habitat for a green iguana. What will you include to help it survive using its inherited traits?\"\n   - Students draw, build, or describe a habitat with trees, branches, leaves, etc.\n   - Reflection: \"How does each part of your habitat match up with the iguana's traits?\"\n   - This applies traits knowledge to real-world design and environmental needs (3-LS4-3).\n\n3. **Adaptation Investigation Booklet:**\n   - Students select 2-3 other animals and create a simple informational booklet with pages like:\n     - \"[Animal name] and Its Traits\"\n     - \"How [trait] helps [animal] survive\"\n     - \"Where [animal] lives and why its traits fit there\"\n   - This consolidates understanding of adaptation and variation across species (3-LS4-2, 3-LS4-3).\n\n---",
