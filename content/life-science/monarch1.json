The chrysalis is a beautiful jade green color with shiny gold dots that look like tiny jewels. It's attached to the twig by a small black stem called a cremaster. The smooth, waxy surface has a subtle pattern. Inside this protective case, something magical is happening - a caterpillar is transforming into a butterfly!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image captures metamorphosis - one of nature's most incredible transformations! Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar's body is completely reorganizing. Special cells called imaginal discs, which were dormant inside the caterpillar, are now growing into butterfly parts: wings, legs, antennae, and compound eyes. The caterpillar's tissues break down into a soup-like substance and rebuild into butterfly form. This process takes about 10-14 days. When the butterfly is almost ready, the chrysalis becomes transparent, and you can see the orange wings through the green shell!\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Metamorphosis**: The dramatic transformation from one life stage to another with completely different body forms.\n\n2. **Pupa/Chrysalis**: The third stage in complete metamorphosis where the caterpillar transforms into a butterfly (moths make cocoons; butterflies make chrysalises).\n\n3. **Complete Metamorphosis**: A four-stage life cycle: egg → larva (caterpillar) → pupa (chrysalis) → adult (butterfly).\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate a \"Chrysalis Watch\" observation journal! If you're raising Monarchs in class, have students predict when the butterfly will emerge based on chrysalis appearance.
