ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about where plants get what they need to grow by examining a real seedling photo.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the photograph (photograph of seedling in mulch)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: One small potted seedling to pass around (real object enhances engagement)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Ask students to take 30 seconds to observe quietly and notice details.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** (ask students to turn and talk to a partner first, then share out):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe the plant and everything around it.\"\n   - \"Why do you think this little green plant is surrounded by dark, chunky stuff? What might that be?\"\n   - \"If you were this seedling, what would you need to survive and get bigger? Where would those things come from?\"\n   - \"How do you think this tiny plant got its water? Do you think it drank it the way you drink from a cup?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what's happening underground that we can't see in this picture. What might the roots be doing?\" \n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper without correcting them. This activates prior knowledge and generates curiosity.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Let's do an investigation where we actually plant seeds ourselves and watch what happens when we give them water and soil—then we'll understand exactly what this seedling needed to grow.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant growth needs through a hands-on planting and observation activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- Clear plastic cups (9-12 oz)\n- Potting soil or garden soil\n- Fast-growing seeds (bean seeds, pea seeds, or radish seeds work best)\n- Water in small cups or spray bottles\n- Paper towels\n- Pencils for labeling\n- Observation sheet (see below)\n- Optional: magnifying glasses\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (Write on board or handout):**\n\n1. **Fill your cup** about three-quarters full with potting soil. Gently press the soil down.\n\n2. **Plant your seed** about 1 inch deep in the soil. You can plant 2-3 seeds per cup to be safe.\n\n3. **Water your soil carefully** until it is damp like a wrung-out sponge—not soaking wet. \n\n4. **Label your cup** with your name and today's date using a pencil.\n\n5. **Place your cup** in a location with good light (by a window is best).\n\n6. **Every day for the next week**, water your plant when the top of the soil feels dry to your touch, and record observations on your sheet:\n   - Did anything change above the soil?\n   - Did anything change below the soil (if you can see roots)?\n   - How much water did you give it?\n   - What does the soil look like and feel like?\n\n**Observation Sheet (to be completed daily for 5-7 days):**\n\n| Day | Date | Above Soil Changes | Below Soil (roots) | Water Added (yes/no) | Soil Appearance | Questions |\n|-----|------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| 1   |      |                    |                    |                      |                 |           |\n| 2   |      |                    |                    |                      |                 |           |\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What changed today?\" \"Why do you think the roots need water?\" \"What happens if you forget to water?\"\n- **Do not give answers**—help students observe and wonder.\n- Remind students that plant growth takes time; some changes may take several days to become visible.\n- Photograph student observations over time to show growth progression.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe seed germination (roots emerging downward, shoots growing upward).\n- Students identify that water is necessary for growth.\n- Students discover that soil holds water and provides a growing medium.\n- Students record observable changes in their plant over time.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce scientific vocabulary and explain the mechanisms of plant growth after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or document camera showing a student's seedling photo\n- Vocabulary cards (printed or drawn) showing: roots, shoots, seed coat, nutrients, germination\n- Diagram template (see below)\n- The original lesson photograph\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share one observation from their plants.\n   - Write key observations on chart paper: \"Seeds need water to grow,\" \"Roots grow down,\" \"Leaves grow up,\" \"Soil helps the plant.\"\n\n2. **Direct Instruction—Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   \n   Display each term and its student-friendly definition:\n\n   - **Seed:** A tiny plant with a protective coating that is ready to grow into a bigger plant when it gets water and warmth.\n   - **Roots:** The parts of a plant that grow down into the soil. Roots drink water and take in nutrients (food) from the soil to help the plant grow.\n   - **Shoots:** The parts of a plant that grow up above the soil, including the stem and leaves. Shoots use sunlight and air to make food for the plant.\n   - **Germination:** The process when a seed wakes up and starts to grow into a plant.\n   - **Nutrients:** Special materials in the soil that plants need to grow big and strong (like plant food).\n\n3. **Make Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Show the original photograph again. Point to the visible green leaves (shoots), the soil, and explain: \"The roots of THIS seedling are in the dark mulch, drinking water. The leaves are reaching up to catch sunlight. The dark stuff around it has nutrients broken down from dead leaves and wood—that's food for the plant.\"\n   - Compare student observations to the photograph: \"Just like in our cups, this seedling needed soil and water to grow these green leaves.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Turn to your neighbor and explain: Why do plants need their roots in soil?\" (Listen for: water, nutrients, support.)\n   - Ask: \"What would happen to a plant if you didn't water it?\" (Listen for: roots can't get water, plant can't grow.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Seed:** A tiny, protected plant ready to grow when conditions are right.\n- **Roots:** Underground plant parts that absorb water and nutrients from soil.\n- **Shoots:** Above-ground plant parts (stem and leaves) that grow toward sunlight.\n- **Germination:** The process of a seed beginning to grow.\n- **Nutrients:** Important minerals and materials in soil that help plants grow.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary correctly when describing their plant observations.\n- Students can explain that roots get water from soil and leaves get air and light.\n- Students understand that soil provides both water and nutrients for growth.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by predicting plant growth and designing a plant-growth model.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Plant Growth Model Template (handout or digital)\n- Colored pencils, markers\n- Optional: photograph/image of a mature plant (optional visual reference)\n- Seeds of different sizes (bean, pea, lettuce) for observation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Plant Growth Prediction Model (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute the model template** showing an empty outlined plant with the soil line marked.\n\n2. **Student Task:** \n   - Draw where the **roots** would be (below the soil line) and label them.\n   - Draw where the **shoots** would be (above the soil line) and label them.\n   - Add arrows showing **where water comes from** (from the soil into roots).\n   - Add arrows showing **where air comes from** (from above into the leaves).\n   - Write 2-3 sentences explaining why plants need each of these materials.\n\n3. **Share-Out:** Have 3-4 students present their models. Ask classmates: \"Do you agree? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Option B: Observation of Decomposing Matter (alternative for groups who finish early)**\n\n1. Display samples of:\n   - Raw wood chips (like in the photograph)\n   - Partially decomposed mulch (darker, crumbly)\n   - Rich dark compost (fully decomposed)\n\n2. **Student Task:** Examine and compare using magnifying glasses. Record:\n   - What do you notice about the texture?\n   - Do you see any living organisms (beetles, worms)?\n   - Why might plants grow better in the richest, darkest soil?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Why did you put the roots there?\" \"What travels through the roots?\" \"Where does the plant get energy?\"\n- Push thinking with: \"If we zoomed in even MORE, what might the roots be touching in the soil?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create an accurate labeled model showing root and shoot positions.\n- Students use arrows and labels to show the movement of water and air into plant parts.\n- Students can explain the purpose of water and air in plant growth.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student mastery of learning objectives through formative and summative measures.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation of student plant care:** Do students water appropriately? Do they record observations daily?\n- **Participation in discussions:** Can students describe plant needs using evidence from their observations?\n- **Vocabulary use:** Do students correctly use roots, shoots, and germination in conversation?\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\n**Provide each student with an exit ticket (digital or paper) containing these questions:**\n\n1. **Draw and Label:** Sketch a seedling and label the roots and shoots.\n\n2. **Explain:** Write or tell your teacher: \"Why do plants need water to grow?\"\n\n3. **Predict:** \"If you forgot to water your plant for one week, what do you think would happen? Why?\"\n\n4. **Apply:** \"Look at the original picture of the seedling in mulch. Why is the dark soil a good place for this plant to grow?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- ✅ **Emerging (1-2):** Student identifies that plants need water but cannot clearly explain why.\n- ✅ **Developing (2-3):** Student explains that water helps plants grow and describes roots taking in water.\n- ✅ **Proficient (3-4):** Student explains that roots absorb water and nutrients from soil, which are needed for the plant to grow taller and develop leaves.\n- ✅ **Advanced (4):** Student explains the role of both water and nutrients, describes how they move through the plant, and predicts what would happen without them.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can accurately label a plant diagram with roots and shoots.\n- 75% of students can explain at least one reason plants need water.\n- 90% of students demonstrate responsibility for plant care and record observations consistently.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards with pictures:** Provide cards with word + image + one-sentence definition for students learning English or with language delays. Example: \"**Roots** = Parts that drink water\" with a picture.\n\n2. **Sentence stems for explanation:** Give students sentence starters:\n   - \"Plants need water because _____.\"\n   - \"The roots help the plant by _____.\"\n   - \"In the picture, I see _____ around the seedling because _____.\"\n\n3. **Paired observation:** Pair struggling readers/writers with a buddy to co-observe and co-record plant growth. The buddy can read questions aloud; the student points to or describes changes.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Design an investigation:** Ask: \"What if we grew two plants—one with water and one without water? What would we observe?\" Have students design the experiment, predict outcomes, and explain why soil nutrients matter (connects to 5-LS2-1 about matter cycles).\n\n2. **Research decomposition:** Have students research how mulch and wood chips break down and become nutrients. They can create a diagram showing: dead leaves → decomposers (worms, fungi) → nutrients → plant food.\n\n3. **Model the water cycle in soil:** Challenge students to explain: \"How does water get back into the air from soil?\" (Evaporation through leaves.) Draw or build a model showing roots pulling water up through the plant and water vapor leaving leaves.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Time-Lapse Growth Documentation:** If possible, photograph student plants daily and compile into a 30-second time-lapse video showing germination and growth. Students narrate using scientific vocabulary. Share with other classes.\n\n2. **Grow Plants in Different Conditions (5-7 days):** Plant seeds in parallel groups:\n   - Group A: Regular soil + water + light\n   - Group B: Sand + water + light (no nutrients)\n   - Group C: Regular soil + no water + light\n   - Group D: Regular soil + water + no light\n   \n   Predict which will grow best. Observe daily and record. Discuss why soil nutrients AND water AND light all matter. (Connects to 5-LS1-1 about materials needed for growth.)\n\n3. **Decomposer Investigation:** Fill a jar with layers: soil, leaves, twigs, food scraps (if allowed). Keep moist. Observe over 2-3 weeks as decomposers break down matter. Discuss how decomposed material (like the mulch in the photo) becomes soil that feeds new plants. (Connects to 5-LS2-1 about matter cycling through ecosystems.)\n\n4. **Field Investigation:** Take students outside to observe plants growing in garden beds, landscaping, or wild areas. Ask: \"What soil do you see? Can you spot decomposed leaves? Why do these plants grow here?\" Connect observations back to lesson concepts.\n\n5. **Interview and Reflection:** Have students interview a parent, school gardener, or landscaper: \"What does a plant need to grow?\" Write up responses and compare to classroom learning.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing:** Seed germination typically takes 3-5 days for beans/peas. Plan this lesson for a time when you can observe growth over a full week.\n- **Seed choice:** Bean and pea seeds are reliable, affordable, and fast. Avoid seeds that require scarification or prolonged cold (too complex for this grade).\n- **Water management:** Teach students the \"wrung-out sponge\" rule to prevent root rot. Let them feel the difference between wet and damp soil.\n- **Light:** Emphasize that seedlings need a window or grow light. Seedlings without light become pale and weak (demonstrate why if possible).\n- **Real-world relevance:** Show students the mulch/wood chips in the photograph and explain it's like the \"ground cover\" they see in gardens and landscaping—it protects and feeds the soil.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly uses the photograph of the seedling in mulch to ground student understanding in a real-world context. By combining hands-on growing with scientific explanation, students develop deep understanding of why plants need soil and water (5-LS1-1) and how matter cycles from decomposed materials to living plants (5-LS2-1).**",
