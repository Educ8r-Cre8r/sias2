ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed image of the grasshopper on the seed head (high quality, large enough for all to see)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Optional: small observation containers or magnifying glasses (to show later)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display Introduction:** Project the photograph on a large screen or display it on the board without immediately explaining it. Allow 30-45 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Questions:** Ask students these questions in sequence, allowing 10-15 seconds of think-time before taking responses:\n   - \"What do you notice about how this grasshopper's body looks? What body parts can you see?\"\n   - \"Why might a grasshopper have long, powerful back legs? What could it use those legs for?\"\n   - \"Look at those long, thin things sticking out from the grasshopper's head. What do you think those are for? How might they help the grasshopper?\"\n   - \"If you were a grasshopper, how would you find food in a field? What would help you stay safe?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Ask students to turn to a partner and discuss: *\"What would happen to a grasshopper if it didn't have strong back legs? What would happen if it had no eyes or antennae?\"* Invite 2-3 pairs to share their thinking.\n\n4. **Chart Ideas:** Write student observations and ideas on chart paper to revisit during the Explain phase. Title it: \"What Grasshoppers Need to Survive.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Today, we're going to become grasshopper detectives. We'll investigate how different parts of a grasshopper's body help it live, find food, and stay safe.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copies of the grasshopper photograph (one per pair or small group, 8.5\" x 11\" or larger if possible)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- **Grasshopper Structure Hunt Worksheet** (see below) — 1 per student or pair\n- Rulers or measuring tapes (optional, for estimating body part sizes)\n- Magnifying glasses (if available, for better observation details)\n- Chart paper or poster board for group findings\n\n**Grasshopper Structure Hunt Worksheet (Teacher Creates)**\nPrint or display this template for students:\n\n---\n**Grasshopper Structure Detective Sheet**\n\n**Name:** _________________ **Date:** _________________\n\n**Look carefully at your grasshopper photo. Find and label these parts:**\n\n1. **Head** — Where are the eyes? Circle them.\n2. **Antennae** — How many do you see? Draw them. What do you think they do?\n3. **Legs** — Count all the legs. Are all legs the same size? Circle the biggest ones.\n4. **Wings** — What color are they? Where are they on the body?\n5. **Mouthparts** — Where does the grasshopper eat? Look at the bottom of its head.\n\n**Now, make a prediction:**\n- Which body part helps the grasshopper **jump far away** from danger?\n- Which body part helps it **find food or smell plants**?\n- Which body part helps it **see predators coming**?\n\n---\n\n**Activity Steps:**\n\n1. **Pair Students:** Distribute one printed photograph and one Structure Hunt Worksheet to each pair or small group.\n\n2. **Guided Discovery:** Say: \"You are detectives looking for clues about how grasshoppers survive. Your job is to look very carefully at the photograph and find the body parts listed on your sheet. Use your pencils to draw arrows or circles on your photo to show where each part is.\"\n\n3. **Student Investigation (12-15 minutes):** Circulate as students work. Ask prompts rather than giving answers:\n   - \"Where do you think the grasshopper's eyes are? How do you know?\"\n   - \"These long thin parts—what might they sense about the world around the grasshopper?\"\n   - \"Look at the back legs. Why do you think they're so much bigger than the front legs?\"\n   - \"Why is the grasshopper on a flower or seed head? What might it be doing there?\"\n\n4. **Group Observation (5-7 minutes):** Gather the class. Have 2-3 pairs share what they discovered by pointing to the photograph and explaining what they found. Record observations on chart paper: \"What We Discovered About Grasshopper Bodies.\"\n\n5. **Documentation:** Have each student sketch or label their own simple diagram of the grasshopper on the back of their worksheet, noting what each part might do.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without lecturing—ask guiding questions, not leading questions.\n- Affirm observations: \"Yes, I see you noticed the antennae are really long. I wonder why?\"\n- Connect observations to survival: \"Why do you think having strong back legs would help a grasshopper stay alive?\"\n- Help students move from observation to inference.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify external structures: antennae, head, legs (6 total), wings, mouthparts, compound eyes.\n- Students begin to infer function: big legs = jumping, antennae = sensing, eyes = seeing, mouthparts = eating.\n- Students record observations with drawings and labels.\n- Students develop questions about how grasshopper structures work.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Completed \"What Grasshoppers Need to Survive\" chart from Engage phase\n- \"What We Discovered\" chart from Explore phase\n- Large labeled diagram of a grasshopper (teacher-made or from NGSS resource, printed 11\" x 17\" or projected)\n- Vocabulary poster or cards with pictures\n- Index cards or whiteboard for vocabulary\n- The original photograph\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Reconnect to Photograph (2 minutes):** Display the original photograph again. \"Let's review what we found. You discovered some amazing things about grasshopper bodies!\"\n\n2. **Review Student Discoveries (3-4 minutes):** Point to the \"What We Discovered\" chart. Ask students: \"What body parts did we find? What did we think they do?\" Affirm their inferences.\n\n3. **Introduce Vocabulary with Context (8-10 minutes):** Present each term using the photograph as reference:\n\n   **Vocabulary (with Fourth Grade-Friendly Definitions):**\n\n   - **External Structure:** A body part on the outside of an animal's body that helps it survive. (Point to antennae, legs, wings on the photo. \"These are all external structures because we can see them on the outside.\")\n   \n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment. (Example: \"The grasshopper's strong back legs are an adaptation—they help it jump to escape from a predator. The green color is an adaptation—it helps the grasshopper hide in plants.\")\n   \n   - **Camouflage:** A color, pattern, or shape that helps an animal blend into its surroundings. (Point to the grasshopper's green and brown coloring. \"Do you see how the grasshopper looks similar to the green plant? That's camouflage. Predators have a harder time seeing it!\")\n   \n   - **Sensory Structure:** A body part that collects information about the world (sight, smell, touch, hearing). (Point to antennae: \"Antennae smell and feel.\" Point to eyes: \"Eyes see.\" These help the grasshopper sense danger or find food.\")\n   \n   - **Mouthparts:** The structures an animal uses to eat. (Point to the grasshopper's mouth area. \"The grasshopper uses its mouthparts to chew plants.\")\n\n4. **Make Connections to NGSS Learning (4-5 minutes):** Create a simple chart on the board:\n\n   ```\n   GRASSHOPPER BODY PART → WHAT IT DOES → HOW IT HELPS SURVIVAL\n   \n   Strong back legs → Jump high and far → Escape from predators\n   Antennae → Sense/smell → Find food, sense danger\n   Eyes → See → Find food, detect predators\n   Green/brown color → Camouflage → Hide in plants (blend in)\n   Wings → Fly → Escape danger, move to new food sources\n   Mouthparts → Chew plants → Eat food to grow\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):** Ask quick questions:\n   - \"What is an external structure? Can you name one on a grasshopper?\"\n   - \"What does camouflage mean? How does the grasshopper use camouflage?\"\n   - \"If a grasshopper didn't have strong back legs, how would that affect its survival?\" (Expect: It couldn't jump away from predators; it would get caught more easily; it might not survive.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that external structures are body parts we can see on the outside of animals.\n- Students can name at least 4 grasshopper structures and explain one function for each.\n- Students recognize that grasshopper structures are adaptations—they help the grasshopper survive.\n- Students understand that camouflage is an adaptation and can describe how the grasshopper uses it.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large poster board (1 per small group of 3-4 students)\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Scissors\n- **Optional:** Pre-made grasshopper body part cutouts (laminated images) or construction paper for building a labeled model\n- Rulers\n- Access to the original photograph or printed copies\n- Glue sticks\n\n**Activity: \"Build a Survival Survival Guide\"**\n\nStudents create a visual guide showing how a grasshopper's structures help it survive in its habitat.\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Form Small Groups:** Arrange students in groups of 3-4.\n\n2. **Assign Focus Structures:** Each group receives one of these tasks (or all groups can address all):\n   - **Group A:** How do strong legs help a grasshopper survive?\n   - **Group B:** How do antennae and senses help a grasshopper survive?\n   - **Group C:** How does camouflage help a grasshopper survive?\n   - **Group D:** How do wings help a grasshopper survive?\n   \n   *(Alternatively, assign all groups to address all structures.)*\n\n3. **Create a Visual Guide:** On poster board, students:\n   - Draw or cut and paste a picture of a grasshopper (can trace or use a printed image)\n   - Label the structure they're focusing on\n   - Draw or write how that structure helps the grasshopper:\n     - **Survive** (stay alive, avoid predators)\n     - **Find food**\n     - **Move around**\n     - **Sense danger**\n   - Add arrows, labels, and explanations\n\n4. **Include a Real-World Scenario:** Students add a small drawing or sentence answering: \"What would happen to a grasshopper if it lost this body part? How would it struggle to survive?\" Example: \"If a grasshopper didn't have antennae, it couldn't smell food. It would get hungry and weak.\"\n\n5. **Gallery Walk (5 minutes):** Groups post their guides around the room. Students do a brief gallery walk to see how other structures contribute to survival.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions:\n  - \"How does this structure help your grasshopper survive?\"\n  - \"Can you show me with your drawing how this structure protects the grasshopper?\"\n  - \"What would be the biggest problem if this structure didn't work?\"\n- Encourage use of vocabulary (adaptation, camouflage, external structure, sensory).\n- Prompt students to connect to the original photograph: \"Find this part on the real grasshopper photo. What do you notice?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation showing at least one body structure and its survival function.\n- Students articulate how structures are adaptations using key vocabulary.\n- Students demonstrate understanding by explaining consequences of missing a structure.\n- Students apply concepts to a new context (scenario-based thinking).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of grasshopper structures and their functions in survival.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation:** Listen to student discussions during Engage and Explore. Do they use evidence from the photograph? Do they attempt to explain *why* structures exist?\n- **Worksheet Review:** Check the Grasshopper Structure Hunt Worksheet. Did students identify structures? Did their predictions about function show reasoning?\n- **Vocabulary Use:** As students elaborate, did they use terms like \"adaptation,\" \"external structure,\" \"camouflage,\" and \"sensory\"?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes at end of Lesson 2):**\n\nAdminister one of these options:\n\n**Option A: Written Exit Ticket (Individual)**\n\nProvide students with a simple printed form or ask them to write on a note card:\n\n```\nGRASSHOPPER SURVIVAL STRUCTURES EXIT TICKET\n\nName: ___________________     Date: ___________________\n\n1. Draw or name one external structure of a grasshopper:\n   _____________________________________________________\n\n2. Explain how this structure helps the grasshopper survive:\n   _____________________________________________________\n   _____________________________________________________\n\n3. What would happen if a grasshopper didn't have this structure?\n   _____________________________________________________\n   _____________________________________________________\n\n4. Circle the word that describes how a grasshopper's green color helps it survive:\n   a) Adaptation     b) Migration     c) Hibernation\n```\n\n**Option B: Quick Oral Assessment (Whole Group or Pairs)**\n\nAsk these questions; listen for understanding:\n- \"Show me a body part on the grasshopper photo. Tell me how it helps the grasshopper survive.\"\n- \"What does camouflage mean? Why is it important for a grasshopper?\"\n- \"If I asked you why grasshoppers have strong back legs instead of weak legs, what would you tell me?\"\n\n**Option C: Diagram and Explanation (Kinesthetic)**\n\nShow students the photograph. Ask them to:\n- Point to or draw an external structure.\n- Explain its function in 1-2 sentences.\n- Connect it to survival: \"How does this help the grasshopper stay alive?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student identifies at least 2 external structures and explains how each helps grasshopper survival. Student uses vocabulary (adaptation, external structure, camouflage, sensory) correctly in context.\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student identifies 1-2 external structures and provides a basic explanation of function. Student may confuse terminology but shows understanding of the connection between body parts and survival.\n\n✓ **Beginning:** Student identifies a structure but cannot yet explain how it helps survival, or explanations are vague. Teacher provides scaffolding and reteaches.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that external structures are adaptations.\n- Students can name at least 3 grasshopper structures and link each to survival, food-finding, or predator avoidance.\n- Students apply learning to explain why body parts matter (consequence of missing a structure).\n- Student thinking reflects the NGSS standard: structures function to support survival and behavior.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary and Visuals:**\n   - Provide a glossary with pictures alongside vocabulary words (external structure, adaptation, camouflage).\n   - Use the photograph as a constant reference tool rather than expecting memory recall.\n   - Reduce the number of structures to identify (focus on legs, antennae, and eyes only).\n\n2. **Guided Questioning & Sentence Stems:**\n   - Provide sentence starters for explanations:\n     - \"The grasshopper has __________ legs because __________.\"\n     - \"Camouflage helps the grasshopper __________.\"\n     - \"If the grasshopper didn't have __________, it couldn't __________.\"\n   - Use yes/no or multiple-choice questions during discussions before asking open-ended questions.\n\n3. **Hands-On Model:**\n   - Provide pre-made grasshopper body part cutouts or a simple body outline to label together as a small group.\n   - Use a physical model or 3D representation (toy grasshopper) for students to touch and examine, supplementing the photograph.\n   - Pair struggling students with stronger readers during Explore; assign roles (one finds structures, one records).\n\n---\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Compare and Contrast:** \n   - Provide photographs of other insects (cricket, locust, katydid) alongside the grasshopper. \n   - Challenge students to identify similar and different structures and hypothesize why. \n   - Ask: \"Why might a grasshopper and a cricket both have strong legs?\"\n\n2. **Deep Ecological Thinking:**\n   - Introduce a predator-prey scenario: \"An owl hunts grasshoppers. How does each of the grasshopper's structures help it avoid the owl?\"\n   - Have students design a grasshopper with *modified* structures. \"If a grasshopper lived in a rocky desert instead of a grassy field, what structures should change? Why?\"\n   - Research and present: Assign students to investigate the lifecycle of grasshoppers and how external structures change as they grow.\n\n3. **Sensory Pathway Challenge:**\n   - Use 4-LS1-2 more deeply: Have advanced learners trace the path of sensory information. \n   - Activity: \"A grasshopper sees a predator. Trace the journey: eyes → brain → __________ (what body part responds?) → survival behavior (jumping).\"\n   - Create a labeled diagram showing the sensory-response loop.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grasshopper Habitat Diorama**\n   - Students create a small habitat (shoe box or paper bag) showing a grasshopper and its environment.\n   - Include plants it eats, places it can hide (camouflage), and areas to jump.\n   - Worksheet prompt: \"Label your grasshopper's structures. Explain how each structure helps it survive in this habitat.\"\n   - *Connections:* Extends to ecosystem understanding and habitat requirements.\n\n2. **Sense Challenge Game**\n   - Play a movement game where students role-play as grasshoppers with and without senses.\n   - Round 1: \"Find the flower (food)\" — students use all senses (vision and smell cues: scent spray or picture).\n   - Round 2: \"Close your eyes (no antennae)\" — students must find food without smell or sight.\n   - Debrief: \"Which senses were most important? Why would a grasshopper struggle without antennae?\"\n   - *Connections:* Engages 4-LS1-2 (sensory information processing).\n\n3. **Adaptations in Our Classroom**\n   - Challenge students to identify \"external structures\" in the classroom or school that are like adaptations—they help something survive or function better.\n   - Examples: Desk drawers (storage), pencil tip (precision), backpack straps (carrying), shoes (grip and protection).\n   - Have students draw and label one example, explaining its \"function\" just as they did for grasshoppers.\n   - *Connections:* Metacognitive transfer of concept; builds systems thinking.\n\n4. **Homework: Family Observation**\n   - Send home a simple one-page worksheet: \"Look for insects in your yard or neighborhood. Draw one and label any external structures you see. How might these structures help that insect survive?\"\n   - Students bring drawings to class; share findings in a follow-up discussion.\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Summary\n\n**NGSS 4-LS1-1: Construct an argument that plants and animals have internal and external structures that function to support survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction.**\n- ✓ Students identify grasshopper external structures (legs, antennae, wings, mouthparts).\n- ✓ Students explain how each structure supports survival (escaping danger, finding food, sensing threats).\n- ✓ Students make arguments using evidence from the photograph (e.g., \"Big legs → jumping → escaping predators\").\n\n**NGSS 4-LS1-2: Use a model to describe that animals receive different types of information through their senses, process the information in their brain, and respond to the information in different ways.**\n- ✓ Students identify sensory structures (antennae = smell/touch, eyes = sight).\n- ✓ Students trace how sensory information (danger, food) leads to a response (jumping, eating).\n- ✓ Elaborate and Challenge activities explicitly model the sensory-response pathway.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Pacing:** If time is limited, combine Engage and Explore into one 45-minute session, then do Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate in a second session.\n- **Visual Aids:** Print or project the grasshopper photograph in high quality. Having it visible throughout all five phases anchors learning.\n- **Real Specimens (Optional but Powerful):** If available, a live grasshopper in a clear container allows students to observe movement, feeding, and sensory behavior in real-time. Many science suppliers provide feeder insects.\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Post vocabulary words with picture cards around the room. Refer to them frequently during transitions.\n- **Safety Note:** If using live insects, ensure proper handling and return-to-nature protocols. Do not allow students to harm or stress the animal.\n\nThis lesson uses the grasshopper photograph as an anchor to develop Fourth Grade understanding of how external structures support survival—core to NGSS 4-LS1-1.",
