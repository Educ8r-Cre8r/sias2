Scientifically, vultures have evolved exceptional eyesight (they can spot a dead animal from miles away while soaring) and strong digestive systems that can safely break down bacteria found in carrion. Their bald or nearly-featherless heads help them stay clean while feeding on decaying matter. This behavior is an example of an **ecological role**: vultures are nature's \"cleanup crew,\" preventing disease spread and nutrient cycling in ecosystems.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Animal Behaviors:** Different animals have different ways of finding food based on what their bodies can do.

    "firstgrade": "# First Grade Science Lesson: Scavenger Birds\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a large black bird with long, thin legs standing on the ground. The bird has a small, wrinkled head and neck that looks very different from its big body. You can see its gray legs and feet clearly as it searches on the grass and dirt for food to eat.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** A vulture (or similar scavenger bird) foraging for food on the ground.\n\n**Why This Happens:** Scavenger birds have special adaptations that help them find and eat dead animals. Their excellent eyesight allows them to spot food from high in the sky. Their bare heads and necks help keep them clean when eating messy food. Their long legs allow them to walk across different terrains searching for meals. This behavior is an important part of nature's cleanup crew—scavengers help decompose dead matter and recycle nutrients back into the environment.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Animal Adaptations:** Birds have special body parts (long legs, bare heads, sharp eyes) that help them survive and find food in their habitats.\n\n2. **Food Chains and Roles:** Different animals have different jobs in nature. Scavenger birds eat dead animals, making them an important part of the food chain.\n\n3. **Habitats and Behaviors:** Animals behave in ways that match where they live. This bird's ground-foraging behavior helps it find food in open grassland areas.\n\n4. **Variation in Bird Anatomy:** Not all birds look the same. This bird's body shape is very different from songbirds because it does a different job.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFirst graders learn best through direct observation. Before showing this image, ask students to watch a short video or look at pictures of different birds. Have them notice: \"What do you see that is the SAME? What do you see that is DIFFERENT?\" This activates prior knowledge and makes them active observers rather than passive viewers.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Strategies:**\n- Provide a simplified, labeled diagram showing the bird's body parts (head, neck, legs, wings) so students with visual processing differences can reference it during discussions.\n- Offer a choice of response formats: students may draw, dictate, or use picture cards to answer questions about the bird's adaptations.\n- Use consistent, repetitive language when describing the bird's features (e.g., always say \"bare head\" and \"long legs\") to support students with language processing needs.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** \nK-LS1-1: Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-LS1.A]]: All organisms have external parts and internal parts that support their survival, growth, behavior, and reproduction.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]]: The shape and stability of structures of natural and designed objects are related to their function(s).\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]: Patterns in the natural world can be observed and used as evidence.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What body parts does this bird have that help it find food?** (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why do you think this bird has such long, thin legs?

Have students match each bird to cards showing body parts (long legs, webbed feet, long beak, small body). Discuss why each bird has the body parts it needs for its lifestyle.\n\n2. **Classroom Scavenger Hunt:** Hide pictures or small objects around the classroom. Have students \"forage\" to find them, just like the bird searches for food. After, discuss: \"How did you look for things? How is that like how birds search for food?\"\n\n3. **Bird Adaptation Drawing:** Give each student a large piece of paper with a simple bird outline. Have them add or draw body parts that would help their bird survive in a specific habitat (forest, desert, water, grassland). Students can color and label their adaptations, then share with a partner.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Birds* by Kevin Henkes (simple, beautifully illustrated introduction to bird diversity)\n- *What Do Birds Eat?* by Becky Bloom and Tom Bloom (explores different bird feeding strategies)\n- *All Kinds of Animals* by Mary Ann Hoberman (poetry and facts about animal variety)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"What Do Vultures Eat? | Animal Behavior for Kids\"** – National Geographic Kids (2:45 minutes) | Explains scavenger behavior in age-appropriate language with real footage.

    "secondgrade": "# Second Grade Science Lesson: Scavenger Birds\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis large black bird with gray legs and a wrinkled head is a vulture, a special kind of bird that eats animals that are already dead. Vultures have powerful wings, strong beaks, and excellent eyesight that helps them find food from high in the sky. Their bare heads and necks help keep them clean when they eat.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** How do vultures find dead animals to eat, and why are they important to nature?\n\n**Scientific Explanation:** Vultures are scavengers, meaning they eat meat from animals that have already died naturally or from predator kills. Their eyes are 8 times stronger than human eyes, allowing them to spot carcasses from thousands of feet in the air. Vultures play a crucial ecological role by cleaning up dead animals, which prevents disease spread and keeps ecosystems healthy. This is an example of a food chain role and decomposer function in nature.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Animal Roles in Food Chains:** Vultures are scavengers/consumers that feed on dead organisms, completing the nutrient cycle in ecosystems.\n\n2. **Structural Adaptations:** The vulture's bare head, powerful beak, strong wings, and exceptional eyesight are physical features that help it survive and hunt effectively.\n\n3. **Biodiversity and Ecological Balance:** Scavenger birds like vultures are essential for ecosystem health; without them, dead animals would accumulate and cause disease.\n\n4. **Animal Behaviors:** Vultures use specific hunting strategies (soaring high, watching for movement) that are instinctive behaviors passed through generations.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching about scavengers, use a \"role card\" activity where students physically act out different animals in a food chain. This kinesthetic approach helps Second Graders understand abstract concepts like \"scavenger\" and \"decomposer\" through movement and embodied learning.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple representations of how vultures hunt: a simple diagram showing eyesight strength, a short video clip of soaring, and a tactile \"feather hunt\" game where students find hidden pictures around the classroom. This addresses visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners while reducing barriers for students with different learning profiles.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 2-LS2-1  \n*Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water, and animals get materials they need from food.*\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS1.A]] - All animals need food, water, and air to survive; vultures meet these needs by eating dead animals.\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS2.A]] - Different animals eat different kinds of food; vultures are carnivorous scavengers.\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS4.D]] - Every organism has different body structures that help it survive in its environment; vulture adaptations include keen eyesight and powerful beaks.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] - The vulture's body parts (eyes, beak, wings) are designed for its scavenging role.\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] - Vultures soar high because their lightweight bodies and large wings allow them to catch air currents, helping them hunt efficiently.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think vultures eat, and why do you think they look for dead animals instead of hunting live ones?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **How do a vulture's strong eyes and sharp beak help it survive?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 1)\n\n3. **Why might an ecosystem have problems if there were no vultures?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **If vultures disappeared from a forest, what do you predict would happen to the dead animals there?** (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Scavenger:** An animal that eats dead plants or animals instead of hunting live ones.\n* **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment.\n* **Ecosystem:** A community of living things and their environment all working together.\n* **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals.\n* **Eyesight:** The ability to see; vultures have very sharp eyesight.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Vulture Vision Game:** Create a \"distance challenge\" where students stand at different distances from a window and count how many small objects (leaves, insects) they can see. Compare their results to discuss why vultures' exceptional eyesight helps them hunt from high in the sky.\n\n2. **Food Chain Build:** Using picture cards of various animals (grass, mouse, owl, vulture, dead owl), have students arrange them in a food chain on the floor or bulletin board. Discuss how the vulture's role is different from other animals because it eats animals after they've died.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Balance Story:** Read a simple story about what happened when vultures left a forest (disease spread, ecosystem problems). Have students illustrate or act out the story to show cause-and-effect relationships in nature.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *Vultures* by Louise Spilsbury (Let's Read and Find Out Science series) – Clear, age-appropriate facts about vulture behavior and adaptations.\n* *What Do Animals Eat?* by Lisa Bullard – Simple exploration of different animal diets including scavengers.\n* *A Vulture's View* by Erika David – Narrative book showing vultures' ecological importance.\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n* **\"Vulture Facts for Kids\"** (National Geographic Kids) – 3-minute video showing vultures in action and explaining their role in nature.

Second Graders benefit from concrete, observable examples—the vulture's distinctive appearance and obvious hunting behavior make it an excellent anchoring phenomenon for these concepts.",
    "thirdgrade": "# Third Grade Science Lesson Analysis: Scavenger Bird\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a large black bird with a bare, wrinkled head and long, thin legs standing on the ground. The bird has dark feathers covering most of its body and appears to be looking down at the ground. This type of bird is a scavenger that eats animals that have already died.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** *Why do some birds have bare heads and eat dead animals?*\n\nThis bird is a scavenger—an animal that feeds on carrion (dead animals). The bare, featherless head is a key adaptation that prevents feathers from becoming dirty and matted when the bird reaches deep inside dead animal carcasses to eat. Unlike predators that hunt living prey, scavengers play a critical ecological role by removing dead animals from the environment, which prevents disease spread and recycles nutrients back into the soil. This is a survival strategy that has evolved over millions of years because it provides a reliable food source without the danger or energy cost of hunting living animals.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Adaptation:** Body parts (like the bare head) help animals survive in their environment and find food more easily.\n\n* **Food Webs and Roles:** Scavengers are decomposers that break down dead matter; they occupy a unique and important role in ecosystems different from hunters or herbivores.\n\n* **Animal Behavior:** Birds have inherited behaviors (instincts) that guide them to find and eat food in specific ways.\n\n* **Ecological Relationships:** All animals depend on other living and non-living things to survive; scavengers depend on dead animals as their food source.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nThird graders may initially find scavenging \"gross\" or negative. Reframe this as a *superpower*—these birds are nature's cleanup crew! Use language like \"nature's recyclers\" to help students see the ecological value. This shifts their perspective from disgust to appreciation.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Representation:** Provide images of scavenger birds in their natural habitats alongside diagrams labeling body parts. Use both visual and verbal descriptions. **Action & Expression:** Allow students to choose how to show learning—some may draw and label adaptations, while others create a food web diagram or act out a scavenger's day. **Engagement:** Connect to students' prior knowledge by asking, \"Who cleans up trash in your neighborhood?\" before introducing ecological roles.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 3-LS1-1 Develop models to describe that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but all have in common birth, growth, reproduction, and death.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.C]]—Adaptation behaviors and structures that help organisms survive\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS2.A]]—Organisms depend on their environment and each other\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]]—The bird's bare head is a structure that functions to help it eat efficiently\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]]—The scavenger is part of a larger food web system\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you notice about this bird's head compared to other birds you know?** (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why might a bare head be helpful for a bird that eats dead animals?** (Bloom's: Infer | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **How does this bird's role in nature help other living things and the environment?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **If all the scavenger birds disappeared from an area, what problems might happen?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Scavenger:** An animal that eats dead animals or leftover food instead of hunting living prey.\n\n* **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and thrive in its environment.\n\n* **Carrion:** A dead animal's body.\n\n* **Ecosystem:** All the living and non-living things in an area and how they interact with each other.\n\n* **Decomposer:** An organism that breaks down dead plants and animals and returns nutrients to the soil.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Scavenger Bird Adaptation Chart:** Students create a two-column chart titled \"Adaptations\" with drawings and labels of the bird's special features (bare head, long legs, sharp eyes). They write one sentence explaining how each adaptation helps the bird survive. This connects to [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.C]].\n\n2. **Food Web Role-Play:** Divide the class into groups representing different organisms (plants, herbivores, predators, scavengers, decomposers). Create a physical food web using yarn, with students holding cards, to show how energy and nutrients flow through an ecosystem. Highlight the scavenger's unique position.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Detective Game:** Provide picture cards of various environments (forest, grassland, desert). Students predict which scavenger birds might live there and why. Discuss how scavengers are found in many different habitats because dead animals are everywhere.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *What Do You Do With a Kangaroo?* by Mercer Mayer (explores animal behaviors and adaptations)\n- *Who Eats What?

    "fourthgrade": "# Fourth Grade Science Lesson: Scavengers in Nature\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a large black bird called a vulture standing on the ground with its wings partially spread. The vulture has a gray, wrinkled head and neck with no feathers, long gray legs, and powerful black wings. You can see it searching on the ground, which is where vultures look for food in nature.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why do some birds have bald heads and search for dead animals?\n\nVultures are **scavengers**—animals that eat dead plants and animals instead of hunting live prey. Their bare heads and necks help them stay clean when they eat dead animals, and their strong stomach acid breaks down meat that might be harmful to other animals. This is a special adaptation that allows vultures to fill an important role in ecosystems by cleaning up dead animals and preventing disease spread. Vultures are nature's recyclers!\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Adaptation:** Vultures have special body features (bare heads, strong beaks, excellent eyesight) that help them survive as scavengers.\n\n2. **Food Chains and Ecosystems:** Scavengers like vultures are decomposers that break down dead matter, cycling nutrients back into the environment.\n\n3. **Roles in Ecosystems:** Different animals have different jobs—some hunt, some eat plants, and some (like vultures) clean up what's left behind.\n\n4. **Animal Behavior:** Vultures use their keen eyesight and sense of smell to locate food sources from great distances.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching about scavengers, start with familiar examples (like how ants clean up crumbs at a picnic) before introducing vultures. This makes the concept less abstract and more relatable to fourth graders' everyday observations.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple ways for students to engage: Show photographs and videos (visual), play recordings of animal sounds (auditory), and allow hands-on sorting activities where students categorize animals by their feeding roles (kinesthetic). Consider pairing students with different reading levels to read vocabulary cards together.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 4-LS1-1: Use a model to describe that animals receive different types of information through their senses, process the information in their brain, and respond to the information in different ways.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-LS1.A]]—Animals have different sensory abilities suited to their environments and roles.\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-LS1.D]]—Animal behaviors are shaped by their adaptations and environmental needs.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]]—The vulture's bare head structure allows it to function as a scavenger.\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]]—Scavengers are part of the larger ecosystem system that cycles materials and energy.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why do you think a vulture's head has no feathers, while other birds have feathered heads?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **How does a vulture help keep the environment clean and healthy?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If there were no scavengers like vultures in an ecosystem, what problems might happen?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **What other animals do you know that are scavengers, and what do they have in common with vultures?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Scavenger:** An animal that eats dead plants or animals instead of hunting live ones.\n* **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment.\n* **Ecosystem:** A community of living things and their nonliving environment all working together.\n* **Decomposer:** An organism that breaks down dead material and returns nutrients to the soil.\n* **Carrion:** Dead animal flesh that scavengers eat.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Scavenger Hunt Classification Game:** Create cards with pictures of 15–20 different animals. Have students sort them into categories: hunters (carnivores), plant-eaters (herbivores), and scavengers. Discuss why each animal fits its group and what special features help it eat that way.\n\n2. **Design a Scavenger Bird:** Give students paper and art supplies. Ask them to design their own scavenger bird with adaptations suited to their chosen environment (desert, forest, mountain). They should label body parts and explain how each feature helps the bird survive as a scavenger.\n\n3. **Food Chain Diagram Investigation:** Provide students with a picture of a vulture and other animals from the same habitat. Have them create a food chain or food web showing how energy moves through the ecosystem, including the vulture's role in breaking down dead matter.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Vultures* by Sandra Markle (National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Animals series)\n- *A Day in the Life of a Vulture* by Caroline Arnold\n- *Who Eats What?

    "fifthgrade": "# Fifth Grade Science Lesson: Scavengers in Nature\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a large black bird with a bare, wrinkled head and neck, long legs, and powerful wings folded against its body. The bird is walking on the ground near grass and small plants, demonstrating how scavenger birds move through their environment searching for food. You can clearly see its textured skin, dark feathers, and the way its body is adapted for finding meals on the ground.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** A scavenger bird (likely a vulture or similar species) foraging for food by walking and observing its surroundings.\n\n**Why This Happens:** This bird is a **scavenger**, which means it eats dead animals (carrion) instead of hunting live prey. Scavengers play a critical ecological role by consuming remains that would otherwise decay and spread disease. Their specialized adaptations—like excellent eyesight, a bare head that stays clean while eating, and long legs for walking over rough terrain—make them perfectly suited for this job. Scavengers help keep ecosystems clean and healthy by breaking down nutrients and returning them to the soil.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Food Chains and Roles:** Scavengers occupy a unique position in food chains as decomposers/detritivores. Unlike predators that hunt live animals, scavengers consume dead organic matter and play an essential role in nutrient cycling.\n\n2. **Structural Adaptations:** The bird's specific body features—bare skin on the head (prevents feather matting during feeding), strong legs, sharp eyesight, and powerful digestive system—are physical adaptations that help it survive and perform its ecological role.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Relationships:** Scavengers help maintain ecosystem balance by preventing disease spread, reducing waste, and cycling nutrients back into the soil for plants to use.\n\n4. **Biodiversity and Roles:** Different organisms have different jobs in ecosystems. Understanding that some animals are scavengers helps students recognize the diversity of feeding strategies in nature.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching scavengers, avoid emphasizing the \"gross\" factor, though students will naturally be curious! Instead, reframe scavenging as an important environmental service. Use analogies to human jobs: \"Just like garbage collectors keep our neighborhoods clean, scavengers keep nature clean.\" This helps students see the role as valuable rather than unpleasant.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Provide images of various scavengers (vultures, hyenas, crows, beetles) so students see that scavenging is performed by many different animal types. Create a visual diagram showing how a scavenger fits into a food chain. **Multiple Means of Action/Expression:** Allow students to choose how they demonstrate learning—through drawings, written explanations, role-plays, or digital presentations. **Multiple Means of Engagement:** Connect scavengers to student interests by asking, \"What 'cleans up' in your classroom or home?\" before introducing ecological roles.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n5-LS1-1: Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.\n\n5-LS2-1: Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS2.A]] Formation of food webs showing feeding relationships\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS2.B]] The role of decomposers in cycling nutrients\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS1.C]] Organization for matter and energy flow in organisms\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]] (Understanding ecosystems as interconnected systems)\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]] (Tracking matter as it cycles through organisms)\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] (How the bird's body structure supports its scavenging function)\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think would happen to an ecosystem if there were no scavenger animals?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n2. **How are a scavenger's body parts (like its bare head and strong legs) helpful for its job of finding food?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **Compare a scavenger to a hunter (like a hawk or lion). How are their feeding strategies different, and why might both types be important in nature?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **If you were designing a new scavenger animal for a specific environment, what adaptations would it need?** (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 4)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Scavenger:** An animal that eats dead plants or animals rather than hunting living prey.\n\n* **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and do its job in nature.\n\n* **Decomposer:** An organism that breaks down dead materials and returns nutrients to the soil.\n\n* **Ecosystem:** A community of living things and their non-living environment all working together.\n\n* **Carrion:** The dead body of an animal.\n\n* **Nutrient Cycle:** The path that nutrients (like nitrogen and phosphorus) take as they move from soil to plants to animals and back again.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Food Chain Investigation:** Have students create food chains or webs that include a scavenger. Provide images or cards of various organisms, and ask students to arrange them to show who eats whom. Challenge them to identify where the scavenger fits and explain why its role is essential.\n\n2. **Design a Scavenger:** Students design their own scavenger animal on paper or using digital tools. They must label and explain at least three adaptations their animal has and describe the environment where it would live. Display designs and have students present their reasoning to the class.\n\n3. **Scavenger Role-Play or Documentary:** In small groups, students create a short video, puppet show, or dramatic presentation showing a day in the life of a scavenger. They should demonstrate how the animal finds food, what it eats, and why its work is important to the ecosystem.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Vultures* by Joyce Milton (Step into Reading series) — Easy-to-read introduction to vulture adaptations and behavior\n- *Who Eats What?
