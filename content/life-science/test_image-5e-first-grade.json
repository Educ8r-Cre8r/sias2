Exploring Habitats in a Backyard Pond**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90 minutes (two 45-minute sessions or one extended block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 1-LS1-1: Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n  - 1-LS3-1: Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that young plants and animals are like, but not exactly like, their parents.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify living things and non-living things in a garden habitat.\n2. Explain why certain animals and plants live in a garden or near water.\n3. Describe how rocks, water, and plants help animals survive in a habitat.\n4. Design a simple habitat model that provides shelter and food for at least one animal.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about gardens, ponds, and animal homes by examining the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed large color photograph of the garden pond (or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Picture cards of common garden animals (optional: frog, fish, butterfly, earthworm, bee)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Initial Observation:** Show the photograph and give students 30 seconds of silent observation time. Ask them to look carefully at everything they see.\n\n2. **Guided Discovery Questions:**\n   - \"What is that dark area in the middle? Has anyone seen something like this before?\" (Accept: pond, water, pool, dark water)\n   - \"What animals do you think might live in the water or in this garden?\" (Listen for: fish, frogs, bugs, birds, worms)\n   - \"Why would animals want to live in a place like this?\" (Probe for: water, plants, food, rocks for hiding)\n   - \"Who made this garden? Was it animals or people?\" (Guide toward: people made it for their garden)\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \"I wonder... what do you think is hiding under those rocks or in that water right now? Turn to a partner and share your best guess.\"\n\n4. **Create a Wonder Wall:** Record student predictions on chart paper: \"Things that might live in our garden pond.\" Display this throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great ideas! Now we're going to build our own little habitat to see how animals and plants need special things to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate habitats through hands-on model building and observation.\n\n**Materials (per pair/small group):**\n- Clear plastic container or shallow tub (8\" × 6\" or larger)\n- Potting soil or sand (enough to fill 1–2 inches)\n- Gravel or small stones\n- Shallow dish or bottle cap\n- Water (prepared in a squeeze bottle or small pitcher)\n- 3–4 live pillbugs/roly-polies (or alternative: earthworms, or observe ants if unavailable—see differentiation)\n- Picture of a garden or habitat reference card\n- Observation worksheet (template provided below)\n- Hand lens (optional)\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud and demonstrate):**\n\n1. \"Pour soil into the bottom of your container about this deep.\" (Show 1–2 inches with fingers.)\n2. \"Spread some gravel or stones on top of the soil.\"\n3. \"Put a few small rocks around the container—these will be hiding places.\"\n4. \"Fill your small dish or cap with a little water and push it into the soil—this is like a pond for your animals!\"\n5. \"Carefully place your pillbugs (or other animals) into the container. Watch where they go!\"\n6. \"Draw a picture on your worksheet showing where the animals went. Did they hide under rocks? Near water? In the soil?\"\n\n**What to Record/Document:**\n- Students draw or write where animals moved\n- Students mark: Did the animal go to soil, rocks, water, or open space?\n- Students circle or check: \"The animal needed: water / rocks / soil / plants\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group without directing where animals \"should\" go\n- Ask: \"Where is your animal hiding? Why do you think it picked that spot?\"\n- Redirect without answering: \"What do you notice about the places where most animals are going?\"\n- Ensure water doesn't overflow; supervise animal handling gently\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe pillbugs/worms moving toward soil, moisture, and dark sheltered areas\n- Students record observations showing animals don't randomly place themselves—they choose spots with water, shelter, or soil\n- Informal recognition that animals \"need\" certain things in their environment\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize observations about habitats and survival needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper labeled \"What Animals Need to Survive\"\n- Picture labels: shelter, food, water, soil\n- Photograph from Explore phase (or new close-up photo of garden components)\n- Poster or picture showing habitats (garden, pond, forest examples)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out (5 minutes):** Ask 3–4 groups to share what they observed:\n   - \"Which group wants to tell us where your animal went?\"\n   - Record on chart: \"Most animals went to [soil/water/rocks]\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):** Teach these words with concrete examples from the Explore activity and photograph:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Habitat:** A home for an animal. It has everything the animal needs to live. (Point to the garden pond photo: \"This is a habitat for fish and frogs.\")\n   - **Shelter:** A safe place where an animal can hide or rest. (Show rocks in the photo and from the student containers: \"Rocks and soil are shelters.\")\n   - **Water:** Something all living things need to survive. (Point to the pond and the water dish in the student containers.)\n   - **Food:** What plants and animals eat to grow strong. (Point to flowers and plants in the photo: \"Plants give food to insects and animals.\")\n   - **Living and Non-Living:** Living things grow and move (animals, plants). Non-living things do not grow or move (rocks, water, soil). (Show both in the photo.)\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at our garden photo again. Show me where you see shelter.\" (Students point to rocks, plants, tunnel into water.)\n   - \"Where is the water?\" (Pond.)\n   - \"What food do you see?\" (Flowers, plants.)\n   - \"Which things are living? Which are not living?\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we took away the rocks from this garden, would the animals be happy? Why not?\" (They need places to hide.)\n   - Ask: \"If we took away the water, what would happen?\" (Animals couldn't drink or live there.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the words habitat, shelter, water, and food in sentences\n- Students can point to examples in the photograph\n- Students begin understanding that habitats have specific things animals need\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply habitat concepts to a new scenario and deepen understanding of animal needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Design template worksheet (see below) or blank paper\n- Crayons, markers, colored pencils\n- Optional: craft materials (cotton, leaves, pebbles to glue to design)\n- Picture cards or photos of different animals (bird, ant, snail, squirrel)\n- Habitat reference poster\n\n**Activity: \"Design a Home for a Garden Animal\"**\n\n1. **Present a Real-World Problem (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Imagine a butterfly just arrived in an empty yard. It needs a new home. What would you add to help it survive and be happy?\"\n\n2. **Model One Example (3 minutes):**\n   - \"If I were making a home for a ladybug, I would draw flowers for food, a leaf for shelter, and a drop of water.\"\n   - Show a simple sketch on the board.\n\n3. **Student Design Task (10 minutes):**\n   - Assign each student or pair a different animal (frog, bee, butterfly, snail, worm, bird).\n   - Students draw or sketch a habitat for their animal that includes:\n     - One place for shelter\n     - One source of water\n     - One source of food\n     - Colorful plants or living things\n   - Students label or identify each part: \"This is shelter. This is water. This is food.\"\n\n4. **Gallery Walk (optional, 2–3 minutes):**\n   - Post designs around the room\n   - Do a quick walk where students observe peers' designs\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Does your frog have water? Where will it hide? What will it eat?\"\n- Accept varied answers (students might draw food as insects, plants, or seeds)\n- Affirm the connection between the photograph and student designs\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a habitat design that shows understanding of at least two survival needs (water, shelter, food)\n- Students can explain why they chose to include specific elements\n- Evidence of transfer: \"A frog needs water like the pond in the garden photo\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitats and animal survival needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n- Observe during Explore: Do students' drawings show animals in realistic locations (near water/shelter)?\n- Listen to explanations in Explain phase: Can students use \"habitat,\" \"shelter,\" or \"water\" in sentences?\n- Review Elaborate designs: Do designs include at least 2 of 3 survival elements (shelter, water, food)?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nGive each student a simple exit card with 2–3 questions (read aloud for emerging readers):\n\n1. **Picture-Based Question:** Show a picture of a garden/pond. \n   - \"Point to or circle where an animal might hide.\" \n   - \"Point to or circle where an animal might drink water.\"\n\n2. **Verbal or Written Response:** \n   - \"What does an animal need to survive in a habitat?\" \n   - Accept any combination of: water, food, shelter, plants, safe place, hiding spot\n\n3. **Application:**\n   - \"If you were making a home for a snail, what would you put in it?\"\n   - Accept any response showing one survival need (e.g., \"A place with moisture,\" \"Leaves to eat,\" \"Rocks to hide under\")\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify at least one survival need from the photograph (water, shelter, food)\n- ✓ Student can explain why an animal needs that thing\n- ✓ Student's habitat design includes at least one realistic element for their assigned animal\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary: habitat, water, shelter, food (receptively and/or expressively)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students (80%+) can point to shelter and water in a habitat\n- Most students can name at least one reason animals live in gardens (food, water, shelter)\n- Students demonstrate transfer by including survival needs in their designed habitats\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Explore Activity:**\n   - Use only soil and one animal (pillbug/roly-poly). Eliminate the water and rocks initially\n   - Pair student with a buddy or place in a small group with teacher support\n   - Provide a pre-drawn observation sheet with checkboxes: \"The animal went to: ☐ Soil ☐ Top of soil ☐ Other\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:**\n   - Use only 2 key words: \"home\" (habitat) and \"water\" \n   - Pair words with consistent gestures or pictures\n   - Repeat vocabulary during transitions and snack time (e.g., \"Where is the water in our classroom?\")\n\n3. **Exit Ticket Modification:**\n   - Allow fully verbal responses (no writing required)\n   - Use picture-only questions (point-to-answer)\n   - Accept single-word answers: \"Water.\" \"Rocks.\" \"Food.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Extended Habitat Investigation:**\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if we removed the water? The rocks? The soil? Why?\"\n   - Challenge students to predict and test (remove one element, observe, report)\n   - Introduce the idea of multiple habitats: \"Can you design a habitat for an aquatic animal AND a land animal in one container?\"\n\n2. **Comparative Observation:**\n   - Provide images of three habitats (pond, forest, meadow)\n   - Ask: \"Which animals live in each? Why? What is the same? What is different?\"\n   - Have students sort animal pictures into correct habitats with justifications\n\n3. **Design Complexity:**\n   - Challenge: \"Design a habitat that would work for TWO animals at the same time. Make sure both animals have what they need.\"\n   - Introduce a simple food chain vocabulary: \"The plant is food for the bug. The bug is food for the bird.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Outdoor Habitat Hunt\" (15–20 minutes)**\n   - Take students on a guided outdoor walk (playground, school garden, or nearby green space)\n   - Ask: \"Can you find a small animal habitat? What living things do you see? What non-living things help them?\"\n   - Students sketch or photograph one habitat they find\n   - Share findings in a group discussion\n   - Connects to 1-LS1-1: observing how animals use external parts and their environment\n\n2. **\"Parent and Baby Animals\" Habitat Comparison (homework or follow-up session, 20 minutes)**\n   - Provide picture cards of animals with their offspring (bird with chicks, cat with kittens, frog with tadpoles)\n   - Ask: \"Do baby animals need the same habitats as their parents? Are they the same or different?\"\n   - Students draw or sort pictures, comparing habitats\n   - Connects to 1-LS3-1: observing similarities and differences between parents and offspring\n\n3. **\"Build a Deluxe Habitat\" (20–30 minutes, small group or center activity)**\n   - Extend the Explore activity with additional materials: live plants, moss, leaves, sticks\n   - Students create a more complex multi-layered habitat in a larger container\n   - Observe over several days and record changes (animals' movements, plant growth, water changes)\n   - Relates to 1-LS1-1: designing solutions using materials that mimic how animals use their environment\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Live Animal Safety:** Pillbugs/roly-polies are ideal for this lesson—they're hardy, safe, and readily available. Ensure students wash hands after handling. Return animals to an outdoor habitat after 1–2 days of observation.\n- **Photograph Discussion:** Use think-pair-share format for questions to ensure all students engage, not just fast responders.\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Use the same words daily across transitions, read-alouds, and routines to build automaticity.\n- **Struggling with Writing?** Accept all recording formats: drawings, dictation, pointing, verbal explanations.\n- **Connection to Home:** Send a note home asking families to observe habitats in their yard or neighborhood and share observations during circle time.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson anchors abstract concepts (habitat, survival needs) in concrete observation and hands-on exploration, enabling First Graders to build foundational understanding of life science and ecosystems.",
