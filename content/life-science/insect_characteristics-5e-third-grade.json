Each structure has a specific job that supports the animal's life needs.\n\n- **Structural Adaptations for Survival:** The grasshopper's green color, powerful hind legs, and body shape are traits that help it survive in grass habitats by providing camouflage and enabling quick movement to escape predators.\n\n- **Variation in Animal Traits:** Different grasshoppers may have slightly different colors, sizes, or leg lengths, showing that individuals within the same species have variations that can affect their survival success.\n\n- **Habitat-Organism Relationships:** Grasshoppers are well-suited to grassy environments because their body structures and traits match the demands of that habitat, demonstrating why certain organisms survive well in specific places.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Grasshoppers Up Close: How Bodies Help Animals Survive**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or three 30-minute sessions)\n\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 3-LS4-2: Use evidence to construct an explanation for how the variations in characteristics among individuals of the same species may provide advantages in surviving, finding mates, and reproducing.\n  - 3-LS4-3: Construct an argument with evidence that in a particular habitat some organisms can survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n- **Identify and label at least three external body parts of a grasshopper and explain one function of each part** (e.g., legs for jumping, antennae for sensing).\n\n- **Describe how a grasshopper's color, shape, and body structures help it survive in a grassy habitat** using evidence from observations.\n\n- **Compare variations in grasshopper traits among individuals** (size, color, leg length) and explain how these differences could affect survival.\n\n- **Construct a simple argument using evidence** about why grasshoppers are well-suited to grass habitats and what might happen if their habitat changed.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how grasshoppers' body parts help them survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, high-quality image of the grasshopper (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector where all students can see it clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the color of this grasshopper? Why do you think it might be that color?\"\n   - \"Look at those long, springy back legs. What do you think a grasshopper does with legs like that?\"\n   - \"See those long, thin things sticking out near the head? What might those be for? Have you ever seen an insect use something like that?\"\n   - \"If a bird was hunting for food in the grass, would it be easy or hard to spot this grasshopper? Why?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"Let's think about this—a grasshopper lives in tall grass and needs to hide from animals that want to eat it, AND it needs to jump away fast if danger comes. Which parts of this grasshopper's body help it do those things?\"\n\n4. **Record student observations and predictions** on chart paper. Do not correct misconceptions yet; they will be revisited during the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be like scientists and study a real grasshopper up close to discover exactly how each body part helps it survive!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate grasshopper body structures hands-on and discover their functions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Live grasshoppers (1 per small group of 3-4 students, or 2-3 grasshoppers for whole-class observation if live specimens are unavailable)\n  - *Alternative:* High-quality color photographs, videos of grasshoppers moving, or 3D plastic grasshopper models if live insects are not available\n- Hand lenses (magnifying glasses)\n- Observation worksheet (printed, with labeled diagram outline of a grasshopper)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Paper and pencil for recording\n- Optional: Video clip of a grasshopper jumping (30 seconds) to show function\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Assign students to small groups** of 3-4. Each group gets a live grasshopper in a clear container or observes a projected image together.\n\n2. **Distribute hand lenses and observation worksheets.** Each worksheet should have a simple outline of a grasshopper with labels for: legs, antennae, eyes, body segments, wings (if visible).\n\n3. **Direct students to observe and record:**\n   - \"Look closely at the grasshopper's legs. How many legs can you count? Are they all the same size? The back legs look VERY different from the front legs. What's special about them?\" *(Students should notice the thick, muscular hind legs.)*\n   - \"Now find the antennae—those long, thin, whip-like things near the head. Gently watch how the grasshopper moves them. What do you think it's using them for?\" *(They might hypothesize: feeling, smelling, or sensing.)*\n   - \"Look at the color and pattern on the grasshopper's body. If this grasshopper sat still in the grass, would you easily see it? Why or why not?\" *(Connect to camouflage.)*\n   - \"Watch the grasshopper move. Describe what happens. Does it walk, jump, fly, or do all three?\"\n\n4. **Observation worksheet task:** Students color the grasshopper to match what they see, label the body parts, and write one sentence describing what each part does (with teacher support as needed).\n\n5. **If using a video clip:** Play a short clip (20-30 seconds) of a grasshopper jumping and ask: \"How do those powerful back legs help the grasshopper survive?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you observe?\" \"Why do you think it does that?\" \"How might that help it stay alive?\"\n- Encourage students to look carefully rather than providing answers.\n- Help students notice details (e.g., \"Look at how thick those hind legs are—what does that tell you?\").\n- Manage live specimens carefully; ensure students are gentle and that grasshoppers are returned to proper containers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students identify at least 3-4 major body parts (legs, antennae, eyes, wings/body).\n- Students make inferences about what each part does (legs for movement/jumping, antennae for sensing, color for hiding, eyes for seeing).\n- Students create a labeled, colored diagram with written observations.\n- Students discuss variations they notice (e.g., \"This one is darker green than that one\").\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to survival concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Images of grasshoppers in grass habitat\n- Word cards (for vocabulary)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Bring students together. Ask 2-3 groups to share what they observed about one body part and what they think it does. Write their ideas on the board without correction.\n\n2. **Present key vocabulary and concepts:**\n\n   - **Antennae (plural; antenna is singular):** Long, thin sense organs on an insect's head that help it smell, taste, and feel vibrations in the air and ground. These help the grasshopper know what's around it.\n   \n   - **Camouflage:** Colors and patterns on an animal's body that help it blend in with its surroundings so predators cannot easily see it. The grasshopper's green color is camouflage in grass.\n   \n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or trait that helps an animal survive in its habitat. Grasshoppers' powerful hind legs are an adaptation for jumping away from danger.\n   \n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. Grasshoppers live in grasslands and meadows.\n   \n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals. Birds and snakes are predators of grasshoppers.\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph and observations:**\n   - \"Remember how we noticed the grasshopper's back legs are much bigger and stronger than the front legs? That's an **adaptation**. Those powerful legs help it jump up to 20 times its own body length! Imagine being able to jump as high as a building—that's the grasshopper's superpower for escaping predators.\"\n   - \"The green color we observed? That's **camouflage**. When a grasshopper sits still in grass, it disappears! Predators like birds have a hard time spotting it.\"\n   - \"Those wispy antennae we saw moving? They're the grasshopper's sensors. They help it detect danger, find food, and sense the environment around it. That's why **antennae** are so important for survival.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show the photograph again. Point to the grasshopper's back legs and ask: \"What do we call a body part that helps an animal survive? What's the job of these legs?\" (Expected answer: \"Adaptation. They help it jump away from danger.\")\n   - Ask: \"Why is the grasshopper's green color helpful in a grass **habitat**?\" (Expected answer: \"It helps it hide/blend in so predators can't see it. That's camouflage.\")\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Antennae** | Long, thin \"feelers\" on an insect's head that help it sense things around it like smells and vibrations. |\n| **Camouflage** | Colors and patterns that make an animal hard to see because it blends in with its surroundings. |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or skill that helps an animal survive in its home. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives, like grasslands or ponds. |\n| **Predator** | An animal that hunts and eats other animals for food. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can use vocabulary terms appropriately to describe grasshopper body parts and their functions.\n- Students understand that body structures help animals survive in their habitats.\n- Students recognize that not all grasshoppers are identical—individuals have variations in size, color, and other traits.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new scenario and deepen their knowledge of trait variation and survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of grasshoppers with different colors and sizes (light green, dark green, brown, large, small)\n- Scenario cards or worksheet\n- Chart paper for group discussion\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce a variation investigation:**\n   Display 3-4 images of different grasshoppers (varying in color and size). Ask: \"Look at these grasshoppers. Are they all exactly the same? What differences do you notice?\" (Students should note color, size, stripe patterns, etc.)\n\n2. **Present a survival scenario:**\n   \"Imagine a dry, brown field where all the grass has died. Now look at these grasshoppers again. A bird is hunting for food. Which grasshopper do you think the bird would spot first in the brown field? Why? Which grasshopper would have a harder time surviving there?\"\n\n3. **Guide students to understand trait variation and survival:**\n   - A light green grasshopper would stand out in a brown field (less likely to survive).\n   - A brown grasshopper would blend in better (more likely to survive).\n   - This shows that **variation in traits** (like color) affects survival chances.\n\n4. **Small group task – Survival Advantages:**\n   Assign groups one of these scenarios:\n   - **Group A:** \"A grasshopper with very long, powerful legs vs. a grasshopper with short, weak legs in a field full of hungry snakes. Which survives better? Why?\"\n   - **Group B:** \"A grasshopper with long antennae vs. a grasshopper with short antennae in a dark field at night. Which can find food and stay safe better? Why?\"\n   - **Group C:** \"A large grasshopper vs. a small grasshopper in a crowded grassland. Which can hide in the grass better? Which might find a mate easier? Why?\"\n\n5. **Groups discuss and prepare a simple explanation** (drawing + 1-2 sentences): \"This trait helps the grasshopper survive because...\"\n\n6. **Share out:** Each group presents their scenario. Connect back to the Engage discussion question: \"Variation in traits helps some grasshoppers survive better than others in their habitat.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate small group thinking by asking: \"How does this trait help it survive?\" and \"What would happen if the habitat changed?\"\n- Record group ideas on chart paper.\n- Reinforce the concept that survival depends on the match between a grasshopper's traits and its environment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students explain how specific traits (color, leg strength, antenna length) affect survival.\n- Students recognize that variations in a species exist and can influence success in a habitat.\n- Students are beginning to think about **adaptation** as a match between organism and environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of grasshopper body structures, their functions, and how traits relate to survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observe student engagement during Explore; note who identifies body parts and their functions accurately.\n- Review observation worksheets from Explore phase for accuracy in labeling and reasoning.\n- Listen to group discussions during Elaborate; note student use of vocabulary and understanding of trait variation.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide students with a simple illustration of a grasshopper. Ask them to complete ALL of the following (adjust difficulty as needed):\n\n1. **Label three body parts** and write what each one does. (e.g., \"Antennae—helps the grasshopper sense things around it\")\n\n2. **Answer this question in 2-3 sentences:**\n   \"Why is a grasshopper's green color helpful for surviving in a grassy field? What would happen if a grasshopper turned brown?\"\n\n3. **Draw and explain a variation:** \n   \"Draw two grasshoppers that look different from each other. Circle the one that would survive better in a brown, dry field. Explain why in one sentence.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Student correctly labels and explains the function of at least 3 body parts.\n\n✓ Student makes a clear connection between camouflage (green color) and survival in a grass habitat.\n\n✓ Student identifies a variation in grasshopper traits and explains how it affects survival.\n\n✓ Student uses at least two vocabulary terms accurately (adaptation, camouflage, habitat, predator, antennae).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most students will accurately label body parts and describe basic functions.\n- Most students will explain camouflage as a survival tool.\n- Students will show emerging understanding that variations in traits affect survival chances.\n- Advanced students will make sophisticated connections between trait variation, habitat, and survival (see Differentiation—Challenge).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Worksheet:** Provide a worksheet with pictures of grasshopper body parts already labeled (antennae, legs, eyes, body). Students only need to draw lines matching the part to its function from a word bank:\n   - Antennae → Sensing and feeling\n   - Legs → Jumping and running\n   - Eyes → Seeing\n   - Green color → Hiding in grass\n\n2. **Partner with Visual Supports:** Pair struggling readers/writers with a stronger peer or allow them to draw their observations instead of writing full sentences. Provide a sentence frame for the exit ticket: \"The grasshopper's [body part] helps it survive because _____.\"\n\n3. **Focus on One Adaptation:** Instead of learning all body parts, concentrate on one key adaptation (e.g., powerful hind legs) and repeat this concept across phases using consistent visual reminders.\n\n#### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deeper Trait Variation Analysis:** Provide images of 4-5 grasshoppers with different characteristics (colors, sizes, wing patterns). Ask students to predict which would survive best in three different habitats (tall grass, dry desert, rocky field) and justify their predictions with evidence.\n\n2. **Life Cycle and Adaptation Connection:** Challenge students to research and explain how a grasshopper's body changes as it grows through different life stages and how these changes relate to its habitat needs. This bridges to 3-LS1-1 (life cycles).\n\n3. **Design a New Habitat:** Ask: \"If we created a brand-new habitat for grasshoppers with bright purple plants, what traits would a grasshopper need to survive? Design a grasshopper that would thrive there.\" Students draw and label their design with adaptations explained.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grasshopper Life Cycle Research (15-20 minutes)**\n   Students research or watch a short video about the grasshopper life cycle (egg → nymph → adult), noting that body structures change as grasshoppers grow. They create a simple diagram showing how the legs and antennae develop and become larger/stronger at each stage. This connects to 3-LS1-1.\n\n2. **Predator-Prey Role Play (20-25 minutes)**\n   Students play a \"predator-prey\" game: some students are \"grasshoppers\" (moving across an open space), others are \"birds\" (trying to catch them). In one round, all grasshoppers are bright red (no camouflage); in a second round, most are green. Debrief: \"Why were more grasshoppers caught in the red round? What does this tell us about camouflage and survival?\" This reinforces adaptation in a kinesthetic, memorable way.\n\n3. **Insect Adaptation Museum Gallery Walk (30 minutes)**\n   Students research one other insect (butterfly, ladybug, stick insect, beetle, ant) and create a poster showing an illustration, labeled body parts, and an explanation of how each part helps it survive. Display posters around the room as a \"museum.\" Students do a gallery walk and compare adaptations across insects. This deepens understanding of variation and diversity while connecting to 3-LS4-3 (organisms survive well or less well in specific habitats).\n\n---\n\nThis lesson grounds abstract concepts in concrete observation and maintains student engagement through active exploration and discussion. The photograph serves as the anchor for all five phases, and students repeatedly return to the image to deepen their understanding of how structure relates to function and survival.",
