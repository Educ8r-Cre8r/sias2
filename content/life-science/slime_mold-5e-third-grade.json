ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of slime mold (high-quality digital display)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: printed photograph (one per pair or small group)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or smart board. Say: *\"Look carefully at this image. I found something very strange and interesting on a forest walk. What do you see?\"* Allow 20-30 seconds of quiet observation.\n\n2. **Facilitate initial discussion** using these questions:\n   - *\"What do you think this yellow thing might be? Is it a plant, an animal, or something else?\"*\n   - *\"Where do you think this is growing? What do you see around it?\"* (Guide them to notice the brown leaves, wood chips, and forest debris)\n   - *\"Have you ever seen anything like this before?\"*\n   - *\"Do you think this is alive? What makes you think so?\"*\n\n3. **Create a class \"Wonder Wall\"** on chart paper. Ask: *\"What questions do you have about this mystery creature?\"* Record student wonderings (don't answer yet). Examples might include: \"How does it grow?\" \"What does it eat?\" \"Is it slimy?\" \"Why is it yellow?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** *\"I'm going to tell you this is actually a living thing. Before we learn more, write on a sticky note: Do you think this creature is more like a plant or more like an animal? Why?\"* Collect and display predictions.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today and tomorrow, we're going to become forest detectives and investigate this mysterious creature to figure out what it really is and why it lives where it does.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photographs of slime mold in different growth stages (if available; if not, use the main image)\n- Magnifying glasses (one per pair)\n- Printed observation worksheets (see directions below)\n- Color pencils or crayons\n- Optional: real slime mold specimen in a clear container (if safely available; not required)\n- Modeling clay (yellow, brown, or natural colors)\n- Small wood chips or twigs\n- Shallow containers or paper plates\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Detailed Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Provide each pair of students** with a high-quality printed image (or use magnifying glasses to examine the projected image in sections).\n\n2. **Direct students:** *\"Use the magnifying glass to look very closely at your photograph. You are looking for details. What do you notice about the texture? The color? The shape? How many different shapes do you see?\"*\n\n3. **Students draw and label** on their observation worksheet:\n   - A large, detailed drawing of what they see\n   - Labels for colors they observe\n   - Words describing the texture (bumpy, spongy, smooth, bumpy, etc.)\n   - A count or estimate of how many separate pieces they see\n\n4. **Ask:** *\"Look at what's around the yellow creature. What do you see? Is it alive? Dead? Why might the creature be growing there?\"*\n\n**Part B: Building a Habitat Model (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:** *\"We know this creature lives on dead wood and leaves on the forest floor. Let's build a miniature forest floor home where a slime mold might live.\"*\n\n2. **Provide materials:** Shallow container, twigs, wood chips, leaf pieces, soil (if available), and yellow modeling clay.\n\n3. **Student directions:**\n   - Build a forest floor scene in your container using the wood, chips, and leaves\n   - Shape your yellow clay into a slime mold (or multiple fruiting bodies—the structures you see in the photo)\n   - Place your slime mold where you think it would actually grow\n   - Be ready to explain: *\"Why did you put it there? What does it need to survive in this habitat?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: *\"What does your creature need to grow?\"* *\"Why did you put it in that spot?\"* *\"What would happen if you put it somewhere dry?\"*\n- Avoid confirming answers; instead, encourage thinking: *\"That's a great observation! What made you think that?\"*\n- Take photographs of student models for documentation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe and document specific details (texture, color, shape variation)\n- Students will construct habitats showing understanding that slime molds live on dead wood and decaying material\n- Students will begin reasoning about *why* certain places are better homes for this organism\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Printed slime mold fact sheet (teacher-created, simple language)\n- Word cards with vocabulary terms (large, visible)\n- Images showing slime mold life stages (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):** \n   - Invite 2-3 student pairs to show their habitat models and explain their thinking\n   - Ask the class: *\"What did you notice about where your slime mold lived? What was always nearby?\"*\n   - Guide them to recognize: dead wood, dead leaves, moist/dark places\n\n2. **Teacher Mini-Lesson (8-10 minutes):**\n   - *\"Here's something amazing: What you see in this photo is NOT a plant, and it's NOT an animal. It's in its own special group called a slime mold. Scientists discovered that slime molds are actually very simple living things that are more like fungi than anything else.\"*\n   \n   - *\"Slime molds do something really important in the forest. They are decomposers. That means they break down dead things—dead leaves, dead wood, dead plants. This is a really important job! Without decomposers, dead plants would pile up forever, and forests wouldn't have room to grow new plants.\"*\n   \n   - *\"Slime molds need three things to survive: moisture (it's wet and damp where they live), darkness (they don't grow in bright sunlight), and dead organic matter (dead stuff to eat). The forest floor gives them all three things!\"*\n\n   - Show the photo again: *\"What you're looking at are the fruiting bodies—the yellow parts. That's the part that makes spores, kind of like how plants make seeds. This helps new slime molds grow in other places.\"*\n\n3. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - *\"Turn and talk to a partner: Why would a slime mold NOT survive on a sunny, open field with no dead plants?\"*\n   - Listen to partner conversations; use responses to gauge understanding\n   - Ask 2-3 students to share aloud\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Decomposer** | A living thing that breaks down dead plants and animals and turns them back into soil |\n| **Habitat** | The home of a living thing—the place where it lives and finds everything it needs |\n| **Organism** | A living thing (can be very small or very large) |\n| **Fruiting Body** | The part of a slime mold that releases spores (the yellow parts you see) |\n| **Spores** | Tiny, tiny parts that a slime mold releases to make new slime molds in other places |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will understand that slime molds are living organisms with a unique role (decomposers)\n- Students will explain that slime molds live in specific habitats (moist, dark, with dead organic matter)\n- Students will use vocabulary terms to describe what they observed in the photograph\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Scenario cards (printed, one per group)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Images or drawings of different forest habitats (rainforest floor, dry desert, sunny meadow, swamp)\n- Optional: brief video clip of slime mold time-lapse growth (2-3 minutes, if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Application:**\n\n1. **Divide the class into small groups** (3-4 students per group). Assign each group one scenario card. Examples:\n\n   **Scenario 1:** \"A forest has LOTS of dead leaves and branches on the ground. It's dark and damp. Can slime molds survive here? Why or why not?\"\n\n   **Scenario 2:** \"A sunny, open field has very little dead plants. It's dry. Can slime molds survive here? Why or why not?\"\n\n   **Scenario 3:** \"A swampy area has tons of rotting wood, it's very wet and dark. Can slime molds survive here? Why or why not?\"\n\n   **Scenario 4:** \"A desert is hot, dry, and has very little dead plant material. Can slime molds survive here? Why or why not?\"\n\n2. **Student task:**\n   - Read your scenario as a group\n   - Discuss: Can a slime mold survive here? Why or why not?\n   - Use what you learned about what slime molds need (moisture, darkness, dead organic matter)\n   - Draw a picture of that habitat and write 2-3 sentences explaining your answer\n   - Be ready to explain to the class\n\n3. **Group presentations (3-4 minutes total):**\n   - Each group shares their scenario and answer\n   - Classmates give a \"thumbs up\" if they agree, with a reason why\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Listen for accurate use of habitat and decomposer concepts\n- Ask follow-up questions: *\"What would you need to change about this habitat to help slime molds survive there?\"* or *\"What would happen if we added more dead wood to the desert?\"*\n- Guide groups to think about the three key needs (moisture, darkness, food)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will apply their understanding of habitat requirements to new scenarios\n- Students will construct evidence-based arguments about organism survival\n- Students will explain how environmental conditions affect living things\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Observation of student models during Explore phase (did they place slime molds in appropriate habitats?)\n- Listen to turn-and-talk discussions in Explain phase\n- Circulate during Elaborate scenarios and listen for reasoning about habitat needs\n- Collect observation worksheets and habitat drawings\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (end of Day 2, 5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple form or ask them to answer on a half-sheet:\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Look at this picture of a slime mold.** (Show the original photo or a new slime mold image)\n   - *Draw a circle around where you think this slime mold is living.*\n   - *Tell me one reason why slime molds like to live in places like this.*\n\n2. **What is ONE important job that slime molds do in the forest?**\n   - Answer choices (or open-ended): \n     - [ ] They make food for animals\n     - [ ] They break down dead plants and turn them into soil\n     - [ ] They grow fruits and vegetables\n\n3. **A student says: \"I'm going to look for slime molds in my backyard on a sunny day on a patch of grass with no dead leaves.\"** \n   - *Do you think the student will find slime molds? Why or why not? (Hint: Think about what slime molds need.)*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Student correctly identifies that slime molds live on dead wood/leaves in damp areas\n✓ Student explains that slime molds are decomposers (break down dead things)\n✓ Student predicts correctly whether slime molds can survive in a given habitat, using reasoning about moisture, darkness, and dead organic matter\n✓ Student uses vocabulary terms correctly (decomposer, habitat, organism)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify the habitat requirements for slime molds\n- 75% of students will explain decomposer role accurately\n- Students will demonstrate understanding through drawings, written responses, and verbal explanations\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for students who need extra help):\n\n1. **Sentence Starters and Word Banks:**\n   - During Elaborate scenarios, provide sentence frames:\n     - *\"Slime molds CAN / CANNOT live here because _____________.\"*\n     - *\"Slime molds need _____________, _____________, and _____________.\"*\n   - Provide a word bank: moisture, darkness, dead plants, sunshine, dry, wet\n\n2. **Paired Observation:**\n   - Pair struggling readers/writers with a stronger partner during observation worksheet and habitat building\n   - Allow drawings with labels instead of written explanations\n\n3. **Simplified Vocabulary:**\n   - Use consistent, simpler language: *\"breaks down dead things\"* instead of *\"decomposes\"*\n   - Create illustrated vocabulary cards with pictures for each term\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deep Dive Research:**\n   - Provide access to kid-friendly articles or videos about slime mold reproduction and life cycle\n   - Ask: *\"Slime molds produce spores. How is this like how plants make seeds? How is it different?\"*\n   - Have students create a life cycle diagram (birth → growth → reproduction → death) for a slime mold\n\n2. **Design Challenge:**\n   - *\"Design the PERFECT slime mold habitat. What would you include? Draw it and label all the things that make it perfect for slime molds. Why is each thing important?\"*\n   - Can include elements beyond the forest floor (different moisture levels, light sources, types of organic matter)\n\n3. **Real-World Problem Solving:**\n   - *\"A forest is covered in plastic and pollution—no dead leaves or wood. Slime molds are disappearing. How could we help them survive? What would we need to do?\"*\n   - This bridges to 3-LS4-4 (solutions to environmental change)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Field Investigation (if safe and feasible):**\n   - Take students on a nature walk to search for slime molds, fungi, and decomposers on the school grounds\n   - Provide small collection containers and magnifying glasses\n   - Students photograph and document findings\n   - Return to class and add discoveries to a \"Decomposers in Our School\" poster\n\n2. **Life Cycle Time-Lapse Project:**\n   - If a real slime mold specimen is available (culture from a biological supplier or collected safely), place it in a moist container with dead wood\n   - Take daily photographs over 1-2 weeks\n   - Create a time-lapse video or photo sequence poster showing growth and fruiting body formation\n   - Connect to 3-LS1-1: *\"All living things have a life cycle: birth, growth, reproduction, and death. Here's what a slime mold life cycle looks like!\"*\n\n3. **Decomposer Food Web:**\n   - Expand to explore the role of all decomposers (bacteria, fungi, worms, insects) in a forest ecosystem\n   - Create a food web diagram showing how dead leaves → decomposers → soil → new plants\n   - Discuss: *\"Without decomposers, where would all the dead leaves go?\"* (Connects to ecosystem cycles)\n\n4. **Book Connection:**\n   - Read aloud *\"The Decomposers: Insects and Fungi\"* or similar picture book\n   - Discuss other decomposers and their habitats\n   - Have students create a \"Decomposer Fact Card\" for slime molds to add to a classroom decomposer collection\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Real specimen optional but powerful:** If you can safely obtain a slime mold culture (available from biological suppliers or collected from a local forest), the impact on student engagement and learning is significant. However, the lesson is fully functional with high-quality photographs alone.\n  \n- **Safety consideration:** Ensure students understand not to touch unidentified fungi or organisms on nature walks without adult supervision. Slime molds are harmless, but this reinforces science practice of careful observation.\n\n- **Photography documentation:** Take photos of student models, drawings, and exit tickets—these create excellent visual evidence of learning for portfolios and parent communication.\n\n- **Vocabulary scaffold:** Write vocabulary terms on sentence strips and keep them visible throughout both days. Refer back to them during discussions.\n\n- **Connection to curriculum:** This lesson naturally extends into food chains/webs, nutrient cycles, and ecosystem roles in upper elementary grades.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is ready to implement and honors the wonder visible in your slime mold photograph while building genuine life science understanding aligned to Third Grade standards.",
