Observe and describe the parts of a sprouting seed (shell, stem, leaves, developing bud).\n2. Explain that seeds grow into plants with different body parts that have jobs (stem holds up the plant, leaves catch sunlight, seeds make new plants).\n3. Compare a seed to a sprout to a growing plant and identify how they are alike and different.\n4. Use pictures or drawings to show how a plant grows and changes over time.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printout or digital display of the photograph (sunflower seed sprouting)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen where all students can see clearly. Point to different parts as you introduce it.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What color is it?\"\n   - \"What do you think this green part is? Have you ever seen something like it before?\"\n   - \"Look at the top part—what do you notice about how it looks different from the green stem?\"\n   - \"Do you think this plant started out looking like this, or did it change? How?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:**\n   - \"I'm going to tell you that this used to be a tiny seed, just this big [show pinch with fingers]. Do you believe me? Why or why not?\"\n   - Write student predictions on chart paper: *\"We think seeds grow into plants because...\"*\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be plant detectives. We're going to watch seeds start to grow, just like the one in this picture, and discover how seeds change!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover plant growth concepts through hands-on observation and exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-soaked bean seeds (soak dried beans overnight so they're at the sprouting stage)\n- Clear plastic cups or small clear containers (one per student or pair)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Observation sheets (simple diagram with labels: seed shell, stem, leaves, roots)\n- Colored pencils\n- Paper towels or soil (optional, for realistic growing medium)\n- Water in spray bottles\n\n**Activity — \"Seed Detective Investigation\":**\n\n1. **Set up stations:** Place each sprouting seed in a clear cup where students can see it from all sides. If seeds haven't sprouted yet, use pre-sprouted seeds or overnight-soaked seeds showing cracks and tiny white roots.\n\n2. **Student directions (read aloud and demonstrate):**\n   - \"Pick up your seed carefully. Look at it with your hand lens. What do you see?\"\n   - \"Can you find the hard shell on the outside? Gently touch it.\"\n   - \"Now look for the tiny white part starting to come out. That's the beginning of the root!\"\n   - \"Look for any tiny green leaves starting to peek out.\"\n   - \"Draw what you see on your observation sheet. Use your colors to show the parts.\"\n\n3. **Guided observations:**\n   - Teacher circulates and asks: \"What color is the shell?\" \"What's the smallest part you can see?\" \"Is it hard or soft?\"\n   - Encourage students to use the hand lens and compare their seed to the photograph.\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Students color and label their observation drawings with teacher support (shell, stem, tiny leaves).\n   - Take a class photo of each student's seed with their name for a growth timeline.\n\n5. **Connection to photograph:**\n   - Hold up the photograph. \"This seed is further along in growing than ours. See? The green stem is longer, and the leaves are bigger. That's going to happen to your seed too!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask probing questions without giving answers: \"What do you think this white part does?\" \"How is your seed different from the picture?\"\n- Support students in using hand lenses correctly.\n- Record student observations on audio or by writing down direct quotes.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify and draw at least 2–3 parts of a sprouting seed (shell, white root beginning, tiny green growth).\n- Students compare their seed to the photograph and notice similarities and differences.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled diagram of sprouting seed (prepared in advance)\n- Photograph displayed\n- Word cards with pictures (seed, stem, leaf, roots, sprout)\n- Simple life cycle diagram (seed → sprout → plant with leaves and buds)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore:**\n   - Ask 3–4 students to share what they observed: \"What was the hardest part to see?\" \"What surprised you?\"\n   - Display student drawings on the board.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary using the photograph and a large labeled diagram:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Seed:** A small package that has everything needed to grow into a plant (inside the hard shell is a tiny baby plant).\n   - **Stem:** The green part that grows up from the seed; it holds the plant up and carries water to the leaves.\n   - **Leaves:** The flat green parts that catch sunlight and help the plant make food.\n   - **Roots:** The white parts that grow down into the soil; they drink water for the plant.\n   - **Sprout:** A seed that has just started to grow and is showing its first stem and leaves.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to each part on the photograph. \"See the green stem? That's what we saw starting as a tiny white bump in your seed.\"\n   - \"The leaves at the top are bigger in the picture because this plant has been growing longer than yours.\"\n   - \"Roots were growing down (out of view) while the stem was growing up.\"\n\n4. **Introduce the idea of a life cycle (simple version):**\n   - Show a simple picture sequence: Tiny seed → Seed sprouting → Small plant with green leaves → Larger plant with flower bud (as in photo).\n   - \"Seeds grow into sprouts, and sprouts grow into bigger plants. It takes time!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Point to the stem in the picture. Now point to the stem in your drawing.\"\n   - Ask: \"What do roots do? Where do they grow?\" (Look for: \"Down into dirt\" / \"They drink water\")\n   - Use thumbs up/sideways/down to gauge understanding.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name at least 3 parts of a sprouting seed/plant.\n- Students understand that seeds have baby plants inside and grow over time.\n- Students can explain one job of a plant part (stem holds up the plant, leaves catch light, roots drink water).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by mimicking plant structures and planning plant care.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Green pipe cleaners, straws, or craft sticks (for stems)\n- Tissue paper or construction paper leaves\n- Cotton balls or pom-poms (for seed heads)\n- Glue sticks\n- Markers\n- \"Plant Care\" planning chart (teacher-made)\n\n**Activity — \"Design a Sprout\" or \"Plan to Grow Your Seed\":**\n\n**Option A: Design a Sprout Model**\n- Students create a simple 3D or 2D model of a sprouting seed using craft materials.\n- They label the parts and explain to a partner: \"My stem does...\" \"My leaves help the plant...\"\n- This connects to NGSS 1-LS1-1 by having students mimic plant structures.\n\n**Option B: Plant Care Plan (Real-World Application)**\n1. Each student receives a \"Plant Care Planning Sheet\" with simple pictures showing:\n   - Watering the plant (with water droplets)\n   - Putting the plant in sunlight (with sun picture)\n   - Checking on the plant (with magnifying glass)\n\n2. **Teacher facilitates:**\n   - \"Your seed is growing at home or in class. What does it need to grow big and strong?\"\n   - Students draw or point to what a growing plant needs.\n   - Ask: \"Where will you put your plant so it gets light?\" \"How often will you give it water?\"\n\n3. **Make predictions:**\n   - \"In one week, what will your seed look like? Can you draw it?\"\n   - Have students sketch a prediction of their plant one week from now.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Why did you choose that color for the leaf?\" \"How is your model the same as the seed in the picture?\"\n- Support students in making connections between plant parts and their functions.\n- Document predictions for comparison later.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a model or plan showing understanding of plant structure and growth needs.\n- Students make predictions about their plant's future growth.\n- Students articulate one way plants are adapted to survive (need water, need light).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant growth and structures.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Can they identify plant parts?\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain phase: Do they use vocabulary correctly?\n- Review observation drawings for accurate detail and labeling.\n- Ask individual students to point to plant parts and explain their jobs.\n\n**Summative Assessment — \"Seed to Plant Exit Ticket\":**\n\nProvide each student with a simple three-part picture card or have them draw:\n\n1. **Draw a tiny seed.** (Success: Shows a small shape, possibly with a shell indicated)\n2. **Draw a sprout.** (Success: Shows a stem, a white root, and/or tiny green leaves)\n3. **Draw a bigger plant.** (Success: Shows a taller stem, larger leaves, and a bud or flower, similar to the photograph)\n\n**Assessment Questions (teacher asks one-on-one or students show with fingers/thumbs):**\n- \"Which picture shows the seed just starting to grow?\" (Students point to sprout)\n- \"What does the stem do?\" (Expected answer: \"It holds up the plant\" / \"It grows up\")\n- \"Where do roots grow?\" (Expected answer: \"In the dirt/ground\" / \"Down\")\n- \"How are the sprout and the big plant alike?\" (Expected answer: \"They both have stems and leaves\")\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student accurately draws three stages showing growth.\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies at least 2 plant parts.\n- ✓ Student explains one function of a plant part.\n- ✓ Student recognizes that plants change and grow from seeds.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will accurately depict growth over time with recognizable plant parts.\n- Students will explain basic plant functions using vocabulary introduced in the lesson.\n- Students will make accurate comparisons between the photograph, their seed, and other plant stages.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-labeled observation sheets:** Provide diagrams with parts already labeled and outlined; students only need to color and point to parts. This reduces fine-motor and writing demands.\n\n2. **Seed observation station with teacher:** Seat students with an adult who asks guiding questions and helps use the hand lens. Provide a pre-sprouted seed that is clearly showing parts (not a barely-sprouted seed).\n\n3. **Simplified exit ticket:** Instead of drawing all three stages, student points to a pre-drawn picture showing seed, sprout, and plant. Teacher asks, \"Which one is growing?\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Root and shoot investigation:** Ask advanced students to predict and then observe: \"Which part grows up? Which part grows down? Why?\" Have them hypothesize about why and design a simple experiment (e.g., plant a seed sideways; what happens?).\n\n2. **Extend the life cycle:** Provide pictures of a flowering plant and seed-bearing stage. \"What comes after the plant grows big leaves? Can you put these pictures in order?\"\n\n3. **Plant adaptations exploration:** Show pictures of different seeds (dandelion parachute, coconut, burr, bean) and ask, \"How is each seed different? What might each seed do to survive and spread to new places?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Weekly Growth Journal (1–2 weeks):**\n   - Students observe and draw their sprouting seeds 2–3 times per week.\n   - Create a class growth chart on the board tracking the tallest stem length.\n   - Compare drawings over time: \"How did your plant change from last week?\"\n   - Connects to 1-LS3-1 (observing change over time).\n\n2. **Plant Needs Experiment:**\n   - Set up 3 simple plant setups: one with water + light, one with water only (dark), one with light only (no water).\n   - Observe over one week: Which plant grows best? What does a plant need to grow?\n   - Have students predict and record which will grow best (real-world application of NGSS 1-LS1-1).\n\n3. **Parent-Child Plant Similarity:**\n   - If you plant a sunflower seed (like in the photo), students can compare: \"How is the baby sunflower plant like the parent sunflower plant?\" / \"How is it different?\"\n   - Take photos at different stages and create a class \"family album\" for the plant (connects to 1-LS3-1: young plants are like, but not exactly like, parents).\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson works best spread across 2–3 days. Do Engage/Explore Day 1, Explain/Elaborate Day 2, Evaluate Day 3 after students have observed seeds for several days.\n- **Seed sourcing:** Use dried beans or sunflower seeds from the grocery store. Soak them overnight before the Explore phase to ensure visible sprouting.\n- **Classroom environment:** Keep sprouted seeds in a visible location where students can observe daily growth. This extends the lesson naturally into the following weeks.\n- **Photo integration:** Keep the original photograph visible throughout the lesson. Students will return to it repeatedly, building deeper understanding with each phase.",
