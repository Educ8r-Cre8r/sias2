ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about life cycles and help students understand that this photograph is a teaching tool about nature, not something to fear.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (large format, 8.5\" × 11\" minimum) or projected image\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"Wonder Wall\" (a designated bulletin board or poster space)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Introduction & Display:**\nDisplay the photograph on the board or projection screen. Before revealing what it is, show just a close-up of the terrain (grass, soil, leaves) and ask:\n\n1. **\"What habitat do you see in this picture? What clues tell you what kind of place this is?\"** (Students identify forest floor, grass, soil — nature environment)\n\n2. Reveal the full image. Say: **\"This photograph shows a real animal in nature. What do you notice? What questions come to mind?\"**\n\n3. **\"This is a deer that has died. In nature, all living things eventually die. What do you wonder about what happens next? Where does the deer go?\"**\n\n4. **\"If we could follow this deer's story backward in time, what do you think its life looked like when it was younger? What did it need to live?\"**\n\nPrompt students to share observations without judgment. Normalize the conversation: *\"Death is a natural part of life for all living things — plants, animals, and even people. Today, we're going to learn about the complete life story of animals like this deer.\"*\n\n**Record Wonder Questions:** Write 2-3 student questions on a \"Wonder Wall\" to revisit at the lesson's end (e.g., \"What eats dead animals?\" \"Does the deer go back into the ground?\" \"How long does it take?\").\n\n**Transition:** *\"Over the next two days, we're going to trace the life cycle of a deer — from birth to adulthood to death — and discover what happens to animals in nature.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate life cycles through hands-on modeling and discovery.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper plates (one per student)\n- Colored pencils, crayons, or markers\n- Pictures of deer at different life stages (found via Google Images: fawn, young buck, adult doe, adult buck) — print 4-6 images\n- Scissors\n- Glue sticks\n- String or brads (fasteners)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Setup:**\nOrganize students into small groups (3-4 students). Display the stage pictures on a table or board where all can see.\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **\"You are going to create a Life Cycle Wheel for a deer. On your paper plate, you'll show the four stages of a deer's life: birth, growth, reproduction, and death.\"**\n\n2. **\"Divide your paper plate into 4 sections by folding it gently or drawing lines.\"** (Teacher models this.)\n\n3. **\"In each section, draw or glue a picture of a deer at that stage of life. You can use the pictures we have, or draw your own.\"**\n   - **Section 1 (Birth):** Fawn (baby deer) just born\n   - **Section 2 (Growth):** Young deer growing larger\n   - **Section 3 (Reproduction/Adult):** Adult deer (mother or father)\n   - **Section 4 (Death):** Deer at the end of its life\n\n4. **\"Label each section with the stage name: BIRTH, GROWTH, REPRODUCTION, DEATH.\"** (Teacher provides word cards if needed.)\n\n5. **\"On the back of your plate, write or draw one thing that deer need during their life to survive: food, water, shelter, or space.\"**\n\n**Connection to Photograph:**\nExplain: *\"The deer in our photograph is at the death stage — the last stage of the life cycle. This is natural. Every living thing goes through all four stages.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking: *\"Tell me about this stage. What is the deer doing? What does it need?\"* \n- Avoid providing answers; instead, guide with questions: *\"What do fawns look like? How are they different from adult deer?\"*\n- Provide sentence starters if needed: *\"In the ____ stage, the deer is ___.\"*\n\n**Documentation:**\nStudents complete their Life Cycle Wheels and keep them for the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation of all four life cycle stages\n- Students identify at least one survival need (food, water, shelter, or space)\n- Students recognize that death is the natural final stage\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Build vocabulary and solidify understanding of life cycles using student work and the original photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student Life Cycle Wheels from Explore\n- Projected photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Picture of a living deer (healthy adult)\n- Picture of a fawn with mother deer (if available)\n- Vocabulary cards with images\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\nInvite 2-3 groups to share their Life Cycle Wheels. Ask:\n- *\"What does your deer look like in the birth stage? What about the growth stage?\"*\n- *\"How is the fawn different from the adult?\"*\n- *\"Why do you think we include 'death' in the life cycle?\"*\n\n**Introduce Vocabulary** (write and display each with a simple picture):\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Life Cycle** | The stages that all living things go through: being born, growing, making babies, and eventually dying. |\n| **Birth** | When a new animal is born and begins life. |\n| **Growth** | The stage when an animal gets bigger and stronger. |\n| **Reproduction** | When adult animals have babies. (Alternative simpler term: \"Making babies\") |\n| **Death** | When a living thing stops living. This is a natural part of the life cycle. |\n| **Habitat** | A place in nature where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. |\n\n**Direct Instruction:**\n\nDisplay the photograph again and say:\n*\"This photograph shows a deer at the death stage of its life cycle. This is natural and happens to all living things. When this deer was a baby — a fawn — it looked like this [show fawn picture]. The mother deer helped take care of it. As it grew, it got bigger and stronger, eating grass and other plants from its habitat. When it was an adult, it found a mate and had babies of its own. Now, its life cycle is complete. Its body will decompose and return nutrients to the soil — that means it breaks down and becomes part of the earth again. This helps new plants grow, which feed other animals. Even in death, this deer is part of the ecosystem.\"*\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n\nAsk students:\n1. *\"Can you show me on your Life Cycle Wheel where the deer in the photograph is?\"* (Students point to \"Death\" section)\n2. *\"Name the four stages of a life cycle.\"* (Students respond chorally or individually)\n3. *\"Is death a sad, scary thing, or a natural part of life?\"* (Guide to: \"It's a natural part. All living things die.\")\n\n**Connection Back to Photograph:**\n*\"Our photograph is helping us understand that death is not the end of a story — it's just one important part of nature's story.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name the four life cycle stages\n- Students understand that death is natural and happens to all living things\n- Students recognize that the deer in the photograph represents the death stage of the life cycle\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply life cycle understanding to a different animal and deepen awareness of how habitats support life.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of different animals (rabbit, bird, fox, butterfly, fish) — one per small group\n- Large paper or poster board\n- Markers, crayons\n- Sentence stem handout (printed or written on board)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario:**\n*\"Now that we understand the deer's life cycle, let's explore how other animals in the same habitat also have life cycles. Your group will choose a different forest animal and create a quick life cycle story.\"*\n\n**Group Task:**\n\n1. **Assign each small group a different animal** (rabbit, bird, fox, butterfly, or another forest creature).\n\n2. **Groups create a simple 4-stage life cycle poster** showing birth, growth, reproduction, and death for their animal. They can:\n   - Draw pictures\n   - Write labels\n   - Use sentence stems: *\"When a ____ is born, it is very _____. As it grows, it learns to _____. As an adult, it _____. Eventually, all _____ die, and their bodies return to the earth.\"*\n\n3. **Groups present their animal's life cycle** (1-2 minutes each).\n\n4. **Discussion:** \n   - *\"All of these animals live in the same forest habitat as the deer. What do they all need to survive?\"* (Food, water, shelter, space)\n   - *\"What happens when one animal dies? Does it affect the other animals?\"* (Guide to: Living things are connected; dead animals can feed other animals or help plants grow)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide sentence stems and word banks for students who need support\n- Ask probing questions: *\"What does your animal eat? Where does it sleep?\"*\n- Listen for understanding of the complete life cycle, not just birth and growth\n\n**Real-World Connection:**\n*\"In real forests, when the deer dies, other animals like foxes, raccoons, and birds will eat from its body. This is called decomposition. The dead deer feeds other animals and helps the forest stay healthy. Nothing is wasted in nature.\"* (Keep the tone factual and scientific, not graphic.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a life cycle model for a different animal\n- Students understand that different animals in the same habitat all go through similar life cycle stages\n- Students recognize that death and decomposition are part of how ecosystems work\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess students' understanding of life cycles and the role of death in nature.\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- Observation of Life Cycle Wheel accuracy (all 4 stages present and correctly labeled)\n- Listening to student explanations during group shares (do they mention survival needs? do they understand death is natural?)\n- Questioning during Explain phase (can they name the stages and point to them?)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nDistribute an index card to each student. Students respond to one or more of the following (adjust based on reading level; may use drawings, words, or both):\n\n**Option 1 (Drawing + Label):**\n*\"Draw a picture of a deer at one stage of its life cycle. Label the stage (birth, growth, reproduction, or death). Write one thing the deer needs to live at that stage.\"*\n\n**Option 2 (Response Prompt):**\n*\"Why is death a natural part of a deer's life cycle? Use one or two sentences.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n✓ Student identifies at least one correct life cycle stage  \n✓ Student recognizes that death is part of the life cycle (not separate from it)  \n✓ Student mentions at least one survival need (food, water, shelter, space)  \n✓ Student demonstrates understanding that life cycles are common to all living things  \n\n**Quick Check:**\nCollect exit tickets. Review for:\n- Misconceptions (e.g., \"Death is bad\" rather than \"Death is natural\")\n- Gaps in understanding (e.g., reproduction stage unclear)\n- Use these insights to inform reteaching or small-group discussions in the next lesson\n\n**Return to Wonder Wall:**\nBefore closing, revisit 1-2 questions students asked in Engage:\n- *\"Who wondered what happens to the deer's body? Now we know decomposition happens — the body breaks down and feeds other living things and the soil.\"*\n- *\"Does this answer any of your questions?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Life Cycle Graphic Organizer:**\n   - Provide a pre-drawn or partially filled Life Cycle Wheel with pictures already placed; students add labels and survival needs\n   - Use simplified language: \"Baby,\" \"Big,\" \"Baby-Making,\" \"Died\" instead of \"Birth,\" \"Growth,\" \"Reproduction,\" \"Death\"\n\n2. **Sentence Stems & Word Banks:**\n   - Provide written sentence starters and a word bank on index cards for writing or labeling activities\n   - Example: *\"A fawn is a baby ____. It eats ____. It drinks ____.\"*\n\n3. **Peer Partnerships:**\n   - Pair struggling students with a partner during Explore and Elaborate phases\n   - Partner can read picture labels aloud or help organize materials\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Ecosystem Connections:**\n   - Ask: *\"When the deer dies, what other animals might eat it? Draw a food chain showing the deer and 2-3 other animals.\"*\n   - Extend: *\"How does the death of one animal help another animal survive?\"*\n\n2. **Lifespan Investigation:**\n   - Provide information cards showing how long different animals live (deer: 6-15 years; rabbit: 5-9 years; butterfly: weeks to months; turtle: 20-150 years)\n   - Task: *\"Create a chart comparing lifespans. Which animals live the longest? Why might some animals live longer than others?\"* (Connect to habitat, size, predators)\n\n3. **Decomposition Research:**\n   - Introduce the term \"decomposition\" formally and ask: *\"What organisms help break down dead animals?\" (earthworms, insects, bacteria)*\n   - Provide a diagram of decomposition and ask students to explain the steps in their own words\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Observation Journal: Outdoor Scavenger Hunt**\n   - Take students outside to find evidence of decomposition or the life cycle in nature (dead leaves, fallen branches, insects, etc.)\n   - Students sketch what they find and write: \"This shows the ____ stage of a life cycle because ____\"\n   - Discuss: *\"How does nature recycle dead things?\"*\n\n2. **Animal Biography Project:**\n   - Assign each student or pair an animal\n   - Task: Write a 3-5 sentence \"life story\" for that animal, including all four life cycle stages (birth, growth, reproduction, death)\n   - Include illustrations for each stage\n   - Compile into a class book: *\"Life Cycles in Our Forest\"*\n\n3. **Compare Lifespans: Graph & Discussion**\n   - Provide a data chart of lifespans for 5-8 different animals\n   - Students create a simple bar graph or pictograph showing which animals live the longest\n   - Discussion: *\"Why do you think some animals live longer? What helps them survive longer?\"*\n   - Connect to habitats and adaptations (sets up future lessons on 3-LS4-2)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Tone & Sensitivity:** Frame the photograph and death as a scientific, natural occurrence—not something morbid or upsetting. Use language like \"the deer's life cycle is complete\" rather than \"the deer is dead.\"\n- **Parental Communication:** If families have concerns, send a brief note home explaining that the lesson uses real nature photography to teach about life cycles—a key third-grade standard—and that discussions are age-appropriate and scientific.\n- **Before the Lesson:** Consider your students' prior experiences with loss. Have counselor or social-emotional resources available if needed, but most students at this age handle it well when framed correctly.\n- **Follow-Up:** This lesson naturally leads to lessons on food chains/webs (3-LS2-1), adaptation (3-LS4-2), and ecosystems (3-LS4-3).",
