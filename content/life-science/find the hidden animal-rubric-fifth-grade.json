        "exceeds": "Student explains effects on multiple organisms (predators and prey) with specific reasoning; may discuss food chains or predator-prey relationships affected by the camouflaged animal's success.",

      "dokLevel": 3,
      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student predicts that camouflage would become less effective because the animal's coloring matches rocks, not sand, and explains consequences (e.g., increased predation, need to adapt or relocate); may mention adaptation over time.",
        "meets": "Student predicts that the animal's camouflage would not work as well in sand and explains that the animal could be more easily seen by predators.",
        "approaching": "Student recognizes that the environment change would affect camouflage but explanation lacks clarity; may state the animal would be 'in trouble' without explaining why or how.",
        "beginning": "Student provides minimal response such as 'the animal would be seen' or 'it wouldn't blend in' without connecting to sand versus rocks."
