Observe and name at least three body parts of a spider (legs, eyes, body).\n2. Describe how a spider's body parts help it survive (catching food, moving, sensing).\n3. Explain that spiders, like all animals, need food and safe places to live.\n4. Sort and classify pictures of animals based on observable body features.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of the orb weaver spider on a hand (displayed on document camera, projector, or as large poster)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Hook:** Show the photograph to the group on the projector or as a large printed image. Hold it up for 10 seconds without speaking—let students look and wonder.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (calibrated for kindergarten comprehension):**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is that?\"\n   - \"Wow! This spider is on someone's hand. Does anyone know what spiders use their legs for?\"\n   - \"How many legs can you count? Are they long or short?\"\n   - \"If you were this tiny spider, what would you need to stay alive and safe?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... what makes a spider's body so special? What does its body help it do?\"\n\n4. **Record Observations:** Write student responses on chart paper in simple words. Accept all answers without judgment.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Let's explore spider bodies up close by looking at pictures and building our own spider to learn more.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover spider body structures through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of spiders (printed or drawn—simple, age-appropriate images showing spider body parts clearly)\n- Pipe cleaners (8 per student, preferably black or brown)\n- Foam balls or pom-poms (small, one per student)\n- Googly eyes (2 per student, adhesive-backed)\n- Glue sticks\n- Safety scissors (adult-supervised or pre-cut materials)\n- Large construction paper or paper plates (optional base)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Show and Observe:** Display 2-3 simple spider picture cards. Point to and name parts: \"This is the body. These are legs—how many? One, two, three... eight legs! And look—eyes!\"\n\n2. **Student Construction (hands-on discovery):**\n   - Give each student a foam ball or pom-pom (this is the spider's body).\n   - Provide 8 pipe cleaners. Students bend and attach them around the body to make legs. (Teacher or aide assists with gluing/attaching.)\n   - Students glue on 2 googly eyes to the body.\n   - As students build, ask: \"What are these for?\" (legs to walk and climb), \"Why does the spider need eyes?\" (to see)\n\n3. **Documentation:** Have students draw or trace their spider on paper, then label or point to: body, legs, eyes.\n\n4. **Comparison:** Once complete, have students hold up their spiders and compare: \"Does your spider look like the spider in the photo?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Tell me about your spider's legs. How does it move?\"\n- Avoid giving direct answers; instead, ask students to observe and think.\n- Encourage peer teaching: \"Show your neighbor your spider and tell them what it can do.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a 3D model of a spider with identifiable legs, body, and eyes.\n- Students verbally describe at least one body part and what it does.\n- Students make connections between their model and the photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled spider diagram (prepared beforehand)\n- Photograph of spider on hand (displayed again)\n- Student-made spiders from Explore phase\n- Picture cards of spiders in different environments (web, on ground, on leaf)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - Invite 3-4 students to show their spider and tell one thing about it.\n   - Ask: \"How is your spider the same as the one in the picture? How is it different?\"\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Concept Introduction:**\n   - Display large labeled spider diagram (body, legs, eyes, fangs).\n   - Use simple language: \"All spiders have eight legs. Eight! They use their legs to walk, climb, and run. Spiders have eyes to see. They have fangs to catch and eat food.\"\n   - Point to the photograph: \"This real spider is on someone's hand. The spider is safe here, but it needs to find food and a safe place to live, just like you need food and a safe home.\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary Introduction (with definitions):**\n   - **Spider:** A small animal with eight legs and usually eight eyes.\n   - **Legs:** Body parts that help animals walk, climb, and move.\n   - **Body:** The main part of an animal where all its parts connect.\n   - **Eyes:** Body parts that help animals see.\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and safe.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your fingers—how many legs does a spider have?\" (Students hold up 8 fingers or point to their model.)\n   - \"What does a spider need to survive?\" (Food, a safe place to live.)\n   - \"Why are a spider's legs important?\" (To move, climb, catch food.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify and name spider body parts (legs, eyes, body).\n- Students explain that spiders use their bodies to find food and stay safe.\n- Students understand that all animals need food and shelter to survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by exploring how spider bodies help them meet survival needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards showing: spider web, spider on ground, spider on leaf, spider in corner\n- Picture cards showing spider eating insects, spider moving, spider hiding\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: short video clip (1-2 minutes) of spider movement or web-building (age-appropriate)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-World Connection—\"How Do Spiders Use Their Bodies to Survive?\"**\n   - Show pictures of spiders in different environments (web, on leaf, in corner).\n   - Ask: \"Where do spiders live? What are they doing there?\"\n   - Explain: \"Spiders use their eight legs to climb and build homes. They use their eyes to see insects (their food). They use their fangs to catch and eat food. All of these body parts help spiders survive.\"\n\n2. **Sorting Activity:**\n   - Provide picture cards: spider eating, spider climbing, spider in web, insect flying.\n   - Ask students to sort: \"Which pictures show things a spider does to stay alive?\"\n   - Discuss: \"Does the spider need to eat? Does it need a safe home? Yes! Just like us!\"\n\n3. **Build Understanding Further (Optional for advanced engagement):**\n   - If time allows, show a short, safe video (YouTube or National Geographic Kids) of a spider building a web or moving—no predators or scary moments.\n   - Ask: \"How many legs did you see? What was the spider doing?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide sorting and discussion without leading answers.\n- Make parallels to students' own needs: \"You need food and a safe home. Spiders need these things too!\"\n- Celebrate observations: \"You noticed the spider used its legs to climb—excellent observing!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students connect spider body parts to survival actions (legs for climbing/moving, eyes for seeing food, fangs for catching food).\n- Students recognize that all animals, including spiders, have similar survival needs (food, shelter).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of spider body structures and survival needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n   - Observation checklist during Explore phase: Can student name at least 2 spider body parts? Can student describe what the body part does?\n   - Listen to student responses during group discussions in Explain and Elaborate.\n   - Note which students can make connections between body parts and survival needs.\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (End of Lesson):**\n   - Show the original photograph of the spider on the hand.\n   - Ask 2-3 individual students:\n     - \"Point to the spider's legs. What does it use them for?\" (Acceptable answers: walk, climb, move, catch food)\n     - \"What does this spider need to stay alive?\" (Acceptable answers: food, water, safe place, home)\n     - \"Is this spider like the one you made? How?\" (Student describes similarities.)\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n   - **Emerging:** Student can name 1-2 spider body parts.\n   - **Developing:** Student can name 3+ spider body parts and describe what one does.\n   - **Proficient:** Student can name spider body parts, describe their functions, and explain that spiders need food and shelter to survive.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- All students can identify at least 2-3 spider body parts.\n- Most students can describe how at least one body part helps a spider survive.\n- All students recognize that spiders, like all animals, need food and safe places to live.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n1. **Simplified Body Part Focus:** Focus only on legs, eyes, and body. Reduce vocabulary to these three terms. Use repetition and pointing.\n2. **Guided Model Building:** Pre-attach some pipe cleaners to the foam ball so the student only has to adjust/attach the remaining ones. Provide hand-over-hand support.\n3. **Yes/No Questions:** Instead of open-ended questions, use yes/no prompts: \"Do spiders have legs?\" \"Does a spider need food?\" These are easier to process and answer for students still developing language skills.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n1. **Multiple Spider Types:** Show pictures of different spiders (jumping spider, wolf spider, garden spider) and ask: \"What body parts do all these spiders share? How are they different?\" This extends observation skills and pattern recognition.\n2. **Spider Webs and Problem-Solving:** Ask, \"How do you think a spider uses its legs to make a web? Why does it need a web?\" Students draw or verbally explain their thinking, deepening understanding of form and function.\n3. **Connect to Other Animals:** \"What other animals have legs? How many? Do all animals have the same number of legs? Why might that be?\" This extends learning to animal diversity and comparative anatomy.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Spider Hunt Classroom Game:**\n   - Hide pictures of spiders around the classroom.\n   - Students find them and name one body part and one thing it does.\n   - Reinforce vocabulary and concepts through movement and play.\n\n2. **Spider Story and Movement:**\n   - Read aloud a simple spider book (e.g., *Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends* by David Kirk).\n   - Act out spider movements: \"Walk like a spider! Climb like a spider! Hide in a corner like a spider!\"\n   - Connect to the concept: \"Spiders move using their eight legs to find food and stay safe.\"\n\n3. **Family Letter—\"Spider Observers at Home\":**\n   - Send home a simple letter (with pictures) asking families to look for real spiders outdoors or in the home (without touching).\n   - Ask: \"What body parts did you see? Where did you find the spider?\"\n   - Bring back observations to share in circle time, extending the lesson and engaging families.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
