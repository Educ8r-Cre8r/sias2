The lesson will integrate 5-LS2-1 (Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment) as the primary standard, with connections to broader life science understanding of how organisms obtain and use energy and matter for growth.*\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Explain** how parent organisms provide food and care that help offspring survive and grow by using evidence from observations and scientific reasoning.\n\n2. **Identify and describe** at least three external structures that parent and offspring birds use for survival (such as wings, beaks, and legs) and explain how each structure helps the organism meet its needs.\n\n3. **Support an argument** with evidence that offspring inherit traits from their parents and that variation exists even within families, using the photograph and their own observations as proof.\n\n4. **Model the movement of matter** (food and energy) from the environment through plants, to animals, to offspring, demonstrating how organisms obtain and use resources for growth and survival.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about parent-offspring relationships and animal growth using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed copy of the photograph (parent_and_offspring.jpg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks or observation sheets\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Introduce the Photograph:** Project the image on a large screen or display it on a document camera. Allow students 30 seconds of silent viewing before discussion begins.\n\n2. **Open-Ended Observation Prompt:** Ask students: \"What do you notice about these two birds? What is happening in this picture?\" Record observations on chart paper without correcting or guiding answers yet.\n\n3. **Guided Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"Which bird do you think is the parent, and which is the offspring? What clues tell you that?\"\n   - \"What is the parent bird doing with its wings and mouth? Why might it be doing that?\"\n   - \"How are these two birds alike? How are they different?\"\n   - \"What do you think the parent bird is providing to the smaller bird, and why might it need it?\"\n\n4. **Wonder and Prediction Prompt:** Ask students to complete this sentence in their notebooks: \"I wonder why the parent bird is... \" and \"I predict that the parent bird helps the baby bird by...\"\n\n5. **Personal Connection:** Invite students to think of a time they saw a parent animal caring for a young one (pets, wild animals, or videos) and share a quick example with a partner.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to explore how parent animals like these birds help their babies grow strong and healthy. We'll investigate what offspring inherit from their parents and how parents pass food and care to their young.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22-27 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate parent-offspring relationships and the movement of food/energy through observation and hands-on modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copies of the photograph (one per pair)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Large poster paper\n- Yarn or string (different colors)\n- Scissors\n- Pre-printed or handwritten labels: \"Parent Bird,\" \"Offspring Bird,\" \"Food (Seeds/Insects),\" \"Growth,\" \"Energy\"\n- Observation recording sheets\n\n**Activity: \"Tracing Food and Growth\"**\n\n**Part A: Close Observation of Traits (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Partner Observation Task:** Distribute printed photographs to pairs. Ask students to use a magnifying lens (if available) or careful observation to identify at least 5 similarities and 3 differences between the parent and offspring bird.\n\n2. **Recording Instructions:** Students draw or describe what they see on their observation sheet, labeling:\n   - Wing shape and size\n   - Beak color and shape\n   - Eye appearance\n   - Body size\n   - Plumage (feather color and pattern)\n\n3. **Guided Questions During Observation:**\n   - \"Where do you see white feathers? Brown feathers? Are they in the same places on both birds?\"\n   - \"Compare the beaks. How are they the same? How are they different in size?\"\n   - \"What do you notice about the parent's wing position?\"\n\n**Part B: Modeling Energy and Matter Movement (12-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set-Up:** Distribute large poster paper to each pair or small group. On the paper, students draw or place labels for: \"Sun,\" \"Plants/Seeds,\" \"Parent Bird,\" \"Offspring Bird.\"\n\n2. **Model Building Task:** Using yarn or string in different colors, students trace the movement of food energy from plants to the parent bird to the offspring bird. They label each connection.\n   - Green yarn: Plant growth (gets energy from sun)\n   - Yellow yarn: Parent eats plants/insects\n   - Red yarn: Parent feeds offspring\n   - Orange yarn: Offspring grows using that food/energy\n\n3. **Think-Pair-Share:** After creating their model, students discuss with a partner:\n   - \"Where does all the energy start?\" (the sun)\n   - \"How does food move from one organism to another?\"\n   - \"Why does the baby bird need food from the parent?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate and ask probing questions without giving answers:\n- \"What do you think happens to the food after the baby bird eats it?\"\n- \"Where did the parent bird get its food?\"\n- \"Can you trace the path of energy backward to the sun?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Accurate identification of 3-5 shared traits and 2-3 differences\n- A visual model showing the connection between plants → parent → offspring\n- Recognition that food moves through organisms and is essential for growth\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and concepts about inheritance, growth, and energy movement through teacher-led discussion and instruction.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary terms\n- Projected photograph\n- Student notebooks\n- Prepared definition cards (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):** Invite 2-3 pairs to briefly share their observations and models. Display their models side-by-side to highlight similarities in student thinking.\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Mini-Lesson: Key Concepts (8-10 minutes)**\n\n   Use the photograph and student models to explain:\n\n   - **Parental Care:** Parent organisms invest time and energy in feeding and protecting offspring because it increases the offspring's chances of survival and growth.\n   - **Inherited Traits:** Offspring receive traits (body structures, colors, shapes) from their parents through heredity. This is why the baby bird has a similar shape, wing structure, and beak to its parent.\n   - **Variation in Traits:** Even though offspring inherit traits, they may look slightly different from their parents or siblings. The baby bird is smaller and has slightly different feather patterns than the adult.\n   - **Energy and Matter Movement:** Food (matter) enters animals' bodies, and the energy from that food fuels growth, movement, and body warmth. When the parent feeds the offspring, matter and energy move from parent to child.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Instruction (5 minutes):** Display and discuss key terms with student-friendly definitions:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Offspring:** A young organism born from or produced by parent organisms. (Point to the smaller bird in the photo.)\n- **Parent:** An adult organism that produces and cares for offspring. (Point to the larger bird.)\n- **Inherited Traits:** Characteristics passed from parents to offspring, like beak shape, wing structure, or feather color.\n- **Growth:** The process by which an organism becomes larger and more developed over time, using food and energy.\n- **Energy:** The power needed for living things to move, grow, and stay warm. Energy comes from food and originally from the sun.\n- **Matter:** The material that makes up everything, including food, bodies, and the environment. Matter is neither created nor destroyed—it moves and changes form.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:** Ask students to turn to a partner and answer:\n   - \"Why does the baby bird need the parent to feed it?\" (to get energy and matter for growth)\n   - \"What trait did the baby bird inherit from its parent?\" (students should identify one visible trait from the photo)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Clear understanding of why parent birds feed offspring (survival and growth)\n- Recognition that traits are inherited but may vary\n- Ability to explain that food provides energy needed for growth\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and extend their understanding by comparing different organisms and designing a real-world feeding scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photo or video clips of other parent-offspring pairs (mammals, insects, reptiles) — optional but recommended\n- Chart comparing different animals' parental care strategies\n- Colored pencils, markers, poster paper\n- Access to books or websites about animal parenting (optional)\n\n**Activity: \"Parental Care Across the Animal Kingdom\"**\n\n**Option A: Comparative Analysis (recommended for most students)**\n\n1. **Introduce New Animals:** Show brief images or descriptions of 2-3 other parent-offspring pairs from different animal groups (e.g., lion and cub, duck and ducklings, butterfly laying eggs).\n\n2. **Comparison Task:** On a T-chart or Venn diagram, students compare the bird pair in the photograph to another animal pair:\n   - How do parents feed their offspring in each species?\n   - What external structures help parents care for babies? (e.g., paws, wings, mouths)\n   - Which offspring need more parental care? Why?\n\n3. **Discussion:** Facilitate a brief discussion:\n   - \"Do all parent animals feed their offspring the same way?\"\n   - \"Why might some animals need their parents longer than others?\"\n   - \"What external structures help different parents care for their young?\"\n\n**Option B: Real-World Problem (for more advanced students)**\n\n1. **Scenario:** \"A young bird has just left its nest. Its parent is teaching it to find food by itself. Design a feeding station in your backyard that could help the parent teach the young bird where to find seeds.\"\n\n2. **Design Task:** Students sketch and label a bird feeding station, explaining how it helps both parent and offspring survive and grow.\n\n3. **Explanation:** Students write 2-3 sentences explaining how their design helps move food (matter and energy) from plants to the birds.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Facilitate discussion by asking: \"What structures do different animals use to feed their babies?\"\n- Guide students to recognize patterns in parental care across species.\n- Challenge students to explain why variation in parental care exists.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Recognition that parental care and feeding look different across species but serve the same purpose (offspring survival and growth)\n- Understanding that external structures are adapted to the animal's lifestyle and environment\n- Ability to apply learning to design a practical solution\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of inherited traits, parental care, growth, and energy/matter movement.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Do students accurately identify inherited traits and create a logical model of energy flow?\n- Check for Understanding questions during Explain phase\n- Discussion participation and questions asked during Elaborate phase\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket/Assessment Task**\n\nProvide students with a new photograph of a different parent-offspring pair (or describe it verbally). Students respond to the following prompts in their notebooks:\n\n1. **Identification:** \"Identify the parent and offspring in this image/description. What inherited traits can you see?\"\n\n2. **Function of External Structures:** \"What external structure (wing, beak, leg, etc.) does the parent use to care for or feed the offspring? How does it help?\"\n\n3. **Energy and Growth:** \"Explain how food energy moves from the environment to the parent to the offspring. Why is this movement important?\"\n\n4. **Evidence-Based Argument:** \"Using evidence from the photograph and what you learned, explain why parent animals need to care for their offspring.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students correctly identify parent and offspring.\n- Students name and describe at least 2 inherited traits.\n- Students explain how at least one external structure helps parental care.\n- Students trace energy/matter from an external source (plants or food) through parent to offspring.\n- Students provide reasoning for why parental care is necessary for offspring survival and growth.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Written or oral responses showing understanding of inheritance, growth, parental care, and energy flow\n- Ability to apply concepts to a new organism\n- Evidence of critical thinking about why parental behaviors exist\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Scaffold Observation:** Provide a pre-made list of traits to look for in the photograph (wing shape, beak color, eye color, body size, feather pattern) rather than asking open-ended identification. Students check off or circle traits they see.\n\n2. **Simplify Energy Model:** Use a three-step diagram instead of a full model: \"Plant → Bird → Baby Bird.\" Have students draw or use pre-made images to place in order, focusing on the basic concept that food moves through living things.\n\n3. **Structured Writing:** Provide sentence frames for exit ticket responses:\n   - \"The parent bird is ___ because ___.\"\n   - \"The baby bird inherited ___ from its parent.\"\n   - \"The baby bird needs food to ___.\"\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate Variation:** Ask students to research why offspring look different from parents even though they inherit traits. Have them create an explanation using terms like \"mutation,\" \"environmental influence,\" or \"genetic recombination\" (appropriate for advanced fifth graders).\n\n2. **Ecosystems Connection:** Challenge students to expand their energy model to include: Sun → Plants → Multiple Animals (herbivore, omnivore) → Decomposer. Have them explain how matter cycles through an entire ecosystem, not just within one family.\n\n3. **Comparative Life Cycles:** Have students research and present on how parental care differs dramatically across animal groups (e.g., birds feed chicks constantly, while sea turtles lay eggs and never see offspring; mammals nurse young, while most fish do not care for young at all). Students create a presentation explaining how different reproductive strategies affect offspring survival.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bird Observation Journal (Homework/Ongoing):** Students spend time observing birds in their neighborhood or yard over one week. They sketch and record observations of any parent-offspring interactions, inherited traits they notice, or behaviors they see. They bring sketches back to class to share and compare with classmates' observations. This connects classroom learning to real-world biology.\n\n2. **Food Chain Investigation:** Students design and conduct a simple investigation to answer: \"How much food does a growing animal need?\" Using small objects (beans or beads) to represent food portions, students calculate how much \"food energy\" it would take for an offspring to grow from baby size to parent size over several weeks, then discuss their findings in relation to why parents must feed their young frequently.\n\n3. **Interview a Pet Owner or Farmer:** Students interview a parent who owns a pet, or contact a local farmer or zoo keeper, to learn about how different animals care for their young. Specific questions might include: \"How long does the parent care for offspring?\" \"What does the parent feed them?\" \"What inherited traits do you notice in the babies?\" Students compile responses into a short report or poster presentation comparing different species' parenting strategies.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
