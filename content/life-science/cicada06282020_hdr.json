The cicada has a tan and brown body with beautiful clear wings that look like stained glass windows. You can see the intricate patterns of veins running through its transparent wings. The cicada's large eyes and strong legs are visible as it holds onto the branch.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image captures an adult cicada, an insect famous for its loud buzzing song and incredible life cycle. Most cicadas spend years underground as nymphs, feeding on plant roots. Some species stay underground for 13 or even 17 years! When ready, they crawl up from the soil, climb a tree, and break out of their old skin to emerge as winged adults. Adult cicadas only live for a few weeks, during which time they mate and lay eggs. Their life cycle is one of nature's most amazing transformations!\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Incomplete Metamorphosis**: Cicadas go through egg → nymph → adult stages (no pupa stage like butterflies).\n\n2. **Life Cycle Duration**: Different cicada species have different life cycles - some emerge every year, while periodical cicadas emerge every 13 or 17 years!\n\n3. **Sound Production**: Male cicadas produce their loud buzzing sound by vibrating special membranes on their abdomen called tymbals - this helps them attract mates.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate a timeline activity showing cicada life cycles! Use a long strip of paper marked with years. Students can illustrate what's happening above ground (seasons, changes) and below ground (cicada nymphs growing). For 17-year cicadas, this becomes a math connection too - students can calculate when they were born versus when cicadas emerged.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n- **Audio Examples**: Play recordings of cicada songs at different speeds to help students hear the variations\n- **Visual Timelines**: Create large wall timeline showing underground years vs. above-ground weeks\n- **Tactile Materials**: Provide shed cicada skins (exoskeletons) for students to examine safely\n- **Movement Connection**: Have students act out the emergence process from underground to treetop\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS1.B]]: Growth and Development of Organisms\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS2.D]]: Social Interactions and Group Behavior\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.B]]: Natural Selection\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]: Observing patterns in life cycles and emergence timing\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1.

The branch is covered in colorful red and silver leaves, creating a beautiful natural backdrop for the cicada.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe cicada in this photo is an amazing example of the incredible life cycle and transformation of these fascinating insects. Cicadas spend most of their lives, often 13 or 17 years, underground as nymphs, feeding on the roots of plants. When they are ready to emerge, they crawl up a tree or other structure, shed their old skin, and break free as winged adults.
