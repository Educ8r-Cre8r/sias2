ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the camouflaged moth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the moth on bark and leaf litter\n- Document camera or projector (if available)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without revealing what it is or where it is. Show it for 10 seconds and ask: \"What do you see?\" Allow quick responses.\n\n2. **Pose these discovery questions:**\n   - \"Can you find the animal hiding in this picture? Where is it?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this animal might look like the things around it?\"\n   - \"If you were a bird hunting for food, would this animal be easy or hard to find? Why?\"\n   - \"Do you think this animal's color is an accident, or did it help the animal survive? What makes you think so?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... what would happen to this animal if it suddenly lived on a bright green leaf instead of brown bark? Could it still hide?\"\n\n4. **Record predictions** on chart paper: \"Why might animals look like their surroundings?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate how animals use camouflage to hide and survive in their environments, and we'll discover how this connects to energy and matter moving through nature.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how camouflage works and why certain colors and patterns are more effective in different environments.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Colored paper or cardstock in multiple colors (brown, green, tan, white, black) cut into small rectangles (approximately 2\" × 1\")\n- Large sheet of brown kraft paper or poster board with images/colors representing a forest floor (brown, tan, black, green patches)\n- Large sheet of green poster board (to represent grass or leaves)\n- Small bowl or bag\n- Stopwatch or timer\n- Student investigation sheets (see below)\n- Pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: The Predator Hunt (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up the environment:** Place the \"forest floor\" poster (brown kraft paper with varied natural colors) on a table or floor where students can gather around it.\n\n2. **Distribute colored paper pieces** randomly across the forest floor poster. Include:\n   - 10 brown/tan pieces (camouflaged)\n   - 5 bright colored pieces (blue, red, yellow—not camouflaged)\n\n3. **Explain the investigation:** \"You are predators hunting for food. I will give you 30 seconds to find and collect as many colored pieces as possible. You can only pick up one piece at a time. Ready?\"\n\n4. **Run the hunt:** Play once. Record results: \"How many pieces were found? Which colors did you find the most of?\"\n\n5. **Repeat on the green poster board:** Set up a new environment with the same colored pieces, but on green background this time. Predict before hunting: \"Which colors will be easier or harder to find on green?\"\n\n6. **Students record observations:**\n   - On their investigation sheet: \"Which colors were easier to find on the forest floor? Which colors were easier to find on green? Why?\"\n   - \"Which pieces were camouflaged (hidden)? Which stood out?\"\n\n**Part 2: Design Your Own Camouflage (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Challenge:** \"Now, design your own 'camouflaged piece' that would be hard for a predator to find on the forest floor.\"\n\n2. Students select or combine colors and patterns on a new piece of paper to create their design.\n\n3. **Test:** Place designs on the forest floor poster and have classmates try to spot them. Record: \"Was my camouflage effective? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate during the hunt to observe which students understand that camouflage matches the environment.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Why do you think you found more brown pieces? What does that tell us about hiding?\"\n- Resist giving answers; instead, prompt students to notice patterns in what they find.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that colors matching the environment are harder to find (camouflaged).\n- Students recognize that standing out from your environment makes you more visible to predators.\n- Students design camouflaged objects and test their effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to the photograph and ecological concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Printed photographs of the moth from the original image (one per pair/group, if possible)\n- Vocabulary cards or anchor chart\n- Image of other camouflaged animals (optional: leaf-tailed gecko, stonefish, tree frog, snowy owl in winter)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover during the hunt? Why were some colors easier to find than others?\"\n   - Record student thinking on chart paper.\n   - Guide toward: \"Animals that match their environment are harder for predators to see.\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Write each term on chart paper. Read aloud and display.\n   \n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Camouflage:** A color, pattern, or shape that helps an animal blend in with its environment so it is harder to see.\n   - **Adaptation:** A trait or characteristic that helps an organism survive and reproduce in its environment.\n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals.\n   - **Prey:** An animal that is hunted and eaten by another animal.\n   - **Environment:** All the living and nonliving things in a place where an organism lives.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Return to the original moth image.\n   - Ask: \"Now that we know what camouflage is, what camouflage does this moth have? Point to the bark. Point to the moth. How are they alike?\"\n   - Explain: \"This moth's brown color and pattern are adaptations. Its light brown wings match the bark and dead leaves in its forest home. This adaptation helps the moth survive because it's hard for birds and other predators to see it.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show images of other camouflaged animals (if available).\n   - Ask: \"Is this an example of camouflage? How do you know?\"\n   - Alternatively, ask individual students to point to where the moth would be on a blank forest-floor picture.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define camouflage and adaptation in their own words.\n- Students can identify the moth in the photograph and explain how its color helps it survive.\n- Students understand that camouflage is an adaptation that provides a survival advantage.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of camouflage and adaptation to a new context and deepen their thinking about how organisms interact with their environment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheets of construction paper or poster board in various colors/patterns (forest floor, grass, snow, desert sand, water, tree bark)\n- Colored markers, colored paper, magazines, scissors, glue\n- Picture cards or drawings of 6-8 different animals (example: polar bear, leopard, rabbit, butterfly, caterpillar, squirrel, fish, chameleon)\n- Chart paper labeled with headings: \"Environment\" and \"What camouflage would work?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Match Organisms to Environments (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display environment posters** around the room: forest floor, snowy landscape, green forest, desert, underwater, tree bark, etc.\n\n2. **Provide animal cards** (one per pair or small group).\n\n3. **Challenge:** \"Your animal needs to survive. Which environment would it be best camouflaged in? Why? Design how your animal's camouflage would look in that environment. Draw or create a picture showing your animal blended into its environment.\"\n\n4. **Students work together** to:\n   - Choose or justify an environment for their animal.\n   - Create or draw the animal camouflaged in that setting.\n   - Label their work with: \"Animal: _____, Environment: _____, Why this camouflage works: _____\"\n\n**Part 2: Connection to the Food Web (5 minutes)**\n\n1. **Transition to ecosystems:** \"Camouflage helps prey animals avoid being eaten. When predators can't find enough prey, what happens? When there's less food for predators, what else might happen to the whole forest?\"\n\n2. **Introduce the concept:** \"All organisms in an environment—plants, animals, and decomposers—are connected through energy and matter movement. Camouflage helps animals survive in this system.\"\n\n3. **Show the original photograph again:** \"In this forest environment, the moth's camouflage helps it hide from predators. But dead leaves and bark on the forest floor are also part of this system. They break down and return nutrients to the soil, which plants use to grow. Those plants feed insects like moths. Everything is connected.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate small group discussions without directing their choices.\n- Ask: \"Why does this camouflage work in this environment? What would happen if this animal was in a different place?\"\n- Support students in recognizing that adaptations are specific to particular environments.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students match organisms with appropriate environments for their camouflage.\n- Students explain why specific adaptations work in specific environments.\n- Students begin to understand the interconnection between organisms, camouflage, survival, and ecosystem balance.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of camouflage as an adaptation and its role in organism survival and environmental interaction.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation:** Circulate during Explore and Elaborate phases. Note whether students can explain why certain colors worked in the hunt and why they chose particular environments for animal camouflage.\n- **Questioning:** Ask individual students: \"If this animal lived in a different place, would its camouflage still work? Why or why not?\" Listen for understanding that adaptations are environment-specific.\n- **Investigation sheets:** Review students' written predictions and observations from the Explore phase to check for evidence of understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (physical card, digital form, or paper slip) with the following prompt:\n\n**Question 1:** \"Look at this picture of a brown rabbit in a snowy field. Is the rabbit well-camouflaged? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Question 2:** \"Explain how camouflage helps animals survive.\"\n\n**Question 3:** \"A moth has brown wings that match tree bark. What would happen to this moth if its environment changed and all the bark turned white? Explain your thinking.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student identifies that the brown rabbit would NOT be well-camouflaged in snow (stands out).\n- ✓ Student explains that camouflage helps animals hide from predators or find food.\n- ✓ Student recognizes that the moth's brown camouflage would no longer work in a white environment and predators could find it more easily.\n- ✓ Student demonstrates understanding that adaptations must match the specific environment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that camouflage is an adaptation specific to an organism's environment.\n- Students can explain the survival advantage of camouflage.\n- Students apply this understanding to new scenarios and recognize what happens when environments change.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary:** Before the full lesson, introduce and review key terms (camouflage, adaptation, predator, prey) with visual examples or picture cards. Pair students with visual supports during the Explain phase.\n\n2. **Guided partner investigation:** During Explore, pair struggling students with more independent learners. Provide a sentence starter sheet: \"I found _____ colored pieces because _____. These pieces were hard to see because _____.\"\n\n3. **Simplified exit ticket:** Offer multiple-choice or matching options instead of open-ended questions. Example: \"Camouflage helps animals by: (A) making them run faster, (B) helping them hide from predators, (C) making them bigger.\"\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Camouflage in multiple environments:** Challenge students to design an animal that could be camouflaged in TWO different environments (e.g., a color-changing creature). Ask them to justify how this adaptation might help the animal if its environment shifted seasonally.\n\n2. **Investigate adaptation trade-offs:** Introduce the concept that camouflage can have drawbacks. \"If an animal is perfectly camouflaged to hide, how does it attract a mate? Can you research and present an example of this challenge in nature?\" (Example: bright-colored poison dart frogs are NOT camouflaged; they advertise toxicity instead.)\n\n3. **Food web connection:** Ask advanced learners to create a simple food web showing how the moth, its predators, plants, and decomposers interact. Then ask: \"If camouflage helps moths hide, and there are fewer moths eaten, what happens to the food web?\" This bridges toward 5-LS2-1 more deeply.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seasonal camouflage investigation:** Research animals that change camouflage seasonally (example: snowshoe hare, ptarmigan). Students compare photographs showing the animal in different seasons and explain how each adaptation matches its environment. Create a poster or presentation: \"Same Animal, Different Camouflage.\"\n\n2. **Camouflage in human contexts:** Explore how humans use camouflage (military uniforms, hunting gear, sports team uniforms). Students discuss: \"Why do humans copy animal camouflage? What environments do we need to hide in?\" This connects adaptation concepts to real-world application and can lead to a brief STEM engineering challenge: \"Design a camouflaged backpack for a specific environment.\"\n\n3. **Decomposition and nutrient cycling:** Extend the food web thinking by investigating the role of decomposers (fungi, bacteria, earthworms) in breaking down dead leaves and bark from the forest floor. Students can:\n   - Examine decaying leaves under magnifying glasses.\n   - Set up a simple compost observation (in a clear container with soil, dead leaves, water over 2-4 weeks) to witness decomposition.\n   - Create a diagram showing how dead matter returns to soil and feeds new plants—connecting to 5-LS2-1 (movement of matter).\n\n---",
