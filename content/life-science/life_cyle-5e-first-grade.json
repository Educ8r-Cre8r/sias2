ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about life cycles by examining the photograph and activating prior knowledge about eggs, seeds, and new life.\n\n- **Materials:** \n  - Printed photograph (one per student or displayed on screen)\n  - Real eggshells (empty, cleaned, rinsed—1-2 per student if available)\n  - Small potted seedlings or bean sprouts in a clear cup (to pass around)\n  - Chart paper and markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n  - Display the photograph on the board or give each student a printed copy. Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see?\"\n  - Pass around a real eggshell (or the potted seedling) so students can hold it and feel it.\n  - Ask these discussion questions one at a time, allowing 20-30 seconds of think-pair-share before calling on volunteers:\n    1. \"What do you think was inside this eggshell before it cracked open?\"\n    2. \"Have you ever seen something grow from an egg or a seed? What did it look like?\"\n    3. \"Why do you think the baby plant inside needs a hard shell to protect it?\"\n    4. \"If you were a tiny baby plant trying to grow, what would you need to be safe?\"\n  - Record student responses on chart paper without correcting—this is their \"before\" thinking.\n  - Prediction prompt: \"I wonder what happens next when a baby plant breaks out of its egg? Let's investigate and find out!\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Scientists observe things carefully to understand how living things grow. Today, we're going to act like scientists and create our own growing baby plants to see what happens!\"\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate plant growth and observe how young plants develop external structures (roots, stems, leaves) by planting seeds and observing real seedlings.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Small paper or plastic cups (4 oz), one per student\n  - Soil or potting mix\n  - Bean seeds (dried, large, easy to handle) or sunflower seeds, 1-2 per student\n  - Water in spray bottles or small watering cans\n  - Newspaper or paper towels to cover work area\n  - Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (optional but helpful)\n  - Real eggshell halves (cleaned and dried), one per student\n  - Markers and labels (for decorating pots)\n  - Paper towels\n  - Real seedlings in clear cups (pre-planted 3-5 days earlier) for observation\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Part A: Planting Investigation (12 minutes)**\n  \n  1. Give each student a cup and show them how to place a small eggshell half inside it (the shell will become the \"pot\").\n  2. Demonstrate: \"Let's fill our eggshell with soil. Not too much—just enough so we can fit our seed inside.\"\n  3. Students fill their eggshell shells with moist soil.\n  4. Demonstrate how to place the bean seed about 1 inch deep in the soil: \"The seed needs to be covered, like it's hiding in the soil. This protects it, just like the eggshell protected it!\"\n  5. Lightly water each seed so the soil is moist but not soggy.\n  6. Students may decorate their cup with markers.\n  7. Explain: \"We're going to keep these somewhere warm and give them water. Let's check them tomorrow and every day this week to see what changes.\"\n\n  **Part B: Observing Real Seedlings (8 minutes)**\n  \n  1. Show students seedlings that were planted 3-5 days earlier in clear cups so they can see roots, stem, and leaves.\n  2. Give each student or pair a hand lens to examine the seedling closely.\n  3. Ask: \"What parts of the plant do you see? Can you point to the green leaves? The stem? The white roots at the bottom?\"\n  4. Have students draw what they see on a observation sheet with labels for: roots (bottom), stem (middle), leaves (top).\n  5. Explain: \"These are all external parts—parts on the outside that we can see. Each part helps the plant survive.\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:** \n  - Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the roots? Where are they growing? Why do you think they grow down?\" \n  - Help students understand that they're not \"giving\" the answer but rather helping them notice patterns.\n  - Refrain from saying \"That's wrong\"—instead ask: \"What else do you see? Tell me more.\"\n  - Ensure soil moisture is appropriate; model proper watering.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  - Each student has planted a seed and will have it to observe over the week.\n  - Students have drawn/labeled a seedling showing roots, stem, and leaves.\n  - Students verbally describe what they observed: \"The roots grow down,\" \"The leaves are green,\" \"The stem is like a tube.\"\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-18 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and help students connect their observations to the concepts of life cycles, offspring characteristics, and external structures.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple drawings\n  - The photograph displayed on screen or printed\n  - Student observation drawings from Explore phase\n  - Picture cards of plants at different life stages (optional: seed, seedling, adult plant)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n     - Invite 3-4 students to show their seedling drawings and describe what they observed.\n     - Ask: \"Did everyone's seedling look exactly the same? What was different?\"\n     - Record observations: \"Some had bigger leaves. Some had longer roots. Some were taller.\"\n     - Say: \"That's an important pattern! Young plants are like their parents, but not exactly the same—they're all different.\"\n\n  2. **Introduce Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n     - Write each term on chart paper with a simple drawing next to it:\n       - **Seed:** A baby plant inside a protective shell that can grow into a new plant.\n       - **Seedling:** A young plant that has started to grow from a seed.\n       - **Roots:** The parts that grow down into the soil to get water and hold the plant in place.\n       - **Stem:** The part that holds up the plant and carries water and food.\n       - **Leaves:** The green parts that help the plant make food from sunlight.\n       - **Offspring:** A young living thing made by a parent plant or animal.\n     \n     - Point to the photograph and say: \"These eggshells in the picture are like the seeds we planted. Inside each one was a baby plant. When it got big and strong, it broke out of its shell, just like your seedling is going to do.\"\n     - Point to the leaves on the eggshell seedlings: \"See the tiny green leaves? Those are the same kind of leaves that bigger plants have. But these are smaller—the baby is just starting to grow.\"\n\n  3. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n     - Ask: \"If I show you a picture of a big bean plant, where did it start?\" (As a seed in a shell.)\n     - Ask: \"What does a root do?\" (Gets water, helps the plant stay in place.)\n     - Ask: \"Why are all the seedlings in our classroom a little different?\" (All offspring are alike but not exactly the same—that's normal!)\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Seed:** A baby plant inside a hard, protective cover that grows into a new plant.\n  - **Seedling:** A young plant that has just started to grow from its seed.\n  - **Roots:** Plant parts that grow down into the soil to drink water and hold the plant steady.\n  - **Stem:** The part of the plant that stands up and carries water to the leaves.\n  - **Leaves:** The flat, green parts of a plant that catch sunlight to help the plant grow.\n  - **Offspring:** A young animal or plant made by a parent.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  - Students can point to roots, stem, and leaves on a seedling and name them.\n  - Students can explain in simple words: \"Seeds have babies inside. The babies break out and grow. They all grow roots and leaves, but they look a little different.\"\n  - Students understand that seedlings are young versions of plants, and they're not yet as big as their parents.\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (16-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding of how external structures protect developing life by designing their own protective covering for a seed or egg, mimicking natural protection.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Raw eggs (1 per pair or small group) OR large dry beans\n  - Various protective materials: bubble wrap, newspaper, paper towels, cotton balls, foam pieces, fabric scraps, plastic wrap, aluminum foil\n  - Masking tape and scissors\n  - Droppers or small cups of water\n  - Paper plates (for \"drop test\" surface)\n  - Chart paper: \"What Protected Our Egg?\"\n  - Optional: actual eggshells from the photograph (already broken) for reference\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Introduction (2 minutes):**\n     - Show the class the broken eggshells from the photograph again. Say: \"The eggshell protected the baby plant inside. Now, let's design our own protectors!\"\n     - Explain: \"You and your partner will wrap an egg [or use a dry bean] with materials that you think will protect it, just like an eggshell does. Then we'll test if your design works.\"\n\n  2. **Design Challenge (10 minutes):**\n     - Organize students into pairs. Distribute one egg (or bean) per pair and access to the protective materials.\n     - Say: \"You have 6 minutes to design a protective covering. What materials will you use? How will you wrap it? Think about what an eggshell does—it's hard, it's smooth, it protects what's inside.\"\n     - Circulate: Ask: \"Why did you choose that material? How do you think it will protect the egg? What would happen if we dropped it?\"\n     - Students wrap their eggs/beans and may decorate or label their designs.\n\n  3. **Testing and Observation (5 minutes):**\n     - Once designs are complete, explain: \"Now we're going to gently drop our protectors from about 6 inches high onto this plate. Let's see if your covering protects what's inside!\"\n     - Demonstrate dropping one design first.\n     - Each pair drops their protected egg/bean carefully onto a paper plate.\n     - Observe: Did it crack? Did the protective material help?\n\n  4. **Reflection (3 minutes):**\n     - Record on chart paper: \"Which designs worked best? What materials were the strongest?\"\n     - Ask: \"How is your protective covering like an eggshell? How is it different?\"\n     - Say: \"Nature gave eggs and seeds special protective shells to help the babies inside stay safe while they grow. Engineers and scientists design protective coverings too—like helmets, padding in sports gear, and protective cases.\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:** \n  - Ask questions that prompt thinking: \"What happens when you drop something hard vs. something soft?\"\n  - Encourage collaboration: \"What does your partner think? Do you agree?\"\n  - Facilitate the drop test safely—choose a controlled location to prevent mess.\n  - Highlight that not all designs worked the same way, and that's okay—that's how we learn.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  - Students create a protective covering and test it.\n  - Students explain why they chose certain materials: \"I used bubble wrap because it's soft and bouncy, like it will catch it.\"\n  - Students observe patterns: \"The materials that were soft and thick worked better.\"\n  - Students make a connection: \"The eggshell in the picture is like our wrapper—it keeps the baby plant safe.\"\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of life cycles, offspring characteristics, and external structures through multiple formative and summative assessments.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (Ongoing):**\n  - Observation checklists during Explore: Can students identify roots, stem, and leaves? Do they water appropriately?\n  - Listen during discussions: Do students use vocabulary correctly? Do they make observations or just guess?\n  - Examine drawings: Can students label the parts of a seedling? Are the parts recognizable?\n\n  **Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (5 minutes at end of Lesson 2):**\n  \n  Provide each student with a simple drawing of a seedling (unlabeled) and ask them to answer these questions (you may read aloud for support):\n  \n  1. **Point and name:** \"Show me the roots. Show me the stem. Show me the leaves.\"\n  2. **Short answer (draw or tell):** \"Where did this baby plant come from?\" (Expected: a seed, an egg, something that broke open)\n  3. **Observation:** \"Look at the two seedlings side by side [show two drawings/real seedlings]. Are they exactly the same? What's different?\" (Expected: different sizes, different leaf shapes, etc.)\n  4. **Application:** \"If you were keeping this seedling safe while it grows, what would you do? Why?\" (Expected: water it, give it light, keep it warm—mimics natural survival needs)\n\n  **Success Criteria:**\n  - Student can point to and name 2 of 3 external structures (roots, stem, leaves).\n  - Student recognizes that plants grow from seeds (or eggs with seedlings).\n  - Student observes that young plants look similar but not identical to each other.\n  - Student makes a logical connection between caring for a plant and protecting its growth.\n\n  **Documentation:**\n  - Keep photographs of student designs and drop tests.\n  - Collect labeled seedling drawings.\n  - Save exit tickets to track vocabulary use and conceptual understanding.\n  - Over the week, photograph students' planted seeds as they germinate and grow—create a class \"growth chart\" showing progression.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  - Students demonstrate understanding of the basic life cycle (seed → seedling → plant).\n  - Students can name external structures and explain one function each.\n  - Students recognize that offspring have similarities to parents but also individual differences.\n  - Students apply knowledge by designing protective structures and explaining their reasoning.\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support:**\n  1. **Vocabulary scaffolding:** Provide a labeled diagram of a seedling that students can point to instead of naming parts. Pair with peer or use hand-over-hand guidance during labeling activities.\n  2. **Simplified exit ticket:** Use \"point and name\" only, or provide multiple-choice options: \"Is this a root?\" (showing a picture of roots, leaves, stem).\n  3. **Guided observation:** Sit with a small group during Explore and ask sentence stems: \"I see... I notice... The roots look...\" to help organize observations before drawing.\n\n- **Challenge:**\n  1. **Extended investigation:** Ask: \"What if we planted a seed in a cup without soil—just with paper towels and water? What would happen? Why?\" Have students design and conduct this test over 2 weeks.\n  2. **Comparative study:** Provide seeds of different types (bean, sunflower, corn). Ask: \"How are these seeds different? Do you think they'll grow the same way? Let's find out and record.\"\n  3. **Life cycle sequencing:** Provide picture cards of plant life stages (seed, seedling, plant with flower, plant with new seeds) and ask students to arrange them in order, then explain why each stage comes next: \"What needs to happen for a seed to become a seedling?\"\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Daily Growth Journal (Week-Long Activity):**\n   - Each student maintains a simple one-page journal where they observe their planted seed each day and draw or write what they see.\n   - Provide a template: \"Today my seed looks like... [draw]. The roots are... The leaves are...\"\n   - At the end of the week, create a class book titled \"Our Seeds Grew!\" with student pages to share with families.\n   - This connects to documenting patterns over time and building observational skills.\n\n2. **Read-Aloud and Pattern Discussion (30 minutes, separate session):**\n   - Read a picture book about plant or animal life cycles appropriate for Grade 1, such as *From Seed to Plant* by Gail Gibbons or *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* by Eric Carle.\n   - After reading, ask: \"How is the story like what we saw in the photograph? What did the baby plant/animal need to survive?\"\n   - Create a simple Venn diagram: \"Plants that hatch from eggs/seeds\" vs. \"Animals that hatch from eggs.\"\n   - Discuss patterns: \"All babies need protection. All babies grow bigger. All babies grow differently but in the same way.\"\n\n3. **Family Extension: \"Growing at Home\" Take-Home Kit:**\n   - Send home a resealable bag with bean seeds, soil, a small cup, and simple picture instructions (no words needed—just drawings).\n   - Include a note asking families to: grow the seed with their child, observe daily, and send back a photo or drawing of progress.\n   - In class, create a display: \"Growing in Our School, Growing in Our Homes\" with contributions from families.\n   - This extends learning beyond the classroom and connects life science to home experiences.",
