ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about bees and flowers using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, clear projection of the bee-on-flower photograph (or printed copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Picture book: *The Bee Tree* by Patricia Polacco (optional, 5 minutes)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** using a projector or document camera so all students can see clearly. Let students look for 15-20 seconds in silence.\n\n2. **Ask these curiosity questions** (one at a time, allowing think-time after each):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Who can tell me about the two living things you see?\" (Validate: purple flower and a bee)\n   - \"Why do you think the bee is sitting on the flower? What might it be doing there?\" (Accept all ideas: eating, drinking, playing, looking for food)\n   - \"Do you see anything sticky or yellow on the bee's body? What might that be?\" (Guide toward pollen idea if needed)\n   - \"Do you think the flower and the bee need each other? Why or why not?\" (Encourage prediction)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Write on chart paper: *\"I wonder why bees visit flowers...\"* Read it aloud and ask students to turn to a neighbor and share one idea. Collect 3-4 responses and write them on the chart.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to do some exploring to figure out exactly how bees and flowers help each other!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how bee body parts help them collect pollen and nectar from flowers.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photos of the bee (one per student or pair)\n- Magnifying glasses or hand lenses (4-5)\n- Sticky notes or labels (small, self-adhesive)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Chart: \"What helps the bee?\" (pre-drawn with columns: \"Body part\" and \"What it does\")\n- Real flower (if available: sunflower, daisy, or wildflower) placed in center of room\n- Shallow dish with water and a drop of food coloring (to represent nectar)\n- Cotton balls or pompoms (to represent pollen)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Observing the Bee (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute** printed bee photos or display the image again on document camera.\n\n2. **Give students directions:** \"Look very carefully at the bee. Use a magnifying glass if you have one. Find these body parts on the bee and point to them:\n   - Eyes (to see the flower)\n   - Legs (count them—there are 6!)\n   - Fuzzy body (covered in tiny hairs)\n   - Wings (for flying)\"\n\n3. **As students point out each part**, ask: \"Why might the bee need THAT body part when it visits a flower?\" Write their ideas on the \"What helps the bee?\" chart.\n   - Example responses: \"Wings help it fly to flowers.\" \"Fuzzy body picks up yellow powder.\" \"Legs help it hold onto petals.\"\n\n4. **Students draw circles** around or label each body part on their bee photo using colored pencils.\n\n**Part 2: Simulating Pollination (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Gather students around the real flower or flower photo.** Explain: \"When a bee visits a flower, it does two things: It drinks sweet juice inside the flower (called nectar), and it gets sticky yellow powder on its body (called pollen).\"\n\n2. **Demonstration:** Dip a cotton ball into the \"nectar\" (colored water) and touch it to the pompom (pollen). Show how the pollen sticks to the cotton ball just like it sticks to the bee's fuzzy body.\n\n3. **Student turn:** Give pairs a flower cutout, a cotton ball, and a pompom. Say: \"You are a bee! Dip your 'bee body' (cotton ball) into the pollen (pompom). What happens? Does the pollen stick?\" Students observe and describe what they see.\n\n4. **Record observations:** Students draw or write (with teacher support) one sentence: \"The pollen stuck to the bee because _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice? Which body parts pick up the pollen? What would happen if the bee had smooth, hairless skin?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answers—let them discover through observation.\n- Use think-pair-share after each observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 4-5 bee body parts and their functions.\n- Students observe that pollen sticks to fuzzy surfaces.\n- Students begin understanding that bees carry pollen from flower to flower.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the relationship between bees and flowers after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large anchor chart (pre-made or co-created): \"Bees and Flowers Help Each Other\"\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures (printed or drawn)\n- The original bee-on-flower photograph\n- Sentence frame poster: \"Bees need flowers because _____. Flowers need bees because _____.\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore phase (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 students to share what they observed about bee body parts.\n   - Ask 2-3 students what happened when pollen stuck to the cotton ball.\n   - Record their language on the anchor chart.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n   Use the vocabulary cards and re-examine the bee-on-flower photo as you define each term. Use hand motions and exaggerated actions to help students remember.\n\n   - **Pollination:** When a bee visits a flower and pollen sticks to the bee's fuzzy body. (Mime a bee landing on a flower and getting dusty.)\n   - **Pollen:** Tiny yellow powder inside flowers. Pollen is like the flower's special powder that helps make new flowers and seeds. (Show a magnified image or reference to the photo.)\n   - **Nectar:** Sweet juice inside flowers that bees drink. It's like the flower's juice treat for the bee. (Mime drinking from a flower.)\n   - **Pollinator:** An animal (like a bee) that carries pollen from one flower to another. (Point to the bee in the photo.)\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy. (Use simple phrase: \"Living things need food and water to survive.\")\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph and Explore activity (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the bee in the photo: \"See how fuzzy this bee is? That's perfect for picking up pollen!\"\n   - Point to the flower: \"The purple petals attract the bee, and inside the flower is nectar for the bee to drink.\"\n   - Explain: \"When the bee flies to the next flower, pollen from the first flower falls onto the second flower. This helps the flowers make seeds. This is called pollination!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2-3 minutes):**\n   Use the sentence frame: \"Bees need flowers because _____. Flowers need bees because _____.\"\n   - Read the frame aloud.\n   - Ask students to turn and talk: \"Why do YOU think bees need flowers?\" (They drink nectar and eat pollen; it's food!)\n   - Ask: \"Why do flowers need bees?\" (To carry pollen to other flowers so seeds can grow.)\n   - Accept simple, accurate responses.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Pollination** | When a bee visits a flower and pollen sticks to its fuzzy body, then falls on another flower. |\n| **Pollen** | Tiny yellow powder inside flowers that helps make new flowers and seeds. |\n| **Nectar** | Sweet juice inside flowers that bees drink for food and energy. |\n| **Pollinator** | An animal (like a bee) that carries pollen from one flower to another. |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy by getting food, water, and shelter. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that bees and flowers have a helpful relationship.\n- Students can use the word \"pollen\" and \"pollinator\" with teacher support.\n- Students recognize that both bees and flowers need each other to survive and grow.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing a flower that would attract a bee.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large colored paper or cardstock (5\"x8\"), one per student\n- Tissue paper (various colors: purple, pink, yellow, orange)\n- Glue sticks\n- Markers and colored pencils\n- Googly eyes or sticker dots (optional)\n- Shallow containers with water mixed with food coloring or glitter (to represent nectar)\n- Pipettes or droppers (one per student)\n- Sentence frame printed on paper: \"My flower attracts bees because _____.\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set the challenge:** \"Now YOU are a flower designer! Bees visit flowers that are:\n   - Bright, colorful (like the purple flower in our photo)\n   - Have sweet nectar inside (like juice)\n   - Have pollen (yellow powder) the bee can pick up\n   \n   Design a flower that would make a bee say, 'I WANT to visit that flower!'\"\n\n2. **Student directions (provide verbally and display with pictures):**\n   - Choose a large paper to be your flower stem and base.\n   - Tear or cut tissue paper into petal shapes and glue them around the edge to make petals. (Make them bright colors!)\n   - Draw or glue a center in the middle. This is where the pollen and nectar are.\n   - Use the dropper to add \"nectar\" (colored water) in the flower's center. Let it drip into the center.\n   - Sprinkle a tiny bit of glitter or food coloring to represent pollen.\n   - Write or dictate: \"My flower attracts bees because _____.\" (Examples: \"It's purple!\" \"It has sweet nectar!\" \"It has pollen!\")\n\n3. **Student work (12-15 minutes):**\n   - Students design and decorate their flowers while thinking about what bees need.\n   - Circulate and ask: \"Why did you choose that color?\" \"What will the bee find inside your flower?\" \"Would a bee want to visit YOUR flower?\"\n\n4. **Gallery walk (optional, 3-5 minutes):**\n   - Display finished flowers on a table or wall.\n   - Students walk around, observe peers' designs, and give compliments: \"I like your flower because the pollen is bright yellow!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate creativity while asking questions that connect back to the concept: \"Bees like bright colors. Did you pick bright colors for your petals?\"\n- Provide sentence frames for students who struggle with writing/explaining.\n- Allow students to show, not just tell, why their flower attracts bees (through design choices).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a colorful flower with identifiable petals, center, and pollen/nectar representation.\n- Students can explain one reason their flower would attract a bee.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that bees are attracted to colors, nectar, and pollen.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of bee and flower relationships and how body parts help organisms survive.\n\n**Assessment Strategy:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Observation checklist during Explore phase: Can students identify 3+ bee body parts? Do they understand that pollen sticks to fuzzy surfaces?\n- Listen to partner conversations during Explain phase: Do students use \"pollen\" and \"nectar\" vocabulary naturally?\n- Questioning during Elaborate phase: Can students explain why their flower design attracts bees?\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket or End-of-Lesson Check):**\n\n**Option 1: Visual Exit Ticket (for non-readers)**\n- Show the original bee-on-flower photograph.\n- Ask three yes/no questions:\n  1. \"Does the bee have legs?\" (Yes)\n  2. \"Is the flower getting something from the bee?\" (Yes)\n  3. \"Would a bee want to visit a flower with no petals and no nectar?\" (No)\n- Students point to or circle yes/no.\n\n**Option 2: Sentence Completion (with teacher scribing)**\n- \"Bees visit flowers because they want to _____.\" (drink nectar / eat pollen / find food)\n- \"The bee's fuzzy body helps it _____.\" (pick up pollen / carry pollen to other flowers)\n- \"Flowers need bees because _____.\" (bees carry pollen / help make seeds)\n\n**Option 3: Quick Sketch with Label**\n- Students draw a bee on a flower and label:\n  - One bee body part (eyes, legs, fuzzy body, wings)\n  - One part of the flower (petals, center, nectar, pollen)\n- Ask: \"Why do they help each other?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Student can name at least TWO bee body parts and explain what they do.\n\n✓ Student understands that bees GET something from flowers (nectar/pollen for food).\n\n✓ Student understands that flowers GET something from bees (pollen carried to other flowers).\n\n✓ Student recognizes that this is a helpful relationship (both need each other to survive).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can identify pollen and nectar as food sources for bees.\n- 75%+ of students can name 2+ bee body parts and their purpose.\n- 70%+ of students can explain that bees and flowers help each other survive.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"pollen\" and \"nectar\" in the Explain phase. Skip \"pollinator\" and \"pollination\" until reinforcement. Repeat vocabulary daily for one week.\n\n2. **Sentence frames and word banks:** \n   - Provide printed sentence frames with visual supports:\n     - \"The bee uses its _____ to pick up pollen.\" (OPTIONS: legs / fuzzy body / wings)\n     - \"The bee drinks _____ from the flower.\" (OPTION: nectar)\n   - Keep word bank posted throughout the lesson.\n\n3. **Simplified Explore activity:** Have these students work with a partner and use only the \"pollen sticking\" simulation (Part 2 of Explore). Skip detailed bee anatomy if time is short. Use magnifying glasses to make it engaging and hands-on.\n\n4. **Alternative Elaborate task:** Instead of designing a detailed flower, provide a pre-made flower cutout and have students color it with bright colors and dictate (not write) one sentence about why bees visit flowers. Teacher scribes.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Research extension:** Provide pictures of 3-4 different bee types (honeybee, bumblebee, carpenter bee) and a simple table to compare body parts, sizes, and colors. Ask: \"Do all bees look the same? How are they different? Which would visit your flower?\"\n\n2. **Complex thinking:** Ask: \"What would happen to flowers if there were NO bees?\" Guide students to think about:\n   - No pollen carried between flowers\n   - No seeds made\n   - No new flowers growing\n   - Create a simple \"problem-solution\" chart together.\n\n3. **Elaborate extension:** Have students design TWO different flower types and predict which one a bee would visit MORE. Challenge them to explain their prediction using what they know about bee preferences (colors, nectar, pollen).\n\n4. **Writing challenge:** Instead of one sentence, ask students to write 2-3 sentences:\n   - \"My flower is _____ color.\"\n   - \"Inside my flower is _____.\"\n   - \"A bee will visit my flower because _____.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Bee and Flower Match Game\"**\n   - Create picture cards: bees, flowers, pollen, nectar, petals, wings, legs, hive.\n   - Students sort cards into two groups: \"Bee body parts\" and \"Flower parts.\"\n   - Advanced: Match \"Bee needs\" (nectar, pollen) to \"Flower needs\" (pollen carried to another flower).\n\n2. **Observational Walk & Field Sketch**\n   - If weather permits, take students outside to find real flowers in a garden or field.\n   - Bring clipboards and paper. Students observe and sketch what they see (even if not realistic).\n   - Ask: \"Do you see any insects on flowers? What colors are the flowers?\" Discuss predictions about why bees might visit these flowers.\n   - Return inside and add labeled drawings to a class \"Flower and Pollinator\" chart.\n\n3. **Bee Life Cycle Sequence Cards**\n   - Create simple, colorful cards showing bee life stages (egg, larva, pupa, adult bee).\n   - Students arrange cards in order and discuss: \"How does the bee grow?\" \"Does the baby bee look like the adult bee?\" (Connects to 1-LS3-1.)\n   - Discuss: \"Where does the bee get food when it's a baby?\" (Nectar from flowers!) \"Does the adult bee need flowers?\" (Yes!) This shows how bees depend on flowers throughout their lives.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Time flexibility:** If students are highly engaged in Explore or Elaborate, take extra time. Skip or shorten EXPLAIN if needed—First graders learn best through hands-on activity.\n- **Real flower alternative:** If you don't have a fresh flower, use a high-quality photograph, flower model, or dissect a paper flower to show parts.\n- **Safety:** Ensure students don't taste the \"nectar\" (even though it's just colored water). Supervise use of glue and small materials.\n- **Prior knowledge:** Some students may have experience with bees in gardens. Activate this! Ask: \"Has anyone seen a bee at home? Where? What was it doing?\"\n- **Connection to next lesson:** This lesson sets up future lessons on plant reproduction (seeds), animal life cycles, and ecosystems.\n\n---\n\nThis 5E lesson puts First Graders in the role of scientists and designers, ensuring they actively construct knowledge about the bee-flower relationship rather than passively receiving information. The photograph remains the anchor throughout, and vocabulary is built gradually through exploration and conversation.",
