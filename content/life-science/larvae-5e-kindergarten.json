Exploring a Larva's Home**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 60-75 minutes (can be split into two 30-40 minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** K-LS1-1 (Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals, including humans, need to survive)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Observe and describe what they see in the photograph using words like head, body, and home\n- Identify at least two things a small animal (like a larva) needs to survive\n- Explain why an animal lives in a particular place using simple observation skills\n- Participate in a group discussion to share what they learn about animal needs\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about small creatures and their homes using the larva photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the larva (printed or displayed on screen, large enough for all students to see)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around a printed version so all students can see it clearly. Say: \"Today we're going to look at a very special tiny creature. It's so small you probably haven't seen one before!\"\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause after each for responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe it?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this creature lives? What is it sitting in?\"\n   - \"This creature is called a larva. Why do you think it might live in the dirt instead of somewhere else?\"\n   - \"What do you think this tiny animal needs to stay alive and healthy?\"\n\n3. **Create a wonder chart** by writing students' responses on chart paper. Title it: \"What Does a Larva Need?\" Record all ideas, even if some aren't scientifically accurate—you'll refine these in the Explain phase.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder if we can figure out what this tiny creature eats, where it sleeps, and what keeps it safe. Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to build our own little larva home so we can understand what this creature needs to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what animals need by creating and observing a model habitat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small clear plastic cups or jars (one per student or small group)\n- Potting soil or garden soil (damp, not soggy)\n- Small pebbles or rocks\n- Dry leaves or small twigs\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Spoons or scoops for distributing soil\n- Optional: magnifying glasses\n- Chart paper to record observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:** \"We're going to build a tiny home for a larva. What do you think we should put in it to make the larva happy and safe?\"\n\n2. **Distribute materials** and guide students step-by-step:\n   - Place a layer of damp soil in the bottom of the cup (about 2 inches)\n   - Add small pebbles or rocks on top\n   - Arrange small leaves or twigs\n   - Lightly mist with water so it's moist but not soaking wet\n   - Observe their creation with magnifying glasses if available\n\n3. **Guide observation and documentation:**\n   - Ask: \"What does your larva home look like? Is it wet or dry? Dark or light?\"\n   - Have students draw or describe their habitat on paper\n   - Record: \"What did we put in the larva's home? Why?\"\n   - Ask: \"Do you think a larva would want to live here? Why or why not?\"\n\n4. **Connect to the photograph:** \"Look at the photo again. Do you see dirt like we put in our home? Do you see small things to hide under? Our model looks like the larva's real home!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask prompting questions rather than providing answers\n- Guide hands-on material handling without taking over the task\n- Help students notice connections between their model and the photo\n- Record student observations and language for assessment\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a basic soil-and-rock habitat model\n- Students observe and describe at least two materials in their habitat\n- Students recognize connections between their model and the photograph\n- Students begin to identify reasons why the habitat includes certain elements (food source, hiding places, moisture)\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of what animals need to survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase (the wonder chart)\n- Photograph of the larva (displayed where all can see)\n- Index cards or chart paper for vocabulary\n- Images or drawings of: soil, water, shelter, food\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:**\n   - Ask 4-5 students to show and describe their larva habitat models\n   - Ask: \"What was hard or easy about building the home?\"\n   - Ask: \"What do you think a larva eats? Where do you think it finds food?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (post on chart or board with simple illustrations):\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives (like the soil in our photo and our model)\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy\n   - **Shelter:** A safe place to hide and be protected\n   - **Food:** What an animal eats to have energy\n   - **Water:** Liquid that all living things need\n\n3. **Connect concepts:**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"This larva lives in the soil. The soil is its habitat. In the soil, the larva finds food, water, and a safe place to hide.\"\n   - Refer to the wonder chart: \"You were right! A larva needs dirt to live in, water to drink, food to eat, and a dark, safe place to hide.\"\n   - Compare to students' models: \"Your habitats look like where a real larva lives. You gave the larva everything it needs!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"What are two things every animal needs to survive?\"\n   - Have students point to their models: \"Show me where the larva's shelter is. Show me where water is.\"\n   - Ask a student: \"Why is soil important for a larva?\" (Accept: \"The larva eats things in the soil\" or \"The larva hides in the soil\")\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds what it needs\n- **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy\n- **Shelter:** A safe home or hiding place\n- **Food:** What an animal eats to grow and have energy\n- **Water:** A liquid that all living things need to drink\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least two things an animal needs: food, water, shelter, or a safe place\n- Students understand that the larva's habitat (soil) provides these needs\n- Students connect their models to the photograph and recognize similarities\n- Students use vocabulary like \"habitat,\" \"shelter,\" and \"survive\" in simple sentences\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding by exploring other small animals' needs and comparing habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or worksheet\n- Pictures or photographs of other small animals in their habitats (earthworm in soil, ant in ant hill, bee in hive, spider in web, snail in shell)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Student drawing paper\n- Optional: short video clip (2-3 minutes) of small animals in nature\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce comparison task:** \"We learned what a larva needs. Let's see if other tiny animals need the same things!\"\n\n2. **Show 2-3 images** of other small creatures in their habitats (earthworm, ant, bee). Ask:\n   - \"Where does this animal live?\"\n   - \"What does it need to survive?\"\n   - \"How is its home like the larva's home? How is it different?\"\n\n3. **Student application task - choose one:**\n   \n   **Option A (Drawing & Labeling):**\n   - Have students draw a picture of another small animal and its home\n   - Label the shelter, food, water, and hiding places\n   - Write or say one sentence: \"[Animal name] needs _____ to survive.\"\n   \n   **Option B (Habitat Creation):**\n   - Set up materials for students to build a habitat for a different small animal (e.g., an ant, a beetle, a worm)\n   - Compare: \"Is this habitat like the larva's home? What's the same? What's different?\"\n\n4. **Share and compare:** Have 3-4 students share their drawings or new habitats and explain why they chose those materials.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to make connections across different habitats\n- Ask probing questions: \"Does this animal also need water like the larva?\" \"What is different about where this animal lives?\"\n- Celebrate observations and reasoning\n- Help students articulate why different animals need similar basic things despite living in different places\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different animals have different habitats but share similar needs (food, water, shelter)\n- Students apply learning to a new context (a different small animal)\n- Students explain their choices using observation-based language\n- Students draw or describe an animal habitat with at least three elements identified\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what animals need to survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Listen to student language during Engage discussions—do they use observation words?\n- Observe habitat models during Explore—do students intentionally add materials that provide food, water, or shelter?\n- Monitor responses during Explain—can students name at least two needs? Do they point to correct examples in models/photos?\n- Observe Elaborate task—do students apply the concept to a new animal?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nChoose one format:\n\n**Format 1 (For students who can write):**\nDraw the larva's home and label three things it has that the larva needs to survive.\n\n**Format 2 (For students who need support):**\nAsk these questions individually and record responses:\n- \"What is the larva's home called?\" (Expect: \"dirt,\" \"soil,\" \"ground\")\n- \"Name one thing the larva needs to stay alive.\" (Expect: food, water, shelter, or safe place)\n- \"Look at the picture. Why do you think the larva lives in the soil?\" (Expect: to hide, to find food, to stay safe)\n- \"Is the larva's home wet or dry? Why?\" (Expect: mention water or moisture for survival)\n\n**Format 3 (Performance-Based):**\nShow students three small animal pictures and ask: \"Which of these animals would like to live in soil like the larva? Why?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least ONE need of an animal (food, water, shelter)\n- ✓ Student describes a habitat or home using observation words\n- ✓ Student makes a connection between the photograph and their model OR between two different animals' needs\n- ✓ Student uses or understands vocabulary: habitat, survive, shelter, or food\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that animals need specific things to survive\n- Students recognize that a habitat provides those needs\n- Students can describe a simple animal home using observable details\n- Students apply learning to recognize needs across different animals\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use picture cards alongside words during Explain. Point to images when saying \"habitat,\" \"shelter,\" \"food,\" and \"water\" so students create visual associations.\n\n2. **Guided habitat building:** Provide a partially prepared habitat model and let students add only 2-3 materials (e.g., soil and a leaf). Ask: \"Is this a good home for a larva?\" Reduce decision-making to build confidence.\n\n3. **One-to-one questioning:** During evaluation, ask simpler yes/no questions first (\"Does a larva need water?\"), then open-ended follow-ups (\"What else does a larva need?\"). Accept single-word answers.\n\n**Challenge (Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Comparative habitats:** Have students build two habitats—one for a larva and one for a different small animal (worm, beetle, snail). Ask them to explain both similarities and differences in what each animal needs. Record their explanations on a Venn diagram.\n\n2. **Predict and test:** Ask: \"What would happen if we took all the water out of the larva's habitat? If we kept it in bright light? If we didn't give it food?\" Have students make predictions, then discuss why those conditions would be harmful.\n\n3. **Real-world connection:** Challenge students to find a larva or other small creature outside (with supervision). Observe its habitat and ask: \"What can you find that this animal needs to survive? What shelter does it have?\" Document findings with drawings and labels.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Life Cycle Exploration:** Introduce the concept that a larva grows into an adult insect. Show photographs of a larva → pupa → adult beetle/butterfly. Ask: \"Why might the larva and the adult need different habitats? What changes?\" Create a simple 3-frame drawing showing the life stages.\n\n2. **Habitat Hunt Outdoors:** Take students on a nature walk to find small animal homes (under rocks, in leaf piles, in bark crevices). Sketch or photograph the habitats found and compare them to the larva's home using a chart: \"Where I found it / What it looks like / What it has.\"\n\n3. **Animal Needs Sorting Game:** Create picture cards of different animals and their needs (food like leaves, water, shelter like a burrow). Students match animals to the habitats or items they need. Discuss why each animal needs those specific things.\n\n4. **Sensory Habitat Experience:** Fill a sensory bin with damp soil, small rocks, leaves, and twigs. Let students explore with their hands (wearing gloves if desired) and describe the textures, smells, and materials. Ask: \"How does this feel? Would a larva like to live here? Why?\"\n\n5. **Larva Journal:** Over the next week, have students observe their habitat model each day. Draw or describe changes: Does the soil dry out? Does it stay moist? What might happen to the larva if conditions change? This builds observation skills and understanding of habitat maintenance.",
