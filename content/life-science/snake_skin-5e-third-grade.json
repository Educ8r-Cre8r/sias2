ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal adaptation and camouflage using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of snake in leaf litter (displayed large on screen or printed for small groups)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Initial Observation:**\n   - Show the photograph on a large screen or distribute printed copies to small groups.\n   - Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds in silence before speaking.\n   - Say: *\"Today, we're hunting for a hidden animal. Can you find it?\"*\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (calibrated for Third Grade):**\n   - *\"What animal do you see in this picture? How did you find it if it was hiding?\"* (Hook: It's hard to spot!)\n   - *\"What color is the snake? What colors do you see in the leaves and wood around it?\"* (Connect to camouflage without naming it yet)\n   - *\"Why might it be helpful for a snake to look like the leaves and dirt around it?\"* (Activate prior knowledge about hiding)\n   - *\"Have you ever noticed how some animals look similar to where they live? Can you think of another animal that does this?\"* (Extend thinking)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:**\n   - *\"I wonder... what would happen to this snake if it lived in a bright green garden instead of this brown forest? Would it still be safe?\"*\n   - Record student wonderings on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Great questions! Now let's do an activity where you become scientists and test how well different colors hide in different places.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how color and pattern affect an animal's ability to hide in specific environments through a hands-on camouflage activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small paper squares or construction paper in various colors: tan, brown, green, bright pink, white, gray (8-10 of each color, about 2\" x 2\")\n- Two \"habitat\" boxes or large sheets of paper:\n  - **Habitat 1:** A sheet covered with dead leaves, twigs, and brown paper (forest floor/leaf litter like the photo)\n  - **Habitat 2:** Green tissue paper, green construction paper, and artificial grass (garden/grass)\n- Timer\n- Data recording sheet (see below)\n- Pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup:**\n   - Divide students into pairs or small groups.\n   - Give each group access to both habitat displays.\n\n2. **Student Directions (Read aloud and post visually):**\n   - *\"You are going to test which colors hide best in different habitats.\"*\n   - *\"Step 1: Your teacher will mix up all the colored paper squares and place them randomly on Habitat 1 (the brown forest floor). Don't look yet!\"*\n   - *\"Step 2: When I say 'Go,' you have 30 seconds to find and circle all the squares you can see. Write down the color and how many you found.\"*\n   - *\"Step 3: We'll repeat this with Habitat 2 (the green garden).\"*\n   - *\"Step 4: Compare your results. Which colors were easier to find in the forest? Which colors were easier to find in the garden?\"*\n\n3. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Distribute 8-10 colored squares randomly on each habitat board before students begin.\n   - Call out \"Go!\" and \"Stop!\" (use timer).\n   - Circulate and observe: *\"What colors are you finding easily? Which ones are harder to spot? Why do you think that is?\"*\n   - Do not tell students the answer; guide with questions.\n   - Assist with recording data on the sheet (or partner with students to scribe if needed).\n\n4. **Data Recording Sheet (provided to each group):**\n   ```\n   Colors Found in Brown Forest Habitat:\n   [Tan: ___ Brown: ___ Green: ___ Pink: ___ White: ___ Gray: ___]\n   \n   Colors Found in Green Garden Habitat:\n   [Tan: ___ Brown: ___ Green: ___ Pink: ___ White: ___ Gray: ___]\n   \n   Which habitat was it easier to find the brown squares? ___________\n   Which habitat was it easier to find the green squares? ___________\n   ```\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that tan and brown squares \"disappear\" in the brown forest habitat and green squares blend into the green garden.\n- Students will record that some colors are found fewer times in habitats where those colors match the environment.\n- Students will begin to understand that *matching the environment helps things hide.*\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration findings to the snake photograph and camouflage concept.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary pre-written\n- Color pencils or markers\n- Index cards with vocabulary terms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their results: *\"Which colors were hardest to find in the brown forest? Why?\"*\n   - Chart their responses: *\"Brown and tan squares were hard to find because the forest has lots of brown and tan colors!\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (with student-friendly definitions):**\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|\n   | **Camouflage** | When an animal's color or pattern matches where it lives, making it hard to see. |\n   | **Adaptation** | A special feature that helps an animal survive in its habitat. |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives that has the food, water, and shelter it needs. |\n   | **Inherited trait** | A characteristic that an animal gets from its parents (like brown skin or striped patterns). |\n   | **Survival** | Staying alive and healthy in your habitat. |\n\n3. **Connection to the Photograph:**\n   - Display the snake photo again.\n   - *\"Look at this snake. Its skin is brown, tan, and gray—just like the leaves and wood here. This is camouflage! The snake's coloring is an adaptation that helps it hide from animals that might want to eat it. The snake inherited this color from its parents.\"*\n   - Point to the background: *\"This is the snake's habitat—a forest floor with dead leaves and wood. The snake's skin color is perfect for this habitat!\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If this brown snake lived in a bright green garden like Habitat 2, would it still be well-hidden? Why or why not?\"* (Elicit that the snake would be easier to see because it doesn't match green.)\n   - Ask: *\"What would happen if a snake with green skin lived here in the brown forest?\"* (It would be easier for predators to see it.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or pattern matches where it lives, making it hard to see.\n- **Adaptation:** A special feature that helps an animal survive in its habitat.\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives.\n- **Inherited trait:** A body feature passed down from parents to babies.\n- **Survival:** Staying alive in your home environment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define camouflage and identify it in the photograph.\n- Students understand that the snake's brown/tan color is an inherited adaptation suited to its forest habitat.\n- Students recognize the connection between their camouflage experiment and the real snake.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply camouflage and adaptation concepts to new real-world scenarios and animal examples.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of various animals in different habitats (4-6 images):\n  - White polar bear on snow\n  - Green frog on lily pads\n  - Striped zebra in grassland\n  - Brown rabbit in brush\n  - Orange tiger in tall grass\n  - Speckled bird on tree bark\n- \"Which animal fits this habitat?\" sorting mats (printed or drawn on paper)\n- Markers and paper for student-created animal designs\n\n**Activity - Option A (Animal Matching):**\n\n1. **Animal Habitat Sort:**\n   - Display 2-3 animal pictures and their habitats separately.\n   - Ask: *\"Which animal do you think lives here? Why would its color help it survive in this habitat?\"*\n   - Have students match animals to habitats and explain their reasoning using the word \"camouflage\" or \"adaptation.\"\n\n2. **Student-Created Adaptation Design:**\n   - Show students a new habitat picture (e.g., a rocky mountain, a snowy forest, or a sandy desert).\n   - *\"Now YOU are a scientist. Design your own animal that would survive well in this habitat. Draw its color and pattern, and explain how its camouflage helps it hide.\"*\n   - Have students label their design: *\"This animal has [color/pattern] so it can hide from predators in its [habitat].\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the sorting with guiding questions: *\"Does this animal's color match this habitat? Why do you think the animal looks like this?\"*\n- Circulate during drawing: *\"Tell me about your animal. How does its color help it survive?\"* (Listen for use of vocabulary.)\n- Affirm use of vocabulary: *\"Yes! You're describing an adaptation!\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly match at least 2-3 animals to habitats based on camouflage reasoning.\n- Students create and explain a new animal design using adaptation vocabulary.\n- Students articulate that *color and pattern variations* give some animals advantages in particular environments.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of camouflage, adaptation, and habitat through formative and summative assessment.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the lesson):**\n- Observe during Explore: Do students recognize which colors blend into which habitats?\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain: Can they use the word \"camouflage\" or \"adaptation\" correctly?\n- Monitor Elaborate: Do students explain their animal designs with reasoning about habitat match?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (Administer at end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a brief written or verbal exit ticket. Read aloud; students respond verbally or draw/write:\n\n**Question 1 (Camouflage understanding):**\n*\"Look at the snake picture again. Why is the snake's brown and tan skin a good adaptation for living in a forest with dead leaves and wood?\"*\n- **Success Criteria:** Student says or writes that the brown/tan color matches the leaves and wood, making the snake hard to see (camouflage).\n\n**Question 2 (Habitat fit):**\n*\"Would this brown snake survive well in a bright green garden? Explain why or why not.\"*\n- **Success Criteria:** Student explains that the brown color would NOT match the green, so predators would see it more easily.\n\n**Question 3 (Inherited traits):**\n*\"Did the baby snake get its brown color from its parents, or did it learn it? How do you know?\"*\n- **Success Criteria:** Student indicates the color is inherited (came from parents) because it's a body feature present from birth, not something learned.\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n- ✓ Student identifies camouflage in the photograph and can explain why it helps the snake.\n- ✓ Student compares how the same snake color would work differently in different habitats.\n- ✓ Student uses the word \"adaptation\" or \"camouflage\" to explain the snake's traits.\n- ✓ Student constructs a simple argument: *\"This snake lives well in forests because [its color/pattern matches the habitat].\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can define or show understanding of camouflage.\n- 75% of students can explain why the snake's color is suited to its habitat.\n- 70% of students can predict what would happen if the snake's color changed or the habitat changed.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use \"hides\" instead of \"camouflage\" or \"blends in\"; use \"special feature\" instead of \"adaptation\" until students are ready for formal terms.\n\n2. **Concrete manipulatives:** During Explore, allow students to physically place colored squares on habitats rather than searching quickly. Give extra time (45 seconds instead of 30). Pair with a buddy for data recording.\n\n3. **Sentence frames for exit ticket:**\n   - *\"The snake's brown color helps it because ___.\"*\n   - *\"In the green garden, the brown snake would be ___ to hide.\"* (easy/hard)\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Habitat prediction:** Show students a new, complex habitat (e.g., a rocky stream or a tree with moss). Ask: *\"What color would an animal need to be to survive here? Why?\"* Have them explain multiple factors (camouflage, food availability, water).\n\n2. **Variation investigation:** Provide pictures of 3-4 different snakes with different patterns (striped, spotted, solid). Ask: *\"These are all snakes, but they look different. Why might each type live in a different place? What adaptation does each one have?\"*\n\n3. **Written explanation:** Have students write or illustrate a short story: *\"A snake with red and yellow stripes lived in a brown forest. What happened to this snake? Could it survive?\"* Encourage reasoning about predators and camouflage failures.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Observation Walk:** Take students on a nature walk or show photographs of a local outdoor space. Challenge them to find an animal or evidence of an animal (a hole, track, web, etc.) and predict what color or pattern would help an animal hide there. Discuss how real animals in your area use camouflage.\n\n2. **Camouflage Art Project:** Students create a large background (jungle, desert, ocean, snow) with markers and paint. They design and cut out a paper animal with camouflage to match, then glue it on. Display and have peers guess where the hidden animal is. Discuss: *\"Which animals are harder to find? Why?\"*\n\n3. **Animal Adaptation Research:** Provide picture cards or short books about animals with extreme adaptations (stick insect, leaf-tailed gecko, snow hare, arctic fox). Students choose one animal, research or observe pictures, and create a poster: *\"This animal's [feature] helps it survive in [habitat] because ___.\"* Share findings in small groups.\n\n4. **Skin Shedding Connection:** Show students a shed snake skin (if available from a nature center or educator, or a realistic photograph). Explain that snakes shed their skin as they grow—a life process! Connect to 3-LS1-1 by asking: *\"Snakes are born, grow, and shed their skin. What other animals do you know about that grow and change?\"*\n\n5. **Variation in Traits:** Provide multiple pictures or toy snakes in different colors/patterns. Have students sort them and discuss: *\"Why might some of these snakes live in different places than others? What did they inherit from their parents?\"* This addresses 3-LS3-1 and 3-LS3-2.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** If using live animals, check school policies and ensure appropriate handling. Photographs are safer and equally effective for this grade level.\n- **Pacing:** This lesson can be split across two sessions: Session 1 (Engage + Explore), Session 2 (Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate).\n- **Cross-curricular link:** This lesson integrates reading (following directions), math (counting/comparing data), and art (design activities).\n- **Common misconceptions to address:**\n  - *\"The snake chose to hide by copying the leaves.\"* → Clarify: The snake is born with this color; it's an inherited adaptation, not a choice.\n  - *\"Camouflage means the animal turns colors.\"* → Clarify: The animal is born with a color that matches its habitat. It doesn't change.",
