Observe and describe what the insect in the photograph is doing on the flower.\n2. Identify at least two things animals need to survive (food and water, or food and shelter).\n3. Explain that insects visit flowers to find food.\n4. Describe one way plants and animals are connected to each other.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animals, plants, and what living things need.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the insect on the flower\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: real flower in a vase (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently on a screen, chart, or large printout. Allow 30–45 seconds of silent observation time.\n\n2. **Ask discovery questions calibrated to kindergarten curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you see on this flower? Can you describe the bug to me?\" (prompt students to notice the insect's color, long legs, antennae)\n   - \"Why do you think this bug is visiting the flower? What might it be doing there?\" (encourage guesses without judgment)\n   - \"Have you ever seen a bug on a flower? What was it doing?\"\n   - \"What do you think this bug needs to stay alive?\" (plants, water, food, etc.)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what this bug needs from the flower to live. Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Create a visible anchor chart** titled \"What Do Animals Need?\" with three columns: Animals, Plants, and Our Ideas. Leave space to fill in during the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore what bugs and flowers need, and how they help each other. Let's be investigators!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover what animals and plants need through observation and hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real flowers (daisies, sunflowers, or wildflowers work well)—enough for small groups or pairs to examine\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but helpful)\n- Chart paper or drawing paper for each student/pair\n- Crayons, colored pencils\n- Water cups\n- Optional: live insects in clear containers (ensure humane observation—not to be kept permanently)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs or small groups** (2–3 per group).\n\n2. **Give each group a flower to observe closely:**\n   - \"Gently hold or look at your flower. What do you notice about it?\" (color, smell, center, petals, stem)\n   - \"Do you see anything on it or around it? Any bugs, pollen, or water drops?\"\n   - \"What part of the flower might an insect want to visit?\" (encourage pointing and discussion)\n\n3. **Introduce a simple observation task:**\n   - Students draw or dictate a picture of the flower with the bug visiting it.\n   - Ask them to label or point to: the bug, the flower, and the part of the flower the bug might eat.\n\n4. **If available, briefly show students a live insect** (or the photo again) and ask:\n   - \"What does this bug use to drink or eat from the flower?\" (point to mouthparts in photo)\n   - \"How would the bug get to the flower?\" (legs help it move and climb)\n\n5. **Ask students to predict:** \"If this bug didn't have flowers, what would happen to it?\" (Expect simple responses: \"It would be hungry,\" \"It would go away,\" etc.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, ask open-ended questions, and listen to student thinking without correcting.\n- Prompt deeper observation: \"Can you see the yellow powder on the flower? That's pollen—insects collect it!\"\n- Encourage all students to participate; accept answers at varying levels of sophistication.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and document (through drawing or dictation) that insects visit flowers.\n- Students recognize that flowers have parts insects interact with.\n- Students make simple connections: insects come to flowers for food.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to the concept that plants and animals have survival needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Anchor chart from Engage phase\n- Index cards with images or words (optional): animal, plant, food, water, need, survive\n- Chart paper for recording\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students together** and revisit the photograph.\n\n2. **Facilitate group share-out:**\n   - Ask 3–4 students to share what they drew or discovered: \"Tell us about the flower and bug you observed. What was the bug doing?\"\n   - Affirm observations: \"Yes, the bug was drinking from the flower!\" or \"You noticed the yellow pollen!\"\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly explanations:**\n\n   - **Animal:** A living thing that moves and eats. Examples: bugs, birds, dogs, you!\n   - **Plant:** A living thing that grows from the ground and makes food from sunlight. Examples: flowers, trees, grass.\n   - **Food:** Something animals eat to give them energy and help them grow.\n   - **Need:** Something a living thing must have to stay alive and healthy.\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive.\n\n4. **Make explicit connections to the photograph:**\n   - \"This bug is an animal. What does it need?\" Point to the flower on the photo. \"It needs food. The flower gives the bug food (nectar and pollen).\"\n   - \"The flower is a plant. What does it need?\" Elicit responses: sunlight, water, soil. \"The bug helps the flower by spreading pollen when it visits!\"\n   - \"So the bug needs the flower for food, and the flower needs the bug to help it make seeds. They need each other!\"\n\n5. **Complete the anchor chart:**\n   - Add to the \"Animals\" column: bugs need food, water, shelter\n   - Add to the \"Plants\" column: flowers need sun, water, soil\n   - Add to the \"Our Ideas\" column: bugs and flowers help each other\n\n6. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"What do you think would happen if all the flowers disappeared?\" (Pause for responses. Guide: \"The bugs wouldn't have food to eat.\")\n   - Ask: \"Why is the bug on the flower?\" (Expected answer: \"To eat\" or \"To get food\")\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Animal** | A living thing that moves around and eats food. |\n| **Plant** | A living thing that grows and makes its own food from sun and water. |\n| **Food** | Something we eat that gives our bodies energy. |\n| **Need** | Something a living thing must have to live and be healthy. |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and well. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that insects and flowers are both living things with needs.\n- Students can identify food as something animals need to survive.\n- Students recognize a simple relationship between the insect and the flower.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new context and deepen their knowledge of animal and plant needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large poster paper\n- Pictures of different animals (bee, butterfly, bird, squirrel, rabbit) printed or drawn\n- Pictures of different plants (tree, shrub, grass, garden vegetables) printed or drawn\n- Glue sticks, tape, markers\n- Optional: clipboards for an outdoor observation walk\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Animal and Plant Needs Match Game (Classroom)**\n\n1. **Create a two-column chart:** one side labeled \"Animals\" and one side labeled \"Plants.\"\n\n2. **Display pictures of different animals** (bee, butterfly, bird, ladybug, etc.) on the Animals side.\n\n3. **Display pictures of different plants** (flowers, trees, vegetables, shrubs) on the Plants side.\n\n4. **Ask students to come up and place a finger or string between an animal and a plant:**\n   - \"Which plant might the bee visit? Draw a line.\"\n   - \"Which plant might the bird eat seeds from? Connect them!\"\n   - Discuss: \"Why does this animal need this plant?\"\n\n5. **Reinforce the pattern:** \"Lots of animals need plants for food. Plants need the sun, water, and soil. Everything is connected!\"\n\n**Option B: Outdoor Observation Walk (if weather permits)**\n\n1. **Take students outside** to observe insects, flowers, and plants in a garden or yard area.\n\n2. **Ask them to find and point to:**\n   - One flower that might have insects on it\n   - One insect or bug\n   - One plant or tree\n\n3. **Discuss observations:** \"Did we find bugs on plants? What might they be eating?\"\n\n4. **Return inside and draw/dictate:** \"What did we see outside that needs food? What did we see that makes food from sun and water?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the matching activity by asking guiding questions, not giving answers.\n- During outdoor walks, ensure safety and guide observation without capturing insects.\n- Encourage students to make connections: \"Remember the bug on the flower? We found real bugs today!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding to multiple animals and plants.\n- Students recognize that many different animals visit plants for food.\n- Students deepen their understanding of the interconnectedness of living things.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what plants and animals need to survive, and their connection to each other.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Listen to student responses during Engage and Explain phases.\n- Observe drawings and dictations during Explore for evidence of understanding.\n- Check for understanding with verbal responses to guiding questions.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n\nConduct a brief individual or small-group interview using 2–3 of these questions:\n\n1. \"Tell me one thing a bug (or animal) needs to live.\" *(Accept: food, water, home/shelter)*\n2. \"Look at the flower picture. What is the bug doing on the flower?\" *(Expected: eating, drinking, getting food)*\n3. \"Why do you think flowers and bugs need each other?\" *(Accept any connection: flowers give bugs food; bugs help flowers; they're friends)*\n4. \"If we took away all the flowers, what would happen to the bugs?\" *(Expected: they'd be hungry, they'd go away, they wouldn't have food)*\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student can identify at least **one thing animals need to survive** (food is primary; water and shelter are bonuses).\n- ✓ Student can describe or show **what the insect is doing on the flower** (visiting, eating, drinking).\n- ✓ Student can make **a simple connection** between the plant and animal (bug needs flower for food; or flower and bug help each other).\n- ✓ Student uses **observable details** from the photograph or exploration (mentions flower color, insect appearance, or interaction).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most kindergarteners will demonstrate understanding by correctly identifying one animal need and describing the insect-flower relationship in simple terms.\n- Advanced students may explain that insects pollinate flowers or that plants and animals depend on each other.\n- Struggling students may need visual reminders or repeated modeling; accept one-word answers or pointing responses as valid.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Scaffolding for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Use repetitive questioning and visual supports:**\n   - Show the photograph repeatedly; use the same guiding questions across multiple days.\n   - Create a visual vocabulary board with labeled images of animals, plants, food, water, and shelter.\n   - Pair struggling students with more confident peers during Explore activities.\n\n2. **Simplify vocabulary and tasks:**\n   - Use only two key vocabulary words at a time: \"animal\" and \"food\" or \"plant\" and \"water.\"\n   - Ask yes/no questions: \"Does the bug look like it's eating?\" instead of open-ended prompts.\n   - Accept one-word answers, gestures, or pointing as valid responses.\n\n3. **Provide concrete manipulatives:**\n   - Use real flowers (or pictures of flowers) and toy insects for students to manipulate and act out the scenario.\n   - Create a small sensory bin with soil, water, and plastic bugs and flowers where students can explore freely.\n\n### Challenge (Extensions for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Introduce more complex concepts:**\n   - Teach the term \"pollination\": \"When the bug walks on the flower, yellow powder (pollen) sticks to it. When it visits the next flower, the powder helps make new seeds!\"\n   - Ask: \"What other animals visit flowers? Can you name them?\" (butterflies, bees, hummingbirds, beetles)\n   - Explore the concept of food chains in simple terms: \"The bug eats the flower. The bird eats the bug. The snake eats the bird!\"\n\n2. **Extend investigation:**\n   - Challenge students to observe and draw multiple insects on flowers (if available outdoors).\n   - Ask them to sort animals and plants into categories: \"Which animals fly? Which plants grow tall?\"\n   - Encourage students to make predictions: \"What would happen if bees didn't visit flowers?\"\n\n3. **Connect to life experiences:**\n   - Ask: \"Do you have flowers in your home or yard? What insects have you seen there?\"\n   - Invite students to share family observations: \"Has anyone seen a butterfly or bee on a flower at home?\"\n   - Suggest a simple gardening activity: plant a flower and observe what visits it over time.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Flower and Bug Craft Project:**\n   - Students create a large papier-mâché or tissue-paper flower, then add a paper insect (bug, bee, or butterfly) on top.\n   - Display in the classroom with labels: \"This [animal] visits this [flower] to get [food].\"\n   - Reinforces vocabulary and celebrates the animal-plant connection in a tactile way.\n\n2. **\"What Do Animals and Plants Need?\" Picture Walk:**\n   - Create a hallway display with large photographs or illustrations of different animals (dog, fish, bird, squirrel) and plants (tree, cactus, sunflower, grass).\n   - Students walk and place sticky notes or stickers on pictures answering: \"What does this animal/plant need?\"\n   - Builds classroom community and reinforces cross-curricular observation skills.\n\n3. **Home Observation Project:**\n   - Send home a simple observation sheet (pictures with blanks to fill in or draw): \"Find a plant or flower. Draw or tell about an insect or animal that visits it. What does it need?\"\n   - Ask families to help children observe outdoor insects and report back.\n   - Extends learning beyond the classroom and engages families in science conversations.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
