ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of the insect on the daisy (8.5\" × 11\" or larger, laminated if possible)\n- Document camera or interactive smartboard (optional, for displaying to whole group)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** where all students can see it clearly. If you have a document camera, use it to project the image on a screen. If not, pass around a printed copy or gather students on the carpet where you hold it up.\n\n2. **Introduce with wonder, not information:**\n   - Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. What do you notice? What do you see?\"\n   - Give students 20-30 seconds of silent looking time before discussing.\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (pause after each for responses):\n   - *\"What is the small creature on top of the flower? What does it look like?\"* (Listen for: bug, insect, ant-like thing; note body parts they mention)\n   - *\"What do you think the bug is doing on the flower?\"* (Accept all ideas: eating, playing, sleeping, drinking, looking)\n   - *\"Does the flower look happy or sad to have the bug on it? Why do you think so?\"*\n   - *\"What does this bug need to live? What does this flower need to live?\"* (Listen for: food, water, sun, air)\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper as they share. Use drawings and simple words. Do not correct misconceptions yet.\n\n5. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n   - Say: \"I'm wondering... does the bug help the flower, or does the flower help the bug, or do they help each other? Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to explore like scientists and discover how bugs and flowers are friends.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- One large plastic or silk flower (or a real flower if available and safe)\n- One toy insect or bug (plastic) OR students can make a paper bug following a simple template\n- Magnifying glass (optional but recommended)\n- Chart paper or clipboard with blank paper\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Sticker dots or small circular stickers (to represent pollen)\n- Hand lens (1 per pair if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Teacher Setup (before students arrive):**\nPlace flowers and insects at each table or learning station, 2-3 students per station.\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Observe the flower closely:**\n   - \"Use your eyes (and magnifying glass if you have one) to look at every part of the flower. Point to the petals, the middle, and the stem.\"\n   - \"Draw or point to show me where you see yellow pollen in the middle.\"\n\n2. **Observe the insect closely:**\n   - \"Look at your bug. Can you find its legs? How many can you count? Point to its head, body, and antennae (long feelers).\"\n   - \"If you have a hand lens, look even closer. What new things do you see?\"\n\n3. **Pretend exploration:**\n   - \"Now, use your toy bug to walk it across the flower. Make it land on the yellow pollen in the middle.\"\n   - \"Watch what happens. Does any yellow pollen stick to the bug? Stick a small sticker dot on your bug to show where pollen would stick.\"\n   - \"Now walk your bug to another flower and let it drop off the pollen. What do you think happens?\"\n\n4. **Record observations:**\n   - Students draw or dictate: \"I noticed the bug has _____ (body parts). The flower has _____ (parts). When the bug landed on the flower, I saw _____.\"\n   - Teacher or aide writes down student observations if needed.\n\n**What Students Should Record or Document:**\n- Drawings of the flower and insect with labels (teacher can label)\n- Sticker showing where \"pollen\" stuck to the bug\n- Verbal observations recorded by teacher on their sheet\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- **Circulate constantly.** Stop at each table for 2-3 minutes.\n- **Ask open-ended questions, not leading ones:**\n  - \"What do you notice about the bug's legs?\"\n  - \"Where do you think the pollen is stickiest on the bug?\"\n  - \"How do you think this helps the flower?\"\n- **Resist explaining.** If a student asks \"Why does pollen stick?\" say: \"What do *you* think? Let's watch and see.\"\n- **Document observations** with brief notes or sketches of what students say and do. These inform your Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students should discover that insects have body parts (legs, head, body, antennae).\n- Students should observe that insects move across flowers and could carry something (pollen/stickers).\n- Students should notice that flowers have petals, a yellow center, and different parts.\n- Some students may spontaneously notice or suggest: \"The bug helps the flower make seeds,\" or \"The pollen sticks to the bug.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with student observations from Engage\n- Large photograph of the insect on the daisy (same as Engage)\n- Simple picture cards showing: insect body parts, flower parts, pollen, nectar (optional—you can draw these)\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Gather all students on the carpet with their exploration sheets nearby.\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover about the bug? Show me with your drawing or tell me with words.\"\n   - Call on 4-5 students to share one thing.\n   - As they share, add to the chart from Engage with new information (e.g., \"We found out bugs have 6 legs!\").\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n\n   Present each term with a picture, real example, or clear definition. Repeat the word many times.\n\n   - **Insect:** \"This is called an *insect*. Insects are small animals with six legs, a body in three parts, and feelers called antennae. The bug we saw is an insect!\"\n     - Point to the photograph and show: legs, body, antennae.\n   \n   - **Flower:** \"This is a *flower*. Flowers are the pretty parts of plants. Flowers have petals (the colored parts you see), a center, a stem, and leaves. Flowers need water, sunlight, and soil to grow.\"\n     - Point to each part in the photograph.\n   \n   - **Pollen:** \"Inside the flower is a yellow powder called *pollen*. Pollen is like food and helper stuff for flowers. When an insect walks on a flower, pollen sticks to the insect's body, just like the stickers you used!\"\n     - Show a sticker dot or the photograph to illustrate.\n   \n   - **Needs/Survive:** \"All living things *need* certain things to *survive*, which means to stay alive and healthy. Plants need soil, water, and sunlight. Insects need food and water.\"\n\n   - **Helper/Partnership:** \"The insect helps the flower by carrying pollen to other flowers. The flower helps the insect by giving it food called nectar. They are partners, like friends!\"\n\n3. **Make Connections Back to Explore (3 minutes):**\n   - Show the photograph again.\n   - Point: \"See the insect here? It's walking on the flower. The pollen sticks to the bug, just like your stickers did. The insect is helping the flower!\"\n   - Revisit the Explore activity: \"Remember when you walked your bug across the flower and the stickers stuck to it? That's what really happens in nature!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can someone show me where the pollen is in this picture?\" (Point to yellow center)\n   - Ask: \"Can someone point to the insect's legs?\" (Point to thin dark legs)\n   - Ask: \"Why does the insect visit the flower?\" (Accept: \"For food,\" \"To eat,\" \"Because it's pretty,\" etc.)\n\n**Vocabulary Table:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Insect** | A small animal with six legs, a body in three parts, and long feelers called antennae. |\n| **Flower** | The pretty, colorful part of a plant that has petals, a center, a stem, and leaves. |\n| **Pollen** | A yellow powder inside flowers that sticks to insects and helps flowers make new flowers. |\n| **Needs** | Things a living thing must have to stay alive and healthy, like food, water, and air. |\n| **Partner/Helper** | Two living things that help each other; the insect helps the flower, and the flower helps the insect. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can identify an insect and name at least one body part.\n- Students understand that flowers are living plants with different parts.\n- Students recognize that insects visit flowers and get pollen on their bodies.\n- Students begin to understand that insects and flowers have a helpful relationship.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials (choose one activity):**\n\n**Option A: Insect & Flower Movement Activity**\n- Space in classroom or gym for movement\n- Picture cards or sign for each \"flower\" (4-5 made from large paper)\n- Music or a drum\n\n**Option B: Create a Garden Diorama**\n- Small box or paper plate base\n- Construction paper flowers (pre-cut or students cut)\n- Plastic or paper insects\n- Glue sticks\n- Crayons\n- Chart paper describing the scene\n\n**Option C: Plant Seeds & Observe (Longer-term)**\n- Small cups\n- Potting soil\n- Fast-growing seeds (marigold, sunflower, bean)\n- Water\n- Sunny windowsill\n- Observation journal\n\n**Activity (I recommend Option A for this age and timeframe):**\n\n**\"Insect and Flower Partners\" Movement Game (15-20 minutes):**\n\n1. **Setup:**\n   - Designate 4-5 \"flower stations\" around the room (use signs, hula hoops, or paper mats).\n   - Divide class: most students are \"insects,\" 1-2 are \"flower growers.\"\n\n2. **How to Play:**\n   - **Flower growers** stand at each flower station and hold up a picture of a flower or act as the flower.\n   - **Insects** move around the room (walk, skip, crawl like a bug). When you play music or beat a drum, they move. When the music stops, they \"land on a flower.\"\n   - At the flower, the insect does an action:\n     - Say: \"I'm eating nectar from the flower!\" (pretend to drink)\n     - Say: \"Pollen is sticking to me!\" (touch different body parts—arms, legs, back—where pollen would stick)\n     - The flower grower says: \"Thank you for helping me! Please carry my pollen to the next flower!\" (or similar)\n   - When music plays again, insects move to the next flower.\n   - After 2-3 rounds, switch roles so flower growers become insects.\n\n3. **Debrief:**\n   - Gather and ask:\n     - \"What happened when the insect landed on the flower?\"\n     - \"How did the flower help the insect?\"\n     - \"How did the insect help the flower?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- **Facilitate and model the first round.** Play an insect yourself to show the behavior.\n- **Use narrative language:** \"Look, the insect is landing on the flower! Pollen is sticking to its wings and legs! The insect is getting food!\"\n- **Keep energy high** with music and enthusiasm.\n- **Gently redirect** students who are struggling with rules (expected at this age).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students physically demonstrate understanding that insects and flowers interact.\n- Students verbalize the concept: \"The bug helped the flower\" or \"The flower gave the bug food.\"\n- Students show comfort with the idea of a partnership between two living things.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n\nThroughout all phases, observe and document:\n- **During Engage:** Listen to student responses to discussion questions. Do they notice details? Do they make any connections?\n- **During Explore:** Circulate and listen to student observations. Can they identify flower and insect parts?\n- **During Explain:** Do students answer your check-for-understanding questions correctly? Do they use the new vocabulary?\n- **During Elaborate:** Do students participate in the game? Can they demonstrate the interaction between insect and flower?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes):**\n\nChoose ONE of the following based on your class and time:\n\n**Option 1: Drawing & Labeling**\n- Give each student a blank paper or index card.\n- Ask: \"Draw a flower with an insect on it. Show me the insect's legs and the flower's petals.\"\n- Optional: \"Draw an arrow showing where the pollen goes.\"\n- **Teacher adds labels** (e.g., \"Insect,\" \"Flower,\" \"Pollen,\" \"Legs\") as students point and dictate.\n\n**Option 2: Verbal Response (Teacher or Aide One-on-One or Small Group)**\n- Ask 2-3 questions:\n  1. \"What is this small creature called?\" (Accept: \"Bug,\" \"Insect,\" \"It has six legs\")\n  2. \"Why does the insect visit the flower?\" (Accept: \"To eat,\" \"For food,\" \"To get nectar\")\n  3. \"Does the insect help the flower? How?\" (Accept: \"Yes, it carries pollen,\" \"It helps make new flowers,\" \"It moves the yellow stuff\")\n- Record student answers on a simple checklist.\n\n**Option 3: Sorting/Matching Activity (if time allows)**\n- Show picture cards of: insect body parts (legs, antennae, body), flower parts (petals, stem, center), and things they need (water, soil, sunlight).\n- Ask: \"Which of these do insects have?\" \"Which do flowers need?\"\n- Students point or place cards in two groups.\n\n**Success Criteria (Students are meeting objectives if they can:)**\n\n✓ Identify an insect and name at least one body part (leg, antenna, body)\n\n✓ Describe that insects visit flowers (to get food/nectar)\n\n✓ State that flowers are living things with certain needs (water, sun, soil)\n\n✓ Show or explain that insects and flowers help each other (with support or prompting)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most Kindergarteners should successfully complete the drawing or verbal assessment, identifying flowers and insects.\n- Most should understand the basic concept: \"Bugs go to flowers for food.\"\n- With prompting, most should recognize: \"The bug helps the flower.\"\n- A few may need revisiting or extension to fully understand the partnership; this is developmentally appropriate.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:**\n   - Use only 2-3 key words per phase (e.g., \"Insect,\" \"Flower,\" \"Food\").\n   - Repeat these constantly and create a visual word wall with pictures.\n\n2. **Provide pre-drawn outlines:**\n   - During Explore and Elaborate, give students partially completed drawings (e.g., flower outline with center pre-drawn) so they focus on observation, not drawing skill.\n   - Or allow them to use stickers and stamps instead of drawing.\n\n3. **Partner with peer or adult:**\n   - Pair struggling students with a buddy during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n   - Have an aide sit with small group during Explain to provide 1:1 clarification.\n   - Use hand-over-hand guidance for movement activities if fine motor skills are a concern.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deepen the partnership question:**\n   - Ask: \"If there were no insects, what might happen to the flower? If there were no flowers, what might happen to the insect?\"\n   - Guide them to predict consequences: \"The flower wouldn't make seeds,\" \"The insect would have no food.\"\n\n2. **Extend observation and investigation:**\n   - Provide a real flower with an actual insect (if safe and available) for 5-10 minutes of observation.\n   - Challenge: \"Can you find pollen on this real insect? Is it the same as the stickers you used?\"\n   - Or: \"Design a new flower that might attract more insects. What would you make it look like? Why?\"\n\n3. **Create a \"Thank You\" card or story:**\n   - Ask advanced learners to draw and dictate: \"A Thank You from the Insect to the Flower\" or vice versa.\n   - Example: \"Thank you, flower, for giving me food. I will carry your pollen to your friends.\"\n   - This builds narrative comprehension and deepens emotional connection to the concept.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### Extension Activity 1: \"Pollinator Hunt\" (Outdoors or Video-Based)\n**Time:** 20-30 minutes (can be done on a separate day)\n\n- **If weather/outdoor access allows:** Take students to a garden or naturalized area with blooming flowers.\n  - Students hunt for insects on flowers using \"detective clipboards\" (clipboard with binoculars drawing).\n  - Record: What bugs did we see? On what flowers? What colors are the flowers?\n  - Discuss: \"Did we see any pollen sticking to the bugs?\"\n\n- **If outdoors isn't available:** Show a short video of pollinators on flowers (2-3 minutes from PBS Kids or National Geographic Kids).\n  - Students watch and record on a simple chart: \"We saw _____ on _____.\"\n  - Discuss: \"Did you see pollen sticking to any bugs?\"\n\n**Connection to NGSS K-LS1-1:** Students further observe and describe what animals need (food from flowers).\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activity 2: \"Flower Need Hunt\" (Indoor Scavenger Hunt)\n**Time:** 15-20 minutes\n\n- **Preparation:** Place pictures or real items around the classroom representing flower needs:\n  - A watering can (water)\n  - A picture of the sun (sunlight)\n  - A pot of soil (soil)\n  - A seed packet (food from soil)\n\n- **Activity:** Students \"hunt\" for each item and place it near a drawn flower or potted plant.\n  - At each station, ask: \"Why does the flower need this?\"\n  - Record student ideas on chart.\n\n- **Debrief:** \"What three things do flowers need to grow? Let's make a poster!\"\n\n**Connection to NGSS K-LS1-1:** Direct focus on survival needs of plants.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activity 3: \"Plant a Flower or Herb\" (Longer-Term Project)\n**Time:** 30-40 minutes (can span 2-3 sessions)\n\n- Students plant seeds in small cups (marigolds, sunflowers, or herbs like basil or mint are fast-growing).\n- Create a \"Plant Care Chart\" with pictures showing: watering (water), sunlight (window), and soil.\n- Over 2-4 weeks, students observe growth and record via drawings or photos.\n- **Connection:** Revisit NGSS K-LS1-1 as plants grow—emphasize: \"Our plant needs water, sun, and soil to grow, just like the flower in our picture!\"\n- Once bloomed (if flowers appear), discuss: \"Will insects visit our flowers? Why? What will they do?\"\n\n**Optional:** If insects visit your classroom flowers, celebrate and discuss the real-world connection!\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Pacing:** Kindergarteners have limited attention spans (10-15 minutes per activity is ideal). If time is short, combine Explain and Elaborate into one 20-minute block.\n\n- **Safety:** If using real insects, ensure no stinging bugs and handle gently. Plastic insects are a safe, effective alternative.\n\n- **Real Flowers:** If possible, use real flowers (daisies like in the photo are perfect—hardy and pretty). Kids find them more engaging than plastic ones.\n\n- **Photography:** Take photos of student work and explanations. These serve as both documentation and portfolio evidence.\n\n- **Reusability:** Laminate the engagement photograph and your flower/insect pictures for future years.\n\n- **Family Connection:** Send a note home asking families to observe bugs on flowers and report back to class: \"Did you see any bugs on flowers? What were they doing?\"\n\n---\n\nThis lesson leverages direct observation, concrete materials, and movement to build foundational understanding of interdependence and survival needs—core Kindergarten life science concepts. The flower-insect partnership is relatable, visible, and memorable for young learners.",
