Discovering Animal Habitats\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** 2nd Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-LS4-1: Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Observe and describe the habitat where snow geese live using details from the photograph.\n- Compare snow geese habitat to at least one other animal habitat and identify differences.\n- Explain how snow geese's body features (wings, white feathers, long neck) help them survive in their habitat.\n- Identify and list at least three characteristics of the snow geese habitat from the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animals and where they live.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of snow geese in the agricultural field (displayed large on projector or printed poster)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board without explanation. Give students 1-2 minutes to simply look and notice.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What animals do you see in this picture? What are they doing?\"\n   - \"What does this place look like? What do you notice about the ground, the sky, and the landscape?\"\n   - \"Why do you think so many birds are gathered together in this field? What might they be looking for?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen birds like these? Where do you think they live when they're not in fields like this?\"\n\n3. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"I wonder why these birds chose to live and gather in this open field instead of in a forest or near a pond. Turn to a partner and share your ideas.\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper (even if inaccurate—these will be revisited during Explain phase).\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become animal detectives and learn all about where these amazing birds live and what they need to survive in their habitat.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate snow geese habitat through close observation and comparison to familiar animal homes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (printed copies or one large display copy)\n- \"Habitat Detective\" worksheet (see directions below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Chart showing 3-4 different habitats (forest, desert, ocean/water, grassland/field) with simple illustrations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Observation Hunt (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute printed copies** of the snow geese photograph to small groups (2-3 students per group), or have students gather around the large display.\n\n2. **Guide students** to complete a \"Habitat Detective Checklist\" by marking or circling what they observe:\n   - [ ] Is the ground wet or dry?\n   - [ ] Are there trees?\n   - [ ] Are there tall plants or short plants?\n   - [ ] Is the sky clear or cloudy?\n   - [ ] Are there other animals besides geese?\n   - [ ] Are there rocks, water, or buildings?\n\n3. **Have students draw or label** one thing they notice about where the geese are living. They should label at least three features (e.g., \"flat ground,\" \"open space,\" \"brown soil\").\n\n**Part B: Habitat Comparison (8 minutes)**\n\n4. **Show the habitat chart** with four different types of habitats (forest, desert, ocean, grassland).\n\n5. **Ask students:** \"Which habitat from our chart looks most like where the snow geese live? Why?\" Discuss responses.\n\n6. **Students draw or write** one way the geese's habitat is the same as another habitat and one way it's different.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask clarifying questions: \"What do you see here? Why do you think that matters for the geese?\"\n- Encourage students to use their senses language: \"I see... I notice... I observe...\"\n- Avoid correcting observations; record all ideas for the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 3-4 physical features of the snow geese habitat (open field, flat land, few trees, brown soil).\n- Students recognize that this habitat is different from forests or deserts.\n- Students begin to connect habitat features to bird needs (e.g., \"open space to fly\").\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and clarify concepts about habitats using the photograph and student discoveries.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with \"Habitat\" vocabulary word\n- Photograph displayed\n- Whiteboard or chart to record key terms\n- Picture cards of different animals and their habitats (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Facilitate a group share-out** (5 minutes):\n   - Call on 3-4 groups to share one observation from their \"Habitat Detective\" worksheet.\n   - Record their observations on a class chart titled \"What We Notice About Snow Geese Habitat.\"\n   - Connect observations to the photograph: \"Yes! I see that open space too. Let's think about why that matters.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (7 minutes) with student-friendly definitions:\n\n   | Vocabulary | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and where it finds food, water, and shelter. |\n   | **Environment** | All the things around an animal—like weather, plants, ground, and water. |\n   | **Adaptation** | A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. |\n   | **Diversity** | The many different kinds of animals that live in different places. |\n\n3. **Make explicit connections** (4 minutes):\n   - Point to the photograph: \"The snow geese live in a habitat called a grassland or field. This is their home. They chose this place because it has what they need.\"\n   - Ask: \"What do you see that the geese need? How do their bodies help them live here?\"\n   - Highlight: \"Their white feathers help them stay warm in cold weather. Their wings help them fly to find food. Their long necks help them reach down to eat plants and seeds.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I move a snow goose to a desert habitat, what might be different for it?\"\n   - Have students turn-and-talk: \"Why do you think geese live in big groups in fields? What helps them survive?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs (home).\n- **Environment:** All the things around an animal—weather, land, water, and plants.\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or skill that helps an animal live in its home.\n- **Diversity:** The many different kinds of animals living in many different places.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that a habitat is a specific place where animals live.\n- Students can name 2-3 features of the snow geese habitat.\n- Students can name 2-3 body features of snow geese and explain how they help the bird survive (e.g., wings for flying, white feathers for warmth, long neck for feeding).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by comparing snow geese habitats to other animal habitats and thinking about adaptation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos of 4-6 different animals (squirrel, fish, desert lizard, penguin, polar bear, rabbit)\n- Picture cards or photos of their habitats (forest, river, desert, ice, tundra, meadow)\n- Matching worksheet or sorting activity\n- Chart paper: \"Animals and Their Homes\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Habitat Matching Game (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display animal and habitat pictures** around the room or on the board.\n\n2. **Explain the task:** \"We know snow geese live in open fields. But other animals live in different habitats. Your job is to match each animal to the habitat where it lives.\"\n\n3. **Work as a class or in small groups** to match animals to habitats:\n   - Squirrel → Forest\n   - Fish → River/Lake\n   - Desert lizard → Desert\n   - Penguin → Ice/Tundra\n   - Polar bear → Ice/Tundra\n   - Rabbit → Grassland/Meadow\n\n4. **After matching, discuss:**\n   - \"Why does the fish live in water but the squirrel lives in trees?\"\n   - \"What does each animal need that its habitat gives it?\"\n   - \"How is the snow geese habitat the same as the rabbit's habitat? How is it different?\"\n\n**Part B: My Habitat Poster (8 minutes)**\n\n5. **Students choose one animal** from the matching activity (or suggest their own).\n\n6. **Students draw or write answers** to complete their own \"Animal Habitat\" poster:\n   - **Animal:** ________________\n   - **Where it lives:** ________________\n   - **What it needs there:** (food, water, shelter, safety)\n   - **How its body helps it live there:** (draw or describe one adaptation)\n\n7. **Students share posters** with a partner or the class.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate matching discussion; ask: \"What does this animal need? Does this habitat have that?\"\n- Guide students to see patterns: \"Notice—all the animals that live in cold places have thick fur or feathers. Why?\"\n- Help students connect body features to habitat needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students match at least 4 animals to their correct habitats.\n- Students explain one reason why an animal lives in its habitat.\n- Students identify one body adaptation and explain how it helps an animal survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitats, animal diversity, and adaptation.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing):**\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Are they noticing habitat features? Can they describe what they see?\n- Listen to turn-and-talk discussions during Explain: Do students use habitat vocabulary appropriately?\n- Review \"Habitat Detective\" worksheets: Did students identify 3+ habitat features?\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal or written depending on writing ability):\n\n**Snow Geese Habitat Exit Ticket**\n\n1. **Where do snow geese live?** (Acceptable answers: field, grassland, open place, flat ground)\n\n2. **Name one thing snow geese need in their habitat.** (Acceptable answers: food, open space to fly, safety in groups, water)\n\n3. **How does the snow goose's white feather help it?** (Acceptable answers: keeps it warm, helps it hide in snow, protects it)\n\n4. **Draw a different animal and its habitat.** (Check: Does the animal match the habitat? Can the student name both?)\n\n**Alternative Assessment Option:**\n- **Habitat Sorting Game:** Show students pictures of 6-8 habitats. Ask them to point to \"where a snow goose lives\" and explain why. Repeat with other animals.\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n- ✓ Student accurately identifies the snow geese habitat as an open field/grassland.\n- ✓ Student names at least one feature of the habitat.\n- ✓ Student matches at least 3 animals to their correct habitats.\n- ✓ Student explains or names one body feature that helps an animal survive in its habitat.\n- ✓ Student demonstrates understanding of diversity by recognizing that different animals live in different places.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that snow geese live in a specific habitat suited to their needs.\n- Students can compare the snow geese habitat to at least one other animal habitat.\n- Students recognize that animals have body features that help them survive in their habitats.\n- Students understand that many different kinds of animals live in many different habitats (diversity).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce cognitive load with a simplified worksheet:**\n   - Provide the \"Habitat Detective Checklist\" with pictures instead of words (yes/no checkboxes with simple icons for water, trees, animals, etc.).\n   - Allow students to point to features in the photograph rather than write or draw.\n\n2. **Pair with a stronger reader/observer:**\n   - Assign struggling students to a partner who can help describe observations and read habitat vocabulary.\n   - Use hand signals or pointing to identify habitat features instead of requiring written responses.\n\n3. **Pre-teach vocabulary with real objects or videos:**\n   - Before the lesson, show a 2-minute video of snow geese in their habitat.\n   - Use a small globe or map to show where cold habitats are located.\n   - Create a tactile \"habitat station\" with samples (sand for desert, cotton for snow, grass for grassland) to touch and explore.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extend to food chains and ecosystems:**\n   - Ask: \"What do you think snow geese eat in this field? What plants or seeds grow there?\"\n   - Have students research and draw a food chain: grass/seeds → geese → predator (eagle or fox).\n   - Challenge: \"What would happen to the geese if all the plants died? How are geese connected to their habitat?\"\n\n2. **Compare migration and seasonal habitats:**\n   - Introduce the concept that snow geese migrate (move to different habitats seasonally).\n   - Ask: \"Why might geese leave this habitat in winter? Where do you think they go?\"\n   - Have students map two habitats (summer field and winter wetland/marsh) and explain why geese move between them.\n\n3. **Design a new habitat:**\n   - Give students a scenario: \"You are creating a zoo habitat for snow geese. What would you include? Why?\"\n   - Students sketch or list features they would add: water, plants, open space, shelter, etc.\n   - Challenge them to justify each feature: \"How does this help the goose survive?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Habitat Diorama Creation:**\n   - Students create a small 3D model of the snow geese habitat using a shoe box, construction paper, cotton for snow, brown paper for soil, and small animal figurines.\n   - Students label habitat features and explain their diorama to classmates.\n   - **Time:** 30-40 minutes\n   - **Connects to:** 2-LS4-1 (observing animals in habitats)\n\n2. **Migrate Like a Goose Game:**\n   - Create a classroom migration game where students walk or run from one \"habitat station\" to another, mimicking snow geese flying from winter to spring habitats.\n   - Set up stations: Winter Field (cold, snowy), Spring Marsh (wet, food-rich), Fall Field (preparing for winter).\n   - Students experience movement and seasonal habitat change.\n   - **Time:** 20-30 minutes\n   - **Connects to:** Understanding animal behavior and habitat needs\n\n3. **Diversity Hunt Around School Grounds:**\n   - Take students outside to search for different animal habitats on the school grounds (under rocks, in trees, in grass, under eaves, etc.).\n   - Have students observe and sketch small animals and their homes: insects, birds, worms, spiders.\n   - Create a class \"Our School's Animal Habitats\" poster showing the diversity of animals living nearby.\n   - **Time:** 30-45 minutes (outdoor + indoor recording)\n   - **Connects to:** 2-LS4-1 (comparing diversity of life in different habitats)",
