  "content": "# NGSS Engineering Design Process Challenge\n\n## Visible Elements in Photo\n- A white egret standing on dark rocks in shallow water\n- Blue water with reflections of overhanging branches/vegetation\n- Long, thin yellow legs supporting the bird's body\n- Pointed beak (blue-gray coloring)\n- Overhanging brown branches and moss-covered rocks framing the habitat\n\n## Reasonable Inferences\n- **From long, thin legs and shallow-water position**: The egret needs legs designed to wade through water without sinking, suggesting a need for weight distribution over a large surface area.\n- **From the rocky shoreline habitat**: The bird must navigate slippery, uneven surfaces while hunting, implying a need for grip and balance mechanisms.\n- **From the pointed beak**: The egret hunts by spearing small fish, so its tool is optimized for precision and penetration in water.\n\n---\n\n## Engineering Task\n\n### **K-2 Version:**\n**\"Design Wading Legs for a Bird\"**\n\nImagine you are designing a bird that needs to walk through muddy water without getting stuck. Build legs using straws, thin sticks, or craft materials that can hold up a small toy or cup of water. Your bird's legs need to:\n- Stand up tall and straight\n- Not wobble or tip over when you add weight\n- Keep the body high above a puddle of water\n\nTry different leg shapes—skinny, fat, splayed out wide. Which design keeps your bird from sinking?\n\n---\n\n### **3-5 Version:**\n**\"Engineer Stable Wading Legs for Shallow-Water Hunting\"**\n\nDesign a set of legs for a wading bird (like the egret) that hunts in shallow water. Your legs must:\n- Support a 500g weight (a small cup of water or sand) without buckling\n- Span at least 6 inches tall when vertical\n- Distribute weight across a wider footprint than a single point (use feet or padded bases)\n- Be built from no more than 5 materials from your kit\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Legs remain stable when the bird leans forward to \"strike\" at fish (simulated by tilting the body 30 degrees)\n- The bottom of the legs can grip a slippery surface (test on wet tile or foil)\n- You can explain why your design prevents sinking in mud or soft ground\n\n---\n\n## EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem** — This phase fits best.\n\nThe photo shows a real organism solving a natural engineering problem: how to move safely and hunt effectively in a challenging environment. Students start by observing *why* the egret's legs are shaped the way they are, then define their own problem: \"How can we design legs that work the same way?\" This grounds the activity in authentic biomimicry before students move to imagining solutions.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Materials\n\n1. **Drinking straws or thin wooden dowels** (for leg structure)\n2. **Foam sheets or rubber erasers** (for feet/foot pads to prevent sinking)\n3. **Tape or hot glue** (to join and reinforce joints)\n4. **Modeling clay or playdough** (for weight and gripping surfaces)\n5. **Aluminum foil or plastic wrap** (to simulate slippery water surfaces for testing grip)\n\n---\n\n## Estimated Time\n\n**One 45-minute session** (K-2) or **Two 30-minute sessions** (3-5)\n\n*Session 1:* Observe the photo, brainstorm leg designs, build prototype.  \n*Session 2:* Test on simulated muddy/slippery ground, modify, test again, and discuss results.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.A (defining and delimiting engineering problems)** by asking students to identify a functional need observable in nature and translate it into measurable design constraints that can be tested and iterated.",
