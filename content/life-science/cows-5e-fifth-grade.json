ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about where food comes from and how ecosystems work by examining a real farm photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color copy of the cow pasture photograph (at least 18\" × 24\") OR projected image on screen\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Do NOT explain it yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to \"Look and Notice\" silently for 30 seconds.** Have them turn to a partner and share what they observe without naming or labeling.\n\n3. **Facilitate a brief whole-group discussion** using these specific questions:\n   - \"What living things do you see in this picture?\" (Guide them to name: grass, trees, cows, possibly insects/birds)\n   - \"What do you think the cows are doing in this field?\" (They're eating/grazing)\n   - \"How do cows get what they need to grow big and strong?\" (Accept initial ideas: they eat grass, drink water, breathe air)\n   - \"What do you wonder happens to this grass after the cows eat it?\" (Where does it go? Does it become part of the cow?)\n\n4. **Record student wonderings on chart paper** with the heading \"Our Questions About the Farm.\" Keep this visible throughout the lesson.\n\n5. **Pose a prediction prompt:** \"If you could follow one piece of grass from this field, trace what happens to it. Where do you think it goes? Make your best guess.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become ecosystem detectives and follow the path of matter—like grass—as it moves through a farm ecosystem.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how matter (food) moves through an ecosystem by modeling a food chain and tracking what happens to eaten material.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Green construction paper (pre-cut into \"grass\" rectangles, 1–2 per student)\n- Brown construction paper (pre-cut into \"soil\" shapes)\n- Index cards with labels: \"Grass,\" \"Cow,\" \"Decomposer (Bacteria/Fungi),\" \"Soil,\" \"Air,\" \"Water\"\n- Large poster board or chart paper (11\" × 17\" minimum, 1 per pair/small group)\n- Glue sticks\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Arrows (pre-cut or drawn by students)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Building a Food Chain Model (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Arrange students into pairs or small groups** (3–4 students per group).\n\n2. **Distribute one poster board and materials to each group.** Display the cow photograph again.\n\n3. **Give students these explicit instructions:**\n   - \"Your job is to show the journey of grass: where it comes from, who eats it, and what happens to it after.\"\n   - \"Start by placing your 'grass' rectangle at the top of your poster board.\"\n   - \"Below the grass, glue the 'Cow' label. Draw an arrow from grass to cow to show 'the cow eats the grass.'\"\n   - \"Below the cow, glue the 'Decomposer' label and draw an arrow showing 'when the cow dies or produces waste, decomposers break it down.'\"\n   - \"At the bottom, place 'Soil,' 'Water,' and 'Air' labels, and draw arrows returning matter from decomposers back to soil.\"\n\n4. **Students work together to arrange and glue materials, creating a visual food chain model.**\n\n5. **Circulate and ask guiding questions** without giving answers:\n   - \"What do you notice about where the grass started? Where does it end up?\"\n   - \"Is matter (food) being used up and lost, or does it go somewhere?\"\n   - \"How do you think new grass grows? What does it need from the soil, water, and air?\"\n\n**Part 2: Recording Observations (5 minutes)**\n\n6. **Give each student an observation sheet** (or section of their group's poster) with these prompts:\n   - \"Draw or write: What happens to the grass after the cow eats it?\"\n   - \"Where does the matter from the grass go?\"\n   - \"How does the soil help new grass grow?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and listen to student reasoning without correcting misconceptions.\n- Ask probing questions that encourage students to make connections between the photograph and their model.\n- Note which students understand matter cycling and which need additional support.\n- Do not provide the \"correct\" answer; let students build their own understanding.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation of grass → cow → decomposition → return to soil.\n- Students begin to recognize that matter doesn't disappear; it changes form and location.\n- Students may express wonder about how grass \"gets back into the ground\" or \"feeds new grass.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts about food chains and matter cycling after students have explored independently.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (still displayed)\n- Student food chain models from Explore phase\n- Vocabulary anchor chart (poster board, pre-made or created with students)\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Invite 2–3 groups to share their models** with the class. Ask:\n   - \"What did your group show about where the grass goes?\"\n   - \"How is matter moving through your food chain?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions:**\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Food Chain** | The path food (and energy) takes as one living thing eats another. In our farm: grass → cow → decomposer. |\n   | **Herbivore** | An animal that eats only plants. Cows are herbivores; they eat grass. |\n   | **Matter** | Anything that has weight and takes up space. Grass, water, and air are all types of matter. When the cow eats grass, the matter from the grass becomes part of the cow's body. |\n   | **Decomposer** | A living thing (like bacteria or fungi) that breaks down dead plants and animals and returns the matter back to the soil. |\n   | **Ecosystem** | A community of living things (plants, animals, insects) and non-living things (soil, water, air, sunlight) that all work together in one place. |\n\n3. **Create an anchor chart** with these terms and simple drawings/symbols. Post it in the classroom.\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"The grass in this pasture is part of a farm ecosystem. The cows, trees, soil, water, and air all work together.\"\n   - \"When cows eat grass, they're taking matter from the plants into their bodies to help them grow and have energy.\"\n   - \"When grass leaves become waste or when cows die, decomposers break down that matter and return it to the soil.\"\n   - \"That's why new grass can grow in the same field year after year—the matter cycles!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding** using this strategy:\n   - Ask: \"Turn to your neighbor and explain: Why do plants need water and air? Use the word 'matter' in your answer.\"\n   - Listen to 3–4 pair conversations and note who understands that plants use air/water as matter to grow.\n   - Reteach briefly for students who don't connect air/water to plant growth.\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart (create this together or display pre-made):**\n\n```\nFOOD CHAIN: Grass → Cow → Decomposer → Soil\n(Energy and matter move through living things)\n\nMATTER MOVEMENT:\n- Grass gets matter from: soil, water, air, sunlight\n- Cow eats grass (matter enters the cow)\n- Decomposers break down waste (matter returns to soil)\n- Cycle repeats!\n```\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that a food chain shows what eats what.\n- Students recognize that matter (matter from grass) moves into the cow's body.\n- Students can explain that decomposers return matter to soil.\n- Students grasp that plants need air and water as materials to grow.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new context and deepen their ability to trace matter through an ecosystem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Option A (Hands-On):** \n  - Potting soil, small clear plastic cups (8 oz), grass seeds or fast-growing plant seeds (radish, lettuce), water, small labels\n  - Chart for recording plant growth observations\n  \n- **Option B (Scenario-Based):**\n  - Index cards with different farm scenarios (see below)\n  - Large poster board for creating new food chain models\n\n**Activity: Choose One**\n\n---\n\n**OPTION A: Plant Growth Investigation (Recommended for tactile learners)**\n\n1. **Introduce the investigation:** \"We learned that plants need matter from air and water to grow. Let's grow our own grass and watch it happen. Remember: where is the matter in that growing plant coming from?\"\n\n2. **Guide students through planting:**\n   - \"Fill your cup 2/3 full with soil. This has nutrients (matter) in it.\"\n   - \"Plant 2–3 grass seeds.\"\n   - \"Water lightly. The water is matter the plant will use.\"\n   - \"Place on a sunny windowsill. The sunlight helps the plant capture matter from the air.\"\n\n3. **Establish an observation routine:**\n   - Students observe and sketch the plant every 2–3 days for 2 weeks.\n   - Record on a simple chart: Date | Plant Height | Observations | \"What matter is the plant using?\"\n\n4. **Reflection questions:**\n   - \"Your plant is growing. Where is this new matter coming from?\"\n   - \"Did the soil get lighter or the same weight? (The plant is taking matter from the soil!)\"\n   - \"What would happen if we didn't water the plant? Why?\" (No water = no matter for growth)\n\n5. **Connect to the photograph:**\n   - \"The grass in the pasture is growing the same way—it's pulling water and nutrients from the soil and getting matter from the air. That's why it can feed all those cows!\"\n\n---\n\n**OPTION B: Complex Food Chain Scenarios (Recommended for analytical learners)**\n\n1. **Present new scenarios on index cards.** Each group draws one:\n\n   - **Scenario 1:** A hawk eats a mouse that eats seeds from grass. Show the food chain. Where does the matter start? Where does it end up eventually?\n   \n   - **Scenario 2:** A farmer picks apples from a tree and sells them at a market. They don't go back to the farm. Is this still a food chain? What happens to the matter in the apple?\n   \n   - **Scenario 3:** A cow eats grass all summer. The cow is sold for meat. Trace the movement of matter from grass → body of cow → human. Then what happens to the matter?\n\n2. **Students create an expanded food chain model** for their scenario using the same materials as Phase 2 (construction paper, arrows, labels).\n\n3. **Groups present and discuss:**\n   - \"How is your food chain similar to or different from the simple grass → cow model?\"\n   - \"Can you track where the matter goes at each step?\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- For Option A: Provide scaffolding by asking, \"What three things did we give the plant? (soil, water, light) Which ones are matter the plant can use?\"\n- For Option B: Ask guiding questions like, \"If this matter doesn't go back to the soil, where does it go? Is the cycle still working?\"\n- Encourage students to use their vocabulary anchor chart.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- **Option A:** Students observe living plant growth and begin to understand that growth requires input of matter (water, nutrients, air).\n- **Option B:** Students extend the food chain concept to multi-step chains and consider what happens when matter leaves the ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of food chains and matter movement in ecosystems.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n- **Observations during Explore and Elaborate:** Did students place decomposers and soil in their model? Did they draw arrows showing matter movement? Did their explanations mention that matter \"goes back\" or \"cycles\"?\n- **Listen-in during Explain pair-share:** Can students use the words \"matter\" and \"decomposer\" accurately?\n- **Exit Ticket (5 minutes at end of lesson):** Distribute index cards with three questions:\n\n---\n\n**EXIT TICKET — Food Chain Detective**\n\n**Name: _________________ Date: _________________**\n\n**Look at the photo again. Answer these questions:**\n\n1. **Draw or write:** Show what the grass does BEFORE the cow eats it. What does grass need to grow? (Hint: Think about matter from air, water, and soil.)\n\n2. **Trace the matter:** When a cow eats grass, where does that grass matter go? (Use the word \"matter\" in your answer.)\n\n3. **Circle the right answer:** If a decomposer breaks down a cow's waste, what happens next?\n   - A) The matter disappears forever.\n   - B) The matter goes back to the soil where new plants can use it.\n   - C) The matter floats into the air.\n\n---\n\n**Summative Assessment:**\nAt the end of Session 2, give students this task:\n\n**FOOD CHAIN MODELING TASK (15 minutes)**\n\n- **Prompt:** \"You are creating a farm educational poster for younger students. Draw a food chain showing: (1) Where grass gets the matter it needs to grow, (2) How a cow uses that matter, (3) What happens to the matter when the cow produces waste, and (4) How the cycle continues.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** \n  - Shows at least 3 steps in the food chain ✓\n  - Includes arrows showing matter movement ✓\n  - Labels or explains where matter comes from (air, water, soil) ✓\n  - Shows that matter cycles back (decomposer + soil) ✓\n  - Uses at least 2 vocabulary words correctly (food chain, matter, decomposer, herbivore, ecosystem) ✓\n\n**Grading Scale:**\n- **Advanced (4):** All criteria present; clear understanding that matter cycles.\n- **Proficient (3):** Most criteria present; shows food chain and basic cycling concept.\n- **Developing (2):** Food chain shown but cycling concept incomplete; missing some labels.\n- **Beginning (1):** Incomplete model; significant gaps in understanding.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- **Demonstrates understanding if students can:**\n  - Name at least two things plants need to grow (water and air, or soil and water, or soil and air).\n  - Explain that the cow gets matter/energy from grass.\n  - State that decomposers break down waste and return it to soil.\n  - Use arrows or words to show matter moving through the ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary anchor chart:** Create a one-page visual with only three terms (Grass, Cow, Decomposer) with large, clear drawings and no text definitions initially. Build definitions together verbally.\n\n2. **Guided food chain template:** Provide a partially completed model (e.g., grass already placed at top, three empty boxes below) where students only need to place labels and draw arrows. Ask, \"What eats the grass?\" then \"What happens to the cow's waste?\"\n\n3. **One-on-one questioning during Explore:** Pair a struggling student with a peer or paraprofessional. Use sentence starters: \"The grass is eaten by the ___. After the cow eats the grass, the matter goes to the ___.\"\n\n4. **Exit Ticket modification:** Offer multiple-choice or matching options instead of open-ended responses. Or reduce to 1–2 questions instead of 3.\n\n#### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Multi-step food chains:** Have students create chains with 4+ organisms (e.g., Grass → Grasshopper → Mouse → Hawk → Decomposer → Soil) and trace matter through each step.\n\n2. **Energy vs. Matter distinction:** Introduce the concept that matter cycles, but energy flows (using a diagram). Ask: \"If matter cycles, what about energy? Where does it go?\" (Answer: dissipates as heat, leaves the ecosystem as solar energy is captured once per cycle.)\n\n3. **Explore human impact:** Pose scenarios: \"If all the cows are removed from a pasture, how does the food chain change? Where does the grass matter go now?\" or \"What if the soil is removed/polluted? Can the cycle continue?\"\n\n4. **Research extension:** Have students research a specific farm animal (chicken, pig, horse) and create a food chain diagram for that animal's ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Compost Investigation (2–3 weeks, at-home or classroom project)**\n   - Provide students with a small clear container, soil, and food scraps (grass clippings, vegetable peels, paper).\n   - Have them create a mini-compost system and observe over 2–3 weeks as decomposers break down matter.\n   - Journal observations: \"How is decomposition like the decomposers in our food chain model?\"\n   - Discussion: \"What do decomposers need to do their job?\" (Warmth, moisture, oxygen—just like living things!)\n\n2. **Field-to-Fork Meal Project**\n   - Have students research or plan a simple meal that includes: a plant grown in soil (salad, bread), milk/meat from an herbivore (butter, beef, milk), and nothing packaged.\n   - Create a \"matter journey map\" showing each food item's ecosystem origin.\n   - Discuss: \"Can you trace the matter in this meal back to soil, air, and water?\"\n   - Optional: Invite a local farmer or nutritionist to discuss farm-to-table connections.\n\n3. **Build a Classroom Terrarium (Ecosystem in a Bottle)**\n   - Use a sealed clear container with soil, plants, small organisms (isopods/pill bugs), and water.\n   - Observe for 2–4 weeks: Does the cycle work in a closed ecosystem?\n   - Discussion prompts: \"Why does condensation appear on the glass? What does that tell us about the water cycle?\" \"What do decomposers do in the terrarium?\"\n   - Document observations with drawings or photos.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Implementation Notes\n\n**Pacing Recommendations:**\n- **Session 1:** Engage (15 min) + Explore (25 min) = 40 minutes. Assign plant-growing task at home or in a windowsill if choosing Option A for Elaborate.\n- **Session 2:** Explain (20 min) + Elaborate (20 min) + Evaluate (15 min) = 55 minutes.\n\n**Classroom Setup:**\n- Arrange desks for pair/group work during Explore and Elaborate.\n- Have the photograph visible throughout both sessions.\n- Post the vocabulary anchor chart prominently after Explain phase.\n\n**Safety Reminders:**\n- Wash hands after handling soil (in plant investigation).\n- Ensure students do not ingest seeds or soil.\n- Use child-safe glue sticks.\n\n**Common Student Misconceptions to Watch For:**\n- **\"Matter disappears when the cow eats it.\"** → Reinforce: \"The matter doesn't disappear; it becomes part of the cow's body.\"\n- **\"Decomposers are 'bad' and ruin things.\"** → Reframe: \"Decomposers are helpful—they recycle matter back to the soil so new plants can grow.\"\n- **\"Plants only get food from soil.\"** → Clarify: \"Plants get water from soil AND air from the atmosphere. Both are matter they need to grow.\"\n\n**Connection to Prior Knowledge:**\n- This lesson assumes students have basic knowledge that animals eat plants/food and that things can change form (e.g., ice melts into water). Assess these quickly in Engage if unsure.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson fully aligns with 5-LS2-1 and 5-LS1-1 and provides a concrete, observable model of how matter cycles through an ecosystem—bridging abstract ecological concepts to students' lived experience through the familiar image of a working farm.**",
