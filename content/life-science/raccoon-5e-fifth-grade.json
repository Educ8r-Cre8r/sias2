ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by connecting to animal behavior and habitats visible in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the raccoon photograph (8.5\" × 11\" or larger, if possible)\n- Document camera or whiteboard (for displaying image)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Sticky notes (optional, for recording predictions)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a document camera or large screen. Allow students to look silently for 30 seconds without any narration.\n\n2. **Ask these focus questions** to spark curiosity (pause after each for 15–20 seconds of think time):\n   - \"What do you notice about where this animal is? What clues tell you what kind of place it is?\"\n   - \"Look at the raccoon's paws and face. What do you think it might be doing or looking for?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this raccoon is near the water and plants instead of, say, in the middle of a field?\"\n   - \"What do you think this animal eats, and what might eat *this* animal?\"\n\n3. **Post a Wonder Prompt** on chart paper: \"How does a raccoon survive and find food in a place like this?\" Invite students to share one prediction or question on a sticky note and add it to the chart. Read a few aloud to affirm diverse thinking.\n\n4. **Transition statement:** \"Today we're going to discover how raccoons are perfectly designed for life in wetlands, and we'll trace the path of food and energy that keeps this ecosystem thriving.\"\n\n**Expected Outcome:** Students are curious about raccoon adaptations and wetland ecosystems; prior knowledge about animal habitats is surfaced.\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate raccoon adaptations and wetland ecosystems through a hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- A variety of craft materials (index cards, markers, pipe cleaners, foam, felt, etc.)\n- Images of wetland animals and plants (printed or from a simple chart)\n- \"Wetland Cards\" (prepared by teacher): cards showing wetland organisms (raccoon, cattails, fish, frogs, insects, dragonflies, water lilies, decomposers) and non-living features (water, mud, log, soil, rocks)\n- Large poster paper or floor space for arranging cards\n- Student exploration sheet (see below)\n- Real objects (if available): bark, rocks, water in a shallow tray, plant samples\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Raccoon Adaptation Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide students into pairs. Distribute **Exploration Sheet A: \"What's Special About a Raccoon?\"** (provided below).\n\n2. **Display the photograph again.** Ask partners to carefully examine the raccoon's body and note:\n   - What do its paws look like? (sensitive, dexterous)\n   - What do you notice about its eyes and nose? (forward-facing for hunting; good night vision)\n   - What about its fur? (thick, water-resistant)\n   - Where is it positioned? (near water, exploring logs)\n\n3. Students sketch or label the raccoon's features and write **one adaptation** that helps it survive in a wetland (e.g., \"sharp claws for catching slippery fish\"; \"sensitive paws to feel for food\"; \"water-resistant fur\").\n\n4. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask guiding questions:\n   - \"Why would sensitive paws be useful here?\"\n   - \"What do you think those paws might be touching or grabbing?\"\n   - Do not give answers; redirect students back to the photograph.\n\n**Part B: Wetland Ecosystem Arrangement (13 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute one \"Wetland Card\" set to each pair (or small group of 3). Cards include:\n   - **Living Things:** Raccoon, Cattails, Fish, Frogs, Dragonflies, Aquatic Plants, Bacteria/Decomposers\n   - **Non-Living Features:** Water, Mud, Log, Soil, Rocks, Sunlight\n\n2. **Challenge:** \"Arrange these cards on your poster to show a wetland ecosystem. Think about what belongs together—what does the raccoon eat? What do plants need? Where would living things interact?\"\n\n3. Students physically arrange cards and draw or write **connections** between them (arrows, labels, descriptions).\n\n4. **What to record:** Students draw their ecosystem on paper and label:\n   - What the raccoon eats (food sources)\n   - What the raccoon needs to survive (water, shelter, oxygen)\n   - One non-living thing that helps each living thing\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Ask prompting questions: \"Where do plants get energy?\" \"What happens to the log over time?\" \"How does the raccoon use this water?\"\n- Encourage students to place items logically without directing placement.\n- Ask: \"Why did you put those two things near each other?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students identify 2–3 raccoon adaptations with reasoning.\n- Students create a physical or drawn model showing living and non-living components connected to the raccoon.\n- Students verbalize at least one food/energy relationship (e.g., \"The raccoon eats the fish, and the fish eat insects\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and clarify concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words written and illustrated\n- Photograph of raccoon (displayed again)\n- Student copies of Vocabulary Card Set (optional)\n- Visual models or diagrams (prepared by teacher) showing food chains\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out (5 minutes):** Invite 2–3 pairs to briefly show their ecosystem arrangements and explain one connection they made. Ask the class: \"Do you agree? Why or why not?\" This validates student thinking and surfaces misconceptions.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (7 minutes):** Display and define each term using the photograph and student models as reference:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. *Example: \"A raccoon's sensitive paws are an adaptation for catching slippery food in water.\"*\n\n   - **Habitat:** The place where a living thing lives. It has the food, water, and shelter the animal needs. *Example: \"A wetland is the raccoon's habitat because it has water, plants for shelter, and animals to eat.\"*\n\n   - **Food Chain:** The path that energy takes from the sun → plants → animals that eat plants → animals that eat other animals. *Example: \"Water plants → Fish → Raccoon.\"*\n\n   - **Ecosystem:** A community of living things and non-living things (water, soil, rocks) that work together. *Example: \"The wetland ecosystem includes the raccoon, plants, water, and soil—all connected.\"*\n\n   - **Consumer:** A living thing that eats other living things to survive (animals). *Example: \"A raccoon is a consumer because it eats fish and frogs.\"*\n\n3. **Make Connections Back to Image (3 minutes):** Point to the photograph and say:\n   - \"Here's a raccoon in its habitat—the wetland. Notice the water, plants, and log. These all help the raccoon survive.\"\n   - \"The raccoon is a consumer—it will eat frogs and fish from this water. Those animals are consumers too—they eat plants and insects.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:** Ask quick, low-stakes questions:\n   - \"Is a raccoon an adaptation or a habitat?\" (Answer: Neither—a raccoon *has* adaptations *and* lives in a habitat.)\n   - \"Is a raccoon a consumer? Why?\" (Yes, because it eats other animals.)\n   - \"Name one non-living thing in a raccoon's habitat.\" (Water, soil, rocks, logs, etc.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \nStudents understand key vocabulary and can identify examples from the photograph and their models. Misconceptions (e.g., \"the log is alive\") are clarified.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply learning by extending to new scenarios and deepening understanding of matter flow in ecosystems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster paper or whiteboard\n- String or yarn (to create a food web diagram)\n- Index cards with animal/plant names written on them\n- Markers\n- Optional: Images of decomposition or additional wetland organisms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Build a Wetland Food Web (for most students)**\n\n1. **Explain:** \"In the Explore phase, we looked at food *chains*—straight lines of who eats what. But in a real ecosystem, it's more complicated! A food *web* shows all the different paths energy takes.\"\n\n2. **Model together:** On poster paper, write these organisms in a circle: Cattails, Water Plants, Insects, Fish, Frogs, Raccoon, Heron, Decomposers, Sun.\n\n3. **Draw arrows** showing multiple feeding relationships:\n   - Sun → Plants (arrow labeled \"provides energy\")\n   - Plants → Insects, Fish, Frogs (arrows showing they eat plants)\n   - Insects → Fish, Frogs, Birds\n   - Fish → Raccoon, Heron\n   - Frogs → Raccoon, Heron\n   - All organisms → Decomposers (when they die, decomposers break them down)\n\n4. **Student Task:** Have students trace with their finger and answer:\n   - \"Find two different paths that energy takes from the sun to the raccoon.\"\n   - \"What happens to the raccoon when it dies?\" (Answer: Decomposers break it down, returning matter to soil.)\n   - \"How is the log in the photograph connected to this food web?\" (It provides shelter, breaks down over time, returns nutrients to soil; decomposers live on it.)\n\n**Option B: Predict & Explain (for students needing more challenge)**\n\nPose a real-world scenario:\n- \"Imagine pollution kills all the fish in this wetland. Using the food web, predict what would happen to the raccoon population. Explain why.\"\n\nStudents draw or write their predictions and reasoning.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Ask guiding questions: \"What does the raccoon lose if the fish die?\" \"Are there other food sources?\" \n- Validate reasoning even if predictions differ.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \nStudents create or identify multiple food chains within a food web, understand the flow of matter from sun → organisms → decomposers → soil, and recognize interdependence.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student mastery of learning objectives using formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Exit Ticket template (printed or digital)\n- Observation notes from Explore and Elaborate phases\n- Student work samples (drawings, diagrams, written responses)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- During Engage: Listen to predictions and questions to gauge prior knowledge.\n- During Explore: Observe student diagrams and listen to partner discussions—note who identifies adaptations and ecosystem connections.\n- During Explain: Use quick-check questions (thumbs up/sideways/down) to monitor vocabulary understanding.\n- During Elaborate: Assess student reasoning in food web explanations.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\nDistribute **Exit Ticket: \"Raccoon Experts\"** with the following prompts (students answer 2–3):\n\n1. **Adaptation Question:** \"Name one body part the raccoon has that helps it survive in a wetland. Explain how it helps.\"\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student names one feature (paws, eyes, fur) and describes its function (e.g., \"Sensitive paws help it feel for food in water\").\n\n2. **Habitat & Ecosystem Question:** \"Why does a raccoon live in a wetland instead of a desert? Use the words 'habitat' and 'food chain' in your answer.\"\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student explains that a wetland provides food (food chain) and necessary features (water, shelter).\n\n3. **Matter & Energy Question:** \"Draw or describe what happens to a dead fish in the wetland ecosystem. How does it connect to the raccoon?\"\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student indicates decomposition, nutrient cycling, or that decomposers break down the fish, returning matter to soil (which feeds plants the raccoon might eat).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student answers all 3 prompts with clear explanations, uses vocabulary accurately, and shows understanding of adaptations and food webs.\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student answers 2 of 3 prompts; may use vocabulary with minor errors; understands basic concepts.\n\n✓ **Beginning:** Student answers 1 prompt or gives vague explanations; vocabulary use is inconsistent; understanding is emerging.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary Support:** Provide a vocabulary card sheet with images and definitions for students to reference during all phases. Allow students to use these during exit ticket.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames:** For Explore and Elaborate, provide sentence starters:\n   - \"This adaptation helps because _______.\"\n   - \"The raccoon eats _______, which eats _______.\"\n   - \"Non-living things like _______ help because _______.\"\n\n3. **Simplified Ecosystem Cards:** Use only 4–5 key organisms (Raccoon, Cattails, Fish, Frogs, Decomposers) for students who feel overwhelmed by complexity. Focus on one clear food chain first (e.g., Plants → Fish → Raccoon).\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Decomposer Deep Dive:** Ask students to trace what happens to the log in the photograph over 5, 10, and 20 years. How do decomposers change it? Where do those nutrients go? Can they create a decomposition timeline?\n\n2. **Human Impact Scenario:** \"If humans built a dam and drained the wetland, describe what would happen to each organism in the food web. Which would disappear first? Why? How might this affect the raccoon?\"\n\n3. **Comparative Ecosystems:** Provide images of a desert, forest, and wetland. Ask: \"If a raccoon were placed in each habitat, which would be best and why?\" Have them justify using adaptations, food chains, and non-living features.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Wetland Diorama Project:** Students build a 3D model of a wetland habitat using a shoebox, natural materials (twigs, moss, rocks, clay), and labels identifying organisms, non-living features, and 2–3 food chain connections. This reinforces spatial understanding of habitat and ecosystem interdependence.\n\n2. **Raccoon Adaptation Mask & Movement Activity:** Students create a mask or headband highlighting one raccoon adaptation (sensitive paws, night-vision eyes, etc.). Then, in a movement activity, they \"act out\" how that adaptation helps during a hunt in the wetland (e.g., reaching into log crevices with paws, seeing in dim light). This kinesthetic reinforcement deepens understanding of form and function.\n\n3. **Wetland Detective Journal:** Provide students with a one-page \"Raccoon's Day\" narrative worksheet. They write or draw what a raccoon eats, where it sleeps, and what dangers it faces—all grounded in habitat and ecosystem knowledge. Extension: Have them identify 3 adaptations evident in their narrative.\n\n4. **Local Ecosystem Walk (if accessible):** Take students to a local pond, stream, or green space. Have them identify living and non-living things, hypothesize about a food chain, and photograph/sketch one example. Back in the classroom, compare to the wetland in the photograph—same concepts, different species.\n\n---\n\n## Answer Key / Teacher Notes\n\n### Exploration Sheet A: \"What's Special About a Raccoon?\" (Teacher Version)\n\n**Expected Student Observations:**\n- **Paws:** Sensitive, five fingers, dexterous—excellent for grasping and manipulating objects in water\n- **Eyes & Nose:** Forward-facing (binocular vision for depth perception), good at night, large nose for detecting scents\n- **Fur:** Thick, grayish, water-resistant; face mask marking\n- **Behavior Seen:** Crouching, exploring a log—indicates hunting/foraging\n\n**Acceptable Adaptations (one or more):**\n- Sharp claws for climbing and gripping\n- Sensitive paws for feeling in murky water\n- Night vision for hunting at dusk/dawn\n- Water-resistant fur for staying dry\n- Small, pointed teeth for eating fish and crustaceans (inferred)\n\n---\n\n### Vocabulary Card Quick Reference\n\n| Term | Kid-Friendly Meaning |\n|------|---------------------|\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter |\n| **Food Chain** | The path that shows who eats what, starting with the sun and plants |\n| **Ecosystem** | All the living things and non-living things in a place, working together |\n| **Consumer** | A living thing that eats other living things to survive |\n| **Decomposer** | A living thing (like bacteria or fungi) that breaks down dead things and returns nutrients to soil |\n\n---\n\n### Exit Ticket Example Responses\n\n**Question 1: Adaptation**\n- ✓ **Proficient:** \"Raccoons have sensitive paws with five fingers. They use them to feel around in the water for fish and crayfish they can't see, so the adaptation helps them find food.\"\n- ~ **Developing:** \"Raccoons have good paws. They use them to catch fish.\"\n- ✗ **Beginning:** \"Raccoons have claws.\"\n\n**Question 2: Habitat & Ecosystem**\n- ✓ **Proficient:** \"A raccoon lives in a wetland because it's the right habitat for them. It has water where fish live, which is a food chain for the raccoon.\"\n- ~ **Developing:** \"A wetland has water and food.\"\n- ✗ **Beginning:** \"Raccoons like water.\"\n\n**Question 3: Matter & Energy / Decomposition**\n- ✓ **Proficient:** \"When a fish dies, decomposers break it down and it returns to the soil. That helps plants grow, and raccoons eat plants indirectly by eating fish that eat plants.\"\n- ~ **Developing:** \"The fish breaks down and becomes part of the water/soil. It helps the ecosystem.\"\n- ✗ **Beginning:** \"It goes away.\" OR \"A decomposer eats it.\"\n\n---\n\n## Final Teacher Tips\n\n1. **Pace:** The lesson works best across two sessions: Engage & Explore in Session 1 (45 min), then Explain & Elaborate in Session 2 (40 min). This allows time for digestion and enthusiasm to build.\n\n2. **Real Objects:** If possible, bring a piece of tree bark or rotting log to class during Explain. Let students handle it carefully and notice crevices where decomposers and insects live—a tangible connection to the photograph.\n\n3. **Video Extension:** A 3–5 minute nature video of a raccoon foraging at water's edge powerfully reinforces adaptations in action. Show during Elaborate for students needing additional context.\n\n4. **Assessment Honesty:** Some students may not fully grasp food webs in one lesson—this is developmentally appropriate. Focus on the simpler concept of food chains and adaptations as core; food webs are a natural next step.\n\n5. **Celebrate Curiosity:** During share-outs, affirm divergent thinking (e.g., \"I notice you put the decomposer at the bottom—that's a smart observation!\"). This builds confidence and encourages deeper thinking in future lessons.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson fulfills NGSS 5-LS2-1** by having students develop models (food chains, ecosystem diagrams, food webs) showing how matter (food, water, nutrients) moves among plants, animals, decomposers, and the non-living environment—all grounded in the tangible example of a raccoon in a wetland.",
