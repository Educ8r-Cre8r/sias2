Identify and describe the sources of materials that a large tree like the oak in the photograph needs to grow (air, water, and soil).\n2. Support an evidence-based argument explaining how plants obtain carbon dioxide from air and water from soil through roots.\n3. Develop a model that shows how matter (nutrients, water, and energy) moves between the tree, soil, decomposers, and the environment.\n4. Apply their understanding to explain why the tree in the photograph is healthy and able to grow so large.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about where a massive tree gets the materials it needs to grow so large.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the oak tree (displayed on projector or printed copies)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: actual small branch or fallen leaf from a local tree\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph prominently. Say: \"This tree is HUGE—it has a trunk thicker than a person is tall, branches as long as a school bus, and thousands of leaves. Where do you think all the materials come from to build and maintain a tree this size?\"\n\n2. Allow 2-3 students to share initial ideas without correcting them.\n\n3. Ask these discussion questions to guide thinking:\n   - \"If we cut this tree down and weighed all the wood, soil, and leaves, where did all that 'stuff' come from? Did the tree's roots pull it from the ground?\"\n   - \"Look at the leaves—they're green and healthy. What do you think the leaves need to make that green color and stay alive?\"\n   - \"This tree has been growing for maybe 100+ years. How does it keep getting bigger every year if there's only so much soil around it?\"\n   - \"What happens to the leaves that fall to the ground? Where do they go?\"\n\n4. Have students record one prediction on a sticky note: \"I think the tree gets its materials mainly from _____ because _____.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become plant scientists and investigate exactly where a tree gets the materials it needs—and you might be surprised to learn that the answer involves air, water, and something that happens on the ground!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the sources of plant materials through a hands-on activity that models water uptake, air access, and nutrient cycling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small potted plants (one per pair; bean or tomato seedlings work well)\n- Water (in cups or spray bottles)\n- Soil samples in clear containers\n- Magnifying glasses\n- White paper towels\n- Clear plastic bags (sandwich or small)\n- Markers\n- Leaves collected from outside (fresh and decomposing if possible)\n- Observation sheets (printed or digital)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Water and Root Absorption (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Pair students and give each pair a small potted plant and a cup of water.\n\n2. Ask: \"We know roots are underground. Let's think about what they do. If I pour this water on the soil, where does it go?\"\n\n3. Have students carefully pour water into the soil and observe for 30 seconds. Ask: \"Where did the water go? Can you see it?\"\n\n4. Instruct students to gently feel the soil—has it changed? Is it wetter? Heavier?\n\n5. Students record on observation sheets: \"After adding water, the soil feels _____ and the plant looks _____.\"\n\n6. Say: \"Plants drink water through their roots just like you drink through a straw. That water becomes part of the plant's body and helps it grow.\"\n\n**Part B: Air, Leaves, and Photosynthesis (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Give each pair a fresh leaf and a magnifying glass.\n\n2. Say: \"Let's examine a leaf closely. Remember the oak tree in the photo—it has thousands of these. What is the leaf's job?\"\n\n3. Students observe and draw the leaf's structure. Point out that leaves are where a plant captures something invisible from the air.\n\n4. Explain simply: \"Plants use something in the air called carbon dioxide. We breathe out carbon dioxide, and plants breathe it in through tiny holes in their leaves. This is how they make their own food and grow.\"\n\n5. Place a fresh leaf in a clear plastic bag with a damp paper towel. Seal it. Place another leaf in an open container on the table.\n\n6. Ask: \"Why do you think I covered one leaf but not the other? What do you predict will happen?\" Record predictions.\n\n**Part C: Decomposition and Nutrient Cycling (5 minutes)**\n\n1. Show students fresh leaves and decomposing leaves (brown, crumbly).\n\n2. Say: \"When leaves fall from the tree—like you saw on the ground around the big oak—they don't just disappear. Tiny creatures and fungi break them down. This process puts nutrients back into the soil.\"\n\n3. Ask: \"If leaves break down and return nutrients to soil, and roots drink water and absorb nutrients from soil, what do you think happens next?\"\n\n4. Students record: \"I think the nutrients from old leaves help new _____ grow on the tree.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What did you observe?\" \"Where did the water go?\" \"What do leaves do?\"\n- Do NOT provide answers; allow students to make observations and form hypotheses.\n- Encourage students to handle materials carefully and record specific observations (not opinions).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that water moves into soil and is absorbed.\n- Students identify leaves as important plant structures.\n- Students begin to see a connection between decomposing material and soil.\n- Students record evidence on observation sheets that can be referenced later.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts after hands-on investigation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of oak tree (displayed again)\n- Optional: diagram showing water cycle, photosynthesis, and nutrient cycle\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover about where water goes when we poured it on the soil?\"\n   - Ask: \"What do leaves do for a plant?\"\n   - Ask: \"What happens to leaves that fall to the ground?\"\n   - Create a class \"evidence list\" on chart paper recording student observations.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Roots:** Underground plant parts that absorb water and minerals from soil and anchor the plant in place.\n   - **Photosynthesis:** The process where plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide from air to make their own food and grow.\n   - **Carbon dioxide:** A gas in the air that plants take in through leaves; humans breathe it out.\n   - **Decomposers:** Tiny living things (fungi, bacteria) that break down dead plants and animals, returning nutrients to soil.\n   - **Nutrient cycle:** The movement of materials (like nitrogen, phosphorus, and minerals) between plants, soil, decomposers, and the environment.\n\n3. **Make Connections to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the oak tree photo again.\n   - Say: \"This tree is MASSIVE. How did it get so big? Let's trace where its materials come from.\"\n   - Point to roots (underground, not visible but implied): \"Roots absorb water and minerals from soil.\"\n   - Point to leaves: \"Thousands of leaves capture carbon dioxide from air and use sunlight to make food.\"\n   - Point to ground: \"When leaves fall and decompose, decomposers break them down, and those nutrients go back to the soil for new growth.\"\n   - Say: \"The tree gets almost everything it needs from AIR and WATER—not mostly from soil like many people think!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Where do the materials for a tree's growth come from?\" (Air and water—mainly.)\n   - Ask: \"How does a fallen leaf help the tree grow new leaves next year?\" (Decomposers break it down, nutrients return to soil.)\n   - Ask: \"Could a tree grow this big if it only had soil but no air or water?\" (No—it needs all three.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define and use the vocabulary terms.\n- Students can explain that plants get materials chiefly from air (carbon dioxide) and water.\n- Students understand that decomposers play a role in returning nutrients to soil.\n- Students see the connection between the Explore activities and how the oak tree survives.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a model that shows how matter moves through an ecosystem centered on the tree.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheet of paper (11\" x 17\" or poster board) per pair\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Arrows (cut from paper or drawn)\n- Labels and vocabulary cards\n- Optional: printed images of trees, leaves, soil, animals, fungi\n- Access to the photograph of the oak tree for reference\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the Modeling Task (2 minutes):**\n   - Say: \"We've discovered where a tree gets its materials. Now you're going to create a model—a drawing that shows how these materials move between the tree, air, soil, and decomposers. This is called a nutrient cycle model.\"\n\n2. **Provide Scaffolding (3 minutes):**\n   - Show a simple example: Draw on chart paper a basic tree with arrows showing:\n     - Water entering roots from soil\n     - Carbon dioxide entering leaves from air\n     - Sunlight hitting leaves\n     - Leaves falling to ground\n     - Decomposers breaking down leaves\n     - Nutrients returning to soil\n   - Say: \"Your model should show these movements. Use arrows to show where things go.\"\n\n3. **Student Creation (10 minutes):**\n   - Pairs create their nutrient cycle model on large paper.\n   - Students should include: the oak tree, roots, soil, decomposers, leaves, air, water, arrows showing movement.\n   - Encourage labeling with vocabulary words learned.\n   - Circulate and ask: \"Where does water come from?\" \"How do leaves help?\" \"What happens to dead leaves?\"\n\n4. **Gallery Walk and Discussion (5 minutes):**\n   - Post models around the room.\n   - Do a quick gallery walk where students notice similarities and differences.\n   - Ask 2-3 volunteers to explain their model briefly.\n   - Highlight strong models that show clear connections between all parts.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide the scaffolding example to support students who struggle with model creation.\n- Ask probing questions to push thinking: \"Where else can water come from besides rain?\" (Groundwater, rivers, etc.)\n- Celebrate accurate representations of the nutrient cycle.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create visual models showing water uptake, photosynthesis, decomposition, and nutrient cycling.\n- Students use vocabulary appropriately in labels.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that matter moves in cycles through ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of where plants get materials and how matter cycles through ecosystems.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase (did students record accurate observations?)\n- Questions during Explain phase (can students answer without prompting?)\n- Model creation and explanation (does the model show the cycle accurately?)\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (end of Day 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a slip of paper with these prompts:\n\n1. **Argument prompt:** \"The oak tree in the photograph is 100 years old and very large. Write or draw to answer: Where does this tree get the materials it needs to grow? Use what we learned to support your answer.\"\n\n   *Success criteria:*\n   - Mentions air (carbon dioxide) and water as main sources.\n   - References roots, leaves, or photosynthesis.\n   - Acknowledges soil provides some nutrients/minerals.\n\n2. **Cycle prompt:** \"Draw arrows to show how a leaf that falls from the tree eventually becomes part of a new leaf. Label at least THREE places the matter goes.\"\n\n   *Success criteria:*\n   - Shows leaves falling.\n   - Includes decomposers or soil.\n   - Shows water and/or nutrients moving.\n   - Arrows connect to new growth.\n\n3. **Reflection:** \"What surprised you most about where plants get their materials?\"\n\n   *Success criteria:*\n   - Any thoughtful response showing engagement (e.g., \"I didn't know most came from air\" or \"I didn't know decomposers were important\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can identify air and water as chief sources of plant materials.\n- 75%+ of students can create a model or diagram showing movement of matter in a cycle.\n- All students can articulate at least one way they understand how the oak tree gets what it needs.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Sentence Frames for Arguments:** Provide sentence starters like:\n   - \"Plants get materials from _____ and _____.\"\n   - \"The roots absorb _____ from the _____.\"\n   - \"Leaves use _____ from the air to make _____.\"\n\n2. **Simplified Model Template:** Offer a pre-drawn outline of a tree with blank boxes for: roots, soil, leaves, air, decomposers. Students fill in words/labels instead of drawing from scratch.\n\n3. **Pairing Strategy:** Pair struggling students with strong communicators during group work. Assign roles: one observes and one records, then switch.\n\n---\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extend to Food Webs:** Ask: \"Where do animals fit into this cycle? If a squirrel eats acorns from the oak tree, how is it connected to the nutrient cycle?\" Have them add animals and create a food web connecting to the nutrient cycle.\n\n2. **Quantitative Thinking:** Ask: \"If a tree's trunk grows 1 inch thicker each year, how much new material did it gain? Where did that material come from? Can you calculate approximately how many gallons of water a tree might use in a year?\" (Research and estimation).\n\n3. **Real-World Application:** Have them research and present on how deforestation or pollution affects the nutrient cycle, or how trees help clean air and water in cities. Connect to 5-LS2-1's broader ecosystem focus.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Tree Ring Investigation:** If possible, obtain a cross-section of a tree trunk or wood log showing rings. Have students count rings to determine age, then discuss: \"Each ring represents one year of growth. What materials did the tree collect that year to make that ring? Can climate or water availability affect ring size?\" (Connects to long-term growth and environmental effects.)\n\n2. **Carbon Dioxide Capture Experiment:** Set up two bean plants—one in a sealed clear container (limited CO₂) and one in open air. Over 2-3 weeks, measure height and leaf count. Graph results and discuss: \"Which plant grew better? Why? What does this tell us about the importance of carbon dioxide?\" (Reinforces photosynthesis and air as a source of plant materials.)\n\n3. **Decomposition Rate Study:** Place leaves in mesh bags buried in soil, and another set in open air. Check weekly to observe decomposition progress. Students record which decompose faster and hypothesize why. Discuss: \"What conditions speed up decomposition? How does this connect to the nutrient cycle?\" (Extends nutrient cycle understanding and introduces variables.)",
