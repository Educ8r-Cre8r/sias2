ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about animals and activate prior knowledge using the lizard photograph.\n\n- **Materials:** \n  - Printed or projected photograph of the lizard on the green leaf\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Optional: stuffed lizard toy or plastic lizard figurine\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  *Display the photograph on a projector or pass around printed copies so all students can see.*\n\n  Begin by saying: \"Today we're going to be animal detectives and look very carefully at a special friend. This is a lizard! Let's observe what we see.\"\n\n  Show the photograph and ask these discussion questions (pause 10-15 seconds after each to allow thinking time):\n\n  1. **\"What animal do you see in this picture? What does it look like?\"** (Listen for: small animal, has a tail, has legs, has a head, spots or patterns on skin)\n\n  2. **\"Where is the lizard? What is it standing on?\"** (Expected: it's on a green leaf or plant)\n\n  3. **\"Why do you think the lizard is on that green plant? What do you think it needs to stay safe?\"** (Listen for ideas about hiding, shade, food)\n\n  4. **\"Look at the lizard's body parts. Show me with your fingers where you see its tail, its legs, and its head. What do these parts help the lizard do?\"** (Expected: tail helps balance, legs help it climb and move, head has eyes to see)\n\n  Record student observations on chart paper using simple drawings and words.\n\n  **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... what does a lizard need every day to stay healthy and happy, just like you need food and water and a safe home?\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Great observations! Now let's act like lizards and explore what they need to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate animal needs through role-play and observation activities.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Open classroom space for movement\n  - Picture cards showing: food (insects), water, shelter/plants, sunny spots\n  - Optional: blankets, boxes, or cushions to create a pretend lizard habitat\n  - Observation worksheet or drawing paper\n  - Crayons or colored pencils\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Part A: Movement Exploration (10 minutes)**\n\n  Say: \"Let's move like lizards and think about what lizards need!\"\n\n  Guide students through these movements while narrating:\n  - \"Creep slowly like a lizard searching for food. What might a lizard eat? Show me with your mouth opening to catch an insect.\"\n  - \"A lizard needs water! Can you crawl to that corner like you're going to find water to drink?\"\n  - \"Lizards get cold, so they need a warm, sunny spot. Everyone rush to the sunny spot in our room! Feel how warm it is?\"\n  - \"Now let's hide under the leaves for shelter. Curl up small under our blankets. This keeps the lizard safe from bigger animals.\"\n\n  **Part B: Habitat Building (10-15 minutes)**\n\n  Divide the class into small groups. Assign each group one animal need:\n  - Group 1: Food station (picture of insects, small objects to \"eat\")\n  - Group 2: Water station (cup of water, or picture of water)\n  - Group 3: Shelter station (blankets, boxes, or leaf pictures)\n  - Group 4: Warmth station (sunny window or lamp area)\n\n  Have each group demonstrate and explain their station: \"Our group made a place where lizards can find ____. The lizard needs this because ____.\"\n\n  **What students should record:**\n  - Draw the lizard in its habitat with the things it needs labeled\n  - Write or tell one sentence: \"The lizard needs ___ to survive.\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n\n  Circulate among groups asking open-ended questions:\n  - \"Why do you think a lizard needs that?\"\n  - \"What happens if a lizard can't find food/water/shelter?\"\n  - \"How does the photograph we looked at help you know what lizards need?\"\n\n  Avoid telling students answers; instead, guide them to think: \"Let's look back at the photograph. Where was the lizard? What does that tell us?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n  Students will demonstrate understanding that lizards need:\n  - Food (insects)\n  - Water\n  - Shelter (plants, rocks, safe places)\n  - Warmth/sun\n\n  Students will create or draw a simple habitat representation.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to scientific concepts.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple pictures\n  - Photograph of the lizard (displayed again)\n  - Picture cards of animal needs\n  - Index cards or poster board with vocabulary\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  Bring students together to discuss their exploration. Say: \"You were amazing animal detectives! Let's talk about what you discovered.\"\n\n  **Group Share-Out:**\n  - Ask 2-3 volunteers from each habitat station to share what they created\n  - Display their drawings or demonstrate their station\n  - Affirm observations: \"You're right! Lizards DO need water just like you do!\"\n\n  **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (point to the photograph as you define each):\n\n  Using simple, clear language with visual support:\n\n  1. **Habitat** – \"A habitat is the special place where an animal lives. The lizard's habitat has green leaves, sunshine, and other things it needs. It's like your home!\"\n\n  2. **Survive** – \"To survive means to stay alive and healthy. Animals survive when they have the things they need, like food, water, and a safe place.\"\n\n  3. **Body parts** – \"All animals have body parts that help them. The lizard has a tail for balance, legs for walking and climbing, and eyes to see insects to eat.\"\n\n  4. **Shelter** – \"Shelter is a safe place to hide and rest. Lizards use leaves and rocks as shelter to stay safe from bigger animals and to stay cool or warm.\"\n\n  5. **Observe** – \"Observe means to look very carefully. When we observe the lizard, we see its colors, its tail, and where it lives. This helps us understand what it needs.\"\n\n  **Connections Back to the Photograph:**\n  Point to the lizard photo: \"Look! The lizard is on a green leaf. That's its habitat. It can hide here for shelter. The leaf plant gives it shade when it's too hot. This is everything the lizard needs to survive!\"\n\n  **Check for Understanding:**\n  - Show the photograph and ask: \"What do you see the lizard using from the plant to help it survive?\"\n  - Ask individual students to point to or name one thing a lizard needs\n  - Use thumbs up/sideways/down: \"Do you think lizards can survive without water? Show me with your thumb!\"\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n\n  | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n  |------|----------------------------|\n  | **Habitat** | The home place where an animal lives that has everything it needs |\n  | **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy by having food, water, and shelter |\n  | **Body parts** | The different pieces of an animal's body, like legs, tail, and head, that help it do things |\n  | **Shelter** | A safe, cozy place where an animal can hide and rest |\n  | **Observe** | To look very carefully at something to learn about it |\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n  Students will:\n  - Use the vocabulary words in simple sentences (\"The lizard has a tail to help it survive\")\n  - Identify at least two things a lizard needs from its habitat\n  - Point out body parts on the photograph and explain one way each part helps\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply understanding of animal needs to a new scenario.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Large poster paper or butcher paper\n  - Picture cards of different animals (bird, fish, squirrel, snake, frog)\n  - Pictures of different habitats (tree, water, grass, rock, desert)\n  - Glue sticks and scissors\n  - Crayons\n  - Optional: children's books about different animal habitats (e.g., *Lizards*, *Where Do Animals Live?*)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  Say: \"We learned what a lizard needs to survive. But did you know that different animals need different things? Let's help match animals to their homes!\"\n\n  **Option A: Habitat Matching Game (15 minutes)**\n\n  Show students pictures of 3-4 different animals (bird, fish, frog, squirrel). For each animal, ask:\n  - \"This animal is a ____. What do you think it needs to survive?\"\n  - \"Where does a ____ live?\" (show habitat options: tree, water, grass, forest)\n  - \"How does its body help it live in that place?\" (bird has wings to fly, fish has fins to swim, frog has long legs to jump)\n\n  Have small groups choose one animal and one habitat, glue them together on paper, and draw one thing the animal needs from that habitat (food, water, shelter, or a place to stay warm/cool).\n\n  **Option B: Design an Animal Home (15-20 minutes)**\n\n  Provide each student or pair with a large sheet of paper. Say: \"You're going to be animal architects! Draw a home for a lizard (or another animal). Make sure your home has everything the lizard needs to survive: food, water, shelter, and a warm spot.\"\n\n  Students draw and label:\n  - A place for the lizard to hide (shelter)\n  - A place with food\n  - Water\n  - A sunny spot\n\n  Gallery walk: Display drawings around the room and invite students to observe each other's designs.\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n\n  As students work:\n  - Ask: \"Why did you put that in the habitat?\"\n  - \"How does this help the animal survive?\"\n  - \"What would happen if the animal didn't have ____?\"\n  - Encourage students to reference the original photograph: \"Remember where we saw the lizard? It was on a leaf. Why do you think that's a good home?\"\n\n  Support students in thinking beyond the lizard to other animals' needs.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n  Students will:\n  - Match at least one animal to its correct habitat\n  - Explain why an animal needs a particular part of its home\n  - Create a representation of a habitat with at least 2-3 things the animal needs\n  - Use vocabulary words: habitat, survive, shelter, observe\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal needs and survival.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n  - Observation checklist during Engage: Do students identify body parts and make connections to the habitat?\n  - Observation during Explore: Can students explain why each station is important for survival?\n  - Listen-in during Explain: Do students use vocabulary correctly in context?\n  - Observe Elaborate work: Can students apply learning to a different animal?\n\n  **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (10 minutes, end of Day 2):**\n\n  Display the original lizard photograph one more time. Ask students to answer these questions (accept verbal, drawn, or written responses depending on kindergarten level):\n\n  1. **\"What animal is this? Point to one body part and tell me what it helps the lizard do.\"**\n     - Success: Student names the animal (lizard) and identifies a body part with function (tail helps balance, legs help climb, eyes help see)\n\n  2. **\"Where does the lizard live? What three things does it need to survive there?\"**\n     - Success: Student identifies the habitat (green plant/leaves) and lists 2-3 of: food, water, shelter, warmth\n\n  3. **\"Draw or tell me one way you are like the lizard. What do YOU need to survive, just like the lizard?\"**\n     - Success: Student makes a connection (both need food, water, home, safe place, warmth)\n\n  **Alternative Quick Assessment (Verbal/Thumbs):**\n\n  Make statements and ask students to show thumbs up (true), sideways (not sure), or down (false):\n  - \"Lizards need food to survive.\" ✓\n  - \"Lizards can live without water.\" ✗\n  - \"A lizard's tail helps it climb and balance.\" ✓\n  - \"The green plant is a good home for a lizard.\" ✓\n  - \"Lizards need a warm, sunny place.\" ✓\n\n- **Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n  Students demonstrate understanding if they:\n  ✓ Identify and name the animal in the photograph (lizard)\n  ✓ Name at least 2 things all animals need to survive (food, water, shelter, warmth)\n  ✓ Point out at least one body part and explain how it helps the animal\n  ✓ Identify the habitat and why it's important for the lizard's survival\n  ✓ Use one or more vocabulary words correctly (habitat, survive, shelter, observe, body parts)\n  ✓ Make a personal connection (humans need similar things)\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n  By the end of this lesson, kindergarteners will demonstrate that they can observe an animal and describe what it needs to survive, meeting K-LS1-1.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n  1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only 2-3 key terms consistently (animal, needs, home). Use the terms repeatedly with pictures: \"This is the lizard's home. Home is what the lizard NEEDS.\"\n\n  2. **Concrete Manipulatives:** Provide picture cards students can point to or match rather than requiring verbal responses. Use actual items (water in a cup, plastic insects, a blanket for shelter) during Explore so students have tactile understanding.\n\n  3. **One-on-One Scaffolding:** Pair struggling students with a buddy or classroom assistant. Ask yes/no questions instead of open-ended: \"Does the lizard need food? Yes or no?\" then help them find the answer by looking at the photo together.\n\n  4. **Reduced Complexity in Elaborate:** Instead of designing a new habitat, let students sort pre-made pictures into \"Food,\" \"Water,\" \"Shelter,\" and \"Warmth\" categories.\n\n- **Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n  1. **Deeper Research:** Provide a second photograph of a different animal in a different habitat (bird in a tree, fish in water, snake on rocks). Ask: \"How is this animal's home different from the lizard's? What different things does it need? Why?\" Encourage students to create a Venn diagram comparing two animals' needs.\n\n  2. **Why/How Questions:** Push thinking beyond observation: \"Why do you think the lizard is brown and white? Could it be hiding? From what? How does the color help it survive?\" Introduce the concept of camouflage in simple terms.\n\n  3. **Design Challenge:** \"Create the PERFECT habitat for a lizard using items from our classroom. What would make a lizard happiest and safest?\" Students gather and arrange real materials and explain their choices.\n\n  4. **Multi-Animal Scenario:** Present a problem: \"We want to create a space for a lizard AND a bird in one room. What things would both animals need? What things would be different?\" This promotes comparison and deeper thinking.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Lizard Life Cycle Discovery (Follow-up lesson or homework):**\n   Create a simple book showing how lizards grow from tiny eggs to adult lizards. Provide three pictures (egg, baby lizard, grown lizard) and have students sequence them and draw one thing the baby lizard needs at each stage. This builds toward understanding life cycles (future standard).\n\n2. **Classroom Observation Walk:**\n   Take students on a \"nature detective walk\" around the school grounds, playground, or garden. Look for real lizards, insects, or other small animals in their natural habitats. Document observations with sketches and photographs. Ask: \"Where do we see animals? What is near them? What do they have?\" This extends K-LS1-1 by applying learning to real-world observation.\n\n3. **Visit a Reptile or Pet Store (or Invite a Guest):**\n   Arrange for a local zoo educator, pet store specialist, or classroom pet owner to bring a real lizard (in a safe enclosure) to visit. Students can safely observe and ask questions like: \"What do you feed it? Where does it sleep? What does it like to do?\" This brings authentic engagement and extends observation skills.\n\n4. **Animal Needs Sorting Center (Stations):**\n   Create a classroom math/science center with picture cards of animals and their habitats. Students sort them by what the animal needs: \"Which animals need water?\" \"Which animals need shelter in trees?\" This reinforces categorization and vocabulary.\n\n5. **Storytelling: \"A Day in the Life of a Lizard\":**\n   Read aloud or have students create a simple picture book/comic strip showing a lizard's day: morning basking in the sun (warmth), finding food, finding water, hiding under a leaf (shelter), sleeping. This builds narrative comprehension while reinforcing the concept that animals' daily activities are tied to their survival needs.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\nThis lesson is designed for kindergarteners' developmental level, using concrete observation, role-play, and repetition to build understanding. The photograph serves as the anchor throughout all five phases, building observation and vocabulary skills. The emphasis is on observable patterns (animals have parts, animals have habitats) rather than abstract concepts. Consider repeating parts of this lesson with different animals to reinforce the pattern that ALL animals need food, water, shelter, and safety—a key concept within K-LS1-1.",
