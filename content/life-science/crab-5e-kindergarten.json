ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of the crab (or projected image)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Students' own observational eyes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster at eye level where all children can see it clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent looking.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (one at a time, allowing think-time between each):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you point to the animal?\"\n   - \"What body parts does this creature have? What do you think those long things on top of its head are for?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this crab is sitting in the sand? What might the sand be used for?\"\n   - \"If you were this crab, what would you need to be happy and safe?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations** on chart paper as they share, using their exact language (e.g., \"pointy things,\" \"hard shell,\" \"lives in sand\").\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder... what does this crab do with those big claws? Let's find out together!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become scientists and learn all about this amazing crab and how it survives in its sandy home. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Shallow sensory bin or large tray filled with kinetic sand or beach sand (3-4 inches deep)\n- Plastic toy crab or hermit crab model (if live crabs are not available; alternatively, use images/videos if no models exist)\n- Small shells, pebbles, and seaweed pieces (optional, for habitat enrichment)\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per group)\n- Observation recording sheet with simple drawings and labels (see below)\n- Hand sanitizer\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Look at the toy crab in the sand. Use your magnifying glass to look very closely at the crab. What do you see?\"\n\n2. \"Gently move the crab around in the sand. Watch what happens to the sand. Does the sand stick to the crab? Does it move the sand?\"\n\n3. \"Look at the crab's claws. Can you pretend the claws are doing something? What do you think they do?\" (Encourage students to mime claw movements: digging, grabbing, protecting.)\n\n4. \"Watch as the crab 'digs' a hole in the sand. Why do you think the crab might want to hide in the sand?\"\n\n5. \"Count the crab's legs. How many do you see? Point to each one.\"\n\n6. \"Look at those two special body parts on top. What do you think those are for?\" (Eyes/eyestalks for looking around.)\n\n7. \"On your observation sheet, draw the crab and label the parts you discovered: claws, legs, eyes, shell, and sand home.\"\n\n**How the activity connects to the photograph:** Students handle the same type of crab and environment shown in the photo, making the flat image come to life in 3D through sensory exploration.\n\n**What students should record or document:**\n- A simple labeled drawing of the crab showing: claws, legs, eyes, hard shell, and sand\n- Words or pictures showing where crabs live (in sand)\n- A simple sentence stem completion: \"The crab uses its claws to _______.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What did you discover about the claws?\" \"Why is the sand important?\"\n- Model gentle handling if a live crab is used\n- Encourage students to use descriptive words: \"scratchy,\" \"bumpy,\" \"hard,\" \"wiggly\"\n- Do not correct or lead—let students observe and wonder\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will manipulate the crab model and sand, discovering that crabs have specialized body parts\n- Students will observe that sand provides a place for crabs to hide\n- Students will document their discoveries with drawings and words\n- Students will begin to see connections between body parts and survival (claws for digging, eyes for looking)\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Photograph of the crab (displayed again)\n- Picture cards of crab body parts (claws, legs, eyes, shell, sand habitat)\n- Real shells or sand samples (optional, for passing around)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather students in a circle. Ask: \"What did you discover about the crab?\" Listen to each group share one thing they learned. Add their discoveries to a new chart titled \"How Crabs Survive.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** using the photograph and items on the \"How Crabs Survive\" chart:\n\n   - **Shell:** \"The hard covering on the crab's back is called a shell. It protects the soft body inside, like your clothes protect you.\"\n   - **Claws:** \"These are called claws. Crabs use claws to find food, dig in the sand, and protect themselves from other animals.\"\n   - **Legs:** \"Crabs have 10 legs! Eight legs help them walk and run, and two legs have the big claws attached.\"\n   - **Eyes (or eyestalks):** \"Those two bumps on top are where the crab's eyes are. They help the crab see its food and watch for danger.\"\n   - **Habitat:** \"The place where an animal lives is called its habitat. Sand is the crab's habitat. Crabs dig holes in the sand to hide and stay safe.\"\n\n3. **Connections back to the photograph and Explore activity:**\n   - Point to each body part in the photograph: \"Remember when you saw the crab's claws digging in the sand? That's what crabs do to survive!\"\n   - \"Just like you need water and food to grow, crabs need these body parts to find food and stay safe.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I cover up the crab's claws in the photo, what would the crab have trouble doing?\" (Finding food, digging, protecting itself.)\n   - \"Why is the sandy environment important for the crab?\" (It's where the crab lives, hides, and finds food.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Shell:** The hard, protective covering on a crab's back\n- **Claws:** Strong pinching body parts crabs use to grab food and protect themselves\n- **Legs:** Body parts that help crabs walk and move around\n- **Eyes/Eyestalks:** Special body parts that help crabs see\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds what it needs to survive\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use vocabulary to describe crab body parts and their functions\n- Students will understand that each body part helps the crab survive\n- Students will identify the sandy beach as the crab's habitat\n- Students will begin to see connections between structure (what the crab looks like) and function (what it does to survive)\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large chart paper\n- Markers, crayons, colored pencils\n- Pre-drawn or magazine images of different animals (bird, fish, squirrel, butterfly) for comparison\n- Picture cards showing different survival scenarios (finding food, hiding from predators, moving fast)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Comparison exploration:** \"Now that we know how crabs survive, let's compare them to other animals!\"\n\n1. Show picture cards of other animals (bird, fish, squirrel, butterfly).\n\n2. **Ask comparison questions:**\n   - \"Does a bird have claws like a crab? What does a bird use its claws for?\" (Yes, but to grab trees and food in the air.)\n   - \"Do all animals live in the sand like crabs do?\" (No—birds live in trees, fish live in water, squirrels live on land with trees.)\n   - \"What do you think this animal needs to survive in its home?\" (Guide students to see that different animals have different body parts and habitats.)\n\n3. **Create a collaborative \"Survival Skills\" chart** with pictures:\n   - Draw three columns: \"Crab,\" \"Bird,\" \"Fish\"\n   - Under each, draw or write: body parts, habitat, survival skill\n   - Examples:\n     - Crab: claws, hard shell, sand → digs and hides\n     - Bird: wings, feathers, talons → flies and grabs food\n     - Fish: fins, gills, scales → swims and breathes underwater\n\n4. **Apply to a real-world scenario:** Show a picture of a crab on the beach. Ask: \"If we visit the beach and see a crab, what should we remember about it? Why should we be careful around it?\" (It has claws, it needs its sandy habitat, it's trying to survive just like us.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide comparisons with open-ended questions rather than telling answers\n- Celebrate observations: \"You noticed that crabs and birds both have claws but use them differently—great thinking!\"\n- Encourage students to think about why animals look different (they need different body parts for different habitats)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will apply their knowledge to compare crabs with other animals\n- Students will understand that different animals have different structures (body parts) and habitats to help them survive\n- Students will recognize that all animals, including crabs and humans, have needs and special features to meet those needs\n- Students will demonstrate deeper understanding by making connections between structure and function\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- During Explore, observe students' ability to identify and name crab body parts\n- Listen to explanations during Explain phase to gauge vocabulary acquisition\n- Watch for connections students make: \"The crab uses its claws to dig because...\"\n\n**Exit ticket/Summative assessment (end of session):**\n\nPresent students with a simple illustrated scenario or show the original photograph again. Ask them to respond (orally for kindergarten is most appropriate, but they may draw):\n\n1. **\"Point to a part of the crab that helps it find food. Tell me what it is.\"** (Expected: Students point to claws and say \"claws\" or \"pinchers.\")\n\n2. **\"Why does the crab live in the sand?\"** (Expected: \"To hide,\" \"To be safe,\" \"To find food,\" or \"It's its home.\")\n\n3. **\"What does a crab need to survive?\"** (Expected: \"Food,\" \"A home,\" \"Sand,\" \"Water,\" or referencing observed body parts/habitat.)\n\n4. **Show/tell: \"Tell me one way a crab is different from you.\"** (Expected: \"It has a hard shell,\" \"It has claws,\" \"It lives in sand,\" \"It has many legs.\")\n\n**Success criteria for student understanding:**\n- ✓ Students can identify at least 2 crab body parts (claws, shell, legs, eyes)\n- ✓ Students can explain that at least one body part helps the crab survive\n- ✓ Students can identify the sandy beach/sand as the crab's habitat\n- ✓ Students can make a simple comparison between what crabs need and what humans need (both need a home, food, safety)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will demonstrate understanding by accurately identifying crab body parts\n- Students will explain, in their own words, how a crab uses its body to survive\n- Students will understand that habitats matter and that crabs belong in sandy environments\n- Students will show that all animals, including crabs, have unique needs and features to help them survive\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use simpler terms initially. Instead of \"eyestalks,\" say \"eyes on sticks.\" Instead of \"habitat,\" say \"home.\" Gradually introduce formal terms.\n\n2. **Hands-on exploration time:** Provide extended time in the Explore phase with the sand bin and crab model. Some students may need more tactile time before moving to abstract discussion. Pair with a peer buddy.\n\n3. **Visual supports and picture cards:** Use large, clear picture cards with simple labels showing crab body parts and their functions (claws = digging, shell = protection). Point to these during explanations. Create a personal \"Crab Word Bank\" with pictures and simple words that students can reference during activities.\n\n---\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Compare multiple animals:** Provide images of several beach animals (starfish, sand dollar, sea turtle, seagull). Ask: \"How are all these animals' bodies designed to help them live at the beach? Which one would have the hardest time if we moved it to the desert?\" This extends thinking beyond one animal.\n\n2. **Predict and hypothesize:** Ask: \"What if a crab had only 4 legs instead of 10? What would change? Could it still survive?\" Encourage students to think about why each body part matters and what would happen without it.\n\n3. **Role-play and storytelling:** Have advanced students create a simple story or role-play scenario: \"I'm a crab. I need to find food today. What do I do? Which body parts will I use?\" This deepens understanding of structure-function relationships and habitat dependence.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Beach Habitat Diorama:** Students create a shoebox or poster board diorama of a beach with a crab's sandy home. Include sand, shells, rocks, and a crab figure. Students label body parts of the crab and explain why each element is in the habitat. (Connects to habitat awareness and can be sent home as a family project.)\n\n2. **Crab Movement Game:** Play a \"Move Like a Crab\" game in the classroom or gym. Students practice walking sideways like crabs, using their \"arms\" as claws to pretend to dig or grab. Discuss: \"Why do you think crabs move sideways? How does their body shape help them?\" This adds kinesthetic learning and deeper thinking about body structure and function.\n\n3. **Comparison Chart Class Book:** Create a simple class book where each page compares the crab to a different animal (bird, fish, ant, cat, human). Each page shows: \"The crab has [body part]. The [animal] has [body part]. Both animals need [survival need].\" Students illustrate and dictate descriptions. This extends understanding of adaptation and diversity.\n\n---",
