Analyze evidence from animal tracks to infer the type of herbivore present and its feeding behavior.\n2. Construct an argument explaining how plants in a habitat provide energy and matter for herbivores.\n3. Develop a model showing how matter (nutrients, energy, plant material) moves from soil and air through plants to herbivores and back to the environment.\n4. Use observations of habitat characteristics to describe the relationship between available plants and the herbivores that live there.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest in animal behavior and ecosystems by examining real evidence of animal presence.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed on projector or printed large format)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks or journals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the projector without comment for 30 seconds. Let students observe silently.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see in the center of this picture? What do you think made these marks?\"\n   - \"What plants can you identify around the tracks? Why might an animal be walking through this grassy area?\"\n   - \"If you were this animal, what would you be looking for in this habitat?\"\n   - \"What does this tell us about what animals need to survive in this place?\"\n\n3. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"Before we investigate further, write in your journal: *What animal do you think made these tracks, and what evidence helps you make that guess?*\" Allow 2-3 minutes for journaling.\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper to revisit during the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become habitat detectives. We'll use the clues in this photograph to understand what herbivores need and how they get energy from plants.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant-herbivore relationships and energy flow through hands-on observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Copies of the photograph (one per pair or group of 3)\n- Magnifying glasses (at least 4-5)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Plant identification cards or guide (optional but recommended)\n- String or rope (to simulate herbivore trail)\n- Worksheet: \"Habitat Detective Chart\" (see below)\n- Poster board or large paper for each group\n- Images or samples of common herbivore droppings, or descriptions (deer, rabbit, groundhog)\n\n**Habitat Detective Chart Template:**\n| Element | Observations | What it tells us |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Tracks (shape, size, depth) | | |\n| Plants in the area | | |\n| Soil condition | | |\n| Animal path | | |\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into groups of 3.** Distribute one color copy of the photograph and a \"Habitat Detective Chart\" to each group.\n\n2. **Direct students to examine the photograph closely** using magnifying glasses and answer the following:\n   - Describe the shape and size of the tracks. Are they deep or shallow? What does that tell you about the animal?\n   - Identify at least 4 different plants visible in the photograph. List them on the chart.\n   - Look at the soil. Is it wet, dry, sandy, or muddy? How might that affect the animal?\n   - Does the animal seem to be walking in a straight line or wandering? What might it be doing?\n\n3. **Create a \"feeding path\" model:** Using string or rope on a table or floor, have students recreate the path the herbivore might have taken through the habitat. At different \"stops\" along the path, place images or names of plants it likely ate. Record which plants are on or near the path.\n\n4. **Document findings:** Students sketch the habitat scene and label the plants and track location. They should write 2-3 sentences about what the animal was probably doing in this spot.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups and ask probing questions: *\"Why do you think the tracks are so deep here?\" \"What would this animal eat?\" \"Where does the plant get energy to grow?\"*\n- Guide observation without confirming answers—let evidence lead students to conclusions.\n- Provide plant identification support if needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Groups identify at least 3-4 plant types in the habitat.\n- Students infer the animal's behavior (feeding, traveling, resting).\n- Groups recognize that the herbivore is in this spot *because* of the plants available.\n- Students record observations showing evidence of plant-herbivore relationships.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts connecting plant physiology to herbivore energy needs and ecosystem matter cycles.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary\n- Diagram showing the relationship between plants, herbivores, and the environment\n- Images of plants (roots, leaves, stems)\n- The original photograph (projected)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 2-3 groups to share their findings about the tracks and plants. Display their charts on the board.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Herbivore:** An animal that eats only plants to get energy and materials to survive and grow.\n   - **Photosynthesis:** The process plants use to turn sunlight, water, and air into food and energy.\n   - **Food Chain:** The path energy takes as it moves from plants to animals.\n   - **Ecosystem:** All the living organisms (plants, animals, decomposers) and nonliving things (soil, water, air) in one place that interact together.\n   - **Decomposer:** An organism (like fungi or bacteria) that breaks down dead plants and animals and returns nutrients to the soil.\n\n3. **Explain the key science connection** using the photograph:\n   - Point to the plants in the photo: \"Plants get water from the **soil** and carbon dioxide from the **air**. Using energy from the **sun**, they turn these simple materials into food—sugar—that they use to grow.\"\n   - Point to the tracks: \"This herbivore came to this spot because the plants here provide the food it needs. The plant material it eats becomes part of the animal's body, giving it energy to move, grow, and survive.\"\n   - Draw a simple cycle on the board: **Sun → Plant (grows) → Herbivore (eats plant, gets energy) → Decomposer (breaks down waste) → Soil (nutrients return)**\n   - Explain: \"Matter—the materials that make up plants and animals—is constantly moving through an ecosystem. When a plant dies or an animal leaves droppings, decomposers break it down, and those nutrients go back into the soil to help new plants grow.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Where did the plant get the energy to grow before the herbivore ate it?\" (Sun)\n   - Ask: \"If there were no plants in this habitat, what would happen to the herbivores?\" (They would leave or starve)\n   - Ask: \"When this herbivore leaves droppings on the ground, what happens to that material?\" (Decomposers break it down; nutrients return to soil)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that plants use sunlight, water, and air to create food energy.\n- Students recognize that herbivores depend on plants for energy and growth materials.\n- Students begin to see ecosystems as cycles of matter moving between plants, animals, soil, and air.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a visual model of energy and matter flow in a real ecosystem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster board or chart paper (one per group)\n- Colored markers, colored pencils, or cut-out images\n- Labels (sun, soil, water, air, decomposer, etc.)\n- Arrows or string to show flow\n- Optional: photo of the original habitat printed for reference\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:** \"You're going to create a model that shows how matter and energy move through the ecosystem in this photograph. Your model should show the sun, plants, the herbivore, and what happens when the plant and animal die.\"\n\n2. **Guide the model creation:**\n   - In the center of the poster, draw or paste the herbivore from the photograph (or draw it based on track evidence).\n   - Around it, draw or attach images of the plants visible in the photo.\n   - Above, draw the sun with arrows showing how light energy reaches the plants.\n   - Below, show the soil with labels for water and nutrients.\n   - Add a decomposer (fungus, bacteria, worm) to show what breaks down dead material.\n   - Use arrows to show: **Sun → Plant → Herbivore** and **Dead matter → Decomposer → Soil nutrients → Plant**\n\n3. **Require labels and descriptions:** Each arrow or section should have a label explaining what's moving and why. For example: \"Water moves from soil into the plant's roots.\"\n\n4. **Gallery walk (if time permits):** Display models and have students observe how different groups showed the same concepts.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"What does this arrow show moving? Where does it come from? Where does it go?\"\n- Prompt students to explain the purpose of decomposers: \"Why is the decomposer important to this ecosystem?\"\n- Ensure students label the *inputs* (sun, water, air) and *outputs* (energy to herbivore, waste back to soil).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual showing the interconnected relationship between plants, herbivores, soil, air, water, and sun.\n- Models demonstrate understanding that matter cycles through an ecosystem.\n- Students can explain their model orally or in writing, showing deeper conceptual understanding.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant physiology, herbivore dependence on plants, and ecosystem matter cycles.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student participation in group discussions during Explore and Explain phases.\n- Review Habitat Detective Charts for accuracy of observations and inferences.\n- Ask think-pair-share questions: \"Why does a herbivore need plants? What would happen if all the plants died?\"\n- Check model creation for evidence of understanding matter and energy flow.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\nProvide students with a blank diagram showing: sun, soil/water, plant, herbivore, and decomposer. Ask students to:\n\n1. **Draw and label arrows** showing how matter and energy move through this ecosystem. (3-4 arrows minimum)\n\n2. **Answer these questions in 2-3 sentences each:**\n   - **Question 1:** \"Explain how a plant uses materials from the soil, water, and air to grow. Where does the energy come from?\"\n   - **Question 2:** \"Why do herbivores need plants to survive? What do they get from eating plants?\"\n   - **Question 3:** \"What happens to a dead plant in the ecosystem? How does it help other organisms?\"\n\n3. **Reflection:** \"Look back at the photograph of the tracks. Write one thing you learned about this herbivore and its habitat based on today's lesson.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student identifies that plants use sunlight, water, and air as inputs for growth.\n- ✓ Student explains that herbivores depend on plants for food energy.\n- ✓ Student shows on a diagram that matter cycles from environment → plant → animal → decomposer → soil.\n- ✓ Student makes reasonable inferences about the animal in the photograph based on habitat observations.\n- ✓ Student recognizes the interconnection between all organisms and the physical environment.\n\n**Scoring Guide:**\n- **Proficient (4):** All four success criteria met; answers are clear, detailed, and scientifically accurate.\n- **Developing (3):** Three success criteria met; answers show understanding with minor gaps.\n- **Beginning (2):** Two success criteria met; answers show partial understanding; some misconceptions present.\n- **Needs Support (1):** Fewer than two success criteria met; significant gaps in understanding.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Guided Habitat Detective Chart:** Provide a partially completed chart with word banks (plant names, descriptive words) so students can fill in observations with teacher support.\n\n2. **Simplified Model:** Allow students to create a simpler version of the ecosystem model with just three components: **Plant → Herbivore → Soil (with decomposer returning nutrients)**, rather than showing all inputs like sun, water, and air initially. Build complexity once these relationships are secure.\n\n3. **Sentence Starters for Exit Ticket:** Provide sentence frames:\n   - \"Plants need _______ from the soil, _______ from the air, and _______ from the sun to grow.\"\n   - \"Herbivores eat plants to get _______.\"\n   - \"When a plant dies, _______ break it down and return nutrients to the _______.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-Level Food Chains:** Ask students to research or infer what *eats* this herbivore. Create a longer food chain showing Herbivore → Carnivore (predator). Discuss how the energy originally from the sun still powers the predator through the plant-herbivore-predator link.\n\n2. **Quantitative Matter Cycling:** Have students estimate or research how much plant material a particular herbivore (e.g., deer) eats in a day/week/year. Calculate how much matter is transferred from plants to animals, and discuss the volume of decomposition that must occur to recycle that material back to soil.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Disruption Scenario:** Present a challenge: \"If a disease killed all the plants in this habitat, what would happen to the herbivores, predators, and decomposers? Could the ecosystem recover?\" Have students write a detailed explanation showing their understanding of interdependence and resilience.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Create a Field Guide for Herbivore Tracking:** Students research common herbivores in your local region (deer, rabbits, groundhogs, etc.), draw or find images of their tracks, and create a laminated field guide. Use it for an outdoor scavenger hunt to find real animal tracks on school grounds. Photograph and document where different herbivores have been, and connect observations back to available vegetation in each location.\n\n2. **Decomposition Investigation:** Set up a long-term observation where students place dead plant material (leaves, grass clippings) in a clear container with soil. Over several weeks, students observe and document decomposition, predicting when the material will no longer be visible and inferring where the matter goes. Connect back to the lesson concept: \"Decomposers are breaking down this dead plant material and returning the nutrients to the soil, just like they did in our ecosystem model.\"\n\n3. **Plant Needs Experiment Design:** Students design and conduct an investigation to test one variable affecting plant growth (sunlight, water, or air circulation). Document changes over 2-3 weeks using measurements and sketches. Present findings and explain: \"Since plants need these materials to grow, and herbivores depend on plants, how would reduced _______ (sunlight/water/air) affect the herbivores in this habitat?\" This reinforces the concept that plant health directly impacts herbivore survival.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson anchors the abstract concepts of energy flow and matter cycling in tangible, observable evidence—the tracks in soil and the plants surrounding them. Fifth graders can connect their direct observations to the larger systems at work in ecosystems, building toward more complex understanding of ecological relationships.",
