        "exceeds": "Student explains that the spread-out roots absorb water and nutrients from soil, anchor the plant so it doesn't fall over, and may reference how the branching pattern increases surface area for absorption.",
        "meets": "Student explains that roots take in water and nutrients the plant needs to survive and/or that roots hold the plant in the ground.",
        "approaching": "Student identifies one function of roots (such as getting water or staying in place) but lacks detail or gives an incomplete explanation of how it helps survival.",

        "exceeds": "Student identifies multiple pieces of evidence, such as the seed's stored food (visible as the dark seed), successful root development, green leaf growth, and explains how the seed contained everything needed to start growing before water and soil were added.",
        "meets": "Student identifies at least two pieces of evidence from the seedling, such as the presence of both roots and leaves or mentions the seed contained stored food that allowed growth to begin.",
        "approaching": "Student identifies one piece of evidence (such as 'it has roots' or 'it grew') but cannot explain how this shows the seed had what it needed to start growing.",
        "beginning": "Student provides a vague observation about the seedling without connecting it to evidence of what the seed contained, or gives minimal response."

        "approaching": "Student proposes one or two root features but explanations are incomplete or weakly connected to how they would help the plant survive.",
        "beginning": "Student makes a simple design suggestion with minimal or unclear reasoning, or provides a response that shows limited understanding of root functions."
