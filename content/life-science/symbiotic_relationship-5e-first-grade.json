Identify and describe the external body parts of a bee and explain how each part helps the bee visit flowers.\n2. Observe and describe how bees and flowers work together and need each other to survive.\n3. Design and build a model bee using craft materials that mimics how a real bee's body parts help it collect pollen from flowers.\n4. Explain in simple words why bees visiting flowers is important for both the bee and the flower.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about bees and flowers using the photograph.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Large printed color copy of the photograph (or digital display via projector)\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Optional: recording device or audio of bees buzzing (YouTube or educational resource)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. Display the photograph on a large screen or printed poster so all students can see clearly. Let students look silently for 30 seconds while soft buzzing sounds play in the background.\n  2. Ask students: \"What do you see in this picture? What is the bee doing?\"\n  3. Pose these discussion questions (pause after each to allow responses):\n     - \"Why do you think the bee is visiting this flower?\"\n     - \"What part of the bee's body do you think helps it stick to the flower? Look closely!\"\n     - \"What might the bee be collecting from the flower? Why?\"\n     - \"Does the flower need the bee? Why or why not?\"\n  4. Record student responses on chart paper, even if some are incomplete or incorrect—this activates prior thinking.\n  5. End with a wonder prompt: \"I wonder what would happen to the flowers if there were no bees to visit them?\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Let's explore how bees and flowers really work together by watching them closely and building our own bee!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students investigate bee body parts and how they help the bee visit flowers through hands-on activity.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Real flowers (any variety available: daisies, marigolds, carnations) OR paper flowers with yellow pollen-like powder (turmeric or cinnamon mixed with cornstarch) glued inside\n  - Small objects to represent bee body parts: fuzzy balls (pom-poms), pipe cleaners, googly eyes, small chenille sticks or toothpicks\n  - Craft glue or tape\n  - Paper towels or small paintbrushes\n  - Yellow powder (turmeric, cinnamon, or store-bought pollen powder) in small containers\n  - Trays or large plates to contain mess\n  - One flower per pair or small group of students\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. Divide students into pairs or small groups (3-4 students).\n  2. Give each group one real flower (or paper flower) and a tray.\n  3. **First investigation:** Ask students to gently touch the flower's pollen center (or the inside of the paper flower). Ask: \"What's on your finger? What do you feel?\" (texture, powder). Record observations on a simple chart or drawing.\n  4. **Second investigation:** Provide students with the craft materials (pom-poms, pipe cleaners, googly eyes, chenille sticks).\n  5. Show them a model bee you've created beforehand that demonstrates how a fuzzy body (pom-pom) and sticky legs (pipe cleaners) help collect pollen.\n  6. Ask: \"How can we make our own bee body that can pick up pollen from the flower?\" Encourage students to build a small bee model using the materials.\n  7. Once their bee model is made, have students gently touch their bee model to the yellow powder or real pollen, then to the flower center. Ask: \"Did the pollen stick to your bee? What body parts caught the pollen?\"\n  8. Students should draw or dictate what they discovered: \"Our bee picked up pollen because of _____.\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate among groups asking guiding questions: \"What part of the bee is catching the pollen?\" \"How is your fuzzy pom-pom like a real bee's body?\"\n  - Do not explain the answers; instead, encourage students to watch and discover.\n  - Ask students to compare their observations: \"Did all bees pick up pollen the same way?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students discover that fuzzy or sticky body parts pick up pollen.\n  - Students observe that pollen transfers from bee to flower (even with their models).\n  - Students create a simple bee model showing at least one body part that helps collect pollen.\n  - Students document their observations through drawings or dictation.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration, connecting to the photograph and student discoveries.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Original photograph (enlarged)\n  - Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple definitions\n  - Student drawings/observations from Explore phase\n  - Optional: picture cards of bee body parts labeled with arrows\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Share-out:** Invite 2-3 groups to show their bee models and explain what they discovered. Ask the class: \"What body parts did the bee use to pick up pollen?\"\n  2. **Vocabulary introduction:** Write the following words on chart paper and define each in first-grade language:\n     - **Pollen:** The yellow powder inside flowers that helps make new flowers grow.\n     - **Nectar:** Sweet juice inside flowers that bees drink for food and energy.\n     - **Body parts:** The different pieces that make up a bee's body—like legs, fuzz, wings, and antennae.\n     - **Pollinate:** When pollen moves from one flower to another (by the bee's body).\n  3. **Return to the photograph:** Display the original image again. Point out:\n     - The bee's fuzzy body (dark hair all over it)\n     - The bee's legs with little brushes on them\n     - The yellow pollen stuck to the bee's legs and body\n     - The flower with its bright colors and pollen center\n  4. **Make the connection:** \"The bee's fuzzy body is like a magnet for pollen. When the bee lands on the flower to drink nectar, pollen sticks to it. Then, when the bee flies to the next flower, some pollen falls off. This helps the flower make seeds and new flowers! The bee gets food, and the flower gets help making babies. They help each other!\"\n  5. **Check for understanding:** Ask students:\n     - \"Why does pollen stick to the bee's body?\"\n     - \"What does the bee get from the flower?\" (nectar/food)\n     - \"What does the flower get from the bee?\" (help making new flowers)\n     - \"Are the bee and flower friends? Why?\"\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Pollen:** The yellow powder inside flowers that helps make new flowers grow.\n  - **Nectar:** Sweet juice inside flowers that bees drink for food and energy.\n  - **Body parts:** The different pieces that make up a bee's body—like legs, fuzz, wings, and antennae.\n  - **Pollinate:** When pollen moves from one flower to another, helping the flower make new seeds.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students understand that bees and flowers need each other.\n  - Students can name 2-3 bee body parts and explain one way each helps the bee.\n  - Students recognize pollen and understand its basic role in making new flowers.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by solving a real-world problem using what they learned about bee body parts.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Picture of a garden or a small potted plant (optional: a real flower garden planted in a container with soil)\n  - Chart paper or poster board\n  - Markers or colored pencils\n  - Picture cards of different animals (butterfly, hummingbird, ant, bird, ladybug)\n  - Scissors and glue sticks (optional: for cut-and-paste activity)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Introduce the problem:** \"A gardener wants to grow lots of beautiful flowers in a garden, but there are no bees visiting anymore. How can we help the gardener grow more flowers? What can we do?\"\n  2. **Brainstorm with students:** Ask:\n     - \"What does a flower need to grow new flowers?\" (pollen, bees)\n     - \"Are there other animals that can help carry pollen like bees do?\" (butterflies, hummingbirds, etc.)\n     - \"How could we help bees come back to the garden?\" (plant flowers, don't hurt bees, etc.)\n  3. **Design an action:** Have students work in small groups or as a class to create a simple poster or plan that shows:\n     - How to attract bees to a garden (draw flowers, plants they love)\n     - One other animal that helps flowers (label with the animal's body part that helps, e.g., butterfly's long straw mouth for drinking nectar)\n     - Why helping bees helps the garden\n  4. **Alternatively (for kinesthetic learners):** Create a \"flower garden\" in the classroom. Have students place pictures of flowers around the room. Using their bee models from Explore, students walk around \"visiting\" flowers and moving pollen (confetti or paper pieces) from flower to flower. After the activity, ask: \"Did flowers get visited? Did pollen move? That's what real bees do!\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Guide brainstorming without providing all answers.\n  - Ask questions: \"How is a butterfly like a bee?\" \"What part of the butterfly could carry pollen?\"\n  - Celebrate all reasonable ideas.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students propose at least one way to help bees or flowers in a garden.\n  - Students identify another animal that helps pollinate (even if understanding is simple).\n  - Students create a poster, plan, or demonstration showing their thinking.\n  - Students explain in simple words why their idea would help the garden.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of bee body parts, plant-animal relationships, and how mimicking bee structures solves problems.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (Throughout lesson):**\n  - Observe student discussions during Engage phase.\n  - Monitor Explore investigations: Do students recognize that fuzzy/sticky parts pick up pollen?\n  - Listen to students explain their bee models and observations.\n  - Check their drawings and dictation from Explore.\n\n  **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Session 2):**\n  \n  Use one or more of the following based on classroom format:\n\n  **Option A: Oral Interview (1-on-1 or small group, 2-3 minutes per student)**\n  - Show the original photograph and ask:\n    1. \"Point to the bee. What is it doing?\"\n    2. \"What part of the bee helps it stay on the flower?\" (Accept: fuzzy, sticky, legs, fuzz, etc.)\n    3. \"Why do you think the bee is visiting this flower?\" (Accept: food, looking for nectar, wants to drink, etc.)\n    4. \"If there were no bees, what would happen to the flowers?\" (Accept: can't make new flowers, no seeds, flowers go away, etc.)\n\n  **Option B: Drawing with Dictation**\n  - Provide a blank page with a simple flower outline.\n  - Ask: \"Draw a bee visiting this flower. Tell me one reason the bee needs the flower and one reason the flower needs the bee.\"\n  - Record student's dictated explanation.\n\n  **Option C: Simple Picture Sort**\n  - Show students 4-5 pictures: a bee, a flower, a butterfly, a rock, a tree.\n  - Ask: \"Which of these work together to make new flowers? Why?\"\n\n  **Success Criteria:**\n  - Student identifies the bee and flower and describes at least one interaction (bee on flower, bee collecting pollen, etc.).\n  - Student names or describes at least one bee body part that helps it (fuzzy, sticky, legs, wings, etc.).\n  - Student provides at least one simple reason why bees and flowers need each other (bee gets food, flower makes new flowers, etc.).\n  - Student's bee model from Explore phase demonstrates understanding that body parts matter in how the bee collects pollen.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students demonstrate understanding that bees have special body parts that help them collect pollen.\n  - Students explain that bees and flowers help each other survive.\n  - Students can design or describe a simple solution involving bee body parts (their model bee or garden plan).\n  - Most students meet all learning objectives; struggling students may need support in articulating the relationship, but should show understanding through drawing and modeling.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support:**\n  1. **Scaffolded vocabulary:** Use only the key terms (bee, flower, pollen, fuzzy, sticky) with struggling students; introduce more complex terms as they demonstrate understanding.\n  2. **Simplified Explore activity:** Pair struggling students with a peer or adult. Provide pre-made bee models and allow them to focus on the observation of pollen transfer rather than model-building.\n  3. **Visual support for Evaluate:** Use real photographs, picture cards, or the original lesson image during assessment. Ask yes/no or simple choice questions: \"Does the bee need the flower? Yes or no?\" or \"Is the fuzzy part sticky? Does it help catch pollen?\"\n\n- **Challenge:**\n  1. **Extended investigation:** Ask: \"Can you test whether different textures pick up pollen differently?\" Provide students with fuzzy, smooth, and sticky materials and have them experiment. Record which picks up the most pollen.\n  2. **Research other pollinators:** Introduce butterflies, hummingbirds, or beetles. Ask: \"How are their bodies different from a bee's body? How do their different body parts help them pollinate?\" Students can compare and create a diagram or poster.\n  3. **Design a solution:** Challenge students to design a tool or artificial \"bee\" that could pollinate flowers if real bees disappeared. What materials would they need? What body parts would it need? Build and test it.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Observation Journal:** Over one week, have students (or the class together) observe a real flower garden or potted flowers. Each day, draw or dictate: \"Did a bee visit? What did it do? What did the flower look like?\" Compile into a \"Bee Journal\" showing patterns of bee visits.\n\n2. **Guest Speaker or Video:** Invite a local beekeeper or show a short, age-appropriate video (National Geographic Kids or PBS Kids segment, 3-5 minutes) about how bees help gardens. Afterward, students can ask questions and share what they learned with families.\n\n3. **Plant a Pollinator Garden:** As a class, plant bee-friendly flowers (sunflowers, marigolds, zinnias) in a classroom container or school garden bed. Throughout the growing season, observe and record which insects visit. Connect the learning: \"Our flowers grew because pollinators visited them, just like in our lesson!\"\n\n4. **Craft Project:** Students create a 3D bee using recyclables (paper towel tube body, pipe cleaner antennae, paper wings, pom-pom fuzz) to take home. Include a simple instruction sheet for families explaining how a bee's body parts help it pollinate.\n\n5. **Read-Aloud Connection:** Read age-appropriate books such as *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* by Eric Carle (to discuss life cycles and plant interaction) or *Honey* by Manya Stojic (to explore bees and flowers in nature).\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
