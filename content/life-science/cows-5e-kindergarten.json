Identify at least two things that cows need to stay alive (food and water).\n2. Observe and describe where cows live and what is in that place.\n3. Explain that animals need a home (habitat) with food and water to survive.\n4. Connect what they learn about cows to other animals they know.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about cows and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color copy of the cow pasture photograph (or display on smartboard/projector)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording student observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a large printout where all students can see clearly. Give students 30–45 seconds of silent observation time to look carefully.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (pause after each for responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about the animals.\" (Expected: cows, different colors, standing in a field)\n   - \"Where are these cows? What is around them?\" (Expected: grass, trees, open field, fence)\n   - \"What do you think the cows are doing right now?\" (Expected: eating, playing, living, staying safe)\n   - \"What would a cow need to be happy and healthy? What keeps it alive?\" (Expected: food, water, a place to live, family)\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder... if we took away the grass from this field, what would the cows do? Why?\" Listen to student ideas without judgment.\n\n4. **Record student ideas on chart paper.** You will revisit these predictions during the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an activity to find out what animals really need to stay alive and healthy, just like these cows!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what animals need by exploring and sorting.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards (8–10 images each showing): grass, water, shelter/barn, other animals, toys/sticks, sun, mud, fence, hay\n  - *Note: Create simple line drawings or print clipart images on cardstock and laminate. Organize into two bags or sets.*\n- Two labeled baskets or sorting mats labeled: **\"Cows NEED This\"** and **\"Cows DO NOT Need This\"**\n- Student observation sheet (simple pictorial checklist with images of grass, water, shelter, with boxes to check or circle)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1:** Divide students into pairs or small groups (3–4 students).\n\n**Step 2:** Explain the task: \"You have pictures of different things. Your job is to look at each picture and decide: Does a cow NEED this to stay alive and healthy, or does a cow NOT need this? Put it in the right basket.\"\n\n**Step 3:** Provide each group with 5–6 picture cards. Have them sort the cards together. Circulate and listen (do not correct yet—let them explore).\n\n**Step 4:** As students sort, prompt with gentle questions:\n- \"Why did you put that in the NEED basket?\"\n- \"What would happen if the cow didn't have this?\"\n- \"Have you ever seen a cow eating grass? Do you think cows like grass?\"\n\n**Step 5:** Have students mark their observation sheet by checking or circling pictures of what cows need (teacher can do this together, or students can do it with help).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Listen without correcting; validate all thinking.\n- Ask questions to deepen observation (\"Tell me why you think the cow needs that\").\n- Observe which students recognize food, water, and shelter; note misconceptions.\n- Help students explain their reasoning in their own words.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should identify that cows need grass (food), water, and shelter.\n- Some may include other items; allow discussion, but gently guide back to survival needs.\n- Completed observation sheets or sorting activity showing their thinking.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph from Engage phase (displayed again)\n- Picture cards used in Explore\n- A small container of water and grass samples (real or high-quality images) to show\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Call students together. Ask: \"What did your group put in the NEED basket? Why?\" Accept 4–5 responses. Affirm correct thinking: \"Yes! Cows need food to have energy to grow and play.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** using Kindergarten-friendly language. Write each word on chart paper and draw/post a picture:\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Kindergarten-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Food** | What animals eat to grow strong and have energy. Cows eat *grass*. |\n   | **Water** | A drink that all animals need to stay healthy. Cows drink water. |\n   | **Shelter/Home** | A safe place to rest and stay protected. Cows can rest under trees or in barns. |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives that has everything it needs (food, water, shelter). A pasture is a cow's habitat. |\n   | **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the grass: \"This is the cow's food. See how much grass is in this field? The cows can eat and eat!\"\n   - Point to the trees: \"These are like a shelter. They give shade and protection.\"\n   - Ask: \"Is there water here? Where might the cows get water?\" (Infer water source—stream, water trough, etc.)\n   - Point to the group: \"These cows live together. They are a family or herd.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding** using a simple thumbs strategy:\n   - \"Thumbs up if you think cows need food to survive.\"\n   - \"Thumbs up if you think cows need shelter.\"\n   - \"Thumbs up if you think cows need water.\"\n   - Observe responses and clarify any misconceptions.\n\n5. **Revisit predictions from Engage:** \"Remember when we wondered what would happen if we took away the grass? What do we know now?\" (Cows would not have food; they could not survive.)\n\n**Vocabulary (Listed for Reference):**\n- **Food:** What animals eat to grow strong and healthy.\n- **Water:** A drink all animals need to live.\n- **Shelter:** A safe place to rest and stay warm.\n- **Habitat:** Where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter.\n- **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least 2–3 things cows need (food, water, shelter/home).\n- Students understand that a habitat provides these needs.\n- Students can point to parts of the photograph and identify what cows need there.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to other animals and deepen understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of 3–4 other animals (dog, bird, fish, rabbit, or horse)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Crayons and drawing paper (one sheet per student or pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Compare Animals Activity (Whole Group)**\n\n1. Show a picture of a different animal (e.g., a dog or bird).\n2. Ask: \"Does this animal need food? Does it need water? Does it need a home? Why?\"\n3. Create a simple comparison chart on paper:\n   - **Cows** | **[Other Animal]**\n   - Both need food ✓\n   - Both need water ✓\n   - Both need shelter ✓\n   - We're the same!\n\n4. Guide students to see that different animals all need the same basic things (food, water, shelter) but in different places and forms.\n\n**Option B: Draw and Share (Small Groups)**\n\n1. Give each student/pair a piece of paper divided into three sections labeled: \"Food,\" \"Water,\" \"Home.\"\n2. Ask students to draw or paste pictures showing what a cow needs in each section.\n3. Have volunteers share: \"This is the cow's food. It's grass. The cow eats it to stay strong!\"\n4. Display drawings on a classroom \"Cow Needs\" board.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion without leading too much.\n- Encourage students to explain their thinking: \"Why do you think a bird needs water?\"\n- Validate comparisons: \"You're right! A cow and a dog both need water!\"\n- Help students articulate that all animals need the same things, even if they look different.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that multiple animals share similar basic needs.\n- Students can explain why different animals need food, water, and shelter.\n- Drawings or charts showing understanding of cow needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what cows and animals need to survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe students during sorting activity in Explore: Do they correctly identify food, water, and shelter as needs?\n- Listen to responses during Explain discussion questions.\n- Use thumbs-up check-in to gauge understanding of each need.\n- Note which students need additional support based on responses.\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket / End of Lesson):**\n\nUse **one of these methods** based on your class:\n\n**Method 1: Oral Exit Ticket (for students with limited writing)**\n- Show the cow photograph again.\n- Ask each student (or small group): \"Tell me one thing a cow needs to be healthy. Why does it need that?\"\n- Accept answers like \"grass because cows eat it\" or \"water because cows drink it\" or \"trees because they give shelter.\"\n\n**Method 2: Picture Response**\n- Show an image of a pasture with a cow.\n- Give each student three sticky notes with images/words: \"grass,\" \"water,\" \"shelter.\"\n- Ask students to place each sticky note where that resource appears in the picture and explain what they placed.\n\n**Method 3: Simple Drawing + Dictation**\n- Ask: \"Draw a picture of what a cow needs to be happy and healthy.\"\n- Have students point to and name their drawing: \"This is ___. Cows need it because ___.\"\n- Record their words on their paper.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n✓ Student can identify **at least 2 things cows need** (food and water; or food and shelter; or water and shelter)\n✓ Student can **explain why** the cow needs each thing (e.g., \"for energy,\" \"to drink,\" \"to rest,\" \"to stay safe\")\n✓ Student demonstrates understanding that **a habitat provides what animals need**\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can name at least one need (food, water, or shelter).\n- 60–70% of students can name two or more needs and give a simple reason.\n- All students show emerging understanding that animals need certain things to live.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary** before the lesson using real objects: Show actual grass, a cup of water, and a picture of a barn/shelter. Handle and discuss each one.\n\n2. **Use real-world examples:** \"Your body needs food and water, just like a cow. You sleep in your home, and a cow sleeps in a shelter. You need the same things!\"\n\n3. **Pair with a stronger peer** during Explore sorting activity. Assign their role: \"You put the food pictures together; your partner puts the shelter pictures together.\"\n\n4. **Simplify the exit ticket:** Ask only one question: \"What does a cow eat?\" or \"Where does a cow live?\" Accept one-word or short-phrase answers.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Introduce more complex habitats:** \"This cow lives in a pasture. Can you think of other places cows could live? What would they need there?\" Explore adaptability and habitat variation.\n\n2. **Extend comparison:** \"A fish also needs food, water, and shelter. But where does a fish get water?\" Guide discussion toward understanding that animals use habitats differently; water is both food source and home for fish.\n\n3. **Create a food chain question:** \"The cow eats grass. What eats the cow?\" Introduce the idea that animals are connected; use simple language (predator/prey can come later).\n\n4. **Research challenge:** \"Let's find out: Do cows really drink water from streams, or do farmers give them water in bowls? Let's look at pictures!\" Encourage observation and curiosity about real cow care.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bring in a guest speaker or video:** Invite a local farmer or show a 5–7 minute video of cows on a farm (YouTube has age-appropriate options like \"A Day in the Life of a Cow\"). Students ask: \"What does the farmer do to help cows get food, water, and shelter?\" Connect to lesson concepts.\n\n2. **Create a classroom \"Cow Habitat\" display:**\n   - Set up a corner with pictures/drawings of: grass, water, a barn, trees, and cows.\n   - Have students add drawings or craft items they create to the display.\n   - Label each part with vocabulary words.\n   - Use it for repeated, informal review throughout the week.\n\n3. **Walk-around observation:** If possible, take students outside to observe a real animal (squirrel, bird, ant, etc.) in the school yard.\n   - Ask: \"What does this animal need to survive? Where does it get food? Where is its shelter?\"\n   - Connect to the cow lesson: \"This animal needs the same things as a cow, but lives in a different place!\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson can easily be split across two days: Day 1 = Engage + Explore; Day 2 = Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate.\n- Keep the photograph posted throughout the unit for reference.\n- Revisit the lesson vocabulary throughout the week in other contexts (read-alouds, playground, lunch time) to reinforce concepts.\n- Kindergarteners learn through repetition; repeat these key ideas often.",
