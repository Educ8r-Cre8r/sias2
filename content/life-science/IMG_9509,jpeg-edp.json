  "content": "### Visible Elements in Photo\n- A young seedling with bright green oval-shaped leaves\n- Dark wood chips or mulch surrounding the plant\n- Weathered wood fragments of varying sizes mixed into the mulch\n- Moist soil visible around the plant base\n- A healthy, upright stem supporting multiple leaves\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n- **From seedling in mulch bed**: The plant is in early growth stages and relies on the mulch layer for moisture retention, temperature regulation, and protection from direct soil contact.\n- **From wood chip composition**: Decomposing wood chips create a barrier that shields delicate roots from extreme conditions while providing organic matter as the plant matures.\n- **From plant health despite harsh surroundings**: The mulch system is effectively protecting this seedling, suggesting engineered growing conditions work better than bare soil exposure.\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2: Design a Cozy Home for a Baby Plant**\nBuild a protective bed for a seedling using wood chips, bark pieces, and shredded paper. Your job: create a \"blanket\" around a small plant pot that keeps the soil moist, blocks weeds, and keeps the plant safe. Test it by watering your plant and checking if the soil stays wet longer than a plant without your design.\n\n**3-5: Engineer an Optimal Mulch System for Seedling Protection**\nDesign a mulch layer (using wood chips, straw, shredded paper, and bark) that:\n- Maintains soil moisture for at least 5 days after watering (measured by soil moisture probe or simple visual check)\n- Prevents weeds from competing for space (layer thickness: 2–4 cm)\n- Keeps soil temperature stable (measure morning and afternoon temps with a thermometer)\n- Breaks down slowly enough to last an entire growing season (8–12 weeks)\n\nTest three different mulch combinations (e.g., chips only, chips + straw, chips + shredded paper) on identical seedlings. Measure and compare moisture retention, temperature fluctuation, and weed growth weekly.\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis photo shows a real-world growing system in action. Students should start by observing and asking: *Why is mulch around seedlings? What problems does it solve?* This grounds the engineering task in authentic plant biology rather than jumping to \"build something.\" Observing how nature solves the seedling protection problem naturally leads to designing and testing improvements.\n\n### Suggested Materials\n- Wood chips (mulch from garden centers or landscaping suppliers)\n- Straw or shredded paper\n- Bark pieces or wood fragments\n- Small seedlings or seeds (fast-growing: radish, bean, lettuce)\n- Soil, pots, and watering containers\n- Thermometer and moisture meter (or visual checks)\n- Measuring tape or ruler\n\n### Estimated Time\n**Two to three 40-minute sessions** (or 1–2 weeks if measuring long-term moisture and temperature):\n- Session 1: Observe the photo, ask questions, design mulch combinations (40 min)\n- Session 2: Plant seedlings with different mulch layers, take initial measurements (40 min)\n- Sessions 3+: Weekly observations, data collection, analysis, and redesign (3–5 min per day + 30 min weekly review)\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions**, as students must design and test multiple solutions to the real problem of seedling protection, collecting evidence to determine which engineering approach works best for plant survival.",
