(connection: grass as habitat resource)\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify what animals (cattle) need to live in their habitat (food, water, shelter, space).\n2. Describe the plants and objects found in a pasture habitat that help cows survive.\n3. Compare how different habitats might have different plants and resources for animals.\n4. Observe and record details about the cattle and pasture shown in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by introducing the cattle farm photograph in a way that prompts wonder and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed or projected photograph of cows in the pasture (from the lesson image)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"I See, I Wonder, I Know\" graphic organizer (printed or drawn on board)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or as a large printout. Give students 2-3 minutes to simply look quietly and notice details without talking.\n\n2. **Ask specific discussion questions calibrated to Second Grade:**\n   - \"What animals do you see in this picture? What are they doing?\"\n   - \"What kind of place is this? Do you see grass? Trees? Fences? What else?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the cows are in this open field instead of in a building?\"\n   - \"What do you think the cows need to be happy and healthy here?\"\n\n3. **Use the \"I See, I Wonder, I Know\" chart:** Record student responses on chart paper as follows:\n   - **I See:** Record what students observe (e.g., \"green grass,\" \"cows eating,\" \"fences,\" \"trees\")\n   - **I Wonder:** Record student questions (e.g., \"Why are some cows white and some black?\" \"Where do cows sleep?\" \"Do they drink water from somewhere?\")\n   - **I Know:** Ask what they already know about cows or farms (prior knowledge)\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today, we're going to explore what cows need to live in a place like this meadow. By the end of our lessons, we'll know what makes a good home for cattle!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become scientists and explore a pasture habitat to discover what cows really need to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what a cattle habitat includes through hands-on observation and documentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large paper (one per pair of students)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Photograph of the cow pasture (each pair gets a copy or views it together)\n- \"Habitat Observation Sheet\" (see below—template you create or print)\n- Optional: If outdoors access is available, take students to observe a grassy field or meadow area\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Pasture Habitat Observation (Indoor)**\n\n1. **Divide students into pairs or small groups.** Give each group a copy of the photograph or have them view it together at a document camera/screen.\n\n2. **Provide the \"Habitat Observation Sheet\"** with the following prompts (use pictures + words for Second Grade):\n   - Draw or circle: What plants do you see?\n   - Draw or circle: What animals do you see?\n   - Draw or write: What else is in this habitat? (fences, water, trees, sky)\n   - Color and label: The food the cows eat\n   - Color and label: Where cows might rest or find shelter\n\n3. **Student directions (read aloud clearly):**\n   - \"Look carefully at the photograph. What do the cows need to live here?\"\n   - \"Use your pencil to circle or draw the grass. That's food for the cows!\"\n   - \"Draw a line to the trees. Trees give shade and shelter.\"\n   - \"Mark where you think there might be water for drinking.\"\n   - \"Write or draw one thing you notice that helps the cows live in this habitat.\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:** Circulate between groups and ask prompting questions without giving answers:\n   - \"What do you think that animal is eating?\"\n   - \"Why might those trees be important to the cows?\"\n   - \"Where could the cows get water to drink?\"\n   - \"What keeps the cows safe in this place?\" (pointing to fences if needed)\n\n5. **Documentation:** Each pair completes their observation sheet. Encourage drawing and labeling—writing can be simple or you can scribe for students who struggle.\n\n**Part B: Habitat Needs Sorting (Optional, if time allows)**\n\n- Provide picture cards or simple drawings of: grass, water, fences, trees, barn, sky, cows\n- Students sort items into \"Things cows NEED to live here\" vs. \"Things that are HERE but might not be needed\"\n- This bridges to the Explain phase and surfaces misconceptions\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Completed observation sheets showing what students noticed about the habitat\n- Identification of at least 3 elements: grass (food), shelter/trees, fences, open space\n- Drawings and labels that show connection between habitat features and animal survival\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and clarify habitat concepts, connecting student discoveries to scientific understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with pre-drawn habitat diagram (or create during lesson)\n- Markers\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Picture cards or photos of habitat components (grass, trees, water, fence, cow)\n- Vocabulary cards (with pictures) for Word Wall\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 pairs to hold up or describe their observation sheets.\n   - Ask: \"What did you notice that cows need? What did you draw as food? What helps cows stay safe?\"\n   - Record student responses on chart paper.\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Explanation (8-10 minutes):**\n\n   Present the concept of **habitat** using the photograph and student observations:\n\n   *\"A habitat is a place where an animal lives. It has everything the animal needs to be healthy and safe. Cows live in meadows and pastures. Let's look at what makes a good cow habitat.\"*\n\n   **Create a labeled diagram on chart paper** showing the pasture photograph with labels:\n   - **GRASS** (with arrow) → \"Food for cows. Cows eat grass all day.\"\n   - **TREES** (with arrow) → \"Shelter and shade to keep cool.\"\n   - **FENCES** (with arrow) → \"Keep cows safe and in one place.\"\n   - **OPEN SPACE** (with arrow) → \"Room to walk and move around.\"\n   - **WATER** (with arrow) → \"Cows need water to drink every day.\"\n\n   Use the actual photograph to point to each element: *\"See these trees? They're in our cow picture. See this green grass? That's the food!\"*\n\n3. **Introduce Vocabulary (Key terms with Second Grade-friendly definitions):**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Habitat**: A place where an animal lives that has everything it needs (food, water, shelter, space)\n   - **Pasture** or **Meadow**: A big open field with grass where cows and other farm animals live\n   - **Herbivore**: An animal that eats only plants (cows are herbivores)\n   - **Shelter**: A place that keeps an animal safe and comfortable (trees, barns, shade)\n   - **Diversity**: Different kinds or types (we see cows of different colors—that's diversity)\n\n   *Create a Word Wall or class poster with pictures + words for each term.*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if a cow's pasture had no grass?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why are the trees important in this habitat?\"\n   - Ask: \"Can you point to something in this picture that keeps cows safe?\"\n   - Listen for responses that show students understand habitat needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name 3-4 things a cow needs in its habitat\n- Students understand that a habitat must include food, water, shelter, and space\n- Students can point to parts of the photograph and explain their function for cows\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply habitat concepts to new scenarios and deepen understanding through comparison and design.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or simple drawings of different habitats (desert, forest, ocean, arctic, farm pasture)\n- Paper divided into two columns\n- Colored pencils/markers\n- \"Design a Cow Habitat\" worksheet (optional)\n\n**Activity:** (Choose one or both)\n\n**Option A: Habitat Comparison (Recommended for deeper learning)**\n\n1. **Show students pictures of different habitats:** a desert, a rainforest, an arctic region, and the farm pasture from our lesson.\n\n2. **Ask comparison questions:**\n   - \"Could cows live in the desert? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What would cows need if they lived in a cold, snowy place?\"\n   - \"How is the farm pasture different from the forest? What's the same?\"\n\n3. **Create a comparison chart:**\n\n   | **Pasture (Cow Home)** | **Desert** | **Forest** |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | Green grass (food) | Dry, little grass | Lots of trees, shade |\n   | Open space | Hot, dry | Wet, shady |\n   | Rain/water | Very little water | Lots of water |\n\n4. **Discuss:** \"Cows are adapted to live in pastures with lots of grass and open space. Different animals live in different habitats because they need different things.\"\n\n**Option B: Design a Cow Habitat**\n\n1. Provide students with a large blank paper divided into sections.\n\n2. **Prompt:** \"We're going to design the BEST habitat for a cow. Draw or label these parts:\"\n   - A food source (grass)\n   - Water\n   - Shelter (trees or a barn)\n   - Safe fences\n   - Open space to move\n\n3. Students design and label their own ideal cow pasture, applying what they learned.\n\n4. **Share:** Students present their designs and explain why they included each element.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion with prompts: \"How is your habitat like the one in the picture?\"\n- Ask: \"Would a cow be happy here? Why?\"\n- Push thinking: \"What would happen if we removed the trees/water/grass?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can compare habitats and explain why cows fit in pastures\n- Students can justify why habitats need specific features\n- Students produce a design or comparison that shows understanding of habitat requirements\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students have met learning objectives through formative and summative assessment.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **Observe** during Explore: Are students identifying habitat features correctly?\n- **Listen** during group discussions: Do students use vocabulary appropriately?\n- **Review** observation sheets: Do drawings and labels show understanding?\n- **Ask** during Explain: Can students answer questions about habitat needs?\n\n**Summative Assessment Options:** (Choose one or both)\n\n**Option A: Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (picture + words):\n\n*Draw or write answers to these questions:*\n1. **\"Draw one thing a cow eats in its pasture.\"**\n   - Success: Student draws grass or plants\n2. **\"Why do cows need trees in their habitat?\"**\n   - Success: Student writes or says \"shade,\" \"shelter,\" or \"keeps them cool\"\n3. **\"What do cows drink?\"**\n   - Success: Student writes or says \"water\"\n4. **\"Is the pasture a good home for cows? Why?\"**\n   - Success: Student says \"yes\" and gives at least one reason (has food, water, shelter, space, etc.)\n\n**Option B: Habitat Observation Assessment**\n\nShow students a **new picture of a different animal habitat** (e.g., a bird in a tree, fish in water, rabbit in a burrow):\n\n**Ask:**\n- \"What does this animal need to live here?\"\n- \"Can you label: food, shelter, water, and space?\"\n- \"Is this a good habitat? Why?\"\n\n*Success Criteria:* Students identify at least 2-3 habitat needs and explain reasoning.\n\n**Success Criteria for Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Evidence of Success |\n|---|---|\n| Identify what cattle need in habitat | Student labels or names: food, water, shelter, space |\n| Describe pasture habitat features | Student describes grass as food, trees as shelter, fences as protection |\n| Compare habitats | Student explains why cows fit in pastures but not deserts (or gives similar comparison) |\n| Observe and record details | Student's observation sheet includes labeled drawings of at least 3 habitat features |\n\n**How to Determine if Objectives Were Met:**\n- 80%+ of class correctly answers 3-4 exit ticket questions\n- Student drawings/labels show clear connection between habitat feature and animal need\n- Students use vocabulary (habitat, pasture, shelter, herbivore) accurately in discussions\n- Students can explain (in their own words) why a place is a good or bad home for cows\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:**\n   - Provide a sheet with **pictures only** of habitat items (grass, trees, water, fence, cow)\n   - Students circle or point to items instead of drawing\n   - You or a peer scribe write their explanations\n\n2. **Vocabulary Support:**\n   - Pre-teach vocabulary words with picture cards before the lesson\n   - Display a Word Wall with pictures + words + simple definitions throughout the lesson\n   - Pair student with a strong language model during Explore\n\n3. **Guided Questions:**\n   - Ask yes/no or either/or questions instead of open-ended: \"Do cows eat grass or leaves?\" \"Do trees help cows stay cool?\"\n   - Provide sentence starters: \"Cows need _____ to _____.\"\n   - Read observation sheet prompts aloud; scribe responses\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deeper Habitat Analysis:**\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if this pasture got NO rain for a month? How would it change? What would the cows do?\"\n   - Have students research and present on different farm animals and how their habitats are different from cows (horses, chickens, pigs)\n\n2. **Real-World Application:**\n   - Provide photos of farms from different regions (mountains, plains, tropical areas)\n   - Ask: \"How would a cow farm look different in the mountains vs. the desert? What would farmers need to do?\"\n   - Create a \"Habitat Design Challenge\": \"Design a cow pasture for a place you know (your neighborhood, city, state)\"\n\n3. **Comparative Ecosystems:**\n   - Have students research where wild cattle (bison, water buffalo) live and compare to farm cows\n   - Create a Venn diagram: **Wild Habitats** vs. **Farm Habitats** — what's similar? different?\n   - Write a simple 2-3 sentence explanation of how animal habitats are specially designed for that animal\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Field Observation (if possible):**\n   - Take students to a local farm, petting zoo, or meadow to observe grazing animals in real habitats\n   - Have students complete an observation sheet in the field, drawing and labeling real habitat features\n   - Compare field observations to the photograph from the lesson\n\n2. **Cow Habitat Diorama:**\n   - Provide students with a shoebox or paper bag\n   - Students build a small 3D model of a cow pasture using:\n     - Green paper or real grass (food)\n     - Popsicle sticks or drawn trees (shelter)\n     - Drawn water bowl or blue paper (water)\n     - Plastic cow figurine or drawn cow\n   - Display dioramas and have students explain each habitat component to a partner\n\n3. **\"All About Cows\" Research Booklet:**\n   - Over the next week, assign short research on cow facts (what they eat, how long they live, what they produce, different breeds)\n   - Students create a simple 4-page booklet:\n     - Page 1: \"My Cow Habitat\" (drawing from Elaborate phase)\n     - Page 2: \"What Cows Eat\" (herbivore facts)\n     - Page 3: \"Cow Babies and Families\" (life cycle basics)\n     - Page 4: \"Why Cows Need Habitats\" (reflective writing: one sentence per habitat need)\n   - Share booklets with the class or take home\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Success\n\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Use the same terms (habitat, pasture, shelter, herbivore) consistently throughout all five phases so language sticks.\n- **Real connection:** Reference the actual photograph repeatedly — students learn best when they see the concrete image tied to abstract ideas.\n- **Scaffolding:** Second graders benefit from teacher-led discussions, not just independent discovery. Balance exploration with clear explanation.\n- **Diverse learners:** Adjust task complexity but keep the core concept the same for all students (e.g., all students identify habitat needs; some label them, others explain them).\n- **Follow-up:** This lesson is a springboard for further life science study: animal life cycles, food chains (who eats grass? who might eat cows?), and habitats of other farm or wild animals.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly connects to observable features in the photograph (grass, trees, fences, cattle diversity, open pasture) while building Second Grade understanding of habitats as places with specific features that animals need to survive. It's ready to teach!",
