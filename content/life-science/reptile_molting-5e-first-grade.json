Identify and name external body parts of a lizard and explain how each part helps the animal survive.\n2. Observe and describe how an animal's body features help it live in its habitat.\n3. Explain that animals grow and change over time, and that young animals have some features like their parents but also have differences.\n4. Use body movements and materials to design a way to solve a problem (like catching food or moving through a plant) by copying how a lizard uses its body.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal body parts using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the lizard on a leaf (photograph provided)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: live lizard or lizard video clip (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\nDisplay the photograph of the lizard on a bright green leaf. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\nAsk these discussion questions:\n\n1. **\"What do you see in this picture? What animal is this, and where is it?\"** (Accept all answers; clarify it's a lizard on a leaf/plant.)\n2. **\"Look carefully at the lizard's body. What parts do you notice? Point to the head, legs, tail, eyes on the picture.\"** (Prompt them to identify external parts.)\n3. **\"Why do you think this lizard is sitting on a green leaf? Do you think it wants to hide or be seen? Why?\"** (Guide students to notice the colors match—camouflage concept without using the term yet.)\n4. **\"What would happen if this lizard needed to run away from something scary? What parts of its body would help it move fast?\"** (Students think about legs, tail for balance.)\n\nCreate a class \"wonder wall\" on chart paper. Ask: **\"What do you wonder about how this lizard uses its body to live?\"** Record student questions (e.g., \"Why does it have such a long tail?\" \"Can it climb?\" \"Does it grow bigger?\").\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore how lizards use their bodies to survive and grow. We're going to move like lizards and learn about their amazing body parts!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate animal body parts and movement through hands-on exploration and mimicry.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Print-outs or laminated images of a lizard (one per pair of students, or displayed on screen)\n- Large open floor space or gym (or use desks pushed to side)\n- Chart paper with labeled diagram of lizard body parts (head, eye, legs, claws, tail, scales)\n- Optional: craft supplies (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Lizard Movement Exploration (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Show students the photograph again and ask: \"How do you think a lizard moves?\"\n2. Demonstrate slow, deliberate lizard movements: low crawl using arms and legs, slight tail wiggle, head turning to look around.\n3. Give students clear directions: **\"I'm going to count to 10. During that time, move around the space like a lizard. Use your arms and legs. Keep your body low. When I clap, freeze like a lizard that sees danger.\"**\n4. Repeat this 2-3 times, varying the challenge: \"Now move toward an imaginary insect to catch. Use your eyes and head to find it. Now climb up an imaginary plant like this lizard!\"\n5. After movement, gather students and ask: **\"Which body parts helped you move like a lizard? What did you do with your legs? Your head?\"** Record answers.\n\n**Part B: Observing Lizard Body Parts (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Display a large, labeled diagram or projected image of the lizard. Provide each pair of students with a small copy or have them gather close to one screen image.\n2. Point to each body part and name it: **head, eye, scales (bumpy skin), legs with claws, tail.**\n3. Ask students to find each part on the picture and describe what they see:\n   - \"Find the lizard's eye. What color is it? What might the lizard see with its eye?\"\n   - \"Look at the legs. How many legs does a lizard have? Feel your own legs—lizards have legs like we do!\"\n   - \"See the long tail? If you had a tail, what would you use it for?\" (Balance, moving, defense—don't give answer; let them hypothesize.)\n   - \"The scales are like little bumps all over its body. They protect the lizard's skin, kind of like how your clothes protect your skin.\"\n4. Have students trace the outline of a simple lizard shape on paper or whiteboard, labeling the main parts with teacher support.\n\n**Teacher Role:** Facilitate by asking open-ended questions, redirecting attention to details in the image, and recording observations without correcting or leading too much. Use \"I notice...\" statements: \"I notice this lizard's colors are brown and white—what could that mean?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students can identify and point to: head, eyes, legs, claws, tail, scales. Students can verbally explain that legs help with movement, eyes help with seeing, and tail helps with balance or movement.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts; connect exploration to survival and growth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled lizard diagram\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures and words\n- Photograph of the lizard (displayed again)\n- Picture book with simple text about lizards (optional: *National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Animals* or similar age-appropriate text)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\n\n1. Ask students to share what they discovered during the movement and observation activities. Use a \"talking piece\" (object passed around) so each student gets a turn to say one thing they noticed about lizards.\n2. Record key observations on chart paper: \"Legs help them climb and run,\" \"Eyes help them see food,\" \"Tails help them balance,\" \"Scales protect their skin.\"\n\n**Key Vocabulary Instruction:**\n\nIntroduce these terms using the image and demonstrations:\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **External body parts** | The parts of an animal's body you can see on the outside, like legs, head, tail, and eyes. |\n| **Scales** | Tiny, bumpy pieces of hard skin that cover a reptile's body to keep it safe. |\n| **Claws** | Sharp nails on an animal's feet that help it grip and climb. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives, like on plants, in trees, or on the ground. |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy by using your body parts to find food, stay safe, and stay comfortable. |\n| **Camouflage** | When an animal's color or pattern matches where it lives, so it's hard to see. This lizard is brown and white like the leaf. |\n\n**Connecting to the Photograph and Explore Activity:**\n\n- \"Remember when we moved like lizards? We used our legs and stayed low, just like real lizards do. Lizards' legs help them survive because they can run fast from danger and climb up plants to find food.\"\n- \"The lizard in this picture has four legs with claws. The claws grip the leaf so the lizard doesn't fall. How did you use your hands and feet when you climbed the imaginary plant?\"\n- \"This lizard's brown and white coloring looks like the leaf it's on. This is called camouflage. It helps the lizard hide from animals that might want to eat it!\"\n- \"We also talked about the tail. Lizards use their tails for balance when they climb, and sometimes their tails help them move fast.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n\nAsk students these questions and listen for evidence they understand:\n- \"Show me with your body where a lizard's legs are. What do legs help an animal do?\"\n- \"Why does a lizard need claws on its feet?\"\n- \"Can you see the lizard easily in this picture? Why or why not?\" (Guide them to notice the colors match.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students can define external body parts; use vocabulary terms (scales, claws, habitat, survive, camouflage) in simple sentences; and explain that one body part can help an animal survive in more than one way.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by designing a solution to a problem using animal-inspired body ideas.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards showing human problems (e.g., \"How can we climb a tall tree?\" \"How can we hold something tight?\" \"How can we stay hidden?\")\n- Craft materials: string, paper, tape, plastic cups, building blocks, fabric scraps, paper clips\n- Worksheet or drawing paper titled \"How Would a Lizard Help You?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Real-World Problem-Solving with Lizard-Inspired Solutions:**\n\n1. Present a problem: **\"Imagine you need to climb a rope. What body parts would help you? What could you copy from a lizard?\"**\n   - Accept ideas: \"Strong legs!\" \"Claws to grip!\" \"A long tail for balance!\"\n   - Show how: \"Lizards have claws that grip. Maybe we could make a glove with bumpy material to grip better, like claws. Or we could use rope with knots, like claws to hold onto.\"\n\n2. Divide students into small groups (3-4 students). Assign each group one problem:\n   - **Group A:** \"How could you hold onto something slippery without dropping it?\" (Inspired by lizard claws)\n   - **Group B:** \"How could you stay still and hidden so no one finds you?\" (Inspired by lizard camouflage)\n   - **Group C:** \"How could you move fast across a room without falling over?\" (Inspired by lizard legs and tail for balance)\n\n3. Provide craft materials and ask each group to **design or build** a solution using ideas from the lizard:\n   - For Group A: Create a \"gripper tool\" (wrap textured material around a stick or cup)\n   - For Group B: Create a \"hiding outfit\" or pattern that blends with a classroom area\n   - For Group C: Create a balance tool or practice moving while holding something for balance\n\n4. Have each group **show and tell** their design:\n   - \"What body part of the lizard did we copy?\"\n   - \"How does our design help solve the problem?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate among groups, ask guiding questions (\"What part of the lizard could help with this problem?\"), provide materials as needed, and encourage students to physically try their designs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students can create a simple design that mimics a lizard body part; explain which lizard part inspired their solution; and demonstrate how it helps solve a human problem.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal body parts, survival, and mimicry concepts.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n\n- Observe student movement during Engage/Explore phase—can they identify and use body parts like a lizard?\n- Listen to vocabulary use during Explain phase—do students use terms correctly?\n- Ask clarifying questions during Elaborate phase—can they connect lizard body parts to solutions?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes):**\n\nGive each student an **exit ticket** with these three prompts. Students can draw, dictate to teacher, or write with support:\n\n1. **\"Draw or point to a lizard's body part that helps it survive. Tell me one thing that body part does.\"**\n   - Success criterion: Student identifies a body part (leg, tail, eye, claw, scale) and states one function (climb, move, see, grip, protect skin).\n\n2. **\"If you were a lizard, what could your [legs/claws/tail] help you do?\"**\n   - Success criterion: Student provides a plausible action (run, climb, catch food, balance, hide).\n\n3. **\"The lizard in the picture is brown and white. Why does that help the lizard?\"** (Hint: Look at the leaf!)\n   - Success criterion: Student says \"It hides,\" \"It looks like the leaf,\" \"It camouflage,\" or similar.\n\n**Observation Checklist:**\n\nDuring the lesson, note whether each student:\n- ☐ Can name at least three external body parts of a lizard\n- ☐ Can explain how at least one body part helps the lizard survive\n- ☐ Can move like a lizard and identify which parts they used\n- ☐ Can design or suggest a solution using an animal body part as inspiration\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students demonstrate understanding by:\n- Correctly identifying and naming lizard body parts\n- Explaining at least one survival function of a body part\n- Participating in problem-solving inspired by animal features\n- Showing evidence on exit ticket that they can connect animal structures to survival and function\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only the most essential terms (legs, tail, eyes, scales, climb, hide). Avoid camouflage initially; use simpler phrase: \"It looks like the leaf.\"\n2. **Visual aids and movement:** Provide laminated, large-print pictures of lizard body parts that students can touch and label with stickers or pointing. Use exaggerated movement demonstrations so students have clear models to copy.\n3. **Paired exploration:** Pair struggling learners with a stronger partner during Explore phase. Assign a buddy to help point out body parts and repeat vocabulary.\n4. **Provide answer choices:** During exit ticket, offer picture choices or forced-choice questions: \"Does the lizard use its legs to climb or to hear?\" instead of open-ended questions.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research and compare:** Provide picture cards of other reptiles (snake, turtle, crocodile). Ask students: \"How are lizard body parts different from a snake's? What does each animal need its body parts for?\" Students can create a simple comparison chart.\n2. **Deeper problem-solving:** Ask advanced students to design a **multi-part solution** using two or more lizard-inspired features: \"Create a tool that lets you climb AND grip, like a lizard does with legs and claws.\"\n3. **Life cycle extension:** Introduce the concept that young lizards are like their parents but may look a bit different. Show pictures of a baby lizard and adult lizard. Ask: \"How are they the same? How are they different?\" (Connects to 1-LS3-1.)\n4. **Observation journal:** Have advanced students keep a simple \"Lizard Detective Journal\" where they sketch and label body parts and write (or dictate) what each part does.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Create a Classroom Lizard:** As a class, build a large cardboard or papier-mâché lizard. Label all the body parts with words and pictures. Have students take turns placing labels on the correct body parts. Display it in the classroom and use it for future reference.\n\n2. **Lizard Craft and Movement Dance:** Students create a paper or foam lizard puppet with movable legs, tail, and head. Play music and have them move their puppets like real lizards, calling out the body parts as they move: \"Move the legs! Swing the tail! Turn the head!\" This reinforces part names and survival behaviors.\n\n3. **Animal Habitat Hunt:** Take students on a nature walk (outdoors or around school grounds) and search for small animals (insects, spiders, birds). Ask: \"What body parts do you see? How does each animal use its body to survive here?\" Document findings with photos or drawings and create a class book: *\"Bodies That Help Animals Survive.\"*\n\n4. **Read-Aloud and Comparison:** Read a simple picture book about lizards (e.g., *Lizards* by Gail Gibbons or *National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Animals*). Pause to connect text to the photograph, and ask: \"Does this match what we saw in our lizard picture? What did we learn that's new?\"\n\n5. **Parent Letter and Home Activity:** Send home a simple letter asking families to observe an animal together (pet, bird, squirrel, ant) and ask: \"What body parts does this animal have? How do those parts help it live?\" Students bring back drawings or photos to share.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
