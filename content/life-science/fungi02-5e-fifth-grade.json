ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest in fungi as living organisms and activate prior knowledge about decomposition.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of mushrooms on wood chips (one per pair of students, or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: 1–2 fresh mushrooms (store-bought button mushrooms work fine) to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph.** Show the image on a projector or distribute printed copies to pairs. Allow 1–2 minutes of silent observation.\n\n2. **Pose initial curiosity questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice in this picture? What is growing on the wood?\"\n   - \"Are these plants or animals? What clues help you decide?\"\n   - \"Why might these mushrooms be growing right here, in the middle of rotting wood?\"\n   - \"What do you think happens to all the dead leaves and branches in a forest?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen to Earth if nothing broke down dead plants and animals. Where would all the old material go?\" Encourage students to think-pair-share their ideas (30 seconds per person).\n\n4. **Record responses.** Write student ideas on chart paper without correcting them. This becomes the baseline for comparison at the lesson's end.\n\n5. **If using a real mushroom:** Pass one around so students can observe the cap shape, feel the stem texture, and make observations. Ask: \"What is this organism made of? Is it hard like wood or soft like a plant?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore these amazing organisms and discover why they're so important to forests and gardens—and even to us!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposition and the role of fungi through hands-on observation and model-building.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 clear plastic container (small aquarium, storage box, or large jar) per pair or small group\n- Damp wood chips or shredded bark (enough to fill 2 inches of each container)\n- Dead leaves, twigs, or small pieces of wood\n- Water (spray bottle)\n- Optional: mushroom spawn or fungi culture kit (available through educational suppliers; pre-order if possible), OR collected fungi-colonized wood from outside\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Observation sheets (printed template with spaces for drawings, labels, predictions)\n- Pencils and colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up decomposition containers.** In pairs, students:\n   - Fill the container 2 inches deep with damp wood chips\n   - Add dead leaves, small twigs, and bark pieces on top\n   - Lightly mist with water (do not oversaturate)\n   - Cover loosely with plastic wrap (fungi need some air)\n   - Place in a warm, dim location (shelf away from direct sunlight)\n\n2. **If fungi culture is available:** Sprinkle a small amount of mushroom spawn or a piece of fungi-colonized wood onto the top layer.\n\n3. **Create an observation protocol.** Students predict:\n   - \"What do you think will happen to the wood and leaves in this container?\"\n   - \"Do you think anything will grow here? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What conditions do you think decomposers need?\"\n\n4. **Document initial state.** Students draw and label the contents of their container, noting colors, textures, and any visible organisms.\n\n5. **Daily/twice-weekly observations (over 2–4 weeks).** Students:\n   - Mist the container lightly to keep it moist\n   - Observe with hand lens\n   - Record observations: color changes, growth patterns, texture changes, any visible mushrooms or fuzzy growth\n   - Sketch what they see\n   - Predict what is happening underneath the surface\n\n6. **Facilitate without answering directly.**\n   - Ask guiding questions: \"What's changing about the wood? Where do you think that change is coming from? Could something invisible be helping break this down?\"\n   - Avoid labeling the process; let students discover.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Observation sheets with sketches and written notes documenting wood breakdown over time\n- Students notice color changes, softening of wood, appearance of fuzzy growth or mushrooms\n- Growing curiosity about the \"invisible workers\" doing the decomposition\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce fungi vocabulary and formal concepts after students have observed decomposition firsthand.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Labeled diagram of mushroom anatomy (cap, gills, stem, mycelium)\n- Photograph from the lesson (revisited)\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: microscope slides showing fungal spores (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Reconnect to observations.** Ask: \"What did you notice growing in your containers? What was breaking down the wood?\" Accept student language; validate observations.\n\n2. **Introduce fungi formally:**\n   - \"The organisms we observed are called **fungi.** They are living things, but they are not plants or animals—they are their own group!\"\n   - Display the labeled mushroom diagram. Identify visible structures in the photograph: cap, stem.\n   - Explain: \"What you see—the mushroom—is only the 'fruiting body.' Under the soil or inside the wood, there are thin, branching threads called **mycelium** that do most of the work of breaking down dead material.\"\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions:**\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---|\n   | **Fungi** | Living organisms that are not plants or animals; they break down dead organic matter |\n   | **Decomposer** | An organism that breaks down dead plants and animals and returns nutrients to soil |\n   | **Mycelium** | The branching network of threads that make up most of a fungus and do the work of breaking down material |\n   | **Spores** | Tiny seed-like structures that fungi release to create new fungi; they float in air and land on food |\n   | **Nutrient cycle** | The path nutrients take as they move from soil → plants → animals → decomposers → back to soil |\n\n4. **Explain decomposition and the nutrient cycle:**\n   - \"When a tree falls or leaves drop, they have nutrients stored in them—things like nitrogen and phosphorus. If we just left dead stuff lying around forever, plants would run out of nutrients. Fungi are nature's recyclers!\"\n   - Draw a simple cycle on the board:\n     - **Dead wood/leaves** → **Fungi break it down** → **Nutrients released** → **Soil** → **New plants grow**\n   - \"Fungi don't eat food like animals do. Instead, they release special chemicals that break down dead material from the outside, then absorb the nutrients.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Why are decomposers important?\" (They recycle nutrients so plants can grow.)\n   - \"Where is the mycelium in a mushroom?\" (Hidden inside the wood or soil—what we see is just the fruiting body.)\n   - \"How do fungi make more fungi?\" (By releasing spores that spread and grow.)\n\n6. **Connect back to the photograph.**\n   - Point out the mushroom caps. Explain: \"Under each cap are millions of spores ready to be released and spread to new places.\"\n   - Revisit the wood chips in the photo. Ask: \"What's happening to that wood? Fungi are breaking it down.\"\n\n**Vocabulary Summary:** Display the terms on a class chart that stays visible for the remainder of the unit.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain that fungi are decomposers that break down dead material.\n- Students understand that mycelium is hidden but does the real work.\n- Students can describe nutrients cycling through an ecosystem with fungi's help.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by modeling nutrient cycling and exploring fungi in real-world contexts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster paper or digital tool (e.g., Google Slides)\n- Colored markers, colored pencils, or digital drawing tools\n- Index cards with roles (plant, animal, fungi, soil, sun)\n- String or yarn (optional, for creating cycle diagram)\n- Images of forest/garden ecosystems\n- Sample scenarios: \"A fallen tree in a forest,\" \"A compost pile in a garden,\" \"Mushrooms in a lawn after rain\"\n\n**Activity Option A: Nutrient Cycle Model (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Assign roles.** Divide class into small groups (4–5 students). Each student represents a part of the ecosystem: plant, herbivore, fungi (decomposer), soil, sun.\n\n2. **Act out the cycle:**\n   - **Plant** (with sun) grows and uses water/nutrients.\n   - **Herbivore** eats the plant.\n   - When the **herbivore** dies, **fungi** breaks it down.\n   - **Fungi** releases nutrients back to **soil**.\n   - **Soil** (with sun) supports a new **plant** to grow.\n\n3. **Model visually:** Groups create a cycle diagram or poster showing matter moving through these stages. Fungi must be clearly labeled and their role emphasized.\n\n4. **Gallery walk:** Groups display their models. Students observe and note similarities/differences in how they showed fungi's role.\n\n**Activity Option B: Real-World Fungi Scenarios (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Present scenarios:** \n   - \"Scenario 1: A fallen oak tree in a forest. What will happen to it over 5 years?\"\n   - \"Scenario 2: A gardener starts a compost pile with leaves, kitchen scraps, and twigs. Why would mushrooms grow here?\"\n   - \"Scenario 3: After a heavy rain, mushrooms pop up in the lawn overnight. Where did they come from?\"\n\n2. **Small group analysis:** Each group gets one scenario. They discuss and write:\n   - What role fungi play\n   - Why this place is good for fungi\n   - What would happen without fungi\n   - Draw or label their thinking\n\n3. **Share findings.** Groups present; teacher highlights fungi's essential role in each context.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to groups and ask guiding questions: \"Where is the mycelium here? What nutrients are being released? What would happen if fungi didn't exist?\"\n- Encourage students to reference the photograph and their observations from the Explore phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Visual or written model showing fungi's role in nutrient cycling\n- Students can apply understanding to new scenarios (e.g., recognizing fungi's role in compost, fallen logs, or forest floors)\n- Clear evidence that students understand decomposition as essential for ecosystem health\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fungi's role as decomposers and their function in nutrient cycling.\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n\n1. **Observation during Engage:** Note which students ask questions about decomposition and show curiosity; use their responses to gauge prior knowledge.\n\n2. **Exploration observations:** Review student observation sheets. Look for:\n   - Accurate descriptions of changes in wood/leaves over time\n   - Reasonable predictions about what is causing the breakdown\n   - Engagement with the investigation (consistent observations, drawings, notes)\n\n3. **Exit Ticket (administered after Explain/Elaborate, or at end of lesson):**\n\n   Provide each student with an index card. Ask them to answer (in writing or drawing):\n\n   - **Question 1:** \"What is a decomposer? Give an example from our lesson.\"\n   - **Question 2:** \"Draw and label a mushroom. Where is the mycelium, and what is it doing?\"\n   - **Question 3:** \"Why do we need fungi in forests and gardens?\"\n\n**Summative Assessment:**\n\n**\"Fungi in the Ecosystem\" Task (can be completed in class or as homework):**\n\nStudents are given a picture of a forest floor with fallen logs, dead leaves, mushrooms, and living trees. They must:\n\n1. **Label fungi** on the diagram.\n2. **Write 3–4 sentences** explaining:\n   - What the fungi are doing\n   - Why this process is important\n   - What would happen if fungi disappeared\n3. **Draw arrows** showing how nutrients move from dead material back into soil (and to living plants).\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies fungi and their structures (cap, stem).\n- ✓ Student explains decomposition in age-appropriate language.\n- ✓ Student describes nutrient cycling with fungi's role clear.\n- ✓ Student connects fungi to ecosystem health (e.g., \"Without fungi, nutrients would get stuck and new plants couldn't grow\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Exit tickets show 80%+ of students can define a decomposer and identify fungi.\n- Labeled diagrams demonstrate understanding of mushroom anatomy and mycelium location.\n- Written explanations show students grasp fungi's essential role in nutrient cycling and ecosystem function.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary anchor chart:** Create a visual chart with pictures and one-sentence definitions of fungi, decomposer, mycelium, and spores. Students can reference this during all activities.\n\n2. **Guided observation sheets:** Provide sentence starters for the Explore and Elaborate phases:\n   - \"The wood is becoming _____ because _____.\"\n   - \"Fungi is important because _____.\"\n   - Allow drawing instead of writing for expressing ideas.\n\n3. **Pair with stronger reader/observer:** Assign a peer buddy for the Explore investigation who can help read instructions and discuss observations.\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Offer multiple-choice or matching options instead of open-ended questions (e.g., \"Circle the decomposer: plant / fungus / animal\").\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deep dive into mycelium:** Research and present on how mycelium communicates through the \"wood-wide web\" or how fungi form symbiotic relationships with plants (mycorrhizae). Create a visual explanation for the class.\n\n2. **Experimental design:** Challenge students to design a controlled experiment to test which conditions fungi prefer (e.g., light vs. dark, wet vs. dry, warm vs. cool). Have them predict outcomes and explain why.\n\n3. **Nutrient tracing:** Provide a complex ecosystem scenario (e.g., \"A dead deer in a forest near a lake\") and ask students to trace specific nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon) through multiple decomposition pathways, showing fungi's role at each step.\n\n4. **Real-world application:** Have students research mushroom farming or commercial composting and explain why fungi are crucial. Create a poster or short video explaining these processes to younger students.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Mushroom identification walk:** If fungi are growing near the school, take a supervised outdoor observation walk. Students photograph or sketch fungi in natural habitats and research their names/roles. Create a \"Fungi Field Guide\" for your classroom or schoolyard.\n\n2. **Grow your own fungi:** Use a mushroom growing kit (readily available online) or inoculate a log with oyster mushroom spawn. Students care for it over 4–6 weeks, observing mycelium growth and fruiting. Document the process with photos and create a time-lapse presentation.\n\n3. **Decomposition comparison:** Set up multiple containers with different materials (leaves only, wood only, mixed wood and leaves, with and without fungi inoculant). Observe over 8–12 weeks to compare decomposition rates. Graph results and discuss variables affecting breakdown speed.\n\n4. **Literature connection:** Read age-appropriate books about fungi (e.g., *Mushrooms* by Joan Holub or sections from *National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Bugs*). Discuss fungi in stories; illustrate the nutrient cycle as described in the text.\n\n5. **Compost class project:** Start a classroom compost bin. Monitor fungal growth and decomposition. Calculate how much waste is diverted from the landfill and explain fungi's role in making compost \"black gold\" for gardens.\n\n6. **Connect to climate:** Research and discuss how fungi in soil help plants grow better, which means more carbon dioxide absorption from the air. Create a brief explanation of fungi's role in climate health.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Timing:** The Explore phase (container observations) requires 2–4 weeks of repeated observations. Plan this lesson over an extended unit, not in a single class period. Front-load the containers 1–2 weeks before the formal lesson if possible.\n- **Real fungi:** The lesson is most powerful if students observe actual fungal growth. If mushroom spawn or fungi-colonized wood is unavailable, the outdoor observation walk or purchased mushroom kit become essential.\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wash hands after handling decomposing material and do not taste or smell mushrooms without guidance. Use gloves if students have sensitive skin.\n- **Accessibility:** The 5E sequence is visual and kinesthetic, supporting diverse learners. Provide vocabulary in multiple languages if your classroom is multilingual.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly uses the photograph to anchor student thinking about decomposition, nutrient cycling, and fungi's essential ecosystem role while maintaining full alignment with NGSS 5-LS2-1.**",
