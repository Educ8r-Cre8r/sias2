ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about unusual living organisms by examining the striking photograph of fungi.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph (fungi04.jpeg) or digital display on smart board/tablet\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Students' observation journals or notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or print it in color, projected or held up so all students can see clearly. Say: *\"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see? This is something alive growing in nature. What do you think it is?\"*\n\n2. **Ask discovery questions (one at a time, wait for responses):**\n   - \"What color is this living thing? Why do you think it's so bright pink?\"\n   - \"What does it feel like when you touch it? Is it hard like a rock or soft like a sponge?\" (Students observe the image; validate both predictions.)\n   - \"Where is it growing? What do you see underneath it?\" (Guide them to notice the dark, dead wood and soil.)\n   - \"Do you think this is a plant? An animal? What else could it be?\" (Accept all thinking; validate curiosity.)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Write on chart paper: *\"I wonder... what IS this pink squishy thing? How does it grow? Why does it like dark, wet places?\"* Read aloud and invite students to repeat or add their own wonder.\n\n4. **Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to discover what this mystery organism is and learn why it's so important to our world. Let's explore!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposition and organism needs through hands-on material exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small clear containers or zip-lock bags (1 per student pair, or 4-5 for class demo)\n- Soil or potting mix\n- Dead leaves, torn paper, small sticks, bark pieces (from outside)\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Damp cotton balls or wet paper towels\n- Optional: small magnifying glasses\n- Observation recording sheets (pictures with labels for students to draw/color)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup:** Before the lesson, prepare 4-5 small containers:\n   - Container A: Soil + dry dead leaves (no water) — left in open light\n   - Container B: Soil + dead leaves + water mist — sealed or covered loosely, kept in dim corner\n   - Container C: Soil only (no leaves) + water + sealed, dim light\n   - Container D: Dead leaves + water + sealed, dark location (in cabinet if possible)\n   Keep these containers from the lesson start, or prepare them during this phase.\n\n2. **Introduce the investigation:** *\"We're going to create small homes and see what happens to dead stuff over time. Fungi love certain conditions. Let's test what they need!\"*\n\n3. **Student directions (model each step):**\n   - Pair students up. Assign each pair or small group one container condition to observe today.\n   - Students examine their container with magnifying glasses (if available).\n   - They draw and color what they see on their observation sheet: *Is it wet or dry? Is it dark or light? Do you see any changes?*\n   - Spray water gently on Container B together (supervised).\n   - Discuss: *\"Which containers feel damp? Which are dry? Fungi like moisture—which homes do you think fungi will choose?\"*\n\n4. **What students should record:**\n   - Simple drawings of their container\n   - Color in whether the container is **wet** (blue) or **dry** (yellow)\n   - Color in whether it's **dark** (black) or **light** (orange)\n   - Circle: *\"I think fungi will grow here. Yes / Maybe / No\"*\n\n5. **Teacher role:**\n   - Do NOT tell students decomposition happens yet.\n   - Ask guiding questions: *\"What does this dead leaf need to break down? Is it wet? Is it dark? Would YOU want to live here?\"*\n   - Listen to predictions without correcting; validate scientific thinking.\n   - Observe which students notice moisture and darkness; note for the Explain phase.\n\n6. **Expected outcomes:**\n   - Students will observe and compare different conditions (wet/dry, light/dark).\n   - Students will make predictions about which environment fungi prefer.\n   - Containers are prepared and will show real growth/changes over the next 1-2 weeks, creating anticipation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce fungi as decomposers and explain why they need specific conditions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph (fungi04.jpeg) \n- Real or high-quality pictures of different fungi (optional: mushrooms, shelf fungi, mold if age-appropriate—kept brief and non-threatening)\n- Word cards with vocabulary\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather in circle with photograph visible. Ask:\n   - *\"What did we find in the containers that were wet AND dark?\"* (Lead to: \"These are the best homes!\")\n   - *\"Why do you think the squishy pink thing in the photo likes wet, dark places under the wood?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce fungi formally:**\n   - *\"The pink squishy things in the photo are called FUNGI. They are living things, but they're not plants and not animals. They're special!\"*\n   - Point to the wood in the photo: *\"See how the wood is dark and breaking apart? Fungi EAT dead wood. They help break it into tiny pieces so it goes back into the soil.\"*\n   - *\"Fungi are nature's helpers! They're decomposers.\"*\n\n3. **Teach vocabulary with student-friendly definitions:**\n\n| **Term** | **First Grade Definition** |\n|----------|---------------------------|\n| **Fungi** | Living things that eat dead plants and wood; they like dark, wet places. |\n| **Decomposer** | A living thing that breaks down dead stuff and turns it into soil. |\n| **Habitat** | A home where a living thing likes to live; it has the air, water, and food it needs. |\n| **Moisture** | Wetness; water in the air or soil. |\n| **Breaks down** | Takes something big and turns it into smaller pieces. |\n\n4. **Connect to photograph:**\n   - *\"This pink squishy fungi is eating the dead wood. It's breaking it into teeny pieces. Soon, that wood will be part of the soil again. That's amazing!\"*\n   - *\"The fungi's favorite habitat is: dark, wet, with lots of dead stuff to eat. Just like our containers!\"*\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show the photograph again. Ask: *\"Is fungi alive or not alive? Is it a plant or an animal or something else? What does fungi eat? Where does it like to live?\"*\n   - Provide sentence frames: *\"Fungi eat _____. Fungi like _____ (wet/dark) places.\"*\n   - Listen for student responses; correct gently and affirm partial understanding.\n\n6. **Expected outcomes:**\n   - Students can label fungi as a living organism (not a plant, not an animal).\n   - Students understand fungi break down dead things.\n   - Students can identify two conditions fungi need: moisture and darkness.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of fungal habitats by designing an ideal home for fungi.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or poster board (1 per small group, or whole class)\n- Markers, colored pencils, crayons\n- Magazines for cutting images (optional)\n- Pre-drawn outline of a container/terrarium/box (template provided or drawn by teacher)\n- Small objects (sticks, leaves, cotton balls for \"water,\" black paper) for collage\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the design challenge:** *\"Now that we know what fungi NEED to survive, let's design the PERFECT fungi home! We're going to draw or build a habitat that has everything fungi loves.\"*\n\n2. **Design specifications (write on board/chart):**\n   - Is it **wet or dry**? (Fungi want: WET)\n   - Is it **dark or bright**? (Fungi want: DARK)\n   - What **dead stuff** does it have to eat? (Fungi want: dead wood, leaves, soil)\n   - Is it **safe**? (No chemicals, right temperature)\n\n3. **Student directions:**\n   - In small groups (or as a whole class collaborative poster):\n   - Draw or label a container showing a fungi habitat.\n   - Color or draw: **Dark soil at the bottom** (use brown/black markers)\n   - **Dead wood or leaves** inside (draw or glue torn paper, stick pieces)\n   - **Water/moisture** (draw droplets or use blue markers; use a cotton ball for dampness)\n   - **Label each part** with help from teacher or labels provided.\n   - Write or dictate: *\"This is a good home for fungi because...\"*\n\n4. **Teacher role:**\n   - Circulate with guiding questions: *\"Is this dark enough? Will it be wet? What will the fungi eat here?\"*\n   - Provide sentence starters: *\"Fungi will like this because it is _____ and _____.\"*\n   - Help with labeling but encourage student thinking about placement and conditions.\n\n5. **Gallery walk (if time allows):**\n   - Post designs around room. Students do a quick walk to see other fungi homes.\n   - Ask: *\"Which home do you think fungi would like best? Why?\"*\n\n6. **Expected outcomes:**\n   - Students create a visual representation of a fungal habitat with 2-3 key conditions labeled.\n   - Students can articulate WHY each condition matters for fungi survival.\n   - Demonstrates transfer of knowledge to a new context (designing, not just observing).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fungi as decomposers and their habitat needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative assessment (during lesson):**\n   - **Observe during Explore:** Which students noticed moisture and darkness? Did they make predictions?\n   - **Listen during Explain:** Can students answer: \"What is fungi?\" \"What does it eat?\" \"Where does it live?\"\n   - **Watch during Elaborate:** Are students identifying 2+ habitat conditions in their designs?\n\n2. **Exit ticket (end of lesson — choose one format based on class ability):**\n\n   **Option A (Drawing + Label):** Show photograph again. Students draw fungi and label:\n   - One thing fungi eats (dead wood, leaves, etc.)\n   - One place fungi likes (dark, wet, soil, etc.)\n\n   **Option B (Picture choices):** Ask questions with picture choices:\n   - *\"Fungi is a ___. (Show: plant / animal / special living thing)\" — Circle your choice.*\n   - *\"Fungi likes ___ places. (Show: bright & dry / dark & wet)\" — Circle your choice.*\n   - *\"Fungi eats ___. (Show: rocks / dead wood / sunshine)\" — Circle your choice.*\n\n   **Option C (Sentence frame — teacher scribes or students copy):**\n   - *\"Fungi is alive because ___.\"*\n   - *\"Fungi is different from plants because ___.\"*\n   - *\"Fungi helps nature by ___.\"*\n\n3. **Success criteria:**\n   - Students identify fungi as a living organism (not a plant, not an animal).\n   - Students name at least ONE thing fungi eats (dead wood, leaves, etc.).\n   - Students identify at least ONE habitat condition fungi needs (dark OR wet).\n   - Students show understanding that fungi has a job/purpose (breaks down dead things, returns to soil).\n\n4. **Expected outcomes:**\n   - Most students will identify fungi correctly and name one habitat need.\n   - Students will show emerging understanding of decomposition (that fungi breaks down dead things).\n   - Students will connect fungi to the photograph and containers.\n   - Over 1-2 weeks, actual fungi growth in the moist, dark containers will reinforce learning.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use **\"squishy helpers\"** and **\"eaters of dead stuff\"** alongside formal terms. Repeat these phrases frequently. Avoid multi-step explanations; break into 1-2 idea chunks.\n\n2. **Visual supports:** Provide picture cards showing fungi, dead wood, moisture (water droplet), and darkness (dark circle). Point to cards when explaining; let students match pictures to ideas.\n\n3. **Reduce choices:** During design activity, provide a template container (already drawn) and pre-cut images/paper pieces for moisture and dead wood. Students glue rather than draw. Ask yes/no questions: *\"Does fungi like water? Yes or no?\"*\n\n4. **Pair support:** Assign struggling learners to work with a peer who can model thinking. Provide sentence frame cards they can point to during discussions.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Deeper decomposition thinking:** Ask: *\"What happens to fungi after it eats all the dead wood? Where does the fungi go? What does it become?\"* Introduce: *\"Fungi breaks things down into nutrients that feed new plants!\"* Students draw or explain the cycle.\n\n2. **Habitat design with variables:** Challenge students to design TWO fungi homes (wet + dark vs. wet + bright, or dark + dry vs. dark + wet). Ask: *\"Which home will fungi choose? Why? What happens if we change one thing?\"* Students compare and predict.\n\n3. **Fungi observation journal:** Over 1-2 weeks, have advanced students check containers daily, draw detailed observations, and record changes (growth, color, texture). Ask: *\"Can you see the fungi breaking down the wood? How do you know?\"*\n\n4. **Real-world application:** Ask: *\"Where in nature do you see fungi growing? Why do they like that place? Is it helping or hurting the forest?\"* Students can bring photos from home or go on a nature walk to find fungi (teacher-supervised) and document habitat conditions.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fungi hunt (after 1-2 weeks):** Take students on a short nature walk or outdoor exploration (yard, park, shaded area). Look for real fungi (mushrooms, shelf fungi on logs, mold on decaying leaves). Ask: *\"Can you find fungi? What is it growing on? Is the place dark? Wet? Why did fungi choose this spot?\"* Take photos or draw observations. Return to classroom and compare to their designed habitat. Did they predict correctly?\n\n2. **Decomposition time-lapse project:** Set up the containers as a class science display. Over 2-4 weeks, have students observe and draw weekly changes. Create a \"Before and After\" bulletin board showing how fungi breaks down dead wood into smaller and smaller pieces. Students can write or dictate: *\"Week 1: We saw a whole leaf. Week 3: The leaf is crumbly!\"* This concretely demonstrates decomposition.\n\n3. **Soil and growth connection:** Once containers show fungi growth or decomposed material, use that soil to plant seeds (bean or fast-growing plant seeds). Discuss: *\"Fungi broke down the dead wood. Now the soil has nutrients. Our plant food is here because fungi did its job!\"* Students observe plant growth over weeks and connect fungi → nutrient-rich soil → plant growth. This shows the full role of decomposers in ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson can easily be split: Engage + Explore in one 45-min session, Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate in a second session (or the next day).\n- **Real fungi growth:** The containers you set up will likely show visible growth or changes in 1-2 weeks, especially if kept in a dark, warm place. This creates powerful real-world evidence of fungi and decomposition. Store containers in a cabinet or dark corner of the classroom.\n- **Safety note:** Do not let students handle wild fungi or mold without gloves. Keep classroom-grown fungi in sealed containers. This is a viewing activity, not a touching activity.\n- **Sensitivity:** Some students may find fungi \"gross\" or \"icky.\" Reframe: *\"Fungi are nature's clean-up crew. They're helpers!\"* Use positive language and emphasize their important job.\n- **Family connection:** Send home a note inviting families to look for fungi at home (under logs, in plant pots, dark corners of basements) and photograph them. Students can bring pictures and share where fungi was found and why.",
