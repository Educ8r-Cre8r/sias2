ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the pelican (provided photograph)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Short video clip (1-2 minutes) of a pelican diving or fishing (YouTube has age-appropriate options)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the pelican image on a screen or pass around a printed copy. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about this bird's body? What parts look different from birds you see every day?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this bird lives, and what clues in the photo tell you that?\"\n   - \"That long beak is huge! What do you think the pelican uses it for?\"\n   - \"How do you think a pelican gets food? What would be hard about living in the water?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:**\n   - \"I wonder: What special features does a pelican have that help it survive in the water? Let's find out together.\"\n\n4. **Record Prior Knowledge:** On chart paper, create a two-column chart: \"What We Know About Pelicans\" and \"What We Want to Learn.\" Capture student responses (accept all ideas—misconceptions will be addressed in Explain phase).\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate how animals like pelicans are perfectly designed to live in water habitats. Let's explore what makes them such great swimmers and hunters!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Ziplock bags (gallon size, 4-5 bags)\n- Water (room temperature, in containers or sink access)\n- Various objects to simulate pelican body features:\n  - Feathers (real or craft feathers)\n  - Aluminum foil (to simulate waterproof layer)\n  - Sponges (to show water absorption)\n  - Paper towels (to show water absorption)\n  - Long straws or chopsticks (to simulate beak)\n  - Cotton gloves or rubber gloves (to simulate webbed feet/water resistance)\n- Observation recording sheets (one per student)\n- Markers and colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize Into Investigation Stations:** Divide the class into 4-5 small groups. Each group rotates through stations over 20-25 minutes (5 minutes per station).\n\n2. **Station 1 – Waterproof vs. Non-Waterproof Materials:**\n   - Students place various materials in a ziplock bag filled with water.\n   - They observe which materials stay dry inside and which get wet.\n   - **Recording:** Sketch or write which materials repel (keep out) water like a pelican's feathers do.\n\n3. **Station 2 – Beak Function:**\n   - Students use a straw or chopstick to pick up small objects (cereal, beads, foam pieces) from a shallow pan of water.\n   - They try different techniques: scooping, stabbing, filtering.\n   - **Recording:** Draw or describe which beak shape works best for catching fish. Why might a long, pointed beak be useful?\n\n4. **Station 3 – Floating and Buoyancy:**\n   - Students place craft feathers, sponges, and other materials in water to observe what floats.\n   - They discuss why floating ability helps a pelican.\n   - **Recording:** List materials that float and explain why a swimming bird needs to float.\n\n5. **Station 4 – Body Shape for Movement:**\n   - Students experiment with streamlined vs. bulky shapes using clay or playdough in water.\n   - They observe which shape moves more easily through water.\n   - **Recording:** Draw the shape that moves best through water and explain why.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What did you notice? Why do you think that happened? How does this relate to the pelican?\"\n- Avoid telling students what to conclude; instead, ask them to observe and describe.\n- Provide sentence starters on observation sheets: \"I noticed that _____. This helps the pelican because _____.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should discover that waterproof materials don't absorb water.\n- Students should find that certain beak shapes are more effective at catching objects from water.\n- Students should observe that buoyant materials help organisms float.\n- Students should recognize that streamlined shapes move easily through water.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pelican photograph (displayed again)\n- Pre-made vocabulary cards or poster (optional)\n- Teacher-prepared diagram of a pelican with labeled adaptations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 1-2 students from each station to share one discovery: \"What did you learn about water at your station?\"\n   - Create a class list of observations on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Use the pelican photograph to point out each adaptation as you define terms.\n   - Write definitions on chart paper using student-friendly language.\n\n3. **Make Connections:**\n   - \"You discovered that feathers don't get wet when they're covered with special oil. Pelicans have feathers just like this!\"\n   - \"You found that a long, pointed stick works better to catch things from water. A pelican's beak is shaped exactly like that!\"\n   - \"You noticed that floating materials help you stay on top of water. Pelicans float so they can rest between dives!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Show the pelican photo and ask: \"Point to one adaptation you learned about today. Why does the pelican need that feature?\"\n   - Use a \"Fist-to-Five\" hand signal (5 fingers = I understand completely; fist = I'm confused) to gauge understanding.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal live and survive in its habitat. |\n| **Waterproof** | When something doesn't let water pass through it; water slides off instead of soaking in. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. |\n| **Predator** | An animal that hunts and eats other animals for food. |\n| **Buoyant/Buoyancy** | The ability to float on water; being light enough to stay on top of water. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least 2-3 pelican adaptations.\n- Students can explain why each adaptation helps the pelican survive in water.\n- Students understand the connection between their exploration activity and real pelican features.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Design sheets (blank paper or pre-printed templates with \"Draw and Label Your Aquatic Animal\")\n- Colored pencils, markers, crayons\n- Optional: Images of other water animals (ducks, otters, turtles, fish) as inspiration\n- Recording prompts (printed or on board)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-World Application Scenario:**\n   - \"Imagine you are a nature designer. You need to create a new water animal that lives in a river habitat and hunts small fish. What adaptations would your animal need?\"\n\n2. **Design Challenge (Students work individually or in pairs):**\n   - Draw and label a fictional aquatic animal.\n   - Include at least 4 adaptations from the pelican OR from their exploration (waterproof covering, special beak shape, buoyant body, webbed feet, etc.).\n   - Write labels explaining what each adaptation does and why the animal needs it.\n\n3. **Sentence Stems to Guide Thinking:**\n   - \"My animal has _____ because _____.\"\n   - \"This adaptation helps my animal _____ in its water habitat.\"\n   - \"My animal hunts for food by _____.\"\n\n4. **Gallery Walk (Optional, if time allows):**\n   - Post designs around the room.\n   - Students walk and leave sticky-note questions or observations: \"Why does your animal have that beak? That's a cool idea!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to ask depth-building questions: \"Tell me about this adaptation. Could your animal survive in saltwater with that feature? Why or why not?\"\n- Push students to think about multiple adaptations working together, not just one feature in isolation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate transfer of learning by designing an original animal with justified adaptations.\n- Students show deeper understanding by explaining *why* each adaptation matters for survival.\n- Students can compare their design to the pelican and other water animals.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Station Observation Sheets:** Review student work during Explore phase for accurate descriptions and connections.\n- **Fist-to-Five Check:** Use hand signals during Explain phase to identify students needing support.\n- **Design Challenge Descriptions:** Read labels on elaborate activity designs to assess whether students can explain adaptation-habitat relationships.\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (End of Lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket with the following prompts:\n\n1. **Look at the pelican photo one more time.** Draw an arrow pointing to ONE adaptation and write: \"This helps the pelican _____ (do what?) so it can survive in the water.\"\n\n2. **True or False with Explanation:**\n   - \"A pelican's waterproof feathers are an adaptation.\" (Circle: TRUE / FALSE)\n   - Why did you choose that answer? _____________________________\n\n3. **Complete this sentence:**\n   - \"The pelican and the water habitat are connected because _____________________________\"\n\n**Success Criteria – Students Meet Objectives If They:**\n\n- ✓ Identify at least one pelican adaptation accurately.\n- ✓ Explain how that adaptation helps the pelican in its water habitat.\n- ✓ Use vocabulary terms (adaptation, habitat, waterproof, or predator) correctly at least once.\n- ✓ Demonstrate understanding that organisms and environments are interdependent.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets reveal whether students can name adaptations and explain their function.\n- Students who correctly complete 3 of 4 prompts on the exit ticket have met learning objectives.\n- Design challenges show transfer of concept understanding to a new scenario.\n- Teacher uses results to determine who needs small-group review before moving to next unit.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Adapted Station Sheets with Visuals:**\n   - Provide picture cards or icons at each station (feather = waterproof, fish = food, etc.).\n   - Pre-label some sections of observation sheets so students fill in blanks instead of creating responses from scratch.\n   - Sentence stems are more specific: \"The pelican's beak is _____ so it can catch _____.\"\n\n2. **Peer Partnerships:**\n   - Pair struggling readers/writers with stronger peers during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n   - Assign a pre-designated peer to read station directions aloud.\n\n3. **Simplified Exit Ticket:**\n   - Reduce to 2 prompts instead of 3.\n   - Offer multiple-choice options: \"This adaptation helps the pelican: a) fly, b) catch fish, c) sleep.\"\n   - Allow drawing-only response for students with writing challenges.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Food Web Extension:**\n   - Introduce concept of food chains: sun → plants → fish → pelican → decomposer.\n   - Ask: \"What would happen to pelicans if all the fish disappeared? How is energy moving through this chain?\"\n   - Challenge: Create a more complex aquatic food web with 5+ organisms.\n\n2. **Comparative Anatomy:**\n   - Provide images of other water birds (cormorant, heron, duck, penguin) with different beak and body shapes.\n   - Ask: \"Why are these beaks different? What does each bird hunt? How are beaks adapted to different food sources?\"\n   - Task: Research and present on how one other water bird is adapted to its habitat.\n\n3. **Habitat Change Scenario:**\n   - Present a hypothetical: \"A pelican's habitat gets polluted and all the fish move away. What could the pelican adapt to eat instead? Could it survive? Why or why not?\"\n   - Challenge them to argue whether long-term adaptation is possible or whether this pelican would need to migrate.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Pelican Life Cycle and Migration Research:**\n   - Students research the breeding cycle, migration patterns, and lifespan of pelicans.\n   - Create a timeline showing key life events (egg → chick → fledgling → adult).\n   - Discussion: How do adaptations help pelicans survive during different life stages and seasons?\n   - *Connects to:* LS2-1 (understanding how organisms interact with changing environments).\n\n2. **Wetland Habitat Diorama:**\n   - Small groups create a 3D diorama of a wetland/coastal habitat with a pelican, plants, fish, and other organisms.\n   - Label all organisms and show food web relationships with string or yarn.\n   - Students explain how removing one organism (e.g., fish) would affect the pelican and the whole habitat.\n   - *Connects to:* 5-LS2-1 (modeling matter and energy movement in ecosystems).\n\n3. **Design a Conservation Campaign:**\n   - Students learn that pelicans and other water birds face threats (habitat loss, pollution, overfishing).\n   - In small groups, design a \"Save the Wetlands\" poster or digital presentation.\n   - Include: Why pelicans matter, what threats they face, and what people can do to help.\n   - *Real-world connection:* Students practice science communication and environmental citizenship.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Implementation Notes\n\n- **Timing:** The two 45-minute sessions work as: **Session 1** = Engage + Explore (45 min). **Session 2** = Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate (45 min).\n- **Material Prep:** Gather materials for stations during lunch/prep period the day before. Label each station with a number and directions.\n- **Classroom Management:** Assign groups to stations before Explore phase begins. Use a timer (3-5 minutes per station) and a bell or signal to rotate groups smoothly.\n- **NGSS Alignment Rationale:** This lesson directly addresses 5-LS2-1 by having students model how pelicans (animals) obtain energy/matter from their aquatic environment and depend on water organisms and plants. Students understand the interconnectedness of organism and habitat.",
