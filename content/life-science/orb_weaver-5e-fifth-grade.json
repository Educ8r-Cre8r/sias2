ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about spiders and their role in nature by examining the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed image of the orb weaver spider on a human hand\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph prominently without explanation. Allow students 30 seconds to observe quietly.\n\n2. Ask the following discussion questions:\n   - \"What do you notice about this spider? What body parts can you see?\"\n   - \"Why might a spider have such long, thin legs and such a small body?\"\n   - \"What do you think this spider eats, and how do you think it catches its food?\"\n   - \"How might this spider be connected to plants, insects, and other animals in nature?\"\n\n3. Record student observations and wonderings on chart paper. Do not correct misconceptions yet.\n\n4. Present the focus question: \"How does energy move from the sun through plants and animals, and where does the spider fit into this energy journey?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become spider detectives and trace how energy travels through a food web to discover the spider's important job.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the concept of energy flow in food webs through hands-on modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large cards or paper strips labeled with organisms: \"Sun,\" \"Plant,\" \"Grasshopper,\" \"Spider,\" \"Hawk,\" and \"Decomposer\"\n- String or yarn (one long piece per group)\n- Tape or pushpins\n- Handout: \"Food Web Investigation Sheet\" (see below)\n- Pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Divide the class into groups of 4–5 students.\n\n2. Distribute organism cards and explain: \"You are going to build a food web by showing how energy moves from one organism to another. The arrow shows the direction energy travels.\"\n\n3. Provide these step-by-step directions to each group:\n   - Lay out all organism cards on a flat surface (table or floor).\n   - Start with the Sun card. This is where all energy begins.\n   - Connect the Sun to the Plant using string, and write or draw an arrow showing that plants get energy from the sun.\n   - Connect the Plant to the Grasshopper (grasshopper eats the plant).\n   - Connect the Grasshopper to the Spider (spider eats the grasshopper).\n   - Connect the Spider to the Hawk (hawk eats the spider).\n   - Connect the Decomposer to the Plant (decomposer breaks down dead matter and returns it to soil).\n   - On your Food Web Investigation Sheet, draw arrows showing the path energy takes from the sun to the spider.\n\n4. Have students record their observations by answering:\n   - \"What does the spider eat?\"\n   - \"Where did that organism get its energy?\"\n   - \"Trace the path of energy from the sun to the spider in 4 steps.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Where does the grasshopper get energy?\" and \"If there were no plants, what would happen to the spider?\" rather than providing direct answers.\n- Allow groups to struggle productively with connections; do not correct errors immediately.\n- Note misconceptions for the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Groups successfully create a visual food web model with organisms connected by string.\n- Students can identify that energy flows from plants to insects to spiders.\n- Students recognize the sun as the original source of energy.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and clarify the concept of energy and matter movement through food webs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or digital display\n- Image of the orb weaver spider (from original photograph)\n- Colored markers\n- Student-created food web models from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (8 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2–3 groups to show their food web models and explain their energy pathways.\n   - Ask the class: \"Are all the food webs the same? Why or why not?\" (Students may have included different organisms; validate that multiple food webs are possible.)\n   - Highlight correct pathways; gently address misconceptions without embarrassment.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Use the original spider photograph to anchor vocabulary:\n\n   **Food Chain:** A pathway showing how energy flows from the sun through plants and animals. (Example: Sun → Plant → Grasshopper → Spider)\n\n   **Food Web:** Many food chains connected together in an ecosystem. Shows all the different ways organisms can eat and be eaten.\n\n   **Producer:** An organism (like a plant) that makes its own food using energy from the sun.\n\n   **Consumer:** An organism (like a spider or insect) that eats other organisms to get energy.\n\n   **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals. (The spider is a predator; the grasshopper is its prey.)\n\n   **Energy Transfer:** The movement of energy from one organism to another when one organism eats another.\n\n3. **Connection Back to Photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to the spider in the photograph: \"This orb weaver is a consumer and a predator. It catches insects in its web and eats them. When the spider eats an insect, it is taking the energy that the insect got from eating plants. The energy came originally from the sun.\"\n   - Draw a simple diagram on chart paper showing: Sun → Plant → Insect → Spider.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Food Chain:** A line showing how energy moves from the sun through plants to animals.\n- **Food Web:** All the connected food chains in one place, showing many ways energy can move.\n- **Producer:** A living thing that makes food (like plants).\n- **Consumer:** A living thing that eats other living things to get energy.\n- **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats another animal.\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Ask: \"If you were a spider, who would be your prey?\" (Insects)\n- Ask: \"Where does the spider's energy come from, at the very beginning?\" (The sun)\n- Have students point to the spider in the photograph and name one organism it likely eats.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students use vocabulary correctly in sentences.\n- Students can explain that spiders obtain energy by eating insects, which obtained energy from plants, which obtained energy from the sun.\n- Students understand that energy moves in one direction through a food chain.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of food webs to new contexts and think about how changes affect the entire system.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"What If?\" scenario cards (see below)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photo of the spider (original)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce \"What If?\" Scenarios:**\n   - Explain: \"Food webs are connected. If one organism changes, it affects others. You're going to think like ecosystem scientists.\"\n\n2. **Provide scenarios (one per small group or pair):**\n\n   **Scenario A:** \"What if all the plants in a forest died from disease? Trace what would happen to the grasshoppers, then the spiders, then the hawks.\"\n\n   **Scenario B:** \"What if a farmer used pesticide that killed all the insects in a field? What would happen to the spiders that live there?\"\n\n   **Scenario C:** \"What if hawks moved to a new area and there were no more hawks eating spiders? What might happen to the spider population?\"\n\n3. **Group Task:**\n   - Students receive their scenario card.\n   - They draw or write a short explanation of what would happen to the food web.\n   - They must use the word \"energy\" or \"food chain\" in their response.\n   - Emphasize: \"Trace the problem all the way through the food web.\"\n\n4. **Share and Discuss (5 minutes):**\n   - 2–3 groups present their scenarios and predictions.\n   - Ask the class: \"Do you agree? Why or why not?\"\n   - Reinforce: \"When one part of a food web changes, it affects all the organisms connected to it.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Guide students to think about cause and effect across the food web.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"If there's no grass, what happens to the insect that eats grass? Then what happens to the spider?\"\n- Validate reasoning even if predictions are partially incorrect.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students demonstrate understanding that ecosystems are interconnected.\n- Students can trace the impact of a change through multiple organisms in a food web.\n- Students use scientific vocabulary in explanations.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student mastery of food web concepts and energy flow.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe group participation during food web building (Explore).\n- Check Food Web Investigation Sheet responses.\n- Listen to vocabulary use and explanations during Explain phase.\n- Ask questions during Elaborate scenarios to gauge reasoning.\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (Administer at end of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper and ask them to answer the following (can be written or drawn):\n\n1. **Look at this picture of a spider (show the original photograph).** Draw or write a food chain that shows how energy gets to this spider. Start with the sun.\n\n2. **Explain in 2–3 sentences: Why is the spider important to its ecosystem?** (Hint: Think about what it eats and what eats it.)\n\n3. **If all the insects in an area disappeared, what would happen to the spiders there? Why?**\n\n**Success Criteria for Mastery:**\n\n✓ Student correctly identifies the sun as the starting point of energy.\n\n✓ Student traces a logical food chain: Sun → Plant → Insect → Spider.\n\n✓ Student correctly identifies spiders as consumers/predators.\n\n✓ Student explains that energy moves through food webs.\n\n✓ Student makes a logical prediction about ecosystem changes and explains their reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- 80% of students correctly trace energy from sun to spider in a food chain.\n- Most students can explain the spider's role as a predator and consumer.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that food webs are interconnected systems.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Food Web Model:** Provide a pre-drawn food web with only three organisms (Plant → Insect → Spider) instead of five. Have students trace the pathway with a finger or marker before drawing it.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames for Exit Ticket:** Provide sentence starters:\n   - \"The sun gives energy to the ___.\"\n   - \"The insect eats the ___, so it gets energy from the ___.\"\n   - \"If insects died, the spider would ___ because ___.\"\n\n3. **Peer Pairing:** Pair struggling students with a student who confidently understands food chains. Have them work together on the Elaborate \"What If?\" scenario.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Complex Food Web Design:** Ask students to research and create a real food web from a specific ecosystem (rainforest, pond, meadow) with 8–10 organisms and multiple feeding relationships. Challenge them to identify organisms that eat multiple things (like humans or bears).\n\n2. **Energy Loss Investigation:** Introduce the concept that energy is lost at each level of a food chain. Have students calculate or draw how much energy passes from plants to insects to spiders (e.g., \"If the plant has 100 units of energy, the insect might have only 10 units, and the spider might have only 1 unit\"). Create a visual representation.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Impact Analysis:** Provide a real-world scenario (e.g., \"A new predator moves into the area\" or \"A disease kills all the plants\"). Have students write a detailed prediction of all ecosystem changes and draw a before/after comparison of the food web.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Spider Web Geometry Project:** Have students visit an area outside the school to find and photograph spider webs (or study the pattern of an orb weaver web). Create an art-science project where they replicate the web's geometric patterns using string, wire, or paper. Research why spiders build these specific patterns. Connect to how the web's structure helps the spider catch prey (a structural adaptation).\n\n2. **Insect Collection and Field Identification:** Take students on a \"bug hunt\" to collect and identify insects. Create a chart of insects found and predict which ones spiders might eat. Release insects unharmed. Use this to build a local, real food web based on what students found.\n\n3. **Video Analysis — Nature Documentary:** Show a 5–10 minute clip from a nature documentary (e.g., BBC's Planet Earth or similar) showing spiders hunting prey or competing in their habitat. Have students pause the video periodically to identify the food chain, predict what will happen next, and identify the predator and prey roles.\n\n4. **Creative Food Web Story or Comic:** Have students create a comic strip or illustrated story titled \"A Day in the Life of a Spider\" that shows the spider hunting, eating, and possibly being hunted. Include labels showing the food chain and energy transfer at each step.\n\n5. **Classroom Food Web Game:** Play \"The Web of Life\" movement game where each student represents an organism. When \"predators\" are called out, they must gently tag \"prey\" and connect with yarn to show the food chain. This kinesthetic review reinforces the interconnectedness of ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\nThis lesson directly uses the orb weaver photograph to ground abstract food web concepts in a real organism. Fifth graders are developmentally ready to understand energy flow across multiple organisms and to think about ecosystem interconnections. The hands-on modeling in the Explore phase and the \"What If?\" scenarios in the Elaborate phase move beyond simple memorization to systems thinking, which is essential for mastery of NGSS 5-LS2-1. Be prepared to address common misconceptions such as \"spiders are scary/bad\" by emphasizing their role as natural predators that help control insect populations.",
