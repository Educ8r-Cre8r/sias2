  "content": "### Visible Elements in Photo\n\n- Two turtles in shallow water with algae/green coating on their shells\n- Decomposing wood log partially submerged in water\n- Shallow wetland environment with muddy bottom\n- Dried plant stalks and green vegetation in background\n- Moss or algae growth on surfaces (log, turtle shells)\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n\n- **From turtle shells covered in algae**: Turtles spend extended time in water where growth accumulates; they need shelter or structures that allow aquatic living while managing environmental buildup.\n- **From the submerged log**: Natural materials in wetlands provide structural support and habitat; logs decay over time and may need replacement or reinforcement to remain functional.\n- **From shallow water + vegetation mix**: Turtles depend on both wet and dry zones; a successful habitat requires a transition area between land and water.\n\n---\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2 Version:**\nDesign a safe resting spot for turtles in a shallow pond. Build a platform or log shelter using sticks, rocks, and leaves that turtles can climb onto to rest and dry off. Make sure it doesn't tip over when you gently push it.\n\n**3-5 Version:**\nDesign a turtle basking platform for a shallow wetland habitat. Your structure must:\n- Support at least 2 kg of weight (simulating turtle load) without sinking or tipping\n- Remain stable in 5 cm of standing water for 10 minutes\n- Use only natural or recycled materials (sticks, bark, cork, burlap)\n- Provide at least one exposed dry surface where algae growth can be monitored over 2 weeks\n\nTest your design by placing it in a shallow water container. Measure stability and water absorption. Redesign if the platform sags or tips.\n\n---\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThe photo shows a real habitat where turtles interact with their environment. Students can observe that the log provides structure but also accumulates growth, raising questions: *Why do turtles need resting spots? What makes a good basking platform? How do materials break down in water?* This observation-based approach naturally leads students to define the problem before jumping to solutions.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Materials\n\n- Sticks and small branches (collect or purchase)\n- Cork pieces or bark strips\n- Rocks (various sizes)\n- Burlap or natural fabric scraps\n- Shallow plastic container or aquarium (for testing)\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Time\n\n**45–60 minutes** (single session for K-2; 3-5 may benefit from two 30-minute sessions: one for build/test, one for redesign and observation)\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS 3-5-ETS1-1** (define engineering problems and propose solutions) and **K-2-ETS1-1** (ask questions and make observations about the natural world to solve design problems) by asking students to identify a real organism's need, test a solution in conditions that mirror the actual environment, and refine their design based on performance data.",
