ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring the photograph and what students already know about insects.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph or digital display of the cicada on the flowering plant\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Index cards (one per student)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or poster where all students can see clearly. Let students observe silently for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe the insect you see.\"\n   - \"What is this insect doing on the plant? Why might it be there?\"\n   - \"Have you ever heard a loud buzzing sound on a hot summer day? This might have been a cicada!\"\n   - \"Look at the insect's body. What parts do you notice? What do you think those parts are used for?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what this insect eats, where it came from, and how long it will live. What do you wonder about this insect?\"\n\n4. **Record predictions:** Ask students to draw or write one thing they predict about cicadas on an index card. Collect these to revisit during the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become cicada detectives and discover amazing facts about this insect's body, how it survives, and the incredible journey it takes in its life.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate insect structures and habitats through hands-on observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of different insects (ant, butterfly, beetle, grasshopper, fly) printed or displayed\n- Index cards with insect names\n- Chart paper with a large tree branch drawn on it\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Rulers\n- Model insect bodies: pre-made outlines of insects with detachable parts (legs, wings, antennae) made from craft foam or cardstock\n- \"Insect Habitat\" observation cards (worksheet format)\n- Magnifying glasses (optional, if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Body Structure Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display the cicada photo again** alongside images of 4-5 other insects (ant, butterfly, beetle, grasshopper).\n\n2. **Explain the task:** \"All insects have certain body parts. Your job is to find what ALL insects have in common.\"\n\n3. **Provide each student pair with:**\n   - A large insect body outline (cicada, ant, butterfly, or grasshopper)\n   - Colored pencils or markers\n   - A chart listing body parts to locate: **Head, Thorax (middle body), Abdomen (back), 6 Legs, Antennae, Wings**\n\n4. **Student directions:**\n   - Color and label the main body sections of your insect.\n   - Circle or mark the 6 legs. Count them together.\n   - Draw where the antennae are on the head.\n   - If your insect has wings, color them and count how many.\n   - Write or draw one job for each part (e.g., \"Legs help the insect hold onto branches\").\n\n5. **Teacher Role:** Circulate with a cicada photo. Ask guiding questions: \"Does your insect have the same number of legs as the cicada? How many antennae does it have? What do you think the wings are for?\"\n\n6. **Document:** Students record their findings on the \"Insect Body Checklist\" worksheet.\n\n**Part B: Habitat Survival Investigation (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Refocus on the cicada photo.** Ask: \"The cicada is on a plant. Why? What does it need from the plant?\"\n\n2. **Explain:** \"Cicadas drink juice from inside plants through a special straw-like mouth. This plant is part of the cicada's habitat—its home.\"\n\n3. **Activity:** Students create a simple habitat diagram:\n   - On a worksheet with a drawn plant, students label:\n     - Where the cicada sits (branch)\n     - Where it drinks (plant stem or leaf)\n     - What else might live here (draw or write: other insects, sun, soil, water)\n\n4. **Student Recording:** Students complete the sentence: \"A cicada needs a plant habitat because _______________.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that ALL insects have 6 legs, 3 body sections, and antennae.\n- Students identify that body parts have specific jobs (legs = climbing, antennae = sensing, wings = flying).\n- Students recognize that cicadas depend on plants for food and survival.\n- Each student/pair produces a labeled insect diagram and habitat sketch.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Build shared vocabulary and connect hands-on discoveries to formal concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Cicada photo (displayed again)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures (printed or hand-drawn)\n- Life cycle diagram of a cicada (simple 4-stage illustration: egg → nymph → final molt → adult)\n- Real images of cicadas in different life stages (if available from library books or web resources)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 student pairs to briefly share one body part they found and its job.\n   - Create a class list on chart paper: \"What Insect Bodies Can Do\"\n   - Affirm all responses: \"Great observation! That's exactly how insects survive.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n   - **Insect:** An animal with 6 legs, 3 body parts (head, thorax, abdomen), and antennae. Insects are found everywhere on Earth.\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. (Example: A cicada's strong legs are an adaptation that helps it hold onto branches.)\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. (Example: The cicada's habitat is on or near trees with plants it can drink from.)\n   - **Life Cycle:** The stages a living thing goes through from birth to death—birth, growth, change, and reproduction.\n   - **Proboscis:** The long, straw-like mouth part of a cicada used to drink juice from plants. (Use the cicada photo to point this out.)\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photo (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at our cicada again. Let's identify its adaptations.\"\n   - Point out: strong legs (adaptation for holding on), wings (adaptation for flying), proboscis (adaptation for feeding), colors (adaptation for blending in or attracting mates).\n   - \"Its habitat is this flowering plant. The cicada finds food here and rests here.\"\n\n4. **Introduce Life Cycle Concept (2 minutes):**\n   - Show a simple 4-stage diagram of a cicada life cycle.\n   - **\"A cicada is born as a tiny egg. It hatches into a nymph (baby cicada) that lives underground eating plant roots. After many years, it climbs up, sheds its skin one last time, and becomes an adult with wings. Then it finds a mate and lays eggs to start the cycle again.\"**\n   - Emphasize: \"Just like you, a cicada is born, grows and changes, has babies, and eventually dies. This is called a life cycle.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can you show me with your fingers how many legs a cicada has?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the cicada's legs are strong?\"\n   - Ask: \"What does the cicada use its long mouth for?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly use terms like \"adaptation,\" \"habitat,\" \"insect,\" and \"life cycle.\"\n- Students explain that body parts help insects survive (structure-function relationship).\n- Students understand that cicadas have a life cycle like all living things.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to new contexts and deepen learning about insects, adaptations, and survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pictures of 3-4 other insects (ladybug, dragonfly, mosquito, leaf-cutter ant) in their habitats\n- Chart paper labeled \"Insect Adaptations for Survival\"\n- Colored pencils and paper\n- Optional: short video clip (2-3 minutes) of cicadas in nature (search \"cicada in tree\" on YouTube for teacher preview)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Adaptation Detective (for all learners)**\n\n1. **Present a new scenario:** \"Imagine a grasshopper. It lives in grass. What body parts would help it survive there? How are they different from a cicada?\"\n\n2. **Show pictures of 2-3 other insects** (e.g., dragonfly with long wings for quick flight, ladybug with hard shell for protection, ant with strong legs for carrying).\n\n3. **Student Task:**\n   - Choose one insect picture.\n   - Identify 2-3 body parts or behaviors that help it survive in its habitat.\n   - Draw the insect and label the adaptations.\n   - Write or say: \"This insect's _____________ (body part) helps it survive because _____________.\"\n\n4. **Class Chart:** Create a shared \"Insect Adaptations\" chart on paper, adding students' discoveries.\n\n**Option B: Life Cycle Story (for visual/narrative learners)**\n\n1. **Provide a simple life cycle template** with 4 boxes (egg, nymph, final molt, adult).\n\n2. **Students draw or write the story** of a cicada's life, labeling each stage.\n\n3. **Share: \"My cicada began its life as an ________. Then it ________. Finally, it became an adult that can ________.\"**\n\n**Option C: Habitat Design (for spatial/creative learners)**\n\n1. **Challenge:** \"Design a perfect habitat for a cicada. It must have the plant it needs to drink from, a safe place to rest, and a spot where it can lay eggs.\"\n\n2. **Students draw or build** a simple habitat using paper, markers, and optional craft materials (twigs, leaves).\n\n3. **Label:** food source, shelter, place to lay eggs.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group, asking: \"Why did you choose that adaptation? How does it help the insect survive?\"\n- Record student explanations; these serve as formative assessment.\n- Affirm connections: \"You're right! Just like the cicada needs strong legs, this insect needs _______ to survive in its habitat.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students independently apply adaptation concepts to new insects.\n- Students create visual or written products showing cause-and-effect relationships (structure → function → survival).\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding of how organisms fit into habitats.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of life cycles, adaptations, habitats, and insect structures.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation checklists during Explore (Can students identify 6 legs? Antennae? Body sections?)\n- Check-for-understanding questions during Explain (Do students use vocabulary correctly?)\n- Student drawings and labels in Elaborate (Do adaptations reflect understanding of survival?)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes, end of Lesson 2):**\n\n**Option A: Drawing with Labels**\nProvide students with a blank cicada outline. Students label:\n- 3 body parts\n- 1 adaptation and why it helps the cicada\n- The habitat the cicada lives in\n\n**Option B: Short Answer (for students who can write)**\n1. \"Name one body part of a cicada and explain how it helps the cicada survive.\"\n2. \"What is the cicada's habitat? What does it find there?\"\n3. \"Draw or describe one stage in a cicada's life cycle.\"\n\n**Option C: Oral Explanation (for emergent writers)**\n- Teacher asks 2-3 students individually: \"Tell me about a cicada's life. What does it look like? Where does it live? How does it change?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student identifies 1-2 insect body parts and says generally what they do.\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student identifies 3+ body parts, explains how 2 body parts help the cicada survive, and identifies the habitat.\n\n✓ **Advanced:** Student explains adaptations, describes a life cycle stage, and connects habitat to survival (e.g., \"The cicada needs plants in its habitat because it drinks their juice with its proboscis\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can identify cicadas as insects with 6 legs and antennae.\n- 70%+ of students can name 2+ adaptations and explain a survival benefit.\n- 60%+ of students can describe at least one life cycle stage.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:**\n   - Pre-teach vocabulary using picture cards before the lesson.\n   - Provide a word bank on all worksheets.\n   - Use consistent, simple definitions; repeat key terms in multiple contexts.\n\n2. **Simplified Worksheets:**\n   - Provide partially completed diagrams (e.g., body parts already labeled; students just color and circle legs).\n   - Use \"This or That\" multiple-choice formats instead of open-ended writing.\n   - Example: \"Does a cicada have 4 legs or 6 legs? Circle the answer.\"\n\n3. **Hands-On Support:**\n   - Assign a peer partner for the Explore phase.\n   - Use real objects: Show a model insect with movable parts so students can manipulate and count.\n   - Provide a completed example of an insect diagram before asking students to create one.\n\n4. **Extended Time:**\n   - Allow these students to work on a simplified life cycle (2 stages: egg → adult) instead of 4 stages.\n   - Break the lesson into shorter chunks over 3 sessions instead of 2.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research Extension:**\n   - \"Research another insect's life cycle. How is it the same as a cicada's? How is it different? (Butterfly complete metamorphosis vs. cicada incomplete metamorphosis)\"\n   - Provide access to classroom books, tablets, or teacher-curated websites on insect life cycles.\n\n2. **Complex Adaptation Analysis:**\n   - \"Some cicadas are green, and some are brown. Why might this variation help them survive? (Camouflage in different habitats)\"\n   - Introduce the concept of **natural selection** informally: \"Insects with colors that match their habitat are harder for predators to see, so they survive longer and have more babies.\"\n\n3. **Problem-Solving Challenge:**\n   - \"If all the trees in a cicada's habitat were cut down, what would happen to the cicada population? How could we help cicadas survive?\"\n   - Have students propose solutions and explain them using what they learned.\n\n4. **Comparative Life Cycle Project:**\n   - Create detailed life cycle diagrams for 2-3 insects side-by-side (cicada, grasshopper, ladybug).\n   - Write or illustrate key differences in how long each stage lasts or where it occurs.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cicada Sound Investigation:**\n   - Play a 30-second audio recording of cicada sounds (search \"cicada call\" online for teacher preview).\n   - Discuss: \"Why do you think cicadas make noise? (Males call to attract females for reproduction.)\"\n   - Challenge: \"If a cicada can't hear well but makes loud sounds, how does it find a mate? (Through vibrations and sound.)\"\n   - Activity: Students create their own \"cicada call\" using rhythm instruments or vocal sounds; discuss why communication is important for survival.\n\n2. **Insect Life Cycle Sequencing Game:**\n   - Create or print 4-6 illustrated cards showing cicada (or butterfly, grasshopper, ant) life stages.\n   - Students arrange cards in the correct order, explain why each stage comes next, and discuss what the organism needs at each stage.\n   - Variation: Match insect pictures to their correct life cycle.\n\n3. **Design a New Insect:**\n   - \"Create an insect that could survive in a desert habitat. What adaptations would it need? Draw it and label the adaptations.\"\n   - Students explain: \"My insect has _________ because in a desert it needs to _________.\"\n   - Builds critical thinking about structure-function relationships and environmental fit.\n\n4. **Cicada Habitat Diorama:**\n   - Create a small 3D model of a cicada habitat using a shoe box, twigs, leaves, paper, and markers.\n   - Include: the plant the cicada feeds on, a safe resting place, soil (for nymphs underground), and a spot for eggs.\n   - Write labels explaining why each part is important.\n\n5. **Insect Variation Observation:**\n   - Bring in pictures of 5-6 cicadas with slightly different colorations or patterns.\n   - Students identify differences: \"How are these cicadas different? Why might some be darker and some lighter?\"\n   - Introduce: \"Even though they're all cicadas, they're not exactly the same. These differences might help them survive in different environments.\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Most Third Graders have heard of insects and may have seen bugs outdoors. Some may confuse insects with other arthropods (spiders have 8 legs, not 6). Use this lesson to clarify what makes an insect an insect.\n\n- **Safety:** If using live insects, handle gently and release safely. No live cicadas are needed for this lesson; the photograph and images are sufficient.\n\n- **Timing Flexibility:** This lesson works as two 45-60 minute sessions or can be condensed to one 90-minute block. Prioritize the Engage and Explore phases for maximum engagement.\n\n- **Vocabulary Load:** Third graders learn best with 4-6 new terms per lesson. The 5 vocabulary terms here are manageable. Reinforce by using them repeatedly and providing pictures.\n\n- **Connection to NGSS:** This lesson directly addresses 3-LS1-1 (life cycles), 3-LS4-2 (variations and survival advantages), and 3-LS4-3 (organism-habitat fit). Feel free to add 3-LS4-4 if discussing environmental changes (e.g., habitat loss affecting cicada survival).\n\n- **Inclusive Practices:** Use multiple modalities (visual, kinesthetic, verbal) throughout. Offer drawing, writing, and verbal explanation options. Pair emerging readers with fluent readers during the Explore phase.",
