Explain how a spider web is a structure that helps spiders capture food and survive in their environment.\n2. Describe how matter (insects and plant material) moves from one organism to another through a food chain involving a spider.\n3. Create a model showing the movement of matter and energy among plants, animals, and the spider within an ecosystem.\n4. Identify the role of a spider as a consumer in a food chain and explain how it depends on other organisms for survival.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about spider webs and activate prior knowledge about how animals survive.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Printed or projected image of the spider web photograph (large enough for whole class to see)\n  - Chart paper or whiteboard\n  - Markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation time—students just look without talking.\n\n  2. **Ask these discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing 30–45 seconds per question):\n     - \"What do you notice about the structure of this web? What shapes do you see?\" (Look for responses about circles, lines, geometric patterns.)\n     - \"Why do you think a spider makes a web like this? What could it be used for?\"\n     - \"What might happen if an insect flies into this web? How would that help the spider survive?\"\n     - \"Where do you think the spider gets energy to build and maintain this web?\" (This previews the food chain concept.)\n\n  3. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper: \"What questions do you have about spider webs and how spiders survive?\" Accept all responses without judgment (e.g., \"How does the spider not get stuck?\" \"What eats spiders?\" \"Where does the web come from?\").\n\n  4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"If we think of a spider web as part of a chain of living things, where do you think that chain starts? What other organisms might be connected to a spider web?\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Great questions! Today we're going to explore how a spider web connects to other living things and how food, water, and energy move through this web of life.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate food chains and energy transfer through a hands-on model-building activity.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Index cards or small paper squares (3\" × 3\")\n  - Colored markers or colored pencils\n  - String or yarn (1–2 feet per student pair)\n  - Tape or sticky tack\n  - Large paper or poster board (1 per pair)\n  - Printed or drawn images of: grass/plants, grasshopper, cricket, butterfly, spider, bird, decomposer (optional—or students can draw these)\n  - Chart showing the following organisms: *Sun → Plant → Insect → Spider → Bird*\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Pair students.** Distribute one large paper and one piece of yarn/string per pair.\n\n  2. **Provide the scenario:** \"Your pair is going to build a model of a food chain connected to a spider and its web. The web is in a garden with grass, insects, and birds. You need to show how matter and energy move from one organism to another.\"\n\n  3. **Step-by-step student directions:**\n     - On your paper, draw or cut out and tape down pictures of these organisms in a scattered arrangement: grass, grasshopper, spider, bird.\n     - Use the string/yarn to create connections between organisms, showing which organism eats which organism.\n     - *Start at the sun/plant (energy source) → move to the insect that eats the plant → move to the spider that eats the insect → move to the bird that eats the spider.*\n     - Label each connection with one word: \"eats\" or \"provides energy to.\"\n     - On the back of your paper, write one sentence answering: \"How does matter from the grass eventually reach the bird through the spider?\"\n\n  4. **Connection to photograph:** \"The spider web in our photo is the hunting tool. Without it, the spider couldn't catch the insects it needs. Those insects got their energy from plants. Now that energy is being passed to the spider. If a bird eats the spider, that energy moves again.\"\n\n  5. **What students should record:**\n     - Visual model of the food chain with clear connections\n     - Written explanation of how matter moves through the chain\n     - Labels identifying the role of each organism (producer, consumer, etc.—introduce these terms informally if appropriate)\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What does this organism eat?\" \"Where did the organism it eats get its energy?\" \"Could the chain work without one of these organisms? Why or why not?\"\n  - Do not provide answers; allow students to reason through connections.\n  - Support students who struggle with the concept by pointing to the photograph and asking, \"What did the grasshopper eat before the spider caught it?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students create a visual food chain showing 4–5 organisms.\n  - Students identify that energy and matter flow from plants → insects → spider → potentially other animals.\n  - Students understand that the spider depends on insects, which depend on plants.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (16 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect hands-on exploration to the 5-LS2-1 standard concepts.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper or whiteboard\n  - Projected photograph of spider web (same image as Engage)\n  - Prepared vocabulary cards or poster with key terms\n  - Optional: Simple diagram showing a food chain or food web\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n     - Invite 2–3 student pairs to briefly show their food chain model and explain one connection they made.\n     - Ask the class: \"What did you notice was the same in all the models we created?\" (All have plants at the beginning; all show insects being eaten by spiders; etc.)\n\n  2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):** Display and define each term. Use the photograph and student models as reference points.\n\n     **Vocabulary:**\n\n     - **Producer:** A living thing that makes its own food from sunlight and soil. Plants are producers. *(Point to grass in the models.)*\n     - **Consumer:** A living thing that eats other living things to get energy. Animals are consumers. The spider is a consumer because it eats insects. *(Point to spider in models and photo.)*\n     - **Food Chain:** A sequence showing how energy and matter move from one organism to another (from food source to the animal that eats it). Our model showed a food chain.\n     - **Matter:** Anything that has weight and takes up space. The bodies of insects, plants, and spiders are all made of matter. This matter passes from organism to organism.\n     - **Energy:** The power to do work or cause change. Plants get energy from the sun. Animals get energy by eating plants or other animals.\n\n  3. **Connect to photograph and Explore (3 minutes):**\n     - Display the spider web photo again. \"This web is a tool that helps the spider catch insects. Why is catching insects important? Because the insect is the matter and energy source the spider needs to survive. The insect got its energy from plants. So the web is how the spider connects to the food chain.\"\n\n  4. **Check for understanding:**\n     - Ask: \"If all the insects disappeared from this garden, what would happen to the spider?\" (It would have no food; it couldn't survive.) \"What does that tell us about how the spider depends on other organisms?\"\n     - Ask: \"Where does all the energy in the food chain start?\" (The sun.)\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Producer** | A plant or organism that makes its own food using sunlight and soil. |\n| **Consumer** | An animal that eats plants or other animals to get energy. |\n| **Food Chain** | The path that shows how food and energy move from plants to animals to other animals. |\n| **Matter** | Anything that has weight and takes up space; the \"stuff\" that makes up living things. |\n| **Energy** | The power that lets living things grow, move, and stay alive. |\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students can define producer, consumer, and food chain in their own words.\n  - Students explain that matter and energy move from organism to organism.\n  - Students recognize that the spider web is a structure that helps the spider get food, which is how it participates in the food chain.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding of food chains and matter movement to a new ecosystem context.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Scenario cards describing different ecosystems (see examples below)\n  - Large blank paper or poster board (1 per group of 3–4)\n  - Markers\n  - Optional: Image resources of plants and animals from different ecosystems\n  - Ruler for drawing food chains\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Organize students into groups of 3–4.** Assign each group a different ecosystem scenario:\n     - **Scenario A:** A meadow with wildflowers, grasshoppers, spiders, and hawks\n     - **Scenario B:** A pond with algae, water beetles, dragonflies, spiders, and fish\n     - **Scenario C:** A forest with trees, beetles, spiders, and birds\n     - **Scenario D:** A crop field with grain plants, insects, spiders, and owls\n\n  2. **Task:** \"Your group will create a food chain for your ecosystem that shows how matter and energy move through it. Include at least one spider, and explain how the spider's role helps that ecosystem stay connected.\"\n\n  3. **Step-by-step directions:**\n     - Discuss what organisms live in your ecosystem. Where do they get food?\n     - Draw the organisms on your paper.\n     - Use arrows to show the direction of matter and energy transfer (arrow points from the food source *toward* the eater).\n     - Label each organism as a *producer* or *consumer*.\n     - Write a caption: \"In our ecosystem, matter and energy move through these organisms because ___________.\" (Complete the sentence.)\n     - Identify the spider's role: \"The spider is important because it __________.\"\n\n  4. **Real-world connection:** \"Spiders are found in nearly every ecosystem on Earth. They all use webs or hunting strategies to catch insects. This helps control insect populations and provides food for larger animals. The spider is a vital link in food chains everywhere.\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate and ask: \"Is that organism a producer or consumer? How do you know?\" \"Where does the arrow point, and why?\" \"What would happen to your food chain if the spider disappeared?\"\n  - Encourage students to think about variations: \"Could there be a different food chain in your ecosystem? Show me.\"\n  - Validate all reasonable food chains; acknowledge that real ecosystems have multiple, overlapping chains.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students create a food chain specific to their assigned ecosystem showing 4–5 organisms.\n  - Students correctly label producers and consumers.\n  - Students explain how matter and energy move through their specific ecosystem.\n  - Students articulate why spiders are important to their ecosystem's balance.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of 5-LS2-1 through formative and summative strategies.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Formative Assessment (during Elaborate):**\n     - Observe student groups as they work. Use a checklist:\n       - ☐ Students identify at least one producer in their ecosystem\n       - ☐ Students identify at least two consumers\n       - ☐ Students draw arrows correctly (pointing toward the consumer)\n       - ☐ Students can verbally explain one food chain connection when asked\n     - Ask each group one targeted question: \"Show me the spider in your chain. What does it eat, and what eats it?\" Listen for understanding of matter transfer.\n\n  2. **Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n     Distribute an index card or digital form with these three questions:\n\n     **Exit Ticket:**\n     1. **Draw or describe** a food chain that includes a spider. Label the producer and at least two consumers.\n     2. **Explain in 2–3 sentences:** How does matter move through this food chain? (Where does it start, and where does it go?)\n     3. **Answer this:** Why is the spider web an important structure for the spider's survival?\n\n  3. **Success Criteria:**\n     - **Developing:** Student identifies some organisms in a food chain but may confuse direction of energy transfer or the roles of producers/consumers.\n     - **Proficient:** Student creates a clear food chain with correct direction of arrows, identifies producers and consumers, and explains that matter moves from organism to organism.\n     - **Advanced:** Student describes multiple food chains, uses scientific vocabulary accurately, and explains how the removal of one organism affects others in the chain.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students demonstrate understanding that food chains show how matter and energy move among organisms.\n  - Students recognize spiders as consumers that depend on insects, which depend on plants.\n  - Students can model or describe a food chain and explain the role of each organism.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (Struggling Learners):**\n  1. **Simplified Food Chain Template:** Provide a pre-drawn food chain with images of organisms already in place (e.g., Sun → Plant → Grasshopper → Spider). Students only add arrows and labels, focusing on the direction of matter movement.\n  2. **Sentence Frames:** Provide written sentence starters for explanations, such as: \"The spider eats __________ because __________\" or \"Matter moves to the spider from the __________.\"\n  3. **Peer Pairing:** Pair struggling readers/writers with a strong partner during Explore and Elaborate. Assign the struggling student the role of \"checker\" (verifying arrows point the right direction) or \"drawer\" (creating visual representations while partner writes).\n\n- **Challenge (Advanced Learners):**\n  1. **Food Web Creation:** Instead of a linear food chain, have students create a food web showing multiple interconnected chains in one ecosystem. Ask: \"What happens if one organism has multiple food sources? How does that help the ecosystem?\"\n  2. **Decomposer Investigation:** Introduce decomposers (bacteria, fungi) and ask students to expand their models to show how dead matter returns to the soil, completing the cycle. Provide research resources on decomposition.\n  3. **Ecosystem Impact Scenario:** Present a real-world scenario (e.g., pesticide use killing insects, drought reducing plants). Ask students to predict and model how this affects the entire food chain and the spider population. Have them present solutions.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Spider Web Art and Engineering Project:** Students create their own spider web using string, yarn, or coffee filters and water. They measure the dimensions and calculate the geometric patterns. Display webs and discuss why engineering efficiency matters for a spider's survival.\n\n2. **Local Ecosystem Investigation:** Take students outdoors to observe actual spiders and their webs (if available in your region/season). Students document what insects are caught in nearby webs, predict the food chain in the schoolyard, and photograph evidence. Bring findings back to compare with classroom models.\n\n3. **Food Chain Role-Play:** Assign students roles as different organisms (sun, plant, grasshopper, cricket, spider, bird, decomposer). Have them move around the gym or classroom following a script that models matter and energy transfer. Use props (yarn, cards) to show what is passed from organism to organism. This kinesthetic review reinforces the flow of energy and matter.",
