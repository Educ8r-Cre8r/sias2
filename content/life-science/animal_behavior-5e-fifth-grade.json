Identify and explain how a lizard's structural features (color, scales, body shape, eye position) help it survive in its environment.\n2. Describe how a green lizard fits into a food web as both a predator and prey, and explain how energy and matter move through these relationships.\n3. Design and test a model animal with adaptations suited to a specific habitat.\n4. Support their observations with evidence by explaining the connection between an animal's structures and its survival needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the green lizard.\n\n**Materials:**\n- High-quality color printout or digital projection of the lizard photograph\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Colored markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently on the board or projector without any context. Allow students 1-2 minutes of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask the following discovery questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about this animal's color, and why do you think it might be that color?\"\n   - \"Looking at the lizard's body, what parts do you see that help it move or sense its surroundings? What could those parts help it do?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this lizard lives, and how does its appearance help it survive there?\"\n   - \"What do you think this lizard eats, and what animals might eat it?\"\n\n3. **Make a class prediction chart:** Record students' initial ideas under the headings: \"What I Notice,\" \"Why That Helps,\" and \"What It Eats/What Eats It.\" Emphasize that predictions now will be tested later.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder how this lizard's body is perfectly designed to help it find food and stay safe from predators. Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become animal scientists and uncover the secrets of how this green lizard survives—and how it's connected to other living things in its ecosystem.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate adaptation and food web connections through hands-on exploration and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One printed or enlarged image of the green lizard per student or small group\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Large sheet of white paper or poster board per group\n- Index cards (plain)\n- Yarn or string\n- Tape or push pins\n- Printed image reference sheet showing a simple ecosystem (tree, grass, insects, snake, bird—images or simple drawings)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Adaptation Analysis (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute the lizard image and large paper to each small group (2-3 students).\n\n2. Direct students: \"You are going to become detectives. Look very carefully at the green lizard. For each body part or feature (color, eyes, scales, legs, tail, snout shape), write or draw what it does and *why that helps the lizard survive*.\"\n\n3. Provide a sentence frame on the board:\n   - \"The lizard's __________ helps it __________ because __________.\"\n\n4. Circulate and ask clarifying questions:\n   - \"How might that feature help it hide?\"\n   - \"How might that help it hunt for food?\"\n   - \"Why is being able to see from the side helpful?\"\n\n5. Have groups record their observations on the paper with labels and simple drawings.\n\n**Part B: Food Web Model (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. Transition: \"Now, let's think about the lizard as part of a bigger community. What eats the lizard, and what does the lizard eat?\"\n\n2. Distribute ecosystem reference images and index cards to each group.\n\n3. Direct students: \"On each card, draw or label an organism: green plant, insect, green lizard, snake, and bird. Now, use the yarn to connect them by showing who eats whom. Start with the sun! Remember: energy moves from the sun to plants to animals.\"\n\n4. Students create a simple string food web by placing cards on a large sheet and connecting them with yarn showing feeding relationships.\n\n5. Ask: \"How does the lizard get energy? What is the original source of all this energy?\" (Answer: the sun, through plants)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and listen to student reasoning without correcting immediately.\n- Ask probing questions: \"What would happen if all the insects disappeared?\"\n- Encourage students to revise their food webs if they notice gaps.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 4-6 adaptations with reasoning.\n- Students create a simple food web showing the lizard's role as both consumer and prey.\n- Students recognize that energy flows from the sun through organisms.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Whiteboard and markers\n- Chart paper with vocabulary definitions\n- Digital image of the green lizard\n- Simple diagram of a food web/energy flow\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share one adaptation they identified and explain why it matters.\n   - Display the class prediction chart from Engage and compare it to their discoveries.\n   - Affirm accurate observations and gently correct misconceptions.\n\n2. **Formal Instruction—Key Vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n\n   Introduce and discuss these terms using the lizard and student observations:\n\n   - **Adaptation:** A feature of an animal's body or behavior that helps it survive in its environment. (Example: The green color is an adaptation that helps the lizard hide.)\n   \n   - **Camouflage:** A type of adaptation where an animal's color or pattern helps it blend in with its surroundings so predators or prey can't easily see it. (Example: The green lizard looks like the green plants around it.)\n   \n   - **Consumer:** An organism that eats other organisms to get energy. (Example: The lizard is a consumer because it eats insects.)\n   \n   - **Food Web:** A model showing how energy and matter move between organisms in an ecosystem. It shows who eats whom. (Example: The sun → plants → insects → lizard → snake.)\n   \n   - **Matter and Energy Transfer:** In a food web, energy flows from the sun through plants and animals. Matter (like nutrients) also moves through living and non-living parts of the ecosystem.\n\n3. **Connection Back to Photograph and Exploration (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the lizard's eye: \"This placement is an adaptation that lets it see predators and prey from the side. That's survival!\"\n   - Show the food web diagram: \"The lizard, as a consumer, gets energy from eating insects. That energy originally came from the sun, captured by plants. If we remove the lizard from this web, energy flow changes for all the organisms.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why is the lizard green?\" (Adaptation/camouflage)\n   - Ask: \"What is the original source of energy for the lizard?\" (The sun, through the food it eats)\n   - Ask: \"Where does the lizard fit in a food web?\" (As a consumer; also as prey)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal live and survive in its home. |\n| **Camouflage** | When an animal's color or pattern helps it hide by blending into its surroundings. |\n| **Consumer** | A living thing that eats plants or other animals to get energy. |\n| **Food Web** | A drawing showing how energy and food move from one living thing to another; shows who eats whom. |\n| **Matter and Energy Transfer** | The way energy from the sun and nutrients move through plants and animals in nature. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define adaptation and camouflage using the green lizard as an example.\n- Students understand the lizard's role in a food web as a consumer and prey.\n- Students recognize that energy originates from the sun and flows through organisms.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing adapted animals for new habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Habitat scenario cards (printed or displayed on board)—see examples below\n- Large blank paper\n- Colored pencils, markers, or colored paper\n- Scissors (optional)\n- Access to reference materials (books, tablets with images of real animals in different habitats)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the Challenge:** \"Now that you understand how adaptations help animals survive, you're going to design a new animal for a different habitat!\"\n\n2. **Assign or allow groups to choose a habitat scenario:**\n   - A snowy Arctic environment\n   - A dark forest cave\n   - A sandy desert\n   - A deep ocean\n   - A rocky mountain\n\n3. **Direct students:** \"Design an animal that would survive well in your habitat. Draw it and label at least 4 adaptations. For each adaptation, explain how it helps your animal find food, stay safe, or survive the environment.\"\n\n4. **Provide a design template on the board:**\n   - \"My animal lives in: __________\"\n   - \"Adaptation 1: __________ helps it __________ because __________.\"\n   - \"Adaptation 2: __________ helps it __________ because __________.\"\n   - (and so on)\n\n5. **Deepen the thinking:** \"Now, create a simple food web for your habitat. What does your animal eat? What might eat it? Where does the energy come from?\"\n\n6. **Gallery Walk (if time allows):** Display designs and have students view and compare adaptations across different habitats.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate by asking guiding questions: \"Why would that feature help in a cold environment?\"\n- Encourage students to explain the *why* behind each adaptation, not just describe it.\n- Connect back to the green lizard: \"Remember how the lizard's green color helps it in its forest home? How is your animal's adaptation similar?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design animals with 4+ logical adaptations suited to a specific habitat.\n- Students explain the connection between each adaptation and survival needs.\n- Students create a simple food web for their habitat.\n- Students apply the concept of adaptation to new contexts.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of adaptations and food webs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- Listen to student explanations during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Check the accuracy of food webs and adaptation reasoning.\n- Use the sentence frames and vocabulary to gauge understanding.\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket:**\n\nProvide each student with a ticket (index card or half-sheet) with the following prompts. Students respond in writing or with drawings:\n\n1. **Look at the green lizard picture one more time.** Choose ONE body part or feature and explain how it is an adaptation that helps the lizard survive. Use the word \"because\" in your answer.\n\n2. **Draw a simple food web** that includes: sun, plant, insect, green lizard, and one predator. Use arrows to show energy flow from the sun to the lizard.\n\n3. **Answer in 2-3 sentences:** How would the lizard's life change if its color turned bright pink instead of green?\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student identifies an adaptation, explains its survival function with clear reasoning, creates an accurate food web with correct energy flow, and predicts realistic consequences of a change.\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student identifies an adaptation and attempts to explain it, creates a mostly accurate food web with minor errors in energy flow direction, and provides a prediction with some reasoning.\n\n✓ **Beginning:** Student describes an animal feature but struggles to connect it to survival, food web has significant errors or is incomplete, and prediction lacks reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students accurately identify and explain at least one adaptation.\n- Students create a simple food web showing the green lizard and energy flow from the sun.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that organisms depend on each other for energy and matter.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Sentence Frames and Word Banks:** Provide pre-written frames with fill-in-the-blank options and a word bank (e.g., \"The lizard's __________ [green color / eyes / scales] helps it __________ [hide / see / survive] because __________.\")\n\n2. **Simplified Food Web:** Reduce the number of organisms in the food web to 3-4 (sun → plant → insect → lizard) rather than 5-6. Use images or icons instead of requiring drawing.\n\n3. **Adaptation Matching:** Provide a list of adaptations (green color, side-facing eyes, small scales) and have students match them to photographs of similar animals in other habitats, then explain the match.\n\n4. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair struggling learners with more confident students during Explore and Elaborate phases; assign roles (e.g., one draws, one writes labels).\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Complex Food Webs:** Ask students to create multi-level food webs with decomposers included (fungi, bacteria breaking down dead matter). Have them trace multiple energy pathways and predict what happens if one organism is removed.\n\n2. **Camouflage Investigation:** Challenge students to research and compare camouflage strategies across multiple animals (e.g., stick insect, Arctic hare, tree frog). Create a comparison chart identifying which adaptations are unique and which are shared.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Design Challenge:** Have students design an entirely new ecosystem with 8+ organisms, complete with adaptations for each, interactions, and energy flow. Present findings to the class.\n\n4. **Real-World Application:** Research and report on how human activities affect the green lizard's habitat and food web. Suggest conservation solutions that preserve the ecosystem balance.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Adaptation Camouflage Game:** Create a \"hide and seek\" game where students color paper cutouts of various animals to match different habitat backgrounds (forest floor, sandy desert, snowy field). Time how quickly classmates can find camouflaged animals. Discuss which colors and patterns work best and why.\n\n2. **Food Web in a Bottle (Closed Ecosystem):** Build a small sealed ecosystem with soil, plants, insects, and water. Observe over 2-3 weeks how matter and energy cycle through the system. Journal observations about which organisms thrive or decline. Connect to the concept of how the green lizard and its food web depend on balanced ecosystems.\n\n3. **Interview a Naturalist or Herpetologist:** Arrange a virtual or in-person visit from a local wildlife expert, zookeeper, or nature center educator who can discuss real lizard species, their adaptations, and conservation efforts. Have students prepare 5-10 questions in advance related to the lesson.\n\n4. **Adaptation Poster or Digital Presentation:** Students research a real animal from a specific habitat (not the green lizard) and create a detailed poster or slideshow showing its adaptations, food web role, and how it interacts with other organisms. Present to classmates or families.\n\n5. **Nature Walk Scavenger Hunt:** Take the class on a nature walk to observe real animals or evidence of animals (tracks, droppings, food remains, nests). Document observations and create a food web based on the animals found in that specific habitat. Compare to the green lizard's ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
