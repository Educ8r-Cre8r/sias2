Observe and describe the different body parts and colors of a lizard using their senses.\n2. Explain why animals have different colors and patterns on their bodies.\n3. Compare how different animals' body features help them survive in their habitats.\n4. Create a drawing showing an animal adaptation that helps it survive.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the red-and-yellow-throated lizard (one copy for display, or use a projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Hand magnifying glasses (one per pair of students)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or printed poster at the front of the classroom. Do NOT explain what it is yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity (pause for responses after each):\n   - \"What do you notice about this animal? What colors do you see?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this animal has a bright red and yellow throat? What could those colors be used for?\"\n   - \"Does this animal look like it could hide in a rock pile or in a colorful garden? Why?\"\n   - \"What other animals have bright colors or stripes? Why might they look that way?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to tell you this is a lizard. Right now, I want you to think: What do you wonder about why this lizard looks the way it does? What superpower might those bright colors give it?\" \n\n   Have students turn and talk to a partner, then collect 3-4 responses on chart paper titled \"Our Lizard Questions.\"\n\n4. **Teacher note:** Accept all responses without judgment. This activates their prior knowledge and shows you what they already think about animal adaptations.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Today we're going to explore why animals have different colors and body shapes, and we're going to become animal designers ourselves.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One set of colored paper squares per pair (2–3 sheets each of: gray, brown, green, bright red, bright yellow, white, black)\n- Small pieces of cardboard, foam board, or thick paper to serve as \"habitats\" (one per pair):\n  - One piece decorated to look like a rocky/sandy area (glue on sand, small rocks, tan/gray paint)\n  - One piece decorated to look like a garden or leafy area (green paper, leaf cutouts)\n  - One piece decorated to look like a flower garden (bright tissue paper, flower cutouts)\n- Scissors\n- Glue sticks\n- Markers\n- Observation recording sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud and post on chart paper):**\n\n1. \"You and your partner are going to be animal designers. You have three different habitats: a rocky desert, a leafy garden, and a flower garden.\"\n\n2. \"Cut out shapes from your colored paper squares to make a pretend animal that would hide well in ONE of these habitats. Your animal should have a body, a head, and maybe a tail.\"\n\n3. \"Glue your animal onto the habitat where you think it would be hardest for a predator to see it.\"\n\n4. \"Think: What colors did you choose? Why would those colors help your animal hide?\"\n\n5. \"Now, cut out one more animal shape. This time, make it as BRIGHT and COLORFUL as you can using the red, yellow, and white paper. Glue this animal onto a different habitat.\"\n\n6. \"Record on your sheet: Is your bright animal easy or hard to see in this habitat? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Tell me about the colors you picked. Why would that color help here?\" and \"Where would a predator easily spot your bright animal?\"\n- Do NOT tell students what colors to use—let them discover through trying.\n- Listen for reasoning about color and environment; do not correct or confirm yet.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create two animals: one camouflaged, one brightly colored.\n- Students place them in habitats and begin to notice that bright colors are easier to spot and dull colors blend in.\n- Students record simple observations like \"The red animal is easy to see\" or \"Brown hides on rocks.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (17 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Printed photograph of the lizard (display again)\n- Vocabulary card set (one per student pair)\n- Optional: Simple diagram showing the lizard with labels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (7 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3–4 pairs to share their habitats and explain why they chose their colors.\n   - Display their work on a table or wall for all to see.\n   - Affirm their thinking: \"You noticed that bright colors stand out! You noticed that brown and gray blend in!\"\n\n2. **Return to the photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Show the lizard again. \n   - \"Now let's look at this real lizard. What do you notice about its colors?\"\n   - \"The gray and brown parts help it hide on rocks. But look at that bright red and yellow throat! Why would a lizard show bright colors if bright colors don't help you hide?\"\n   - Accept responses (it's for showing off, scaring enemies, talking to other lizards).\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary (5 minutes):**\n   Use simple language and repeat each term 2–3 times, showing the photograph:\n\n   - **Adaptation:** \"An adaptation is a special body part or color that helps an animal survive. This lizard's bright throat is an adaptation. So is its gray back!\"\n   \n   - **Camouflage:** \"Camouflage is when an animal's color or pattern helps it blend in and hide. This lizard's back is camouflage because it looks like rocks.\"\n   \n   - **Defense:** \"Defense means protecting yourself. Some animals use bright colors as a defense—it warns other animals 'Stay away!'\"\n   \n   - **Habitat:** \"A habitat is the place where an animal lives. This lizard's habitat is rocky and sandy places.\"\n   \n   - **Feature or Body part:** \"Features are the special things about an animal's body—like its color, scales, tail, or throat.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show the lizard photo again. \"Point to the camouflage part of this lizard. Now point to the bright colored part. Why do you think it has both?\"\n   - Listen for responses like \"To hide AND to show other lizards\" or \"Different colors do different jobs.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Adaptation** – A special body part or color that helps an animal survive and do what it needs to do.\n- **Camouflage** – Colors or patterns that help an animal blend in and hide from other animals.\n- **Defense** – Something an animal does or has that keeps it safe from danger.\n- **Habitat** – The place where an animal lives and finds food and water.\n- **Feature** – A special part of an animal's body, like its color, shape, scales, or tail.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can point to and name the two different strategies the lizard uses (camouflage and display).\n- Students understand that \"adaptation\" means a body part or color that helps animals survive.\n- Students can give a simple reason for why animals have different colors.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Blank white paper (8.5\" × 11\")\n- Colored pencils, crayons, or markers\n- Animal habitat picture cards or printed images (pictures of: desert, forest, ocean, snow, rainforest—3–5 images)\n- Chart paper with sentence frame (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario introduction (2 minutes):**\n   \"We've learned that animals have colors and body parts that help them survive. Now you're going to design a brand-new animal for a habitat you choose!\"\n\n2. **Student task (12 minutes):**\n   - Each student selects one habitat picture (desert, forest, ocean, rainforest, or snow).\n   - Students draw an animal that would live well in that habitat and color it with features that help it survive there.\n   - Using a sentence frame on the board, students complete: \"My animal lives in a ________ (habitat). I gave it ________ (color/feature) so it can _________ (survive, hide, scare enemies, etc.).\"\n   - Students write or dictate their sentence.\n\n3. **Gallery walk (4 minutes):**\n   - Post all drawings around the room.\n   - Students do a quick walk to see other animals.\n   - Ask: \"Whose animal would hide best in a forest? Whose animal looks the scariest?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Where does your animal live? What color did you choose and why?\"\n- Prompt students to think beyond just hiding: \"Could your animal use bright colors to scare enemies or show off to other animals?\"\n- Record anecdotes of student thinking for assessment notes.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design an animal with features matched to a habitat.\n- Students explain the connection between the animal's appearance and its survival.\n- Evidence of deeper understanding shown through matching features to specific functions (camouflage, defense, communication).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative assessment throughout lesson:**\n   - During Explore: Observe which colors students choose for which habitats and listen to their reasoning.\n   - During Explain: Listen to student responses about the lizard's two color strategies.\n   - During Elaborate: Review drawings and sentence explanations for understanding of adaptation-habitat connection.\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (5–7 minutes):**\n   Show the original lizard photograph one final time. Ask students to respond (orally or draw) to ONE of these questions:\n   \n   - \"This lizard has a gray back and a bright red throat. Which one is camouflage? Which one helps it talk to other lizards?\"\n   - \"If this lizard moved to a bright flower garden, what color would help it hide? Why?\"\n   - \"Draw another animal and show how its colors help it survive.\"\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n   ✓ Student can identify at least one body feature of an animal and explain why it helps that animal survive.\n   ✓ Student understands that different colors do different jobs (hiding vs. showing off).\n   ✓ Student can match an animal's appearance to its habitat or purpose.\n   ✓ Student uses vocabulary like \"camouflage,\" \"adaptation,\" or \"habitat\" in context.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students can point out that the gray helps the lizard hide and the bright colors help it communicate or scare enemies.\n- Students understand that adaptations help animals survive in their habitats.\n- Students demonstrate this by creating or describing animals that match their environments.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n1. **Provide color sorting pre-activity:** Before Explore, spend 5 minutes having students sort colored paper by \"hiding colors\" and \"showing colors\" using simple habitat pictures as a reference. This scaffolds the decision-making in Explore.\n2. **Sentence frame and word bank:** Offer a sentence frame with a visual word bank for writing explanations. Example frame: \"This color ________ (helps hide / shows off) because __________.\" with images and simple words below.\n3. **Pair with a stronger peer:** During Explore and Elaborate, pair struggling students with a peer who can model thinking aloud (\"I'm choosing brown because rocks are brown and it will hide\").\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n1. **Depth extension:** Ask: \"What if your animal needed to hide AND show bright colors? How could it do both?\" (e.g., flap out bright wings, pop out a colored throat like the lizard, change colors). Have them sketch and explain.\n2. **Habitat comparison:** \"Compare two habitats. Design two different versions of the same animal—one for each habitat. How would it change? Why?\"\n3. **Research real animals:** Provide pictures of real animals with interesting adaptations (poison dart frog, zebra, Arctic fox, octopus) and ask: \"What habitat does this animal live in? What do you think its colors do for it?\" Encourage them to share findings with the class.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Camouflage Hunt at Home or Outdoors:** Have students find three things in nature or at home that are camouflaged (pebbles that blend into dirt, a stick that looks like a branch). Take photos or draw them and bring back to class. Create a \"Camouflage Detective\" bulletin board.\n\n2. **Color-Changing Animal Stories:** Students create a short story or comic about an animal that can change colors (like a chameleon or octopus). \"Why does it change colors? What does it hide from? What does it show off?\" Illustrate and share.\n\n3. **Design a Classroom Habitat Diorama:** In groups, students create a shoebox habitat (desert, rainforest, ocean, arctic). They design and place animal cutouts inside that match the habitat. Challenge them to hide some animals so visitors have to hunt for them on a classroom tour.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson leverages the photograph effectively to make abstract concepts (adaptation, camouflage) concrete and observable.\n- The progression from playful exploration (designing animals) to structured explanation (vocabulary) to real-world application (matching features to habitats) scaffolds learning well for Second Grade.\n- Repeat the vocabulary terms frequently and always anchor them back to the lizard photo. Second graders learn through repetition and visual anchors.\n- If students have difficulty with the sentence frame in Elaborate, allow them to draw and tell you their thinking—you record it for them.",
