ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring what animals need to survive and how their bodies help them.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Printed or projected photograph of the vulture\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Optional: pictures of 3-4 other birds (robin, eagle, duck) for comparison\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Tell students: \"I want to show you a very special bird. This bird has an important job in nature—it helps clean up the Earth. Let's look closely at its body.\"\n\n  2. **Ask guiding discussion questions:**\n     - \"What do you notice about this bird's beak? Does it look different from other birds you've seen?\"\n     - \"Look at the wings. What do you think the bird uses its wings for?\"\n     - \"This bird has strong legs and special feet. Why do you think a bird needs strong legs?\"\n     - \"What do you think this bird eats? How would its beak help it eat?\"\n\n  3. **Record student observations** on chart paper as they share. Use their exact language when possible.\n\n  4. **Wonder prompt:** \"This bird is called a vulture. It eats meat from animals that are already dead. How do you think this bird's body parts—its beak, wings, and legs—help it do this job? Let's find out!\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Now we're going to explore how animals use their body parts to survive. We'll become scientists and observe more carefully!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate and discover how different body parts help animals meet their survival needs through hands-on observation and sorting.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Large printed copies of the vulture photograph (one per pair/small group)\n  - Picture cards of animals with different body parts visible (provided or drawn by teacher): owl, duck, hawk, woodpecker, hummingbird, etc.\n  - Magnifying glasses or hand lenses (optional but encouraged)\n  - Three large sorting mats or poster paper labeled: \"Wings,\" \"Beaks,\" \"Legs\"\n  - Chart paper and colored pencils/crayons for recording\n  - **Real or model objects** that could represent animal body parts: feathers (real if available), a plastic beak or hook shape, a hard claw or foot model\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Part 1: Close Observation (10 minutes)**\n  \n  1. Distribute the large vulture photograph to each small group (2-3 students).\n  \n  2. Give students explicit directions: \"Use your magnifying glasses to look very, very carefully at one body part at a time. First, look at the wings. Describe what you see. How are the feathers arranged? Is the wing big or small? Draw what you see.\"\n  \n  3. Repeat for the beak: \"Now look at the beak. Is it straight or curved? Is it pointed or flat? What do you think this shape is good for?\" Students sketch the beak.\n  \n  4. Repeat for the legs: \"Look at the legs and feet. Are they thick or thin? What color are they? Why might this bird need strong legs?\"\n  \n  5. **Record:** Each student draws the vulture's three main body parts and labels them (with teacher help as needed).\n\n  **Part 2: Sorting by Body Parts (10 minutes)**\n  \n  1. Display the three sorting mats (labeled \"Wings,\" \"Beaks,\" \"Legs\").\n  \n  2. Distribute picture cards of different birds to the group.\n  \n  3. Give clear directions: \"Look at each bird picture. Which body part does it remind you of most? Does it have BIG wings like the vulture? A special beak? Strong legs? Sort the cards onto the mats.\"\n  \n  4. As students sort, ask follow-up questions: \"Why did you put the eagle with the wings? What are those wings good for?\" Encourage use of words like \"fly,\" \"hunt,\" \"find food,\" \"strong,\" \"curved,\" \"sharp.\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate and ask questions without telling answers (\"What do you notice about that beak?\").\n  - Help students describe what they see using sensory words.\n  - Record student language on a chart for use in the Explain phase.\n  - Provide hand-over-hand support with pencils/drawing if needed.\n  - Validate all observations and drawings as \"scientist work.\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Sketches of the vulture showing wings, beak, and legs (may be simple but identifiable).\n  - Verbal statements connecting body parts to function (e.g., \"Wings help fly,\" \"Beak helps eat,\" \"Legs help stand\").\n  - Sorted picture cards showing emerging understanding of how body parts vary across birds.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and reinforce concepts observed during exploration using the photograph as an anchor.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Large vulture photograph (displayed throughout)\n  - Chart paper with student observations from Explore phase\n  - Picture cards of the vulture with body parts labeled (pre-made or created with students during this phase)\n  - Vocabulary cards with pictures and words\n  - Small whiteboards or paper for each student to copy vocabulary words/drawings\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):** Gather students and ask:\n     - \"What did you discover about the vulture's wings? How do you think they help it?\"\n     - \"Tell me about the beak. What shape is it? Why is that shape helpful?\"\n     - \"Why does this bird need strong legs?\"\n     \n     Celebrate correct observations and use this to build toward vocabulary.\n\n  2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):** Present each term with the vulture photograph as reference:\n\n     | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **How It Connects to Vulture** |\n     |----------|--------|--------|\n     | **External parts** (or \"outside parts\") | The parts you can see on the outside of an animal's body | Wings, beak, legs, feathers |\n     | **Wings** | Flat, feathered body parts that help birds fly through the air | The vulture's big wings help it fly high to find food |\n     | **Beak** | The hard, pointed part of a bird's mouth used for eating | The vulture's curved beak is perfect for tearing meat |\n     | **Legs and feet** | Strong body parts that help an animal stand, walk, and hold things | The vulture's strong legs help it stand on the ground |\n     | **Survival** | To stay alive and healthy | Animals use their body parts to survive—finding food and staying safe |\n\n  3. **Check for Understanding (5 minutes):** Use these strategies:\n     - Point to each body part on the photograph and ask: \"What is this called? What does it do?\"\n     - Play \"If-Then\": \"If a vulture has a curved beak, then it can ___.\" (Students fill in: tear food, eat meat, etc.)\n     - Have students act out: \"Show me with your arms how a vulture's wings move.\" (Students flap arms.)\n     - Quick drawing: \"Draw the vulture's beak. Why is it curved?\"\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **External parts:** The body parts you can see on the outside of an animal.\n  - **Wings:** Feathered body parts that help birds fly.\n  - **Beak:** A hard, pointed part of a bird's mouth used for eating.\n  - **Legs and feet:** Strong parts that help an animal stand, walk, and grab things.\n  - **Survival:** To stay alive and stay healthy by meeting your needs.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students can point to and name the vulture's wings, beak, and legs.\n  - Students can tell one way each body part helps the vulture survive (with teacher prompting if needed).\n  - Students use vocabulary words in simple sentences (\"The beak helps the bird eat\" or \"Wings help fly\").\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a simple tool that mimics an animal's body part to solve a real-world problem.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - **For each small group:**\n    - Plastic straws or rolled paper (to create a \"beak\" tool)\n    - Craft feathers or paper scraps (optional decoration)\n    - Paper clips or clothespins (as alternative \"beak\" models)\n    - String or tape\n    - Cotton balls or small foam pieces (representing \"food\" to pick up)\n    - Small containers or bowls\n    - Chart paper and markers\n  - **Real-world problem cards** (images or simple text):\n    - \"A bird needs to pick up seeds from the ground\"\n    - \"A bird needs to hold twigs to build a nest\"\n    - \"A bird needs to tear fruit for breakfast\"\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Present the Challenge (2 minutes):** Show students the problem card. For example: \"This bird needs a tool that works like a beak to pick up small seeds from the ground. You are going to design and build a tool that works like the vulture's beak!\"\n\n  2. **Model the Design Process (3 minutes):**\n     - Show students how to fold or bend a straw slightly, or show how clothespins open and close like a beak.\n     - Say: \"Look—when I squeeze this clothespin, it opens like a beak opening. When I let go, it closes. This could pick up seeds!\"\n     - Let students handle and explore materials before designing.\n\n  3. **Student Design Time (8 minutes):**\n     - Working in small groups or pairs, students select materials and build their \"beak tool.\"\n     - Teacher provides minimal instruction: \"What body part are you copying? How will it work?\"\n     - Students should attempt to use their tool to pick up or move cotton balls (\"seeds\") into a container.\n     - Encourage testing and adjusting: \"Did it work? What can we change to make it better?\"\n\n  4. **Test and Share (5 minutes):**\n     - Each group tests their tool and records results on chart paper with a simple drawing and one sentence: \"Our beak tool can ___.\"\n     - Groups present: \"We made a tool like a vulture's beak. It ___ [works/doesn't work] because ___.\"\n\n  5. **Reflection Prompt:** \"How is your tool similar to the vulture's beak? How did knowing about the vulture's body help you make your tool?\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Facilitate exploration without solving the problem.\n  - Ask guiding questions: \"How does the vulture's beak move? How can we make our tool move that way?\"\n  - Encourage iteration: \"What would happen if we tried ___ instead?\"\n  - Document student designs with photos or drawings for assessment.\n  - Celebrate effort and problem-solving, not just perfect results.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - A simple constructed tool (may be crude but functional or close to functional).\n  - Evidence of trying to mimic a vulture's body part.\n  - Verbal or written explanation connecting their tool to how the vulture survives.\n  - Observation that body parts have specific shapes because of what animals need to do.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of how external body parts help animals survive.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n  - Observation during Explore: Do students identify wings, beak, and legs? Can they describe what they see?\n  - Questioning during Explain: Do students respond correctly when you point to body parts?\n  - Participation in Elaborate: Do students attempt to design a tool mimicking an animal body part? Do they test it?\n\n  **Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes at the end of the lesson):**\n  \n  Provide each student with a simple paper split into three sections, each labeled with a vulture body part picture. Ask:\n  \n  - **Show me:** Draw or point to the vulture's [wing/beak/leg].\n  - **Tell me:** This body part helps the vulture ___.\n  - **Options provided** (for struggling readers/writers):\n    - Fly / Find food / Stand still\n    - Tear meat / Fly / Hold things\n    - Stand / Walk / Hold things\n\n  **Summative Assessment Option (if time allows):**\n  \n  Read aloud and have students respond with thumbs up/down or yes/no:\n  - \"The vulture's wings help it fly. Is that right?\" (Yes)\n  - \"The vulture uses its beak to run fast. Is that right?\" (No)\n  - \"Legs help the vulture stand on the ground. Is that right?\" (Yes)\n  - \"A curved beak is good for tearing food. Is that right?\" (Yes)\n\n  **Success Criteria:**\n  - Students correctly identify at least 2 of 3 body parts on the vulture.\n  - Students can state at least one way a body part helps the vulture survive (with visual or verbal support).\n  - Students demonstrate understanding that body parts have specific functions.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Completed exit ticket showing knowledge of vulture body parts and their functions.\n  - Verbal responses indicating understanding of structure-function relationship.\n  - Transfer of learning evident in Elaborate phase (tool design mimicking animal structures).\n  - Use of vocabulary terms in context (wings, beak, legs, external parts, survival).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support:**\n\n- **Vocabulary Support:** Provide picture-word cards students can point to instead of writing or speaking. Use repetition and multisensory approaches (say the word, show the picture, have students repeat while pointing to the actual body part on the vulture photo).\n\n- **Drawing Support:** Allow students to trace body parts from the photograph using tracing paper, or provide pre-drawn outlines to label instead of drawing from scratch. Accept simple sketches and marks—the goal is identification, not artistic accuracy.\n\n- **Partner/Small Group Work:** Pair struggling students with more verbal peers during discussions and Elaborate activities. Reduce task complexity by focusing on ONE body part at a time (just wings, for example) before expanding to three.\n\n- **Concrete Manipulatives:** Provide real feathers, plastic beaks (toy bird parts), or model legs for students to handle and explore tactilely, not just view pictures. This supports kinesthetic and tactile learners.\n\n**Challenge:**\n\n- **Comparative Analysis:** Have advanced students compare the vulture to another bird (e.g., hummingbird, pelican) using a Venn diagram or simple comparison chart. Ask: \"How are their beaks different? Why?\" This extends to 3-LS3-2 (environment influences traits) and 1-LS1-2 (parent-offspring patterns).\n\n- **Extended Design Challenge:** Task advanced students with designing a multi-part tool that mimics BOTH a beak and talons/feet (e.g., a tool that both grips and tears). Require them to test it multiple ways and explain why each part is necessary.\n\n- **Behavior Research:** Have advanced students observe live birds (in a school courtyard, park, or nature video) and sketch how their beaks are different from the vulture's and hypothesize why. Create a simple \"beak gallery\" poster comparing different bird beaks to different jobs.\n\n- **Reader Responsibility:** Assign more independent reading from accessible texts (leveled readers, picture books about vultures or scavengers) and have them create a \"field guide page\" showing the vulture and labeling its parts with brief descriptive sentences.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bird Beak Exploration Station:** Set up a classroom table with 4-5 different plastic or wooden beaks/tools (tweezers, forceps, chopsticks, clothespins, small scoops). Provide different \"foods\" to pick up: seeds, crumbs, water beads, pom-poms. Students try each tool and record which beak is best for each food. This extends learning about adaptation and specialization without relying solely on the vulture.\n\n2. **Animal Body Part Matching Game:** Create a matching game where students match animals (crow, duck, hummingbird, penguin, hawk) to pictures of their body parts and what those parts help them do. Use the same body-part words (wings, beak, legs) to show how different animals' parts are different shapes but serve similar functions.\n\n3. **\"If I Were a Vulture\" Writing/Drawing Activity:** Students complete the sentence frame: \"If I were a vulture, my [wings/beak/legs] would help me ___.\" Encourage them to draw a picture and dictate or write one sentence. This is homework-friendly and reinforces vocabulary and function.\n\n4. **Scavenger Hunt in Nature (if possible) or with Pictures:** Create a \"bird body parts hunt\" where students find pictures or real examples of feathers, bird nests (showing how legs/feet help), and bird food (relating to beaks). They photograph or sketch and bring back findings to discuss: \"What body part would help a bird get this food?\"\n\n5. **Guest Reader or Expert Connection:** Invite a local wildlife educator, birder, or even a stuffed/mounted bird specimen from a museum for students to observe closely. This real-world expert can answer questions about how different birds' bodies help them survive.\n\n6. **Vulture vs. Other Birds Chart:** As a class, create a large chart comparing the vulture to one other bird (e.g., a robin). Students illustrate both and compare: \"Which bird has a bigger beak? Longer legs? Bigger wings? Why do you think?\" Scaffolds comparative thinking and reinforces structure-function.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\n- This lesson honors first-graders' natural curiosity about animals and their bodies. The photograph is central—return to it frequently.\n- Vultures are excellent examples because their specialized beak and scavenging behavior are visually obvious and promote discussion about how bodies are \"shaped by their jobs.\"\n- Emphasize that animals are not scary but are important; this builds positive attitudes about wildlife and ecosystems.\n- The 5E model ensures students discover concepts through observation before formal terminology is introduced, supporting deeper understanding and retention.\n- Differentiation allows access for all learners—be flexible with output modes (drawing vs. writing, verbal vs. written, hands-on vs. observational).",
