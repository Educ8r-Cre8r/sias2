  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: What Do Living Things Need?\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Animals Need Specific Habitats:** The dragonfly is found among plants and grass, showing that animals live in places that provide what they need to survive.\n- **Plants as Part of Animal Habitats:** Green plants and vegetation surround the dragonfly, demonstrating that animals depend on plants for shelter, food, and protection.\n- **Observable Characteristics Help Identify Needs:** The dragonfly's location near water-loving plants suggests a connection between where animals live and what they need (like water and shelter).\n- **Diversity of Life in One Place:** Multiple plant types and one insect in a small area show that many living things share the same habitat and have different survival needs.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Where Do Dragonflies Live? Exploring Habitats and Survival Needs**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 30-40 minute sessions\n- **NGSS Standards:** K-LS1-1: Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Observe and describe what they see in a photograph of a dragonfly in plants\n- Identify at least two things a dragonfly needs to survive based on observations\n- Explain why animals need plants in their habitats\n- Make simple predictions about where other animals might live and what they need\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about where animals live and what they need by introducing the dragonfly photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color photograph of the dragonfly in plants (or digital display)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph on a large screen or printed on poster board at student eye level. Say: \"Today we're going to be nature detectives and figure out where this special insect likes to live and what it might need!\"\n\n2. Give students 1-2 minutes of silent observation time. Ask them to look carefully without talking.\n\n3. Facilitate a group discussion with these specific guiding questions:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture?\" (Accept all observations: green plants, brown stems, a colorful bug, etc.)\n   - \"Where is the dragonfly? What is around it?\" (Guide them to notice the plants and grass.)\n   - \"Why do you think the dragonfly is sitting on these plants? What might it need?\" (Accept predictions like food, a place to rest, hiding from other animals.)\n   - \"If we took away all the plants, what would happen to the dragonfly?\" (Help them think about shelter and safety.)\n\n4. Wonder prompt: \"I wonder... what else does this dragonfly need to stay healthy and alive? Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to explore and discover what animals really need by looking at pictures and thinking like scientists!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover what animals need to survive through hands-on observation and exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photographs showing: plants, water, animals eating food, animals resting/sleeping, animals hiding from predators (5-6 images total)\n- The original dragonfly photograph\n- Chart paper labeled \"What Do Living Things Need?\"\n- Crayons, markers, colored pencils\n- Drawing paper for each student\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up exploration stations.** Arrange 5-6 picture cards around the room showing:\n   - A plant or flower (represents food/shelter)\n   - Water (pond, stream, or raindrop)\n   - An animal eating (represents food)\n   - An animal sleeping or resting (represents rest/shelter)\n   - An animal hiding in plants or a burrow (represents protection)\n   - An animal with its parent (represents care/safety)\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Walk quietly around the room. Look at each picture.\"\n   - \"Point to the picture and say what you see. What do you think the animal needs?\"\n   - \"When you find a picture that shows something the dragonfly might need, remember it in your head.\"\n\n3. **Guided observation of the dragonfly photo:** Bring students back together and ask:\n   - \"Look at the dragonfly again. Which pictures we saw show things it might need?\"\n   - \"Does it need a place to rest? (Plants!) Does it need food? (Yes! Plants have bugs for food!) Does it need water? (Probably!)\"\n\n4. **Recording and documentation:**\n   - Provide each student with drawing paper.\n   - Say: \"Draw a picture of the dragonfly. Then draw one thing you think it needs to survive.\"\n   - As students draw, circulate and ask: \"What did you draw? Why does the dragonfly need that?\"\n   - Collect drawings to observe student thinking.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to listen to student observations without correcting.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"What makes you think that?\" and \"Where do you see that in the photo?\"\n- Guide students to notice the plants in the background and their importance.\n- Accept all reasonable predictions; science is about careful observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will identify 1-2 basic needs (food, shelter, water, or rest).\n- Students will make simple drawings showing their thinking.\n- Students will verbally connect observations from the photo to animal needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and clarify concepts about animal survival needs after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The dragonfly photograph\n- Chart paper with \"What Do Animals Need to Survive?\" as the title\n- Picture symbols (drawn or printed): water droplet, food item, shelter/home, rest/sleep\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore phase:**\n   - Invite 4-5 students to share their drawings.\n   - Ask: \"What does this student think the dragonfly needs?\" Write their responses on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with definitions:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives; it has everything the animal needs (e.g., the plants and grass where the dragonfly lives).\n   - **Shelter:** A safe, protected place to rest and hide from danger (the plants keep the dragonfly safe).\n   - **Food:** What animals eat to get energy to move and grow (the dragonfly eats tiny insects).\n   - **Water:** A liquid that all living things need to stay healthy (dragonflies live near water).\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the plants: \"This is the dragonfly's habitat! It has plants for shelter and hiding.\"\n   - Point to the leaves and grass: \"These plants also attract tiny bugs that the dragonfly eats.\"\n   - Explain: \"Dragonflies live near water. They need water to lay their eggs and find food.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding strategy:**\n   - Ask students to show a thumbs up, thumbs sideways, or thumbs down when you say: \"A dragonfly needs plants to hide in. Is that right?\"\n   - Repeat with 2-3 other statements about animal needs.\n   - Address any misconceptions immediately with the photograph as reference.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will understand that animals have survival needs: food, water, shelter, and rest.\n- Students will know that a habitat is where an animal lives and has what it needs.\n- Students will connect the dragonfly's habitat (the plants) to its survival needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by exploring other animals' needs and habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of 4-5 different animals and their habitats (bird in tree, fish in water, squirrel with nuts, rabbit in grass, bee on flowers)\n- Chart paper divided into columns labeled with each animal\n- Markers or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-world application:** Say: \"Now we know what the dragonfly needs. Let's think about other animals!\"\n\n2. **Show picture cards one at a time.** For each animal, ask:\n   - \"Where does this animal live?\" (habitat)\n   - \"What does it need to survive?\" (food, water, shelter, rest)\n   - \"Can you find these things in its habitat?\"\n\n3. **Create a class comparison chart:**\n   - Draw or display pictures of 3-4 animals (bird, fish, squirrel, rabbit).\n   - For each one, draw simple pictures or write words showing: food, water, shelter, rest.\n   - Ask: \"Do all animals need the same things?\" (Yes!) \"Do they find these things in the same places?\" (No—different habitats!)\n\n4. **Guided discussion:**\n   - \"A bird needs a tree for shelter. A fish needs water for shelter. Why are their habitats different?\"\n   - \"Where does a fish find water? Where does a bird find water?\"\n\n5. **Student application task (choice-based):**\n   - **Option A:** Students pick an animal card and draw its habitat, labeling what it needs.\n   - **Option B:** Students act out an animal and the class guesses what habitat and needs they're showing.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion without giving all answers—guide students to observe and think.\n- Use the dragonfly photo as a reference point: \"Remember how the dragonfly had plants? What does this animal have in its habitat?\"\n- Ask open-ended questions to encourage deeper thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will recognize that all animals need food, water, shelter, and rest.\n- Students will understand that different animals find these needs in different habitats.\n- Students will apply their learning to new animals and contexts.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal survival needs and habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- Observe student drawings and listen to their explanations during Explore.\n- Use thumbs up/sideways/down checks during Explain to gauge understanding.\n- Listen to student contributions during Elaborate discussions.\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment:**\nAt the end of the lesson, ask each student individually or in small groups:\n\n1. **\"Look at the dragonfly picture again. What does it need to survive?\"** (Accept: food, water, shelter, plants to hide in, or similar responses.)\n\n2. **\"Why do you think the dragonfly lives in the plants?\"** (Accept: It hides there, it finds food there, it's safe, it rests there.)\n\n3. **\"If all the plants went away, what would happen to the dragonfly?\"** (Accept: It would have no shelter, no food, no place to hide, it couldn't survive.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least ONE survival need (food, water, shelter, or rest).\n- ✓ Student connects the dragonfly's habitat (plants) to at least one survival need.\n- ✓ Student explains why the habitat is important for the animal's survival.\n- ✓ Student uses observations from the photograph to support their thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most kindergarten students will identify shelter/plants as a survival need.\n- Students will make simple but logical connections between habitat and survival.\n- Students will describe at least two reasons why animals need the places where they live.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding through drawings, verbal responses, and discussion participation.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n- Provide sentence stems: \"The dragonfly needs _____ to survive.\" or \"The dragonfly lives in _____ because _____.\"\n- Use only 2-3 key vocabulary words instead of all five; focus on \"habitat,\" \"shelter,\" and \"food.\"\n- Pair students with peers or an adult during exploration to provide verbal scaffolding and model observation language.\n- Offer pre-drawn outlines or templates for the drawing activity so students focus on observing and labeling rather than drawing from scratch.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n- Ask: \"What do YOU need to survive? Do you have a habitat like the dragonfly does? Where do you find food, water, and shelter?\"\n- Have students compare and contrast two different animal habitats: \"How is a bird's habitat different from a fish's habitat? How is it the same?\"\n- Encourage students to research (with picture books or teacher guidance): \"Dragonflies lay eggs in water. Why do you think they need to go to water?\"\n- Ask students to predict: \"If we moved a dragonfly to a desert with no plants, what would happen? Why?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Habitat Diorama or Shoebox Display:**\n   Students create a small habitat model in a shoebox showing where a chosen animal lives and what it needs. They include plants, water, shelter, and food sources. Students present their habitat and explain why each element is important for their animal's survival.\n\n2. **Nature Walk and Observation:**\n   Take students on a short, supervised nature walk (schoolyard, garden, or park). Have them observe real animals (insects, birds, squirrels) and their habitats. Discuss: \"Where is this animal living? What do you see around it? What do you think it needs here?\" Document observations with photos or simple sketches and create a class \"Habitats We Found\" poster.\n\n3. **\"Design a Habitat\" Dramatic Play Center:**\n   Set up a creative center where students use natural materials (sticks, leaves, grass, sand, water table) to build habitats for toy animals. Ask: \"Does your habitat have shelter? Food? Water? Is it a good home for this animal?\" This extends the concept to hands-on construction and problem-solving.\n\n---",
