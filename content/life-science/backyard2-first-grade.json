Green grass grows in one part of the yard.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe **Anchoring Phenomenon** is plant growth and diversity in a garden ecosystem. Plants are growing because they have what they need to survive: sunlight, water, air, and nutrients from soil. Different types of plants grow in different parts of the garden because they have different needs. Some plants need more water, some need more sun, and some grow better in certain types of soil. This creates a diverse garden community where many different living things can thrive together.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Living vs. Non-Living Things:** Plants are living things that grow, need water and sunlight, and can make new plants. Rocks and soil are non-living but help plants grow.\n\n2. **Plant Needs:** All plants need sunlight, water, air, and nutrients from soil to survive and grow. Without these things, plants will not stay healthy.\n\n3. **Plant Diversity:** Different types of plants have different shapes, sizes, and colors. This helps them survive in different places and conditions.\n\n4. **Habitats:** A garden is a habitat where plants and animals live together. Each living thing has what it needs to survive in this space.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"See, Think, Wonder\" routine with this image. Have students observe what they see, share what they think is happening, and ask questions about what they wonder. This builds scientific thinking skills.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to share observations: drawing, verbal sharing, or using simple science vocabulary cards with pictures. This supports all learners in expressing their scientific thinking.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** Inside the plant roots, tiny root hairs are absorbing water and nutrients from the soil. The plant's cells are using sunlight to make food through photosynthesis, even though we cannot see this process happening.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This garden is part of a larger neighborhood ecosystem. Birds, bees, and other animals visit this garden for food and shelter. The plants here are connected to the bigger food web in the area.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** Plants eat soil like animals eat food.\n   **Clarification:** Plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and air. They get nutrients from soil, but soil is not their food.\n\n2. **Misconception:** All plants need the same amount of water and sunlight.\n   **Clarification:** Different plants have different needs. Some need lots of water, others need less. Some need full sun, others grow better in shade.\n\n3. **Misconception:** Plants don't need air.\n   **Clarification:** Plants need air (carbon dioxide) to make their food, just like animals need air (oxygen) to breathe.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** 1-LS1-1: Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n- **Disciplinary Core Idea:** [[NGSS:DCI:1-LS1.A]] - All organisms have external parts that they use to perform daily functions.\n- **Crosscutting Concept:** [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] - The shape and stability of structures of natural objects are related to their function.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you notice about the different plants in this garden? (Bloom's: Observe | DOK: 1)\n\n2. Why do you think some flowers are orange and others are white? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. What would happen to these plants if they didn't get water for many days? (Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 2)\n\n4. How is this garden like a home for plants and animals? (Bloom's: Compare | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Habitat:** A place where plants and animals live and get what they need to survive\n* **Nutrients:** Special things in soil that help plants grow strong and healthy\n* **Roots:** The parts of plants that grow underground and take in water\n* **Survive:** To stay alive by getting food, water, and shelter\n* **Diversity:** Having many different types of living things in one place\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- From Seed to Plant by Gail Gibbons\n- The Tiny Seed by Eric Carle\n- Plants Can't Sit Still by Rebecca E.
