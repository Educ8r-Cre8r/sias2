  "content": "# Engineering Design Challenge from Pollination Photo\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n- A honeybee (brown and gold striped body, visible legs and wings) on a purple flower\n- Purple flower with many small, densely packed petals clustered in the center\n- Green foliage and blurred garden background\n- Bee's position: angled toward the flower's center where pollen would be concentrated\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n- **From bee's body structure**: The bee's hairy body and leg position suggest it is collecting pollen as it moves across the flower—hairs trap pollen particles.\n- **From flower's petal density**: The tightly clustered petals indicate the flower is designed to hold pollen and position it where visiting insects will contact it.\n- **From bee-flower interaction**: The bee needs reliable access to the flower's center; flowers must be stable and accessible enough for pollinators to land and feed safely.\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2: Build a Flower Landing Pad**\nDesign a purple flower out of paper or fabric that a toy bee can land on safely. Make sure your flower has a soft, bumpy center where the \"pollen\" (glitter or sand) sticks to the bee. Test: Can your bee toy stay on the flower when you tilt it gently?\n\n**3-5: Design a Pollinator-Friendly Flower Structure**\nEngineer a model flower that:\n- Has a landing platform (petal cluster) at least 3 cm wide that supports a small toy bee without tipping\n- Features a textured center (using sandpaper, velcro, or bumpy material) that traps and transfers \"pollen\" (salt or glitter) to the bee's body\n- Remains stable when tilted 30 degrees (to simulate wind or uneven landing)\n\nSuccess criteria: Pollen transfers to the bee after 3 landings, and the flower stays upright. Test and redesign until both goals are met.\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem** — This photo captures a real-world need: flowers must be structurally sound and accessible for pollinators to land, feed, and transfer pollen. Students begin by observing *why* the flower's shape and texture matter, then define the engineering challenge of creating a reliable pollinator landing system. This anchors the entire design process in observable biology.\n\n### Suggested Materials\n- Colored paper or tissue paper (purple, green)\n- Pipe cleaners or craft wire (bee body/legs)\n- Sandpaper, velcro, or textured fabric (flower center)\n- Salt, glitter, or sand (pollen simulant)\n- Tape and glue\n- Small plastic or foam base (flower stem/support)\n\n### Estimated Time\n**45–60 minutes** (single session) or **Two 30-minute sessions** (design day + test & redesign day)\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS 3-5-ETS1-1** (*Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want*) by having students identify the structural and functional requirements of a flower through observation, then engineer a solution that mimics nature's pollination strategy.",
