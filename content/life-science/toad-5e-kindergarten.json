ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student interest and activate prior knowledge about toads and what animals need to survive.\n\n#### Materials\n- Large printed or projected image of the toad photograph (color, clear)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: Real toad in a container (if accessible; otherwise use only the photo)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display the Photograph:**\n- Show the photograph on a large screen or printed poster at eye level for all students to see clearly.\n- Point out the toad's position near plants and on the ground. Say: *\"Look at this special animal. Have you ever seen something like this before? What do you notice?\"*\n\n**Discussion Questions (calibrated for Kindergarten):**\n1. *\"What is this animal called? What do you already know about toads?\"* (Accept all responses—students may know nothing, and that's okay.)\n2. *\"Look closely at its skin. What does it feel like? Why do you think it looks bumpy?\"* (Encourage descriptive language without correcting.)\n3. *\"Where do you think this toad lives? What do you see around it in the picture?\"* (Guide them to notice plants, branches, ground.)\n4. *\"What do you think this toad needs to be healthy and happy, just like you need food and water?\"* (Record their predictions on chart paper for later reference.)\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\nSay: *\"I wonder why toads have bumpy skin and big eyes. I wonder where they sleep and what they eat. Today, we're going to be toad scientists and find out!\"*\n\n#### Transition\n*\"Let's explore toads up close and discover what helps them live.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate toad body parts and habitats through hands-on observation and model-building.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Per student or pair:**\n  - Toad observation worksheet (simple line drawing of a toad with labels for body parts: skin, eyes, legs, mouth)\n  - Crayons or colored pencils\n  - Small plastic toy toad or toad picture card (laminated, durable)\n  - Sensory exploration items: textured paper (bumpy sandpaper, smooth paper), wet sponge, spray bottle with water\n- **For habitat exploration:**\n  - Shallow tray or small container\n  - Soil or sand\n  - Small rocks\n  - Fake or real plant cuttings (safe, non-toxic)\n  - Water cup\n  - Pictures of toad habitats (printed, 4–5 images showing pond edges, wet ground, under logs, etc.)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part 1: Toad Body Parts (8–10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute observation worksheet and toad image card.** Say: *\"You are going to be a toad detective. Look at the toad picture and describe what you see.\"*\n\n2. **Guide observation with prompts:**\n   - *\"Touch the bumpy sandpaper. Now look at the toad's skin. It's bumpy too! Color the skin bumpy if you want.\"*\n   - *\"Find the toad's eyes. Why are they big? Let's see if you can think like a toad—big eyes help you see insects to eat!\"*\n   - *\"Look at the legs. Toads have strong back legs. Can you hop like a toad?\"* (Quick movement break—students hop in place.)\n\n3. **Students color or draw on their worksheet, labeling what they observe.** Teacher circulates, asking: *\"What do you notice about the toad's [body part]?\"*\n\n**Part 2: Toad Habitat Exploration (12–15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up 2–3 habitat exploration stations** around the room (rotation-based or all students work simultaneously depending on class size).\n\n2. **Station 1 — Sensory Exploration:**\n   - Students feel bumpy sandpaper (like toad skin) and smooth paper.\n   - They spray water on the sponge and notice dampness.\n   - **Observation prompt:** *\"Toads like wet places. What feels wet and damp? Where would a toad want to live?\"*\n\n3. **Station 2 — Habitat Building:**\n   - Students place toy toad in a shallow tray and create a habitat using soil, rocks, plants, and water.\n   - **Instruction:** *\"Build a home where a toad can find food, hide, and stay wet. What does it need?\"*\n   - **Teacher question while students build:** *\"Why did you put water there? Why did you add a rock?\"* (Listen for understanding of toad needs.)\n\n4. **Station 3 — Habitat Picture Sorting:**\n   - Students look at 4–5 pictures of toad habitats and place a toy toad where they think it belongs.\n   - **Prompt:** *\"Which picture shows a good home for a toad? Why?\"*\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- **Circulate to each station** without directing answers. Use phrases like: *\"Tell me what you're thinking,\" \"Why did you choose that?\" \"What happens when...?\"*\n- **Document observations:** Take brief notes on which students describe toad needs (water, food, shelter) and which need more prompting.\n- **Encourage discovery language:** *\"You discovered that toads like wet places! What else are you discovering?\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students will have completed an observation worksheet showing toad body parts.\n- Students will have created a simple habitat model containing at least two elements (water, shelter, or plants).\n- Students will have manipulated and explored textures, connecting bumpy skin to the environment.\n- Informal data: Teacher notes on student understanding of why toads need water and shelter.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and make explicit connections between observations and toad survival needs.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper (3 sheets, pre-labeled with headers: \"What Toads Eat,\" \"Where Toads Live,\" \"What Toads Need\")\n- Markers\n- Vocabulary picture cards (illustrated): toad, habitat, skin, camouflage, insect, water\n- Photograph of toad from lesson start\n- Student habitat models from Explore phase (bring to carpet for reference)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out (5–7 minutes):**\n\n1. **Gather students on carpet.** Display the toad photograph again.\n2. **Ask:** *\"What did you discover about toads when we explored? Let's share what we found out.\"*\n3. **Facilitate student sharing:**\n   - *\"Who built a habitat? What did you put in it? Why?\"* (3–4 students share briefly.)\n   - *\"What does a toad need to stay healthy?\"* (Record their responses on chart paper under three headings.)\n\n**Teacher-Led Explanation (8–10 minutes):**\n\n1. **Introduce key vocabulary with visual supports:**\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n   - **Toad:** A small animal with bumpy skin that hops and lives on the ground. It's like a frog but bumpier!\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. A toad's habitat has water, plants, and soft ground.\n   - **Skin:** The outer part that covers a toad's body. A toad's bumpy skin helps it hide in dirt and stay damp.\n   - **Insect:** A tiny animal with six legs, like a fly or cricket. Toads eat insects for food.\n   - **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or bumpy texture matches its home so it's hard to see. Toad bumps help it hide!\n\n2. **Make explicit connections to the photograph:**\n   - *\"Look at the toad's bumpy skin in the picture. The bumps match the dirt and plants around it. This helps the toad hide from animals that might eat it. That's called camouflage.\"*\n   - *\"See the insects on that branch? The toad's big eyes help it spot tiny insects to eat. That's how it gets energy.\"*\n   - *\"Notice there are plants and wet ground around the toad. Toads need water to stay healthy, and plants give them places to hide.\"*\n\n3. **Connect to previous predictions:**\n   - Revisit the chart from Engage phase: *\"Remember what you predicted toads need? Let's see if you were right!\"* (Check off predictions that align with what they discovered.)\n\n#### Check for Understanding Strategy\n- **Quick visual response:** *\"Show me with your hands—make bumps on your arm like a toad's skin!\"* (Kinesthetic check.)\n- **Thumbs signal:** *\"Thumbs up if you think toads like wet places. Thumbs sideways if you're not sure.\"* (Assess and note who needs clarification.)\n- **Repeat-back prompt:** *\"Tell your neighbor one thing a toad needs to live.\"* (Listen to partner conversations.)\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students can name 2–3 things toads need (water, food, shelter).\n- Students understand the relationship between toad bumpy skin and hiding in their habitat.\n- Students use vocabulary (toad, habitat, skin, insect) in context with teacher support.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply their understanding of toad survival needs to a new scenario and deepen their thinking about animal adaptation.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Per small group:**\n  - Picture scenario cards (4 different habitats: dry desert, wet swamp, rocky mountain, leafy garden)\n  - Token counters or dried beans\n  - Chart: \"Is this a good home for a toad?\" with columns for Yes/No/Why\n- **Optional craft materials:**\n  - Paper plates, construction paper, markers, tape, dried plants (optional for creative extension)\n  - Simple toad puppet template (pre-drawn body; students add features)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part 1: Habitat Decision-Making (8–10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display scenario cards one at a time** showing different habitats: desert, swamp, mountain, garden.\n2. **For each habitat, ask:**\n   - *\"Would a toad be happy living here? Why or why not?\"*\n   - *\"Does it have water? Does it have places to hide? Does it have insects to eat?\"*\n3. **Students vote with their bodies:** *\"If you think this is a good home for a toad, hop to this side of the room. If not, hop to the other side.\"* (Movement + reasoning.)\n4. **After voting, ask 2–3 students:** *\"Why did you choose that side?\"* (Listen for evidence: mentions of water, food, shelter, matching colors/bumps.)\n\n**Part 2: Create-a-Toad-Home Activity (7–10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide into small groups (3–4 students).** Distribute \"Is this a good home for a toad?\" chart.\n2. **Show a picture of one habitat (e.g., swamp).** Ask: *\"What does this toad home need to have so the toad survives? What would we add?\"*\n3. **Students brainstorm together** and mark the chart Yes/No and explain why.\n4. **If time allows,** students create a simple toad home collage on a paper plate using provided craft materials (construction paper for plants, blue paper for water, etc.), labeling what they added and why.\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- **Facilitate discussion** without confirming/denying answers immediately. Say: *\"That's an interesting idea. Tell me more about why you think that.\"*\n- **Prompt reasoning:** *\"What does a toad need to survive that we learned about today?\"* (Redirect to prior learning.)\n- **Circulate during craft activity:** Ask: *\"What are you building? Why did you choose that?\"* to assess understanding through dialogue.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students will demonstrate reasoning about habitat requirements (evidence: they justify why a habitat is or isn't suitable).\n- Students will create a visual representation of a toad habitat containing at least 2 survival elements (water, shelter, food source).\n- Students will articulate at least one reason why their created home helps a toad survive (with teacher scaffolding).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of what toads need to survive and how their body parts help them live.\n\n#### Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket / Reflection Activity (10 minutes)\n\n**Method: One of the following (choose based on class needs):**\n\n**Option A — Picture Sort & Explain (more visual, less writing):**\n- **Materials:** Laminated picture cards showing: toad eating an insect, toad in water, toad hiding under a log, toad on dry sand.\n- **Task:** Students choose the picture that shows something a toad needs to survive. They point to it and tell you: *\"This shows a toad [action]. It helps the toad survive because...\"*\n- **Success criteria:** Student identifies a picture and gives one reason connected to survival (e.g., \"water keeps it wet,\" \"hiding keeps it safe\").\n\n**Option B — Observation Drawing with Labels:**\n- **Materials:** Paper with pre-drawn toad outline, crayons, teacher scribe (for struggling writers).\n- **Task:** *\"Draw the toad's home. Label or tell me what your toad needs: water, food, or a hiding place.\"*\n- **Success criteria:** Student includes at least two elements of a toad habitat and can explain why it's needed.\n\n**Option C — Questioning Protocol (quick verbal check):**\n- **Ask each student 1–2 questions:**\n  1. *\"What is one thing a toad needs to stay alive?\"* (Listen for: water, food, shelter, or related concepts.)\n  2. *\"Why does a toad have bumpy skin?\"* (Listen for: to hide, to match the ground, to camouflage.)\n- **Success criteria:** Student answers at least one question with a survival-related reason.\n\n#### Formative Assessment During Lesson\n- **Observation notes from Explore phase:** Which students described toad needs unprompted?\n- **Group discussions during Explain:** Did students make connections between bumpy skin and camouflage?\n- **Voting/reasoning during Elaborate:** Could students justify which habitat was suitable for a toad?\n\n#### Success Criteria for K-LS1-1 Mastery (Kindergarten level)\n- ✓ **Emerging:** Student names one thing a toad needs (with visual prompts).\n- ✓ **Developing:** Student names 2 things toads need and makes one connection to observation (e.g., *\"Toads need water because they're wet in the picture.\"*)\n- ✓ **Proficient:** Student names 2–3 things toads need (water, food, shelter) and explains at least one reason why, connecting to the photograph or exploration.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- **All students** will identify at least one survival need for a toad (water, food, or shelter).\n- **Most students** will describe two toad survival needs and make one observation-based connection.\n- **Some students** will explain how toad body parts (bumpy skin, big eyes, strong legs) connect to survival in their habitat.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Reduce verbal load — use visuals and gestures:**\n   - Provide a **simplified observation worksheet** with only 2–3 body parts labeled (eyes, skin, legs) instead of detailed drawings.\n   - Use **hand motions** to represent concepts: wiggle fingers for insects, make bubbles in water for where toads live, cover eyes like hiding.\n   - Offer **pre-made vocabulary cards with pictures** so students can point instead of name.\n\n2. **Pair with a peer buddy for Explore and Elaborate:**\n   - Assign a more verbal/confident student to work alongside and model language: *\"I'm noticing the toad's bumpy skin. What do you notice?\"*\n   - During habitat building, provide a **checklist with pictures:** \"My habitat has: [ ] water [ ] plants [ ] rocks\" so students can check off rather than invent.\n\n3. **Shorten tasks and provide choices:**\n   - During Elaborate, give two pre-made habitat scenarios (swamp or garden only) instead of four, reducing decision fatigue.\n   - For exit ticket, use **picture-only responses** — student points to a picture and says one word (\"water\" or \"hiding\") rather than full sentences.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Deepen observational thinking — introduce comparison:**\n   - *\"How is a toad different from a frog? How are they the same? Both need water, but how are their skins different?\"* (If accessible—compare actual photos.)\n   - Pose: *\"What would happen to a toad if it didn't have bumpy skin? If it lived in a dry place?\"* (Cause-and-effect thinking.)\n\n2. **Extend to other animals and habitats:**\n   - *\"What other animals need water like toads do? What other animals hide to stay safe?\"*\n   - Provide pictures of **other animals (turtle, fish, mouse, bird)** and ask: *\"Which of these animals also live in wet habitats? Why?\"* (Compare and categorize.)\n\n3. **Research and create:**\n   - Challenge students to **create a poster or booklet** titled *\"How Toads Stay Safe and Healthy\"* with drawings showing: bumpy skin hiding them, big eyes spotting food, strong legs for hopping, wet habitat keeping them cool.\n   - Introduce idea of **life cycle:** *\"Toads start as tadpoles in water. What happens when they grow? How does a tadpole become a toad?\"* (Plant seed for future lesson; no need to go deep in K.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### 1. **Sensory Toad Hunt (Outdoor Learning)**\n- **Time:** 15–20 minutes\n- **Activity:** Take the class outside (garden, park, or natural area if available). Search for real toads or signs of toads: burrows, wet ground near plants, leaf litter.\n- **Student task:** Observe from a distance (don't touch). Ask: *\"Where is it? Why do you think the toad is here? What does it need that's nearby?\"* Document findings with drawings or photos.\n- **Connection:** Apply observation skills to real-world context; reinforce habitat needs.\n\n### 2. **Toad Life Cycle Sequencing (Math + Science)**\n- **Time:** 10–15 minutes\n- **Materials:** Picture cards showing toad life stages (egg, tadpole, tadpole with legs, young toad, adult toad) — pre-printed and laminated.\n- **Activity:** Students arrange pictures in order. Discuss: *\"Which stage needs water the most? When does it look most like the toad in our photo?\"*\n- **Connection:** Introduce basic life cycle concept; prepare for Grade 1 life science standards.\n\n### 3. **Build an Outdoor Toad Habitat (Long-term Project)**\n- **Time:** Initial setup 15 minutes; maintenance ongoing\n- **Materials:** Shallow wooden box or terracotta saucer, soil, plants (small hostas, ferns—shade-loving), water source, mulch.\n- **Activity:** Class creates a toad-friendly garden corner near the school. Students help plant, water, and monitor. Check for visiting toads or insects.\n- **Connection:** Real-world application of survival needs; environmental stewardship; observation over time.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Pacing:** This lesson works best **split across two days**: Day 1 = Engage + Explore (40–45 min), Day 2 = Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate (45–50 min). This allows time for deeper processing and reduces cognitive overload for Kindergarteners.\n- **Safety reminder:** If using live toads or handling them, ensure no pesticide exposure and minimal handling. Toads secrete toxins—hands off, eyes on. (Most of this lesson uses photos/toys to avoid this issue.)\n- **Cultural connection:** Some cultures have toad stories or observe toads in local ecosystems. Ask: *\"Do toads live near your home? Have you ever seen one?\"* This personalizes the lesson.\n- **Assessment tone:** Kindergarten assessments should feel like conversations, not tests. Use open-ended questions and honor all attempts at reasoning, even if vocabulary is emerging.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson plan directly addresses **K-LS1-1** by having students observe the toad photograph to identify patterns in what animals need: water (habitat visible in image), food (insects visible), shelter (vegetation and ground present), and suitable living conditions (damp environment shown). Through the 5E progression, students move from wondering *\"Why is this toad here?\"* to understanding *\"Toads need these things to survive, and their bodies help them live in this habitat.\"*",
