Describe what snake scales are and explain how they help the snake survive.\n2. Observe and compare different types of animal body coverings (scales, fur, feathers, skin).\n3. Explain why an animal's body covering is important for where it lives.\n4. Make connections between an animal's skin and how it stays safe in its habitat.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal body coverings using the snake photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Snake photograph (printed or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or as a large printout. Do NOT identify the animal yet. Cover the snake with a piece of paper or folder initially.\n\n2. **Ask students to turn and talk to a partner:** \"What do you see in this picture? What do you notice?\" (They may notice wood, leaves, and something moving through them.)\n\n3. **Reveal the snake gradually** (slide the paper away slowly) and ask:\n   - \"What animal is this? How did you know?\"\n   - \"What does the snake's skin look like? Use words like bumpy, smooth, textured, shiny.\"\n   - \"Why do you think the snake looks the same color as the leaves and wood?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this snake lives, and what does it need there?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if this snake had smooth, bare skin like a human instead of scales? Do you think it could hide as well? Do you think it could move as easily?\"\n\n5. **Record student responses** on chart paper titled \"What We Wonder About Snake Skin.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become animal skin detectives. We're going to look closely at different animals' skin and find out how it helps them survive!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how different animal body coverings look and feel through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **For each group of 3-4 students:**\n  - A picture of a snake (from lesson materials or printed from safe sources)\n  - A picture of a bird with visible feathers (e.g., chicken, cardinal)\n  - A picture of a mammal with fur (e.g., rabbit, squirrel, dog)\n  - A picture of a human or animal with bare skin\n  - A texture exploration kit containing:\n    - Sandpaper (to feel a rough texture like scales)\n    - Feather or feather boa (if available)\n    - Piece of fake fur or fluffy material\n    - Smooth piece of plastic or glass\n  - Hand lenses (magnifying glasses)\n  - A clipboard and sheet labeled \"Animal Skin Detective Sheet\" (see template below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Look at all four pictures your group has. Point to each animal and name it together.\"\n\n2. \"Feel each texture in your kit one at a time. Which one feels most like scales? Which feels like feathers? Which feels like fur? Which is smooth like skin?\"\n\n3. \"Use your hand lens to look closely at each picture. What do you see on the snake's body? Look at tiny bumps or patterns. Write or draw what you see on your detective sheet.\"\n\n4. \"Repeat step 3 for the bird, the furry animal, and the human or bare-skinned animal.\"\n\n5. \"In the bottom box, draw which animal you think would be best at hiding in the leaves and wood (like in our snake photo). Circle it.\"\n\n**Animal Skin Detective Sheet template:**\n\n```\nANIMAL SKIN DETECTIVE SHEET\n\nSnake scales look like: ___________________\nThey feel like: [Texture boxes for roughness comparison]\n\nBird feathers look like: ___________________\nThey feel like: [Texture boxes for softness comparison]\n\nFur/Mammal looks like: ___________________\nIt feels like: [Texture boxes for thickness comparison]\n\nBare skin looks like: ___________________\nIt feels like: [Texture boxes for smoothness comparison]\n\nWhich animal would hide best in leaves and wood?\n[DRAW IT] ___________________\n```\n\n**How the activity connects to the photograph:**\nStudents directly explore the textures and appearances they see in the snake photo and compare them to other animals, building understanding of diversity of body coverings.\n\n**What students should record or document:**\n- Written or drawn observations on the detective sheet\n- Predictions about camouflage and habitat matching\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups and ask guiding questions: \"What does that feel like? Is it rough or smooth?\" \"Look at the patterns—what do they remind you of?\"\n- Listen for accurate observations without correcting; model careful looking with a hand lens.\n- Encourage students to use sensory language: bumpy, smooth, feathery, fuzzy, shiny.\n- Do NOT explain *why* these coverings exist yet—let students observe and wonder.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and document that animals have different types of skin/body coverings.\n- Students can match textures to animals.\n- Students make an initial connection between appearance and hiding ability (camouflage concept developing).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientifically accurate concepts about body coverings and adaptation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Snake photograph (displayed again)\n- The four animal pictures from Explore phase\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students together** on the carpet or at their seats so everyone can see the snake photo and the animal pictures.\n\n2. **Facilitate group share-out:**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share one observation from their detective sheets.\n   - Display their answers on a new chart titled \"What We Discovered About Animal Skin.\"\n   - Affirm observations: \"Yes! Scales are bumpy and overlap, just like roof shingles.\"\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** using student-friendly definitions and point to examples in photographs:\n\n   - **Scales:** Special bumpy, flat pieces that cover some animals (like snakes and fish). They overlap like shingles on a roof. *Point to snake photo.* They protect the animal and help it move smoothly.\n   \n   - **Feathers:** Light, fluffy pieces that cover birds. They help birds stay warm and fly. *Point to bird picture.*\n   \n   - **Fur:** Thick, soft hair that covers many animals. It keeps them warm and helps them hide. *Point to mammal picture.*\n   \n   - **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or pattern looks like the place where it lives, so it's hard to see. *Point to snake in leaves.* \"The snake looks like the brown leaves and wood—it has camouflage!\"\n   \n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive where it lives. *The snake's scales and color are adaptations.*\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Remember our snake in the wood and leaves? Its scales help it move through sharp sticks without getting hurt. Its brown color helps it hide from animals that want to eat it or from animals it wants to eat. These are adaptations!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding strategy:**\n   - Ask students: \"Show me with your fingers—are snake scales bumpy or smooth?\" (Students show with pinched or open fingers.)\n   - \"If you had feathers, could you feel scratchy wood? Why or why not?\" (Lead them to understand feathers protect but are different from scales.)\n   - \"Look at our snake again. Why can't we see it easily in the leaves?\" (Camouflage!)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Scales** | Bumpy, flat pieces that cover snakes, fish, and some lizards. They protect the animal and help it move. |\n| **Feathers** | Light, fluffy pieces that cover birds. They keep birds warm and help them fly. |\n| **Fur** | Soft, thick hair that covers many animals like rabbits and squirrels. It keeps them warm and helps them hide. |\n| **Camouflage** | When an animal's color or pattern looks like where it lives, so it's hard to see. |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or way an animal acts that helps it stay safe and find food where it lives. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the vocabulary terms correctly in sentences.\n- Students can explain that different animals have different coverings suited to their habitats.\n- Students understand the concept of camouflage as an adaptation.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by matching animals to habitats and designing a camouflaged animal.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Option A (Habitat Matching):**\n  - Picture cards of 6 animals: snake, polar bear, penguin, zebra, frog, fish\n  - Picture cards of 6 habitats: forest/leaves, snow/ice, grass, water, dark cave\n  - Glue sticks and paper for pasting\n  \n- **Option B (Design Your Own Camouflaged Animal) — recommended:**\n  - Large sheets of white paper\n  - Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n  - Images of different environments: forest, desert, ocean, grassland (printed or displayed)\n  - Sample \"habitat backgrounds\" students can paste onto (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Matching Game**\n\n1. Divide students into pairs or small groups.\n2. Give each group a set of animal and habitat cards.\n3. Students work together to match each animal to the habitat where its body covering helps it survive.\n4. Ask: \"Why does the polar bear belong in the snow? What about its body covering helps it there?\"\n5. Students paste matches on paper and write or draw one reason.\n\n**Option B: Design a Camouflaged Animal (Recommended for deeper elaboration)**\n\n1. Show students different habitat images: a rocky desert, a snowy mountain, a blue ocean, a green forest, etc.\n2. Assign each small group (or pair) one habitat.\n3. **Student task:** \"You are going to design a pretend animal that lives in THIS habitat. Think about what color and pattern it would need to have so it could hide using camouflage. Think about what kind of skin or covering would help it survive there (scales, fur, feathers, or something else!). Draw your animal on this paper, and color it so it blends in with your habitat. You can also glue your drawing onto a habitat background.\"\n4. Students **create their animal** and color/decorate it to match the habitat.\n5. **Share:** Hold up drawings and ask the class: \"Can you find the animal hiding? Why did [student name] make it that color?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask elaboration questions: \"Tell me about the color you chose. Why will that help your animal hide?\"\n- Help students think about texture: \"What would the skin feel like? Bumpy like scales or soft like fur?\"\n- Encourage creative thinking while keeping the science grounded.\n- For struggling learners, provide a partially colored habitat background and ask them to add just the animal.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that animals' body coverings match their habitats.\n- Students apply the concept of adaptation by designing an animal suited to a specific environment.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that color, pattern, and texture all serve survival functions.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal body coverings, adaptations, and habitat connections.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Observation during Explore: Are students accurately describing what they see and feel?\n- Questioning during Explain: Can students use vocabulary correctly when answering questions?\n- Elaboration task completion: Do designs show understanding of camouflage and adaptation?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be written or verbal depending on reading level). Choose one or more of these:\n\n**Option 1 (Picture-Based — best for Second Grade):**\nShow a photo of a crocodile in muddy water. Ask:\n- \"What is this animal?\" \n- \"What do you see on its skin?\" (Bumpy scales)\n- \"What color is it?\" (Green, brown, muddy)\n- \"Do you think the crocodile can hide in the muddy water? Why or why not?\" \n- **Success criterion:** Student recognizes the bumpy scales and explains that the color helps it hide.\n\n**Option 2 (Verbal Response):**\nAsk one or more of these questions (use a recording sheet or ask 3-4 students individually):\n- \"What do snake scales do? How do they help a snake?\"\n- \"If you were a bird, what would cover your body instead of scales or fur?\"\n- \"Look at our snake photo again. Why is it hard to see the snake in the leaves?\"\n- **Success criterion:** Student uses vocabulary (scales, feathers, camouflage, or adaptation) and explains at least one survival function.\n\n**Option 3 (Drawing + Sentence):**\nProvide a large sheet with a habitat picture (e.g., snowy forest). Ask:\n- \"Draw an animal that would be hard to see in this place. What color would it be? Why?\"\n- Student draws and dictates or writes one sentence.\n- **Success criterion:** Animal is colored to blend with habitat; student gives a reason related to hiding or survival.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student correctly names at least two types of animal body coverings (scales, fur, feathers).\n- ✓ Student explains that body coverings help animals survive (protection, warmth, hiding).\n- ✓ Student makes a connection between an animal's covering and where it lives.\n- ✓ Student uses the word \"camouflage\" or \"hide\" in relation to color and pattern.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- **Proficient students** will explain multiple functions of body coverings and apply camouflage concepts to new animals.\n- **Developing students** will identify body covering types and state that they help animals hide or stay warm.\n- **Beginning students** will identify one body covering type and recognize that it helps the animal.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified texture exploration:** Provide only 2-3 textures during Explore (scale-like sandpaper, feather, fur) instead of all four. Use a hand lens together as a teacher-led small group.\n\n2. **Vocabulary scaffolding:** Use only the three main vocabulary words (scales, fur, feathers) for struggling learners in Explain phase. Provide a visual chart with pictures to reference throughout the lesson.\n\n3. **Guided design during Elaborate:** Instead of independent design, work with a small group and provide a pre-colored habitat background. Ask students to choose a color for their animal and glue it into the picture, then ask \"Will it hide? Why?\"\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Use a two-choice response: Show the snake photo and ask \"Are these bumpy or smooth?\" or \"Can you see it hiding? Yes or no? Why?\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research extension:** Ask advanced learners to research and draw 3-4 different animals from ONE habitat (e.g., three animals from a rainforest) and compare how each is camouflaged differently. Provide a children's nature book or approved website access for research.\n\n2. **Adaptation depth:** Challenge students to explain not just camouflage, but other adaptations (e.g., \"A snake's scales are smooth so it can move fast through leaves. A cactus has waxy skin so it doesn't lose water in the desert.\"). Ask: \"What other things besides color help an animal survive in its habitat?\"\n\n3. **Create a detailed habitat diorama:** Instead of a flat drawing, invite advanced learners to create a small 3D habitat in a shoebox with an animal design and multiple environmental elements. They must explain why each part of their animal fits that habitat.\n\n4. **Comparative analysis:** Provide pictures of 4-5 animals and ask students to sort them by body covering type AND habitat, creating a two-way classification chart or matrix.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Snake Skin Shedding Investigation:** Bring in a shed snake skin (from a pet store, nature center, or online source that is clean and safe). Let students handle it with hand lenses and compare it to living snake imagery. Ask: \"Why do you think snakes shed their skin? What's underneath?\" This introduces the idea that scales wear out and are replaced—a real-world adaptation behavior.\n\n2. **Camouflage Game:** Play a classroom game where you hide a stuffed animal snake or picture of an animal among classroom items. Change the color of the animal's background/habitat and play multiple rounds. Discuss: \"Was it easier to find when the colors matched or didn't match?\" This reinforces the survival advantage of camouflage.\n\n3. **Animal Covering Texture Book:** Students create a classroom \"touch and feel\" book by drawing different animals on pages and gluing actual materials (sandpaper, feathers, cotton balls, felt) to represent scales, feathers, fur, and skin. Classes can share this book with families or other grades.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Safety reminder:** If using real feathers, ensure no students have feather allergies. Provide hand sanitizer after tactile exploration.\n- **Pacing:** The lesson can be split across two days: Engage + Explore on Day 1; Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2.\n- **Accessibility:** Ensure the photograph is large and clear. Provide verbal descriptions for students with visual needs.\n- **Language learners:** Pre-teach key vocabulary words (scales, fur, feathers) using images before the lesson. Pair students with English-proficient peers during group work.",
