ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the yellow slime mold and activate prior knowledge about living things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color copy or digital projection of the slime mold photograph\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on screen or as a large poster without revealing what it is. Allow 20-30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (write student responses on chart paper):\n   - *\"What do you see? Describe the colors, textures, and shapes you notice.\"*\n   - *\"Do you think this is a plant, an animal, a fungus, or something else? Why do you think that?\"*\n   - *\"Where do you think this object is? What is it sitting on?\"*\n   - *\"Is this thing alive? What makes you think so or so?\"*\n\n3. **Reveal the mystery:** \"This is called a **slime mold**, and scientists aren't sure if it's a plant or an animal—it's actually something special! Today, we're going to investigate what makes a slime mold so unusual.\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"What would happen if we could watch this slime mold move and change? How do you think it gets from one place to another?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"To figure out what makes slime molds so interesting, we're going to explore how they move and respond to their environment, just like we do.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how organisms sense and respond to their environment through a hands-on model activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Per group of 3-4 students:\n  - 1 shallow plastic container (like a takeout box or shallow bin)\n  - 1 cup of damp potting soil or compost\n  - 1 packet of oat flakes or instant oatmeal (to represent food)\n  - 1 spray bottle with water\n  - Yellow food coloring or yellow play dough (to model the slime mold)\n  - Ruler or measuring tape\n  - Paper towels\n  - Pencil and paper for recording\n\n**Activity: \"Model Slime Mold Investigation\"**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Prepare your habitat:** Pour damp soil into your container and gently flatten it into an even layer about 2 inches deep.\n\n2. **Create a food source:** Scatter a pinch of oat flakes in one corner of the container and another pinch in the opposite corner. These represent decaying leaves and wood.\n\n3. **Model the slime mold:** Roll yellow play dough into a blob shape (or use yellow food coloring mixed with gelatin if pre-made ahead) and place it in the center of the container, equal distance from both food sources.\n\n4. **Observe and record:**\n   - Measure how far the \"slime mold\" is from each food source using a ruler. Record these distances.\n   - Predict: \"Which direction do you think the slime mold will move? Why?\"\n   - Over the next few minutes, lightly mist the soil with water (simulating moisture), especially near one food source.\n   - Watch carefully: Does your model move? Does it change shape? How?\n\n5. **Document your observations:** Use drawings and words to show what happened. Did the \"slime mold\" respond to the food? To the moisture?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group and ask clarifying questions: *\"What do you notice happening? What might be causing that change? How is your model acting like a real slime mold?\"*\n- Resist providing answers; instead, prompt students to observe closely and make their own inferences.\n- Help groups measure accurately if needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should observe and record that the model moves/responds to stimuli (moisture, food placement).\n- Students should begin to see connections between the organism's structure and how it functions in its environment.\n- Groups should produce written/drawn records showing directional movement and response to stimuli.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and deepen understanding of how slime molds survive using their structures and sensory responses.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or anchor chart template\n- Original slime mold photograph (displayed again)\n- Picture cards or diagram of slime mold structures (if available; optional but helpful)\n- Whiteboard or document camera to project student observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to briefly describe what they observed with their model slime molds.\n   - Display their recorded observations on the document camera or board.\n   - Ask: *\"How was what happened in your model like what a real slime mold might do in a forest?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8-10 minutes):** Using the photograph and student observations, teach these terms:\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|----------------------------|\n   | **Slime mold** | A strange living organism that isn't quite a plant or an animal; it can move and spread across rotting wood to find food. |\n   | **Organism** | Any living thing, like a plant, animal, slime mold, or fungus. |\n   | **Decomposer** | A living thing that breaks down dead plants and animals and returns nutrients to the soil. Slime molds are decomposers. |\n   | **Respond** | To react or react to something in your environment, like moving toward food when you're hungry. |\n   | **External structure** | A body part on the outside of a living thing that helps it survive, like the slime mold's bright color or spongy texture. |\n\n3. **Make connections (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph: *\"Look at the bright yellow color. What might that yellow color help the slime mold do? (It stands out; it might help animals avoid it or notice it.)\"*\n   - *\"See the bumpy, spongy texture? How might that texture help it absorb moisture or stick to wood?\"*\n   - *\"In your models, you saw the slime mold respond by moving. Real slime molds do something similar—they spread toward food and moisture. What does this tell us about slime molds?\"* (They are alive; they sense their environment; they can move.)\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If a slime mold is yellow and bumpy on the outside, what does that tell us about how it survives?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"Why would a slime mold move toward decaying wood? What does that mean it needs to survive?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should define slime molds as living organisms with unique structures.\n- Students should explain that slime molds respond to their environment (food, moisture) by moving or growing in that direction.\n- Students should recognize slime molds as decomposers that help break down dead material.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of slime mold structures and responses to a new, real-world scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Forest Detective\" scenario cards (see below)\n- Drawing paper\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: Photos of various forest floor environments (mushrooms, decomposing logs, etc.)\n\n**Activity: \"Forest Detective Challenge\"**\n\n1. **Present the scenario:** Display this scenario:\n   - *\"A dead log in the forest is covered in slime molds, fungi, and insects. All of these living things are breaking down the wood and returning nutrients to the soil. Without slime molds and these other decomposers, the forest floor would be buried in dead leaves and wood that never break down. Healthy forests need decomposers!\"*\n\n2. **Small-group task:**\n   - Divide the class into groups of 3-4.\n   - Assign each group one of these real-world questions:\n     - **Group A:** If a slime mold needs moisture to move and survive, how would a very dry forest affect it?\n     - **Group B:** If a slime mold responds by moving toward food (decaying wood), what would happen if there were no dead trees in a forest?\n     - **Group C:** A forest manager is trying to decide whether to remove all the dead, decaying logs. Using what you know about slime molds, should she remove them? Why or why not?\n\n3. **Student task:**\n   - Groups discuss their question for 5 minutes.\n   - Create a labeled drawing or simple diagram showing their answer.\n   - Write 2-3 sentences explaining: *\"How do slime molds' structures and behaviors help them survive? Why are they important to forests?\"*\n\n4. **Gallery walk or group presentations (5 minutes):** Groups briefly share their findings.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask probing questions: *\"How does the structure we saw help it do this job? What would happen if it couldn't respond to moisture?\"*\n- Guide students to see the connection between organism structure, behavior, and ecosystem health.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should apply understanding to new contexts (different forest environments).\n- Students should construct arguments using evidence: *\"Slime molds are important because...\"*\n- Drawings and written explanations should reflect understanding of structure-function relationships.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of slime mold structures, behaviors, and survival responses.\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- Observe and listen during group discussions in Explore phase. Record whether students recognize organism responses to environmental stimuli.\n- Check student models and recorded observations for evidence that they understand cause-and-effect (moisture/food → movement/growth).\n- During Explain, listen to student responses to check-for-understanding questions to assess vocabulary retention and concept understanding.\n\n**Summative Assessment: \"Slime Mold Exit Ticket\" (5 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with the following prompt (read aloud for support):\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Sketch a slime mold and label two external structures that help it survive. (Students should identify color, bumpy texture, spongy appearance, or similar features visible in the photograph.)\n\n2. **Answer with words or drawing:**\n   - *\"A slime mold is living on a dead log. The log has moisture on one end and decaying food on the other. What will the slime mold do and why?\"*\n   - *(Students should indicate movement/growth toward food and moisture, and explain that the slime mold responds to its environment to find what it needs to survive.)*\n\n3. **Quick write (1-2 sentences):**\n   - *\"Explain why slime molds are important to a forest. Use the word 'decomposer' in your answer.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Students correctly identify at least two external structures of a slime mold.\n\n✓ Students explain that slime molds move/respond toward food and moisture.\n\n✓ Students use the term \"decomposer\" and describe the slime mold's role in breaking down dead material.\n\n✓ Students construct a logical argument connecting organism structure to survival (e.g., \"The yellow color helps...\" or \"The bumpy texture helps...\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most fourth graders should recognize slime molds as living organisms with special structures.\n- Students should explain basic stimulus-response behavior (movement toward food/moisture).\n- Students should communicate understanding that slime molds decompose and are important to ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Sentence frames for writing:**\n   - Provide pre-written frames students can complete:\n     - \"The slime mold has _____ on the outside that helps it _____.\"\n     - \"The slime mold responds to _____ by _____.\"\n   - This scaffolds vocabulary use and organization of ideas.\n\n2. **Simplified model activity:**\n   - Allow struggling learners to observe a pre-made model instead of creating one, reducing task complexity.\n   - Provide simplified recording sheets with pictures and checkboxes instead of open-ended observation sheets.\n\n3. **Paired observation of photograph:**\n   - Partner struggling learners with stronger peers to discuss and describe the photograph together before independent work.\n   - Use think-pair-share to reduce pressure of individual responses.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Research extension:**\n   - Provide advanced learners with the prompt: *\"Slime molds are called 'living fossils.' Find out why scientists call them that and what makes them so unusual compared to plants and animals.\"*\n   - Have them create a short presentation or poster.\n\n2. **Comparative analysis:**\n   - Ask: *\"How is a slime mold's response to food similar to how a dog's nose helps it find food? How is it different?\"*\n   - Students compare organism sensing and responding across kingdoms (protist vs. animal).\n\n3. **Design challenge:**\n   - *\"Design a forest habitat where slime molds would thrive. What features would you include? Why?\"*\n   - Students should include moisture, dead wood, and appropriate conditions based on their understanding.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Long-term observation project:**\n   - If possible, collect a real slime mold (or order one from a biological supply company) and keep it in a moist habitat in the classroom for 2-3 weeks.\n   - Have students sketch and observe how it grows, spreads, and changes shape.\n   - Record observations weekly in a science journal.\n   - **Connection:** Students see real stimulus-response behavior and can compare their model to the actual organism.\n\n2. **Decomposer ecosystem poster:**\n   - Assign students to create an informational poster showing the role of slime molds in the forest food web/nutrient cycle.\n   - Include pictures, labels, and arrows showing how slime molds break down dead material and return nutrients to soil, which plants use to grow.\n   - **Connection:** Extends to ecosystem and energy flow concepts (though not explicitly NGSS 4th grade, it deepens understanding of organism roles).\n\n3. **Class field investigation (optional):**\n   - If feasible, take a nature walk to find real decomposing logs, fungi, and slime molds on the school grounds.\n   - Students photograph and sketch findings and discuss: *\"What structures do you see? How do these organisms respond to moisture and shade?\"*\n   - **Connection:** Real-world application and observation of living organisms in actual habitats.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** Slime molds are harmless, but ensure students wash hands after handling soil or materials. Emphasize not eating any materials.\n- **Sourcing:** If you want to show a live slime mold, they grow naturally on moist, decomposing wood or mulch. Alternatively, purchase cultures from biological supply companies (e.g., Carolina Biological, Boreal Science).\n- **Timing:** This lesson can be compressed into one 90-minute block or spread across two 45-minute sessions. Explore and Elaborate work well as a second-day activity if split.\n- **Assessment tone:** Use observations and exit tickets formatively; the goal is understanding, not perfection. Fourth graders are still developing fine motor skills and writing fluency—accept drawings and simple sentences as valid evidence of understanding.",
