What Special Body Parts Help Them Survive?**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90-120 minutes across two sessions (Session 1: Engage & Explore = 60 minutes; Session 2: Explain, Elaborate, & Evaluate = 45-60 minutes)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 1-LS1-1: Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n  - 1-LS3-1: Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that young plants and animals are like, but not exactly like, their parents.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify and name at least three external body parts of a lizard (legs, tail, skin, claws, eyes).\n2. Explain how at least two lizard body parts help the lizard survive, climb, or hide.\n3. Compare how a baby lizard and adult lizard are similar and different.\n4. Use lizard body parts as inspiration to design a solution to a human climbing or gripping problem.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital display of the lizard photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: toy lizard or lizard figurine to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or bulletin board where all students can see clearly. Keep it covered or hidden until students are seated.\n\n2. **Reveal the image** and pause for 10-15 seconds of silent looking. Then say: \"Look carefully at this animal. It's a lizard! What do you notice about how it's sitting on that branch?\"\n\n3. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause after each for responses):\n   - \"What parts of the lizard's body can you see? Point to them on the picture.\" (Guide students to notice legs, tail, head, skin, eyes.)\n   - \"Why do you think the lizard looks bumpy and brown? Where is it sitting?\" (Connect appearance to habitat; accept \"It looks like the tree!\" or \"It's hiding!\")\n   - \"If you were a lizard, how would you climb up a tree branch? What would you need?\" (Elicit responses about gripping, holding on, balance.)\n   - \"Have you ever seen a lizard? What was it doing?\" (Activate prior knowledge and build excitement.)\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... what special body parts does this lizard have that help it climb and survive? Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Right now, we're going to explore lizard bodies by making our own climbing lizards with special feet. Then we'll figure out how real lizards use their amazing bodies to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clothespins (1 per student) — these will represent lizard legs/feet\n- Strips of sandpaper or sticky velcro dots (3-4 pieces per student)\n- Different textured surfaces: tree bark rubbing, smooth plastic, rough rope, smooth paper, textured foam\n- Optional: tape, markers for decorating\n- Small objects to \"grip\" (foam balls, smooth rocks, cardboard tubes)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up the investigation stations** before the lesson. Have 4-5 stations around the room with different textures (bark, plastic, rope, paper, foam). Label each with a picture.\n\n2. **Introduce the task:** \"A real lizard has special bumpy feet with claws that help it grip and climb. We're going to make our clothespin lizards have special gripping feet, too! Watch me first.\"\n\n3. **Model:** Demonstrate attaching sandpaper or velcro to a clothespin to create \"bumpy feet.\" Say: \"See how this sandpaper is bumpy? When I try to grip with my smooth clothespin, it might slip. But with the bumpy feet, the lizard can hold on better!\"\n\n4. **Student directions (give one at a time, checking for understanding):**\n   - \"Take your clothespin. This is your lizard!\"\n   - \"Stick the sandpaper or velcro to the bottom of the clothespin. These are your bumpy lizard feet.\"\n   - \"Now take your lizard to each station. Try to grip each texture. Can your lizard hold on? Does it slide? Draw or color what happens on your paper.\" (Provide a simple recording sheet with drawings of each texture and space to mark \"grips well\" or \"slips.\")\n\n5. **Facilitate without giving answers:**\n   - Ask: \"What do you notice? Which textures does your lizard grip best?\"\n   - Encourage: \"Try pressing harder. Try a different foot position.\"\n   - Prompt reflection: \"Why do you think it gripped that one better?\"\n\n6. **Document findings:** Students draw or mark which textures their \"bumpy feet\" gripped best. Collect one sentence of student thinking: \"My lizard gripped the ___ best because ___.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that bumpy/textured surfaces grip better than smooth ones.\n- Students make a connection: \"Real lizards have bumpy feet because they need to climb trees!\"\n- Students document which textures worked best.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled diagram of lizard body parts (prepared ahead)\n- The original lizard photograph\n- Index cards with vocabulary words and pictures\n- Optional: picture book (e.g., *Lizards* by John Crossingham or similar)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on the carpet** with the photograph visible.\n\n2. **Group share-out:** Ask 3-4 students to share what they discovered: \"What happened when your lizard tried to grip the different textures? Which ones worked best?\" Write their ideas on chart paper as they speak.\n\n3. **Connect to the real lizard:** Point to the photograph and say: \"Look at this real lizard on the tree bark. See how bumpy and textured it looks? Just like our sandpaper feet, a real lizard's feet are bumpy with tiny claws. This helps it climb and hold on so it doesn't fall!\"\n\n4. **Introduce key vocabulary** using the labeled diagram. Point to each body part on the photograph AND on your chart:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Scales:** Tiny, bumpy, overlapping pieces that cover a lizard's whole body. Scales protect the lizard like armor and help it blend in with tree bark.\n   - **Claws:** Sharp, pointed nails on the lizard's feet that help it grip branches and climb.\n   - **Tail:** The long part at the back of the lizard's body. It helps the lizard balance when climbing and can break off to escape predators.\n   - **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or pattern matches its surroundings so it's hard to see. This lizard is brown and tan like tree bark!\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives (in this case, trees and branches).\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Point to different body parts on the photo: \"Show me with your fingers where the claws are. Where is the tail? Can you point to the scales?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think this lizard's brown color is helpful? Turn to a partner and tell them.\"\n   - Use thumbs up/sideways/down: \"Do you think scales help a lizard? Show me!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name at least 3 lizard body parts on the photograph.\n- Students understand that scales, claws, and coloring help lizards survive.\n- Students articulate one reason why a specific body part is useful (e.g., \"Claws help climb\").\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Building materials: cardboard tubes (paper towel/toilet paper rolls), construction paper, tape, markers, pipe cleaners, pom-poms\n- Pictures of different habitats: desert, tree, rocky cliff, sandy beach (printed or on screen)\n- Optional: printable lizard template for students to decorate\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present a real-world challenge:** \"Imagine you have to design a lizard for a different habitat. If a lizard lived on a sandy desert instead of tree bark, what color would it need? What body parts would help it survive?\"\n\n2. **Option A — Habitat Design Challenge:**\n   - Show pictures of different habitats (tree, rocky area, sandy desert).\n   - Small groups or partners choose one habitat.\n   - They design and build a lizard using craft materials to match that habitat (e.g., a sandy-colored lizard with a longer tail for balance on rocks).\n   - Students explain: \"Our lizard lives in the ___ because it has ___ to help it survive there.\"\n\n3. **Option B — Compare Baby and Adult Lizards:**\n   - Show pictures of a baby lizard and an adult lizard side by side.\n   - Students discuss and draw: \"How are they the same? How are they different?\"\n   - They fill in a simple Venn diagram: Same (both have scales, tails, claws) vs. Different (baby is smaller, adult is bigger).\n   - Connect to NGSS 1-LS3-1: \"Baby lizards look like their parents, but they start very small!\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Why did you choose that color?\" \"What body part does your lizard need most in this habitat?\"\n   - Encourage collaboration: \"How is your lizard similar to the one in the photo? How is it different?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design or describe an adapted lizard for a different environment.\n- Students articulate connections between body parts and survival in a specific habitat.\n- Students compare similarities and differences between baby and adult animals.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative assessment (during the lesson):**\n   - Observation checklist during Explore: Can students identify that textured surfaces provide better grip? Are they making connections to real lizards?\n   - Listen to partner talks during Explain: Do students use vocabulary correctly? Can they explain why a body part is useful?\n   - Examine Elaborate work: Do designs show understanding of adaptation? Can students explain their choices?\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (choose one or both):**\n\n   **Exit Ticket Option A — Drawing & Sentence (for emerging writers):**\n   - Provide a simple template with a blank lizard outline and a sentence frame.\n   - Prompt: \"Draw and color a lizard. Finish this sentence: 'A lizard's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ helps it \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.'\"\n   - Collect to assess if students can identify one body part and explain its function.\n\n   **Exit Ticket Option B — Show Me/Tell Me (for students who struggle with writing):**\n   - Show the original photograph again.\n   - Ask the student one question: \"Point to a body part on this lizard that helps it climb. Tell me why it's important.\"\n   - Listen for use of vocabulary (scales, claws, tail) and evidence of understanding (connects body part to survival/function).\n\n3. **Success Criteria — Students demonstrate understanding when they:**\n   - Name at least 2 lizard body parts from the photograph.\n   - Explain how at least 1 body part helps the lizard survive or function (climb, hide, grip).\n   - Show in their Explore data or Elaborate work that they understand textured/bumpy surfaces provide grip.\n   - Use or understand at least 2 vocabulary terms (scales, claws, tail, camouflage, habitat).\n\n4. **Observation Notes to Track:**\n   - Can student identify body parts on the real photograph? (LS1-1 building block)\n   - Does student make connections between the clothespin activity and real lizard structure? (LS1-1 building block)\n   - Can student compare baby and adult animals in basic terms? (LS3-1 building block)\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary with visuals:** Show pictures of scales, claws, and tails in isolation before the main lesson. Have students point and repeat. Use tactile items: let them feel sandpaper (scales), touch the sharp end of a pencil (claws), hold a rope (tail).\n\n2. **Simplified Explore activity:** Instead of multiple stations, provide only 2 contrasting textures (bumpy sandpaper vs. smooth plastic). Reduce recording to \"works\" and \"doesn't work\" with thumbs up/down rather than detailed drawings.\n\n3. **Sentence frames for explanation:** Provide sentence starters during Explain and Elaborate:\n   - \"The \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ helps the lizard \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ because \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\"\n   - \"The lizard's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is important for \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\"\n\n4. **One-to-one or small group support:** During Explain, work with students who need extra practice identifying body parts. Use the photograph and have them point repeatedly while you name parts.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Design-an-adaptation challenge:** \"If this lizard needed to live in the snow, what would change? Draw your snow lizard. Label the changes.\" Push them to think about multiple body parts and survival.\n\n2. **Habitat research:** Provide books or images of different real lizard species (gecko, anole, horned lizard). Students compare: \"How are their body parts different? Why do you think that?\" Introduce the word \"adaptation\" formally.\n\n3. **Engineering extension:** Challenge students to design a human glove inspired by gecko feet. \"Use your clothespin lizard findings. How would you redesign a climbing glove so humans could climb like a lizard?\" They sketch ideas and explain their reasoning.\n\n4. **Comparative anatomy:** Introduce comparing other animals to lizards. \"Do snakes have claws? Do birds have scales? How are reptiles different from other animals?\" This builds toward animal classification (early elementary extension).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Lizard Life Cycle Book:** Students create a 4-page book (accordion fold or stapled pages) showing: egg, baby lizard, growing up, adult lizard. They draw and write one sentence per stage. This reinforces 1-LS1-2 and 1-LS3-1 about offspring resembling but being different from parents.\n\n2. **Classroom Lizard Observation Habitat (if feasible):** Bring in a live lizard (anole or leopard gecko) for observation over 2-3 weeks. Students make weekly observations: \"What is the lizard doing? How is it using its body parts?\" Keeps the learning concrete and engaging. (Ensure proper care and teacher/parent permission.)\n\n3. **Camouflage Hunt Activity:** Hide pictures or drawings of lizards in a classroom scene (tree bark poster, green leaves, sandy area). Students search for \"hidden lizards\" and discuss: \"Why was it hard to find? How does the lizard's color help it hide?\" This reinforces the concept of camouflage as survival.\n\n4. **Lizard vs. Other Animals Sort:** Provide pictures of lizards, snakes, turtles, and other reptiles and non-reptiles. Students sort by attributes: \"Has scales? Has claws? Has a long tail?\" Introduces early classification and comparative anatomy.\n\n5. **Movement Study:** Students move like a lizard on a low balance beam or tape line, exploring how claws, tail, and body position help balance and movement. This is kinesthetic, multi-sensory, and fun!\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure all craft materials are age-appropriate. If using a live lizard, verify it is safe to handle and establish clear class rules.\n- **Pacing:** First graders need frequent transitions and movement. Consider breaking the lesson across 2-3 days if needed.\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** First graders learn through repetition. Use the same words consistently and point to pictures/photos often.\n- **Connections to home:** Send home a simple \"Lizard Facts\" sheet so families can talk about what students learned. Ask: \"Have you seen a lizard? Where?\"\n- **Photo use:** Laminate and display the lizard photograph throughout the lesson and leave it posted for continued reference and review.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson plan directly addresses K-5 science standards while keeping the content concrete, engaging, and age-appropriate for First Grade learners. The 5E model ensures students move from curiosity to hands-on discovery to formal understanding to application—all essential for deep learning at this level.",
