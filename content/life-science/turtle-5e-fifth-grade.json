Identify the key features of a turtle's habitat and explain how those features help the turtle survive.\n2. Describe how a turtle and the plants in its environment depend on each other.\n3. Create a labeled diagram or model showing how matter (food, water, nutrients) moves between a turtle and its habitat.\n4. Use evidence from the photograph to support an explanation of how organisms interact with their environment.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animals and their homes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph (large enough for whole class to see clearly)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"I notice, I wonder\" graphic organizer (one per student or pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without narration. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation. Ask students to simply look and take in details.\n\n2. **Launch with discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about where this animal is? Describe everything you see around it.\"\n   - \"What do you think this animal needs to survive in this place?\"\n   - \"Why might the turtle be near those green plants? What could those plants do for the turtle?\"\n   - \"If all the plants disappeared from this spot, what do you think would happen to the turtle?\"\n\n3. **Use the \"I Notice, I Wonder\" Protocol:**\n   - Left side: Students write or draw what they **notice** in the photo (specific observations).\n   - Right side: Students write what they **wonder** about the turtle or its home.\n   - Collect 3–4 student responses aloud; record on chart paper to reference throughout the lesson.\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Predict: What things does this turtle need from its habitat to stay healthy and survive? List at least three.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Good thinking! Today we're going to investigate how animals like this turtle depend on their environment and how their environment depends on them. Let's explore this together.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate relationships between organisms and their habitats through hands-on modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Shoebox or small clear plastic container (one per pair or small group)\n- Soil or potting mix\n- Small rocks, bark pieces, and twigs\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Seedlings or hardy plants (beans, clover, or small ferns from a local nursery)\n- Craft materials: construction paper, tape, markers\n- Turtle cut-out or toy turtle (or hand-drawn turtle on cardstock)\n- Observation journal or notebook (one per student)\n- Hand lenses (magnifying glasses)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Assign students to pairs or groups of 3.** Distribute one shoebox \"habitat kit\" per group.\n\n2. **Student Directions (written on board or worksheet):**\n   - \"Your job is to create a mini habitat for a turtle like the one in the photograph.\"\n   - \"Step 1: Layer 2–3 inches of soil in the bottom of your box. Arrange rocks, bark, and twigs to create shelter spots.\"\n   - \"Step 2: Plant 1–2 small plants in your habitat. Water lightly with the spray bottle until the soil is moist (not soggy).\"\n   - \"Step 3: Place your paper turtle in the habitat in a safe spot where it could hide or find food.\"\n   - \"Step 4: Observe your habitat for the next 5 minutes using your hand lens. Record answers to these questions in your journal:\n     - Where is your turtle positioned? Why might it choose that spot?\n     - What resources (food, water, shelter) can your turtle access?\n     - What happens to the plants when the soil has water?\n     - If the turtle eats some of the plants, how might that affect the habitat?\"\n\n3. **Connection to the Photograph:**\n   - As students work, circulate and ask: \"How is your habitat similar to the turtle's home in the photo? What elements did you include that you saw in the photograph?\"\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Students sketch their habitat before and after adding the turtle.\n   - Write 2–3 sentences explaining: \"How does this habitat help the turtle survive?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without answering directly.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice happening to the plant? Why might the turtle need shelter?\"\n- Ensure soil moisture is appropriate; coach students to observe carefully.\n- Redirect if students focus only on the turtle; prompt them to think about the plants' role.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a functional model showing basic habitat components (soil, water, plants, shelter).\n- Students recognize that plants need water and soil; turtles need shelter and food.\n- Students begin to see interconnection (e.g., plants provide food; water is needed by both plants and animals).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and reinforce concepts through teacher-led discussion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart or poster board\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Vocabulary cards or Word Wall\n- Diagram template showing energy/matter flow (adapted for Fifth Grade)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3–4 pairs to briefly show their habitats and share one observation: \"What did you discover about how the turtle and plants depend on each other?\"\n   - Write student ideas on anchor chart under \"Discoveries.\"\n\n2. **Formal Instruction (10 minutes):**\n   - Return to the photograph and point out each component.\n   - Introduce and define vocabulary using the habitat and photograph as reference:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal or plant lives; includes food, water, shelter, and space.\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. (Point to the turtle's shell and legs in photo.)\n   - **Producer:** A plant that makes its own food using sunlight, water, and air.\n   - **Consumer:** An animal that eats plants or other animals for food.\n   - **Ecosystem:** All the living things (plants and animals) and non-living things (water, soil, air) in an area working together.\n\n3. **Make Connections to the Photograph:**\n   - \"In this photo, the turtle is a **consumer** because it eats plants. The green plants are **producers** because they make food using water from the soil and air. Together, they live in a **habitat** that has everything they need. The turtle's hard **shell** is an **adaptation** that protects it. All of this — the turtle, plants, soil, water, and rock — is part of an **ecosystem**.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Thumbs up/middle/down: \"Do you understand what a habitat is?\"\n   - Quick Think-Pair-Share: \"Turn to your partner. What's one way the plant and turtle in the photo help each other or depend on each other?\"\n   - Collect 2–3 responses.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can correctly define habitat, adaptation, producer, consumer, and ecosystem.\n- Students can identify the turtle as a consumer and plants as producers.\n- Students can explain that the turtle's shell is an adaptation.\n- Students recognize the photo as an example of an ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply and deepen understanding by modeling matter/energy movement in the ecosystem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster board or chart paper (one per group)\n- Markers, colored pencils, or colored paper for collage\n- Arrows and labels\n- Photograph or printed images of turtles, plants, sun, water, soil\n- \"Energy and Matter Flow\" diagram template (adapted for Fifth Grade: simplified version showing Sun → Plant → Turtle → Soil/Decomposition)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the Concept of Matter Flow:**\n   - \"Remember when we watered the plants in our habitats? That water comes from rain or from us. The water travels through the soil, into the roots of plants, and helps them grow. When the turtle eats the plant, that water and nutrients become part of the turtle's body. When the turtle leaves waste in the soil, it goes back to help the plants grow again. Matter is always moving and cycling through the ecosystem.\"\n\n2. **Student Task — Create a Cycle Diagram (in pairs or small groups):**\n   - Distribute \"Elaborate Activity Sheet\" with a partially filled diagram:\n     - **Sun** (starting point) → **Plant** → **Turtle** → **Soil/Decomposition** → back to **Plant**\n   - Students add:\n     - Arrows showing the direction of flow\n     - Labels for what's moving (water, nutrients, energy from food)\n     - Drawings or labels showing what happens at each stage\n     - A caption explaining: \"How does matter move through the turtle's ecosystem?\"\n\n3. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - \"In the photo, when it rains, water soaks the soil. Plants use that water. The turtle drinks and eats plants. When the turtle poops, it fertilizes the soil. This cycle keeps happening over and over. This is how nature recycles!\"\n\n4. **Optional Deeper Question (for advanced students):**\n   - \"What would happen if there was a drought (no rain for a long time)? Trace through the cycle and predict what would happen to the plants and the turtle.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Clarify that \"decomposition\" means things break down and return nutrients to soil (keep language simple).\n- Guide students to trace the path of water and energy through the system.\n- Encourage students to use arrows and clear labels.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a diagram showing matter (water, nutrients) moving through the ecosystem.\n- Students can explain at least one complete cycle (e.g., water from soil → plant → turtle → back to soil).\n- Students demonstrate understanding that ecosystems are interconnected systems.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitats, adaptations, and ecosystem interdependence.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe during Explore phase: Are students identifying habitat components?\n- Listen during group share-out: Can they articulate turtle-habitat relationships?\n- Check elaboration diagrams: Can they show matter movement correctly?\n- Use exit ticket (below) for final check.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) — Administer at end of Session 2:**\n\nStudents respond to the following (written, drawn, or oral depending on classroom literacy levels):\n\n1. **Diagram Question:** \"Look at this photograph again. Circle three things the turtle **needs** from its habitat to survive.\"\n\n2. **Short Answer:** \"Why is the shell on the turtle's back an adaptation? How does it help the turtle survive?\"\n\n3. **Explanation:** \"In 2–3 sentences, explain: How do plants and the turtle depend on each other in their habitat?\"\n\n4. **Application:** \"If you were building a habitat for a wild turtle like the one in the photo, what three things would you include and why?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least 3 habitat components (soil, water, plants, shelter, rocks).\n- ✓ Student explains that the shell protects the turtle.\n- ✓ Student describes at least one way plants and turtles interact (e.g., turtle eats plants; plants need water from soil; waste returns to soil).\n- ✓ Student's habitat design includes evidence of understanding (e.g., includes water, plants, shelter).\n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Objectives:**\n- Review exit tickets and elaboration diagrams against the learning objectives checklist.\n- If 80%+ of students earn ✓ on 3 out of 4 success criteria, learning objectives are met.\n- Students who struggle may need one-on-one conference to clarify misconceptions before moving on.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Pre-teach key terms using picture cards and real examples (e.g., bring in a turtle figurine, real plants, rocks). Use the photograph repeatedly as a reference point.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames:** Provide sentence starters for exit tickets and explanations:\n   - \"The turtle needs _____ from its habitat.\"\n   - \"The plant and turtle depend on each other because _____.\"\n   - \"The shell helps the turtle by _____.\"\n\n3. **Paired Exploration:** Pair struggling students with a strong partner during the Explore phase. Assign the struggling student the role of \"observer and recorder\" (drawing) while the partner handles some of the hands-on setup.\n\n4. **Simplified Diagram:** Offer a pre-drawn template for the Elaborate phase with blanks to fill in, rather than creating from scratch.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Matter Cycle:** Challenge students to trace a complete cycle including **decomposition**. Ask: \"What happens to the turtle when it dies? How does its body return nutrients to the soil?\" Introduce the term \"decomposer\" (bacteria, fungi) and have students add a decomposer to their cycle diagram.\n\n2. **Habitat Comparison:** Provide photographs or information about **different turtle habitats** (desert, wetland, forest). Ask: \"How would a turtle's adaptations differ depending on its habitat? What habitat features would change?\" Create a comparison chart.\n\n3. **Population Investigation:** Pose the question: \"If all the plants in the photo's habitat died, what would happen to the turtle population? Why?\" Students write a short prediction with reasoning, or research how habitat loss affects real turtle populations.\n\n4. **Design Challenge:** \"Design an ideal habitat for a turtle that includes all the components we learned about. Create a 3D model or detailed blueprint and explain your design choices using scientific vocabulary.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Turtle Research Project:** Students research a specific species of wild turtle (box turtle, sea turtle, red-eared slider, etc.). They create an informational poster showing:\n   - The turtle's real habitat (with photos/illustrations)\n   - What it eats (producers and consumers it interacts with)\n   - Adaptations that help it survive\n   - One way humans impact its habitat\n   - **Connection to lesson:** Students identify the habitat components and ecosystem relationships in their research.\n\n2. **Classroom Terrarium Over Time:** If feasible, maintain the shoebox habitats for 2–3 weeks. Have students make weekly observations:\n   - How do the plants grow or change?\n   - Does the turtle (figurine) \"move\" to different spots based on where conditions are best?\n   - What happens to the water level?\n   - Create a growth chart or observation log to track changes and discuss what this tells us about ecosystem needs.\n\n3. **Outdoor Habitat Hunt:** Take students on a \"nature walk\" to a grassy, wooded, or landscaped area near school. Provide \"Habitat Observation Sheets\" where they:\n   - Find an animal (or evidence of one: burrow, scat, tracks).\n   - Identify the habitat features around it (plants, water, shelter, soil type).\n   - Predict what that organism eats and needs to survive.\n   - Sketch or photograph the habitat and label components.\n   - **Connection:** Students apply the lesson framework to real habitats, reinforcing that all organisms depend on their environment.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis lesson uses the striking photograph of a turtle in its natural habitat as a springboard to investigate organism-habitat interdependence. Through hands-on modeling, students discover that animals need shelter, food, and water—all provided by their habitat—and that they, in turn, affect their environment through feeding and waste. The cycle of matter through the ecosystem becomes tangible and memorable, building toward the NGSS requirement that students model and explain how matter and energy move through living systems. The lesson is concrete, visually anchored, and scaffolded for Fifth Grade reasoning while remaining accessible to diverse learners.",
