Identify body parts of a snowy egret and explain how each part helps it survive in a water habitat.\n2. Observe and describe how an animal's body is suited to where it lives.\n3. Compare the body parts of water animals to land animals and explain why they are different.\n4. Explain that different habitats have different animals with different body features.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the snowy egret.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, clear display of the snowy egret photograph (printed or projected)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** in a way all students can see clearly. Show it without talking for 15-20 seconds, allowing students to look carefully.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing think-pair-share time):\n   - \"What do you notice about this bird? What is it doing?\" (Students may say: it's white, it has long legs, it's near water, it looks like it's looking for something)\n   - \"Why do you think this bird has such long legs?\" (Encourage thinking about movement and habitat)\n   - \"What do you see in this bird's mouth? Why might it have a long, pointy beak?\" (Connect to function: catching food)\n   - \"Where do you think this bird lives? How can you tell?\" (Water habitat clues: rocks, water, shallow area)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what makes this bird so good at living near water. Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Record** student observations and wonderings on chart paper. Display throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great observations! Now let's explore how different animals' bodies help them live in different places, just like this egret.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate animal body adaptations by observing and comparing features of water animals and land animals.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Magazine or printed pictures of various animals (6-8 images showing: water animals like fish, duck, turtle; land animals like squirrel, deer, lizard). Include the egret photo again.\n- Sorting mats or large paper divided into two sections labeled \"Water Animals\" and \"Land Animals\"\n- Hand lenses (optional, for closer observation)\n- Student observation worksheets (see below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the sorting task:** \"We're going to be animal detectives. Look at each animal picture and decide: Does this animal live in water or on land?\"\n\n2. **Provide each student or pair with:**\n   - Animal picture cards\n   - A sorting mat divided into two columns (\"Water Animals\" | \"Land Animals\")\n   - A simple observation worksheet with prompts:\n     - *\"My animal is a ________\"*\n     - *\"It lives in: water / land\"*\n     - *\"What body parts do I see? (Draw or list: legs, beak, fins, fur, etc.)\"*\n     - *\"How do these body parts help it live there?\"* (Simple answer expected)\n\n3. **Students work in pairs or small groups** to:\n   - Sort animal pictures into correct habitat columns\n   - Choose 2-3 animals to study more closely\n   - Draw and label body parts on the observation worksheet\n   - Make a guess about how each body part helps the animal\n\n4. **Teacher role:**\n   - Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Why do you think a duck has webbed feet?\" \"What would happen if a squirrel had fins?\"\n   - Do NOT give answers; guide with questions\n   - Listen for student reasoning about body-habitat connections\n   - Help students use hand lenses to see details they might miss\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students correctly sort most animals into habitat categories\n   - Students identify at least 3-4 body parts per animal\n   - Students make initial attempts to connect body parts to survival (e.g., \"Long legs help the egret walk in water\")\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and deepen understanding of how animals are adapted to their habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Snowy egret photograph (displayed)\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary\n- Video clip (2-3 minutes optional): short, age-appropriate clip of egret hunting in water (YouTube: search \"snowy egret hunting\")\n- Adapted body parts labeled diagram of egret\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore:**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs/groups to share their animal choices and explain one body part they noticed\n   - Record connections on chart: \"**Body Part → What It Does**\"\n   - Example: \"Long legs → walks in deep water\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with Second Grade-friendly definitions:\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|----------|--------------------------------|\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter |\n| **Adapted** (or \"just right for\") | When an animal's body is specially made to help it live in its home |\n| **Body parts** | The different pieces of an animal's body (head, legs, beak, tail, fins, wings, etc.) |\n| **Hunting** | Looking for and catching food |\n\n3. **Revisit the egret photograph** and point out specific adaptations:\n   - \"See the egret's long, thin beak? It's adapted for poking into the water to catch little fish.\"\n   - \"Look at its long, thin legs. They're adapted for walking in shallow water without getting tired.\"\n   - \"Its white feathers help it stay cool near water and blend in near the sky.\"\n   - \"It lives in a water **habitat**, so its whole body is **adapted** to that place.\"\n\n4. **Show optional video clip** (if available): Watch egret hunting for 1-2 minutes to reinforce behavior and habitat.\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why doesn't the egret need big, strong swimming fins like a fish? Turn to your partner and share your idea.\"\n   - Listen for responses like: \"Because it walks and doesn't swim underwater\" or \"Because it hunts on land near water.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives; the home of a plant or animal\n- **Adapted/Adapted to:** Built or shaped just right to help an animal live in its home\n- **Body parts:** Pieces of an animal that help it move, eat, or sense things (legs, beaks, wings, fins, tails)\n- **Hunting:** Searching for and catching food\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word \"adapted\" and \"habitat\" correctly in simple sentences\n- Students can name 2-3 body parts of the egret and explain one way each helps it survive\n- Students understand that different animals need different body parts for different habitats\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by redesigning an animal for a new habitat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large drawing paper (8.5\" × 11\" or larger)\n- Colored pencils, crayons, or markers\n- Magazines for cutting images (optional)\n- Scissors and glue sticks\n- \"Design a New Animal\" worksheet with prompts:\n  - *\"If an egret lived in a forest (not near water), what body parts would it need to change?\"*\n  - *\"Draw or cut out pictures to show the new animal.\"*\n  - *\"Label the new body parts and explain why they would help.\"*\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set the scenario:** \"Now imagine the egret had to move to a forest where there's no water. What would need to change about its body? How would it hunt for food differently?\"\n\n2. **Provide a choice of habitats:**\n   - **Option A (Easier):** Modify the egret for a sandy desert\n   - **Option B (Moderate):** Modify the egret for a thick forest\n   - **Option C (Challenge):** Modify the egret for a snowy mountain\n\n3. **Students work individually or in pairs to:**\n   - Draw the original egret or use a printed image as a base\n   - Redesign or redraw body parts that would change (legs, beak, feathers, etc.)\n   - Label the new or changed parts\n   - Write or dictate 1-2 sentences explaining: \"I changed the _____ because _____\"\n\n4. **Teacher role:**\n   - Ask probing questions: \"What kind of food is in a forest? How would the bird catch it? Would long legs still be helpful?\"\n   - Validate creative thinking while grounding it in logic\n   - Help students articulate the connection between habitat and adaptation\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students redesign at least 2-3 body parts with some logic behind the changes\n   - Students create a label or sentence explaining one adaptation\n   - Students demonstrate transfer of understanding to a new scenario\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal adaptations and habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore and Elaborate:\n  - ☐ Student identifies body parts of animals\n  - ☐ Student attempts to connect body parts to habitat/function\n  - ☐ Student sorts animals into correct habitats\n  - ☐ Student uses vocabulary (habitat, adapted) appropriately\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be drawn or written):\n\n*\"Look at this picture of an egret. Complete these sentences:*\n1. *An egret lives in a __________ habitat.\"*\n2. *The egret's long legs help it ________________.\"*\n3. *The egret's pointy beak is adapted for __________.\"*\n\n**Alternative exit ticket** (for non-writers):\n- Show a picture of a different water animal (duck, heron, fish)\n- Ask: \"Point to one body part and tell me how it helps this animal live in water.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly names a water habitat (pond, marsh, lake, river)\n- ✓ Student explains one way a body part helps the egret survive\n- ✓ Student uses the word \"adapted\" or \"help\" in their response\n- ✓ Student shows understanding that animals' bodies match their homes\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students (70%+) can name one adaptation of the egret and explain its purpose in simple terms\n- Students can correctly identify a water habitat\n- Students can compare body parts of two different animals with some guidance\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n**Support (Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce visual complexity in Explore:** Provide only 4 animal pictures instead of 8, with very clear distinctions (fish vs. squirrel; duck vs. deer).\n\n2. **Use sentence frames:** Instead of open-ended questions, provide frames:\n   - \"The _________ lives in _________.\"\n   - \"Its _________ help it _________.\"\n\n3. **Pair with a strong peer or adult** during Explore and Elaborate activities. Provide hand lens for closer observation to boost engagement and detail-finding.\n\n4. **Use the photograph repeatedly:** Return to the snowy egret photo as an anchor; don't introduce too many new animals at once.\n\n**Challenge (Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper questioning in Explain:** Ask: \"If we could give the egret one body part from another animal, what would it be and why? What would it lose?\"\n\n2. **Research extension:** Provide pictures of other water birds (heron, crane, cormorant). Ask: \"How are their body parts similar to the egret? Why might water birds have similar adaptations?\"\n\n3. **Multi-habitat design:** In Elaborate, ask students to design an animal that lives in TWO habitats (water and forest). How would it move? How would it hunt? Justify each choice.\n\n4. **Scientific vocabulary:** Encourage use of terms like \"beak,\" \"plumage,\" \"wade,\" and \"prey\" instead of simplified versions.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Wetland Habitat Diorama:** Students create a shoebox or paper diorama of a wetland habitat. Include the egret and 2-3 other animals (cattails, fish, turtle). Label each animal and write a sentence about how it is adapted to that habitat. (Homework or small-group project)\n\n2. **Animal Habitat Matching Game:** Create cards with animal pictures on one side and habitat names on the other. Students play a matching game where they match animals to habitats, then explain one body part that helped them decide. Can be played in pairs or small groups.\n\n3. **\"If I Were an Egret\" Creative Writing:** Students write or dictate a short story (3-4 sentences) from the egret's perspective: \"I am an egret. I have long legs because __________. I hunt by __________. I need water because __________.\" Illustrate and share in a class book.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\nThis lesson uses the concrete, visually striking snowy egret photograph as an anchor throughout all 5E phases. Second graders are concrete thinkers who benefit from returning to the same image repeatedly and comparing it to other animals they can observe. The activities move from observation to sorting, to explanation, to redesign—each level asking students to think more deeply about why animals look the way they do.\n\nIf you have access to a local wetland, park, or pond, consider a brief outdoor observation walk where students look for water birds and practice observing body parts and behaviors in real time. This authentic connection will deepen their understanding far beyond the photograph alone.",
