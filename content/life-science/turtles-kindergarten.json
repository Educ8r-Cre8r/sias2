The big turtle has green stuff growing on its shell.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image shows **basking behavior** in aquatic turtles. The turtles are thermoregulating - using the sun's energy to warm their cold-blooded bodies to an optimal temperature for biological functions. The algae growing on the larger turtle's shell demonstrates a **commensal relationship** where the algae benefits from the mobile surface while the turtle is generally unaffected. This basking behavior is essential for turtle health, helping with digestion, vitamin D synthesis, and parasite removal.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Animal Needs:** All animals need warmth, food, water, and shelter to survive\n2. **Body Covering:** Turtle shells protect their soft bodies underneath\n3. **Animal Behavior:** Animals do things that help them stay healthy and safe\n4. **Living vs. Non-living:** Turtles are living things that grow, move, and need food\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"think-pair-share\" strategy when discussing animal needs. Have students think about what they need to be healthy, pair up to discuss, then share how turtles might have similar needs.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to express their observations - drawing, acting out turtle movements, or using simple words. Some students may benefit from tactile experiences like feeling different textures that represent smooth vs. rough shells.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** Inside the turtle's body, blood moves faster when the turtle is warm, helping it digest food and stay healthy\n2. **Zoom Out:** These turtles are part of a pond ecosystem where they help keep the water clean by eating plants and small animals\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"Turtles can come out of their shells\"\n   **Reality:** A turtle's shell is part of its body, like our ribs - they cannot remove it\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"All turtles live in water\"\n   **Reality:** Some turtles live on land, some in water, and some in both places\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"The green stuff is dirt\"\n   **Reality:** The green covering is living algae that grows on the turtle's shell\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** K-LS1-1 - Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals need to survive\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:K-LS1.C]] - All animals need food in order to live and grow\n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns in the natural world can be observed\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you notice about where these turtles chose to sit? (Bloom's: Observe | DOK: 1)\n2. Why do you think the turtle is sitting in the sunny spot instead of the shade? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n3. How is a turtle's shell similar to and different from your skin? (Bloom's: Compare | DOK: 2)\n4. What would happen if turtles couldn't find sunny places to warm up? (Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Shell:** The hard covering that protects a turtle's body\n* **Basking:** Sitting in the sun to get warm\n* **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds what it needs\n* **Cold-blooded:** Animals that need outside heat to warm their bodies\n* **Algae:** Tiny green plants that can grow in water or on wet things\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- \"Turtle, Turtle, Watch Out!\" by April Pulley Sayre\n- \"Box Turtle at Long Pond\" by William T.
