ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about gardens as places where plants and animals live together and meet their needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed copy of the garden photograph (or projected image)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pointer or stick to direct attention\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster where all students can see. Say: \"This is a special place called a garden. What do you see growing here?\"\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions one at a time, allowing 20-30 seconds for responses after each:**\n   - \"What colors do you see? Are these plants or animals?\"\n   - \"Look at the purple and yellow flowers. What do you think the flowers need to be so colorful and pretty?\"\n   - \"Do you see any animals hiding in this garden? What do you think they're doing here?\"\n   - \"Why do you think someone made this garden? What could live here?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm wondering... if we took away the soil (point), or the sunlight (point to bright areas), or the water, what do you think would happen to these flowers? Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper with pictures and words (teacher writes what students say verbatim).\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Today, we're going to be garden detectives and explore what plants and animals really need to live and grow.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what plants need through a sensory exploration activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small potted plant or cutting of a leafy stem in a cup of water (1 per 2-3 students, or 1 demonstration plant)\n- Soil in a small container (real soil, enough for students to touch safely)\n- Watering can or spray bottle\n- Plant parts observation cards with simple drawings: flower, leaf, stem, root\n- Hand lenses (optional)\n- Paper towels\n- **Image cards showing: sunny window, dark closet, water, dry soil** (teacher-created simple pictures or printed graphics)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Small group rotations (5 minutes per station):** Divide students into 3-4 small groups. Each group rotates through 3 stations.\n\n   **Station 1 — Feel the Soil:**\n   - Students touch real soil with one hand (teacher has sanitizing wipes nearby)\n   - Ask: \"Is it soft or hard? Does it feel wet or dry? Do you think plant roots like being in soil?\"\n   - Students say one word to describe soil (soft, brown, wet, etc.)\n   - Teacher records on a sticky note\n\n   **Station 2 — Observe the Plant:**\n   - Students look at a real plant or stem in water using a hand lens if available\n   - Point to parts: \"This is the flower. This is the leaf. This is the stem. Under the soil are roots we can't see.\"\n   - Ask: \"Which part gets sunlight? Which part drinks the water?\"\n   - Students point to the part that needs water\n\n   **Station 3 — Imagine the Needs:**\n   - Show image cards one at a time: sunny window, dark closet, water droplet, dry soil\n   - Ask: \"Does a plant like sunny places or dark places?\" Students point to sunny window.\n   - Ask: \"Does a plant need water?\" Students nod or say yes.\n   - Ask: \"Can a plant grow in hard, dry soil or soft, wet soil?\" Students indicate soft soil.\n\n2. **Record observations:** Teacher or aide writes/draws what students discover on a large paper titled \"What Plants Need.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions; don't tell the answers\n- Point out details students might miss (\"Look how dark the soil is\")\n- Affirm observations: \"Yes! You noticed the soil is wet!\")\n- Manage transitions between stations with a visual timer or song\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will identify soil, water, and sunlight as things plants need\n- Students will touch, observe, and describe plant parts\n- Students will begin connecting plant parts to their functions (roots drink water, leaves catch sunlight)\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize concepts discovered during exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- New chart paper titled \"Plants and Animals Need...\"\n- Picture cards of the same garden photograph\n- 3-5 large word cards with images: SOIL, WATER, SUNLIGHT, FOOD, SHELTER\n- Markers (colored)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations (5 minutes):**\n   - Gather students in a circle\n   - Review the chart from Engage: \"Remember what we wondered about?\"\n   - Ask: \"Now that we explored, what do plants REALLY need?\" \n   - Accept student responses and validate: \"Yes! We found soil, water, and sunlight!\"\n\n2. **Introduce and anchor vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n\n   Present each term with a Kindergarten-friendly definition and visual reference to the photograph:\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Connection to Photo** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|------------------------|\n   | **SOIL** | The brown dirt where plants grow their roots and drink nutrients | Point to the dark soil in the garden photo |\n   | **WATER** | The drink that plants need to stay alive and grow tall | Mime watering; show watering can in photo |\n   | **SUNLIGHT** | The warm, bright light from the sun that helps plants make food | Point to bright areas in the photo; \"Sunny\" |\n   | **FOOD** | Energy from sunlight that helps plants grow (plants make their own food!) | \"Plants use sun to make food, like how we eat lunch!\" |\n   | **SHELTER** | A safe, cozy place where animals can hide and live | Point to thick plant areas, shade, hiding spots in photo |\n\n3. **Display word cards prominently** around the room at student eye level.\n\n4. **Check for understanding (5 minutes):**\n   - Hold up the photograph again\n   - Ask: \"Point to where you see SOIL.\" (Students point to dark areas)\n   - Ask: \"Where is the SUNLIGHT coming from?\" (Students point up/to bright areas)\n   - Ask: \"What animals might find SHELTER here?\" (Students name insects, bugs, creatures)\n   - Affirm all responses\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Soil:** Brown dirt under plants where they drink water and nutrients\n- **Water:** The wet drink that keeps plants alive\n- **Sunlight:** Bright light from the sun that helps plants grow\n- **Food:** Energy plants make from sunlight (not eaten like our food)\n- **Shelter:** A safe home or hiding place for animals\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use vocabulary words (receptively and expressively) in sentences\n- Students will point to examples of soil, water, and sunlight in the photograph\n- Students will understand that plants and animals need different things to survive\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding to a new scenario: building their own garden.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large poster board\n- Picture cards (pre-made or printed): flowers, bees, butterflies, beetles, grass, water droplets, sun, soil\n- Glue sticks\n- Scissors (teacher-cut or pre-cut for safety)\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario Introduction (2 minutes):**\n   - Say: \"We learned what plants and animals need. Now, imagine we're going to make a NEW garden for the classroom. What does our garden NEED to have so plants and animals can be happy?\"\n\n2. **Collaborative Garden Design (10 minutes):**\n   - Work as a whole group or in small groups\n   - Provide pre-cut picture cards of: soil, water (raindrops/watering can), sun, flowers, butterfly, bee, beetle, grass, tree\n   - Ask: \"Which pictures should we put on our garden poster? What does our garden need?\"\n   - As students choose, ask: **\"Why? What does that need help us with?\"**\n     - Soil? \"Plants need it to grow!\"\n     - Water? \"Plants and animals drink it!\"\n     - Sunlight? \"Plants need it to make food!\"\n     - Butterfly? \"It eats flowers and needs shelter!\"\n   - Students glue pictures onto large paper while saying why each item is important\n\n3. **Gallery Walk (3 minutes):**\n   - Display the class garden (or groups' gardens)\n   - Walk around and ask: \"Who can tell us what your garden needs to keep plants and animals healthy?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide decision-making with questions, not answers\n- Write labels under pictures so students connect words to images\n- Encourage reasoning: \"Tell us why you chose that\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will design a garden with multiple living and non-living things they need\n- Students will justify their choices using vocabulary (soil, water, sunlight, food, shelter)\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that plants and animals depend on multiple things to survive\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students can observe and describe what plants and animals need to survive.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist:** During Explore and Explain, note which students:\n  - ✓ Identify soil, water, or sunlight when prompted\n  - ✓ Use vocabulary words (soil, water, sunlight, shelter, food)\n  - ✓ Point correctly to plant parts\n  - ✓ Describe what a plant or animal needs in 2-3 words\n\n**Exit Ticket (5 minutes) — Choose one:**\n\n**Option A (Pointing/Visual):**\n- Show the garden photograph one more time\n- Ask three yes/no or pointing questions:\n  1. \"Point to something a plant needs to drink.\" (water/soil)\n  2. \"Does the sun help plants grow? Nod yes or shake no.\"\n  3. \"Point to a place where an animal could hide (shelter).\"\n\n**Option B (Drawing):**\n- Provide a simple garden outline (just sky and ground)\n- Ask students to draw or place stickers of three things a plant needs\n- Teacher asks: \"Tell me what you drew and why the plant needs it\"\n\n**Option C (Sorting/Matching):**\n- Provide 6 picture cards: sun, plant, soil, flower, water, bug\n- Ask: \"Which ones does a plant need?\" Students sort into two piles\n- Ask: \"Which ones help animals?\" Students re-sort\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least 2 things plants need (soil, water, or sunlight)\n- ✓ Student describes shelter or food in context of animals\n- ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary word correctly\n- ✓ Student makes a connection between the photo and what living things need\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify at least two plant needs\n- 70% of students will use one vocabulary word (soil, water, sunlight) in response\n- Students will explain that gardens are good homes because they have what plants and animals need\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on only SOIL, WATER, and SUNLIGHT during Explain. Add FOOD and SHELTER only if students show mastery.\n\n2. **Provide choice boards:** Instead of open-ended questions, offer 2 choices: \"Does a plant need soil OR sunshine?\" Students point or nod.\n\n3. **Buddy system:** Pair students with a peer buddy during Explore. Buddy helps describe what they observe and take turns touching/observing plants.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Expand vocabulary:** Introduce ROOTS and PHOTOSYNTHESIS (simplified: \"Plants eat sunlight!\"). Ask: \"Where do roots go? What do roots do?\"\n\n2. **Predict and investigate:** \"What would happen if we didn't water the plant for two weeks?\" Document with drawings and predictions. Follow up with a real plant observation over days.\n\n3. **Create a food chain:** Show how plants make food from sun → animals eat plants → bigger animals eat smaller animals. Use picture cards to create a simple chain.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Plant a classroom seed (2-3 week project):**\n   - Plant fast-growing seeds (bean, sunflower, or basil) in cups with soil\n   - Water daily and place in sunlight\n   - Track growth with pictures or drawings weekly\n   - Discuss: \"Is our plant growing? What is it using from the soil, water, and sun?\"\n\n2. **Garden field trip and observation scavenger hunt:**\n   - Visit a school/community garden or outdoor area with diverse plants\n   - Provide a laminated scavenger hunt card: \"Find soil. Find water. Find an insect. Find a flower. Find shade.\"\n   - Students draw or point to each on their walk\n   - Discuss findings back in class\n\n3. **Story/song about garden needs:**\n   - Read or sing a Kindergarten-level book about gardens (e.g., *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle)\n   - Create a class song to the tune of \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\":\n     > *Plants need soil, water, sun,*\n     > *Growing, growing, having fun!*\n     > *Animals find food and home,*\n     > *In the garden where they roam!*\n   - Students draw pictures to accompany the song\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Photography connection:** Return to the original garden photograph throughout the lesson to anchor learning. Ask students to spot evidence of things plants and animals need each time you revisit it.\n- **Real plants matter:** If possible, have a live plant in the room during all phases. Kinesthetic and tactile experiences are critical for Kindergarten.\n- **Safety:** Ensure soil is clean and sanitized. Have hand sanitizer available. Check for allergies before any outdoor exploration.\n- **Family connection:** Send home a simple note with vocabulary words and a challenge: \"Ask your family: What do we need to grow? What do our pets need? Do plants need the same things?\"",
