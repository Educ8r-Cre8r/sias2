Identify and name at least three body parts of a lizard and explain what each part helps the lizard do\n2. Observe and describe how an animal's body features help it survive in its habitat\n3. Compare their own body parts to a lizard's body parts and discuss why they are different\n4. Predict and explain why an animal's color and shape might help it hide from danger\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about lizards and their special body features by examining the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color copy of the lizard photograph (or display on interactive board)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small stuffed lizard toy\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** large enough for all students to see clearly. Do NOT explain what it is yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to look carefully** for 30 seconds in silence, then ask:\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture?\"\n   - \"What do you notice about this animal's body? What parts can you see?\"\n   - \"What is the lizard standing on?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the lizard's color looks brown and bumpy like the branch?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations** on chart paper. Accept all responses without judgment.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder why this lizard looks so much like the tree branch it's standing on? Do you think that helps the lizard in any way?\"\n\n5. **Allow 2-3 students to share their ideas**, then say: \"Today, we're going to be lizard detectives and find out how lizards' bodies help them live and survive!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore some real lizards and their special body parts to find out their superpowers!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate lizard body parts and match them to survival functions through hands-on observation and matching activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Per group of 3-4 students:**\n  - 1 printed color photo of the lizard (8.5\" x 11\" minimum)\n  - 1 set of pre-made cards with body part names: SCALES, EYES, CLAWS, TAIL, SKIN COLOR (printed and laminated or on cardstock)\n  - 1 set of pre-made cards with function descriptions (see below)\n  - Glue sticks or tape\n  - 1 large paper (11\" x 14\") labeled \"Lizard Body Parts and What They Do\"\n  - Hand lens (optional, for closer observation)\n  - Recording sheet with lizard outline (for drawing and labeling)\n\n**Body Part Function Cards** (prepare these ahead):\n- \"These help the lizard climb on rocks and trees\"\n- \"These help the lizard see danger coming and find food\"\n- \"This helps the lizard balance and move fast\"\n- \"This hard covering protects the lizard's body\"\n- \"This helps the lizard hide from predators because it looks like the tree\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** to each group. Give each student a lizard outline sheet and a pencil.\n\n2. **Instruct students:** \"Your group is a lizard detective team. Use the photo to find each lizard body part. Point to it in the picture. Then draw it on your lizard outline and label it with the word card.\"\n\n3. **After labeling body parts** (5-7 minutes), students **match function cards** to body parts by discussing and gluing them to their large paper.\n\n4. **Circulate and ask guiding questions** (do NOT tell answers):\n   - \"What do those bumpy lines all over the lizard's body look like? What could they do?\"\n   - \"Look at those front legs. What would they be good for?\"\n   - \"See that long thing in the back? What might it help the lizard do?\"\n   - \"Why might a brown, bumpy lizard be hard to see on a brown, bumpy tree?\"\n\n5. **Have groups share** their matches aloud without correcting—just listen.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Listen for misconceptions but do NOT correct them yet\n- Ask follow-up questions to deepen observation (\"Show me which part helps...\")\n- Photograph or collect each group's work for the Explain phase\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify at least 3-4 lizard body parts from the photograph\n- Students attempt to match body parts to survival functions (some matches may be incorrect—this is intentional)\n- Students create a labeled drawing of the lizard with descriptions of what body parts do\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and correct/clarify student thinking about how lizard body structures support survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with the word **ADAPTATION** written at top\n- Index cards with vocabulary words (prepared ahead)\n- Student work from Explore phase\n- The original lizard photograph (large display)\n- Optional: simple life-size diagram of a lizard with labels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a circle** or on the carpet. Display the original photograph prominently.\n\n2. **Conduct a group share-out:**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their body part matches\n   - Say: \"Let me tell you what scientists discovered about each part...\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary with student-friendly definitions:**\n\n   | Vocabulary | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Scales** | Tiny, flat, hard plates that cover a lizard's skin like armor to protect it |\n   | **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home |\n   | **Camouflage** | When an animal's color or pattern looks like its surroundings so it's hard to see |\n   | **Predator** | An animal that hunts and eats other animals |\n   | **Claws** | Sharp, curved nails that help lizards climb and grip |\n\n4. **Explain each body part using the photo:**\n   - **Scales:** \"See these bumpy lines? Those are scales. They're like tiny shields that keep the lizard's skin safe.\"\n   - **Eyes:** \"Those big, bright eyes help the lizard see insects to eat and watch for danger.\"\n   - **Claws:** \"These sharp feet can grip onto rough tree bark so the lizard doesn't fall.\"\n   - **Tail:** \"This long tail helps the lizard balance and run very fast away from predators.\"\n   - **Color and pattern:** \"This lizard is brown and bumpy just like the tree bark. This is called camouflage. Can you see why a hungry bird might not spot it?\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"If a lizard didn't have claws, what would be hard? Why?\"\n   - \"How would a bright pink lizard be different on a brown tree?\"\n   - Point to body parts in the photo and ask: \"What does THIS part help the lizard do?\"\n\n**Vocabulary Chart:** Post the vocabulary words with pictures/drawings on the classroom wall for future reference.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that animal body parts help them survive\n- Students can name the vocabulary terms\n- Students begin to grasp the concept of camouflage and adaptation\n- Student questions are addressed and clarified\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18-22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply and deepen understanding by exploring how other animals have different adaptations for their habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-prepared photo cards of 4-5 different animals in their habitats (rabbit in grass, polar bear in snow, tree frog on leaves, fish in water, bird in air)—one per student or small group\n- Chart paper labeled \"Animal Adaptations Matching Game\"\n- Markers (crayons)\n- Index cards with adaptation descriptions (prepared ahead)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Show the class 2-3 additional animal photos** (different from the lizard). Say: \"Other animals have special body parts too! But their bodies are different because they live in different places.\"\n\n2. **Distribute animal photo cards** to students (one per student or pair).\n\n3. **Instruct:** \"Look at YOUR animal. Find one special body part that helps it survive. Draw it and tell the class what it does.\"\n\n4. **Facilitate a discussion:**\n   - Ask students: \"Why does a rabbit need long ears but a lizard needs a tail?\"\n   - \"What's the same about all these animals? (They all have special body parts)\"\n   - \"What's different? (They live in different places, so they need different parts)\"\n\n5. **Create a class chart:**\n   - Draw a simple two-column chart: \"Animal\" | \"Special Body Part & What It Does\"\n   - Record student ideas as they share\n\n6. **Conclude with:** \"Every animal is built perfectly for where it lives!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide discussion to highlight diversity of adaptations\n- Ask: \"Where does your animal live? How does this body part help it live there?\"\n- Use comparisons back to the lizard\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify adaptations in other animals\n- Students understand that different habitats require different body structures\n- Students can explain how an adaptation helps an animal survive (in simple terms)\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of lizard adaptations and animal body structures.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Can students identify and label body parts?\n- Listen to student explanations in Explain phase: Do they understand the function of each part?\n- Observation during Elaborate phase: Can students apply concepts to other animals?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment** (provide one per student):\n\n**Choose ONE option based on your class:**\n\n**Option A: Oral Assessment (for students needing support)**\n- Ask each student individually:\n  1. \"Point to the lizard's scales in this picture. What do they do?\"\n  2. \"Why does the lizard look brown like the tree?\"\n  3. \"What is one body part that helps the lizard survive? What does it do?\"\n- Record yes/no responses or brief notes\n\n**Option B: Drawing & Label Assessment (mid-level)**\n- Provide students with a blank lizard outline\n- Instruct: \"Draw and label THREE lizard body parts. Write one sentence about what each part helps the lizard do.\"\n- Use the provided rubric (below)\n\n**Option C: Picture Sorting Assessment (advanced)**\n- Provide 6 picture cards: 3 showing lizard body parts labeled correctly, 3 with incorrect labels\n- Ask: \"Which pictures are RIGHT? Which are WRONG? Why?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| Level | Evidence |\n|---|---|\n| **Developing** | Student identifies 1-2 lizard body parts but struggles to explain their function |\n| **Proficient** | Student identifies 3+ lizard body parts and can explain what at least 2 do |\n| **Advanced** | Student identifies 4+ body parts, explains functions, and makes connections to other animals |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Second Grade students should be able to name at least 3 lizard body parts (scales, eyes, claws, tail)\n- Second Grade students should be able to explain in simple words how 2-3 body parts help the lizard survive\n- Second Grade students should demonstrate understanding that animal bodies fit their habitats\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide a labeled reference sheet** during Explore: A simple diagram of a lizard with all parts already labeled. Students only need to match functions using the word cards.\n\n2. **Use hand lens magnification**: Provide a hand lens so students can examine the photograph details more closely, making body parts more obvious.\n\n3. **Reduce the number of body parts**: Instead of 5 parts, focus on just 3: scales, eyes, claws. Simplify matching to fewer function cards.\n\n4. **Provide sentence frames** for Exit Ticket: \n   - \"The lizard's _____ help it _____.\"\n   - \"This body part is important because _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Introduce the concept of \"habitat\"**: Ask advanced students: \"If this lizard lived in the snow instead of on a tree, what would need to change about its body? Why?\" Have them sketch an adaptation for a snowy habitat.\n\n2. **Research task**: \"Find pictures of 2-3 other lizards that live in different places (desert, rain forest, etc.). What body parts are the same? What's different? Why?\"\n\n3. **Camouflage design challenge**: Provide colored paper and ask students to design a lizard (shape, pattern, color) that would be perfectly hidden in a different habitat (desert, ocean, grass). Write an explanation of why it would hide well.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Lizard Habitat Diorama**: Provide small boxes, sand, twigs, leaves, and modeling clay. Students build a realistic lizard habitat and place a clay or paper lizard in it, explaining how each part of the habitat helps the lizard survive.\n\n2. **Classroom Camouflage Hunt**: Hide 10-15 paper cutout lizards (colored to match different classroom areas: under a book, on colored paper, on a patterned fabric, etc.) around the room. Students search for them and discuss which ones were easiest/hardest to find and why (connecting to camouflage concept).\n\n3. **Animal Body Part Chart for Home**: Send students home with a simple worksheet asking them to draw and label body parts of a pet or neighborhood animal and explain what each part helps the animal do. Students share findings in class.\n\n4. **Lizard Life Cycle Research**: Introduce the concept that baby lizards look similar to adult lizards (no metamorphosis like frogs). Create a simple life cycle picture with students: egg → baby lizard → adult lizard.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety reminder**: If live lizards are ever used in class, ensure proper handling training and that animals are calm and accustomed to human touch. Washing hands after contact is essential.\n- **Photograph power**: This photograph is exceptional for engagement because the lizard's camouflage is immediately observable—students will naturally notice the color match.\n- **Vocabulary pacing**: Don't rush through vocabulary. Second graders need repetition. Use vocabulary words consistently throughout the week in different contexts.\n- **Common misconception**: Some students may think animals choose their colors or deliberately hide. Use language like \"is born with\" and \"helps it survive\" rather than \"tries to hide.\"\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is fully scaffolded for Second Grade and aligns with 2-LS4-1 by having students observe, compare, and discuss how animals' body structures help them live in specific habitats. The 5E structure allows for discovery, clarification, and meaningful application.",
