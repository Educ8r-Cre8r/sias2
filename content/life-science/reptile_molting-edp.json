  "content": "# NGSS Engineering Design Process Challenge\n\n## Visible Elements in Photo\n- A lizard (brown and white patterned) perched on a green leaf or plant stem\n- Elongated body with four legs and a long tail\n- Textured skin with distinct color patterns (brown spots on white belly, brown on back and tail)\n- Green plant material (leaf or stem) serving as the lizard's perch\n- Natural outdoor setting with blurred green background\n\n## Reasonable Inferences\n- **From lizard's grip on narrow stem**: This animal needs to climb and balance on thin plant surfaces, suggesting specialized feet or body design adapted for grip and stability.\n- **From color pattern (brown/white contrast)**: The lizard's coloring may provide camouflage in its natural habitat, helping it hide from predators or prey.\n- **From leaf/stem structure**: The plant must support the lizard's weight without bending or breaking, implying strength-to-weight balance is important in nature.\n\n## Engineering Task\n\n### **K-2: Simple Version**\n**\"Design a Safe Climbing Path for a Lizard\"**\n\nYour job: Build a path that a small lizard (or toy lizard) can climb and balance on. Use string, sticks, or paper strips to make branches and leaves. Your path must:\n- Be at least as thick as a pencil (so the lizard can hold on)\n- Go up at least 12 inches high\n- Not wobble or fall apart when you gently touch it\n\nCan your lizard stay on without falling off?\n\n---\n\n### **3-5: Constraint-Based Version**\n**\"Engineer a Climbing Structure That Mimics Plant Support\"**\n\nDesign and build a structure that allows a small animal (toy figurine, 2–3 inches long) to climb safely from the ground to a height of 18 inches. Your structure must:\n- Use only 5 different types of materials (e.g., dowels, string, leaves, foam, tape)\n- Support the animal's weight without bending more than ½ inch at any point\n- Include at least 3 different \"perch\" or \"grip\" surfaces (branches, ledges, etc.) with varying diameters (thick to thin)\n- Be stable enough that the animal doesn't slide or tip when placed on any perch\n\n**Test it**: Does your structure hold the animal in at least 5 different positions without failing?\n\n## EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem** — This phase fits best.\n\n**Why**: The photo shows a real animal solving a real problem (maintaining grip and balance on living plant material in nature). Students can observe the lizard's body design and the plant's structure, then identify the core problem: *\"How do plants support climbing animals?\"* and *\"What makes a good climbing surface?\"* From there, they design their own structure. The problem is grounded in nature observation rather than jumping directly to a solution.\n\n## Suggested Materials\n1. **Dowels or thin wooden sticks** (various diameters: ¼\", ½\", ¾\")\n2. **String or jute twine** (for wrapping, hanging, or creating rope \"branches\")\n3. **Foam tubing or pool noodles** (soft, grippy, easy to cut into perches)\n4. **Real plant material** (collected leaves, bark, small branches from outside)\n5. **Tape** (duct tape, painter's tape, or masking tape for joining/securing)\n*Optional*: Hot glue gun, foam blocks, or plastic cups (for varied grip surfaces)\n\n## Estimated Time\n**Two 30-minute sessions** (or one 45–60 minute block):\n- Session 1: Observation, discussion, sketching design (15–20 min); building begins (15–20 min)\n- Session 2: Finish building, test, troubleshoot, revise (30 min)\n\n## Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task aligns with **NGSS K-ETS1-1 / 1-ETS1-1 / 3-5-ETS1-1** (*Ask questions, define problems, and develop possible solutions*) by having students observe a real animal's biomechanical needs and translate that observation into a human-made structure that solves the same problem of climbing and stability.",
