Identify fungi as decomposers and explain their role in breaking down dead material in ecosystems.\n2. Describe how fungi help nutrients return to the soil so plants can use them.\n3. Create a model showing how matter moves from dead wood through decomposers back into the environment.\n4. Recognize that fungi are living organisms with specific adaptations for survival in moist, shaded environments.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about the mysterious organisms in the photograph and activate prior knowledge about decomposition.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of fungi on tree branch (displayed clearly)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording student observations\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** large and prominently. Tell students: \"These strange-looking things appeared on a tree branch in a forest after a rainy week. What do you think they are? Are they plants? Animals? Something else?\"\n\n2. **Facilitate 3–4 discussion questions:**\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this growing on a dead log or tree? Where was it?\"\n   - \"Why do you think these only appear in wet or damp places?\"\n   - \"What do you think happens to dead wood in the forest? Does it just stay there forever, or does something break it down?\"\n   - \"If these organisms weren't here, what would happen to all the dead leaves and branches on the forest floor?\"\n\n3. **Record student ideas** on chart paper (do not correct misconceptions yet—this is about capturing curiosity).\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"I'm going to tell you these are living things called fungi. Make a prediction: What job do you think fungi do in the forest?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's investigate how fungi grow and what role they play in keeping forests healthy.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover decomposition and fungal growth through a hands-on investigation using safe, observable materials.\n\n**Materials (per student group, groups of 3–4):**\n- Clear plastic container or small aquarium (or zip-lock bag)\n- Moist soil (pre-moistened, not waterlogged)\n- Dead leaves, shredded newspaper, or small dry wood pieces\n- Hand lens or magnifying glass\n- Water spray bottle (for keeping materials moist)\n- Paper towels\n- Labels and markers\n- Observation sheet (template provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Preparation (Teacher does before class):**\n- Prepare 2–3 demonstration containers 1–2 weeks in advance with soil, organic matter, and light moisture so fungi or mold begins to grow visibly. Keep them in a cool, shaded location.\n- Prepare fresh student containers with moist soil and organic matter that students will observe over the next week.\n\n**Student Steps:**\n\n1. **Set up observation containers:** Each group receives a container with moist soil and dead organic material (leaves, wood chips, paper).\n\n2. **Make baseline observations:** Before covering the container, students use a hand lens to examine the materials closely. They draw what they see and describe the texture, color, and arrangement of materials. Record on observation sheet: \"What do the dead leaves and wood look like right now?\"\n\n3. **Observe demonstration containers:** Show students the pre-prepared containers where decomposition is already visible. Ask: \"What changes do you see compared to the fresh materials? What white, fuzzy, or mushroom-like things are growing?\"\n\n4. **Seal and place containers:** Groups cover their containers loosely (allowing air flow but maintaining moisture) and place them in a shaded, cool location. Water lightly if materials dry out.\n\n5. **Daily observations (over 5–7 days):** Each day, students observe without opening the container. They use the hand lens to look for changes: fuzzy growth, color changes, breakdown of materials, moisture, odors (by smelling through a small hole), and any mushroom-like structures.\n\n6. **Document findings:** Students complete the observation sheet daily with drawings and descriptions. Encourage them to notice: \"Are the materials breaking apart? What's growing on them? How has the color or texture changed?\"\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Day 1 baseline sketch and description\n- Daily observations (drawings + 2–3 sentence descriptions)\n- Any visible growth (color, texture, location)\n- Changes in the organic materials (are they breaking down?)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups asking guiding questions: \"What do you notice that's different from yesterday? Where is the growth happening? Why do you think it's growing there and not somewhere else?\"\n- Do NOT explain what is happening yet—let students observe and wonder.\n- Ensure containers stay moist but not waterlogged.\n- Remind students that fungi are alive and growing, just very slowly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe visible decomposition over several days.\n- Students identify fuzzy or mushroom-like growth (fungi/mold) on organic materials.\n- Students notice that moist, shaded materials break down faster and show more growth.\n- Students document observations through drawings and descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce scientific vocabulary and explain the role of fungi in decomposition and nutrient cycling after students have observed and generated questions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Labeled diagram of fungal life cycle or simple decomposition illustration\n- Optional: magnified photo of mushroom gills or fungal mycelium\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2–3 groups to share their observations: \"What did you notice growing in your containers? How did the materials change?\"\n   - Record patterns students noticed (fuzzy growth, breakdown of leaves, moisture, mold appearing).\n\n2. **Introduce Fungi and Decomposers (5 minutes):**\n   - Explain: \"The fuzzy and mushroom-like things you observed are called **fungi** (plural) or **fungus** (singular). They are living organisms, but they are not plants or animals—they are their own group!\"\n   - Show the original photograph again: \"These are fungi too! They grow on dead wood in the forest, just like the growth you saw in your containers.\"\n\n3. **Teach Key Vocabulary (5 minutes):**\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---------------------------|\n   | **Fungi** | Living organisms that eat dead plants and animals by breaking them down; they are not plants or animals. |\n   | **Decomposer** | A living thing that breaks down dead material and turns it into nutrients that go back into the soil. |\n   | **Decomposition** | The process of dead things breaking down and changing form. |\n   | **Mycelium** | The network of tiny threads that fungi grow under the soil or in dead wood; you can't always see it. |\n   | **Fruiting Body** | The part of the fungus you can see above ground (like a mushroom)—this is where spores are made for making new fungi. |\n\n4. **Explain the Decomposition Process:**\n   - Draw a simple diagram on the board showing: Dead Leaves/Wood → Fungi Break It Down → Nutrients Return to Soil → Plants Use Nutrients\n   - \"Fungi are nature's recyclers. Without fungi, dead leaves and branches would pile up and never break down. Fungi release special chemicals that soften and break apart dead material. Then the nutrients from that dead material get mixed back into the soil.\"\n   - Reference their observations: \"Remember the fuzzy growth in your containers? That's fungi eating the dead leaves and breaking them down.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we didn't have fungi, what would happen to all the dead leaves that fall in a forest?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do fungi grow better in wet, shaded places like under logs?\"\n   - Have students turn-and-talk with a partner: \"How is a fungus like a decomposer?\"\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Chart:**\nPost a visual chart with the five vocabulary terms and simple illustrations (students can sketch these). Leave it visible for reference throughout the lesson.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand fungi are decomposers.\n- Students can explain that decomposers break down dead material and return nutrients to soil.\n- Students recognize the fruiting bodies (mushrooms) as the visible reproductive part of fungi.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students deepen understanding by creating a model of nutrient cycling and applying their knowledge to a forest ecosystem scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster paper or whiteboard (one per group or pairs)\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Pre-cut paper cutouts or sticky notes labeled: \"Dead Leaf,\" \"Fungi,\" \"Soil,\" \"Plant,\" \"Water,\" \"Nutrients,\" \"Mushroom\"\n- Optional: images of forest floor ecosystems\n\n**Activity: Nutrient Cycle Model**\n\n1. **Pair or small-group activity:**\n   - Give each pair/group a large sheet of poster paper and labeled cutouts.\n   - Prompt: \"We're going to show how matter moves through a forest using fungi. Arrange these pieces to show: How does a dead leaf turn into nutrients? Where do fungi fit in? How do plants use what the fungi create?\"\n\n2. **Model Creation Steps:**\n   - Groups arrange cutouts on their poster, showing a cycle.\n   - They add arrows showing the flow of matter (dead leaf → fungi breaks it down → nutrients in soil → plant uses nutrients).\n   - They can draw additional details (rain/water, underground mycelium, new plant growth).\n   - Groups label each step with 1–2 sentences explaining what's happening.\n\n3. **Gallery Walk & Discussion:**\n   - Post models around the room.\n   - Students walk and observe others' models.\n   - Gather to discuss: \"How are the models the same? Did anyone show something different? What did we all agree fungi does?\"\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - Show or describe a forest floor scenario: \"A large tree falls in a forest. It will sit there for many years. Draw or tell me what happens to that tree over time. What do fungi do?\"\n   - Students sketch or write a short \"story\" of what happens to the fallen tree (decomposition timeline).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate while students build models, asking: \"Why did you put the fungi there? What happens next? Where do the nutrients go?\"\n- Support groups in showing the **cycle** aspect (nutrients being reused, not just disappearing).\n- Help students recognize that decomposition is necessary for ecosystems to work.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual model showing fungi's role in breaking down dead matter.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that nutrients cycle and are reused in ecosystems.\n- Students apply concepts to a real forest scenario.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students understand decomposer roles and nutrient cycling using multiple methods.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation checks:** Monitor student conversations during Explore phase. Listen for evidence that students notice decomposition and growth.\n- **Vocabulary checks:** During Explain, ask students to point to or describe fungi, decomposers, and mycelium in pictures or diagrams.\n- **Model assessment:** Review Elaborate models for evidence of nutrient cycling and fungi's role.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\nGive each student a slip of paper with these three prompts (students can draw, write, or use words/pictures):\n\n1. **What is a decomposer? Give an example from the lesson.**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student identifies fungi as a decomposer and explains it breaks down dead material.\n\n2. **Draw or describe what you saw happening in your container. What was breaking down the leaves?**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student references fungi/mold growth and the breakdown of organic material.\n\n3. **Why do forests need fungi?**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student explains that fungi break down dead things and return nutrients to soil, OR that without fungi, dead leaves wouldn't disappear, OR that plants need nutrients from decomposed material.\n\n**Exit Ticket Grading:**\n- **Meets Expectation:** Student answers all three with clear references to decomposition and fungi's role.\n- **Approaching Expectation:** Student answers 2 out of 3 accurately; may need clarification on the cycling process.\n- **Below Expectation:** Student struggles to connect fungi to decomposition or nutrient cycling; revisit with small group.\n\n**Alternative/Additional Assessment Options:**\n- **Quick draw:** Show the original photograph again. Students label the fungi and write one sentence about what it's doing.\n- **Think-pair-share:** \"Tell your partner: Why were there mushrooms growing on that tree branch after rain?\" Listen for evidence of understanding.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify fungi as decomposers and describe their role in breaking down dead material.\n- 75% of students can explain that decomposers return nutrients to soil or show this in their models.\n- Students demonstrate observable learning through drawings, written descriptions, and verbal explanations.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Cards:**\n   - Provide picture cards with one word each (fungi, dead leaf, soil, plant). Students match pictures instead of writing definitions. Use these cards as a reference during all phases.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Sheets:**\n   - Pre-draw boxes for each day (Day 1, Day 2, etc.) with sentence starters: \"I see...\" \"The material looks...\" \"The fungi is...\" Students only need to fill in one or two words per box.\n\n3. **Smaller Group Explain Session:**\n   - Pull a small group during the Explain phase for re-teaching with simpler language and more concrete examples. Use actual fungi/mold samples (in sealed containers) for them to see while you explain.\n\n4. **Exit Ticket Modification:**\n   - Allow students to respond verbally to a teacher or aide instead of writing. Provide answer choices: \"Is a fungus a plant, animal, or neither?\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Spore Investigation:**\n   - Provide a mushroom (or image of one) and ask: \"How does a fungus make more fungi? Research what spores are and how they travel.\" Students investigate using books or a controlled web search, then present findings to the class.\n\n2. **Decomposition Timeline:**\n   - Ask: \"How long do you think it takes fungi to completely break down a dead tree? What factors might speed up or slow down decomposition?\" Students research and create a timeline with realistic estimates, explaining their reasoning.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Modeling Extension:**\n   - Have students create a more complex model showing a forest food web/ecosystem, placing fungi in context with other decomposers, plants, and animals. They must show how the entire cycle works.\n\n4. **Fungal Adaptations:**\n   - Explore: \"Why do fungi need moist, dark places? How are fungi adapted to live this way?\" Students research and present on fungal adaptations (e.g., no chlorophyll, spore dispersal, decomposition enzymes).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Home Decomposition Investigation (1–2 weeks):**\n   - Send home a small sealed bag with moist soil, dead leaves, and a zip-lock bag. Families observe decomposition together over one week and send back photos or drawings. Students present their home findings to the class, comparing with classroom containers.\n\n2. **Local Fungi Scavenger Hunt (Outdoor):**\n   - On a school campus nature walk (especially after rain), students search for fungi on dead logs, mulch, or tree bases using magnifying glasses and a field guide. They sketch and label findings, then share observations. *Teacher note: Establish clear safety rules—look but do not touch, and do not taste anything.*\n\n3. **Decomposition in Different Environments:**\n   - Set up two comparison containers: one in sunlight/warm, one in shade/cool. Students predict and observe which decomposes faster. They document findings and present conclusions about environmental factors affecting decomposition rates.\n\n4. **Mushroom Drawing or Watercolor Art:**\n   - Students create a detailed scientific illustration of the fungi from the original photograph, labeling visible parts (cap, gills, stem). Use this as a visual note-taking activity that combines art and science observation.\n\n5. **Nutrient Cycling Board Game (Collaborative):**\n   - Small groups design a simple board game where players move through the nutrient cycle, advancing when they correctly answer questions about fungi, decomposition, and cycling. Other classes can play the game.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Preparation Notes\n\n**Materials to Gather in Advance:**\n- At least 1–2 weeks before: Prepare demonstration containers with moist soil, organic matter, and fungi starter (use store-bought mushroom spawn or create conditions for natural mold growth).\n- Print or project the photograph clearly.\n- Prepare observation sheets (template below).\n- Gather hand lenses (magnifying glasses).\n- Source dead leaves, wood chips, or dried plant material.\n\n**Safety Reminders:**\n- Students should observe fungi in sealed containers; do not encourage handling of mold or fungi.\n- Wash hands after handling soil and organic materials.\n- Do not allow students to eat or taste any fungi, mold, or organic material.\n- If doing an outdoor hunt, establish clear \"look but don't pick\" or \"sketch only\" rules.\n\n**Timing Tips:**\n- The Explore phase requires 5–7 days of observation. Plan ahead so containers are ready to observe daily.\n- If time is limited, use pre-prepared demonstration containers showing advanced decomposition to compress the observation window.\n- Alternatively, show time-lapse photos of decomposition if live observation isn't feasible.\n\n---\n\n## Observation Sheet Template\n\n**Student Name:________________ Group:________________ Date:_________**\n\n**Container Observations**\n\n| Day | Drawings | Description: What do you see? | Changes from yesterday? |\n|-----|----------|-------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 1   |          | Colors: ______ Texture: ______ | N/A (first day)      |\n| 2   |          |                               |                      |\n| 3   |          |                               |                      |\n| 4   |          |                               |                      |\n| 5   |          |                               |                      |\n\n**Reflection Questions:**\n- Where did the fuzzy/mushroom-like growth appear first? Why there?\n- How did the dead leaves and wood change?\n- What do you think the growth is eating?\n\n---\n\nThis lesson anchors squarely in **5-LS2-1** by helping students develop and refine a model of matter movement through the decomposer pathway—fungi break down dead material and return nutrients to the environment where plants access them. The photograph serves as the concrete entry point, and multiple investigations and models build toward deep understanding of decomposer roles and ecosystem cycling.",
