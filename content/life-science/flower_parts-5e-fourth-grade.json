Identify and label the external parts of a flower (petals, stamen, stigma, stalk) and describe what each part looks like.\n2. Explain how at least two flower parts work together to help the plant reproduce and make seeds.\n3. Construct an argument using evidence that flower structures are adapted to attract pollinators and support the plant's survival.\n4. Use a labeled diagram to show how flower parts have specific shapes and colors that serve different functions.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about flower parts and their purposes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, high-quality printed copy of the photograph (or display on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Individual student observation sheets (printed or digital)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently on the board or screen. Allow 1–2 minutes of silent observation before discussion begins.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about this flower? What parts can you see?\"\n   - \"Do you think all these different parts have jobs to do? Why would a flower need so many different pieces?\"\n   - \"Have you ever wondered why flowers are so colorful and smell so nice? What do you think that's for?\"\n   - \"If a flower's job is to make seeds, which part do you think helps with that?\"\n\n3. **Invite predictions:** \"Turn to a partner and make a prediction: What do you think the yellow dusty stuff on the middle part is, and what do you think it does?\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper in two columns: \"What We See\" and \"What We Think It Does.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become flower detectives. We're going to closely examine real flower parts, discover what each one does, and figure out how they work together to help plants make new seeds.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate flower structures hands-on and discover the functions of different parts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4–5 fresh flowers (large blooms like hibiscus, tulips, or lilies work well; avoid highly fragrant flowers that might distract)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (one per pair of students)\n- Small paper plates or trays (one per pair)\n- Tweezers or small forceps\n- Paper towels\n- Flower Exploration Worksheet (see template below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs.** Provide each pair with one flower, a hand lens, a plate, tweezers, and an exploration worksheet.\n\n2. **Guide the investigation with these steps:**\n   - \"Carefully remove one petal and place it on your plate. Look at it with the magnifying glass. Draw what you see and describe it: What color is it? Is it smooth or bumpy? Why do you think flowers have these?\"\n   - \"Now, gently remove the middle part of the flower (the stamen and stigma cluster). Look closely. What do you see? Can you see the tiny yellow or orange grains? Sprinkle a little bit on a paper towel. That dusty stuff is called pollen. Write down: What does pollen feel like? Where do you see it?\"\n   - \"Look at the stalk holding everything up. Why is it so sturdy? How does that help the flower?\"\n   - \"Now, imagine: If pollen from one flower gets to another flower, what do you think happens next? Record your idea.\"\n\n3. **Students document findings** by drawing, labeling, and writing observations on their worksheet for at least 15 minutes.\n\n4. **Circulate and ask probing questions** without giving answers:\n   - \"What do you notice about the texture of this part?\"\n   - \"How might this part's color or shape help a bee or butterfly?\"\n   - \"What happens when you touch the pollen?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate without revealing answers; encourage students to make their own observations and inferences.\n- Ensure students handle flowers gently and respect the materials.\n- Help students move beyond surface descriptions to think about *why* structures exist: \"That's a great observation! Now, why do you think the flower is built that way?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students identify the basic external flower parts (petals, stamen with pollen, stigma, stalk).\n- Students observe that pollen is dusty and visible on stamens.\n- Students record observations and begin to connect structure to function (e.g., \"Bright colors might attract bugs\").\n- Pairs can articulate at least one hypothesis about how flower parts help with reproduction.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student observations to the science of plant reproduction.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large labeled diagram of a flower (drawn on chart paper or projected)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n- Student-friendly reference sheet (one per student)\n- The original photograph\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Invite pairs to share** one observation or discovery from their flower exploration (2–3 minutes). Record key findings on a class chart.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** using the diagram and real flowers (or parts):\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Petal:** The colorful, soft outer parts of a flower that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Petals often have bright colors and patterns.\n   - **Stamen:** The male reproductive part of the flower that produces pollen (tiny yellow or orange grains). Pollen is needed to make seeds.\n   - **Stigma:** The female reproductive part of a flower that sits at the top. Pollen sticks to the stigma and helps the flower make seeds.\n   - **Stalk (or Stem):** The thick, sturdy part that holds the flower up and carries water and nutrients from the roots to all the flower parts.\n   - **Pollination:** When pollen from one flower travels to the stigma of another flower, usually by wind, bees, or other insects. This is how plants make seeds and new plants.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Look at this picture again. Can you see the pink petals? That's the stamen with all the pollen. And that pointed part at the very top? That's the stigma.\"\n   - \"The flower is colored bright pink to attract insects. When an insect lands on it and visits the pollen, some pollen gets stuck to the insect. When it visits another flower, that pollen gets transferred to the stigma. That's how this flower can make seeds!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding** by asking:\n   - \"Which part makes the pollen?\" (stamen)\n   - \"Why does a flower need to be colorful?\" (to attract pollinators)\n   - \"What has to happen for a flower to make seeds?\" (pollen has to get from the stamen of one flower to the stigma of another flower)\n\n5. **Refer to the exploration data:** \"Remember when you looked at the dusty pollen on the stamen? That's the key to how plants reproduce!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students use new vocabulary to label and describe flower parts.\n- Students articulate that flowers have external structures (petals, stamen, stigma, stalk) that have specific jobs.\n- Students begin to understand the connection between structure and function: colorful petals attract pollinators; pollen enables reproduction.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new context and construct evidence-based arguments about flower adaptation and function.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of 3–4 different flowers (printed or projected): a bright red flower, a small white flower, a purple flower with a landing platform, etc.\n- \"Flower Detective Challenge\" worksheet (see template below)\n- Colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the challenge:** \"Different flowers look different. Let's figure out why. Each flower has external structures that are perfectly suited to help that plant survive and make seeds.\"\n\n2. **Show Image 1** (e.g., a bright red tubular flower):\n   - \"This flower is bright red and tube-shaped. What insects or animals might be attracted to it? Why do you think it's shaped like a tube?\"\n   - Reveal that hummingbirds are attracted to red and can fit their long beaks into tubes. The shape and color are adaptations for this specific pollinator.\n\n3. **Show Image 2** (e.g., a small white clustered flower):\n   - \"This flower is small and white. How might it be different from the red one? What pollinator might visit it?\"\n   - Reveal that small insects like bees are attracted to white clusters. The structure is adapted for these pollinators.\n\n4. **Students work in pairs** to complete a \"Flower Detective\" task:\n   - Draw or describe a new flower image provided.\n   - Label the external parts (petals, stamen, stigma, stalk).\n   - Construct an argument: \"This flower's structure helps it because [explain how shape, color, or other features support survival and reproduction].\"\n   - Use evidence from their exploration or the images shown.\n\n5. **Pairs share arguments** with the class (2–3 pairs; 1 minute each).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate discussions that connect structure to survival and reproduction.\n- Prompt students to think beyond appearance: \"How does the shape help the flower get pollinated?\"\n- Accept and validate diverse but evidence-based arguments.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students apply vocabulary to new flower examples.\n- Students construct arguments linking flower structures to pollinator attraction and reproduction.\n- Students recognize that external structures serve survival and reproductive functions.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of flower structures, their functions, and how they support plant reproduction.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n   - Observe and listen during Explore phase: Can students identify flower parts and describe what they see?\n   - Monitor during Explain vocabulary check: Do students use new terms correctly?\n   - Review Elaborate worksheet: Are students constructing arguments with evidence?\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n   \n   Provide each student with an exit ticket (digital or paper) with these three questions:\n\n   **Question 1 (Knowledge):** \"Label the flower diagram below with these words: petal, stamen, stigma, stalk. Write one sentence about what each part does.\"\n   \n   **Question 2 (Application):** \"Why is it important that flowers are colorful? How does this help the flower make seeds?\"\n   \n   **Question 3 (Reasoning):** \"A flower doesn't have legs to move around. Explain how its structure (the parts you labeled) helps it survive and make new plants.\"\n\n3. **Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n   - ✓ Student correctly labels at least 3 of 4 flower parts on a diagram.\n   - ✓ Student describes at least two functions of flower parts (e.g., petals attract insects, stamen makes pollen).\n   - ✓ Student constructs a statement linking flower structure to pollination or seed production using at least one piece of evidence or observation.\n   - ✓ Student uses new vocabulary (petal, stamen, stigma, stalk, pollen, pollination) in sentences.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Exit ticket responses demonstrate that students can identify, name, and explain the function of external flower structures.\n- Responses show emerging understanding that external structures support the plant's survival and reproduction.\n- Students provide evidence from their exploration or observations to support their explanations.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Reference Sheet:** Provide a laminated card with pictures and one-sentence definitions of petal, stamen, stigma, and stalk. Students can refer to this during all phases.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Worksheet:** For students who struggle with open-ended investigation, provide a worksheet with sentence starters and prompts:\n   - \"The petals are _____ (color) and _____ (texture).\"\n   - \"The pollen looks like _____. It feels _____.\"\n   - \"I think the bright color helps the flower because _____.\"\n\n3. **Partner With Peer Support:** Pair struggling students with confident peers during Explore and Elaborate phases. Assign the peer the role of \"recorder\" or \"observer\" while both explore together.\n\n4. **Shorter Exit Ticket:** Allow students to draw and label a flower diagram and write one sentence about one part's job instead of three written responses.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-Step Pollination Diagram:** Ask advanced students to create a comic strip or diagram showing the steps of pollination: (1) bee visits flower 1, (2) pollen gets on bee, (3) bee visits flower 2, (4) pollen transfers to stigma, (5) seeds develop. Write captions for each step using vocabulary.\n\n2. **Research Pollinator Adaptations:** Challenge students to research and present on a specific pollinator (bees, butterflies, hummingbirds, wind) and how a specific flower is structurally adapted to that pollinator. Create a poster showing the match.\n\n3. **Design a New Flower:** Ask students to design a fictional flower for a fictional pollinator (e.g., a flower for a giant moth, a flower for a lizard). Sketch it, label parts, and write: \"My flower would have these features because _____.\"\n\n4. **Extended Exit Ticket:** Invite advanced students to answer: \"Some flowers are pollinated by wind instead of insects. Predict what external structures a wind-pollinated flower might have that are different from the hibiscus in the photo. Explain your reasoning.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Flower Dissection Deep Dive:** In a follow-up session, provide fresh flowers and hand lenses for students to carefully cut open a flower and examine the ovary (the part that becomes seeds). Students sketch what they find inside and write: \"After pollination happens, the ovary will grow into a _____ (fruit or seed pod).\" This bridges to seed and fruit development.\n\n2. **Pollinator Observation Field Trip or Window Garden:** If possible, take students outside to observe flowers and pollinators in your school garden or local park. Have students sketch and count: \"Which flowers attracted insects? How many insects did you see? Which flower parts were the insects touching?\" Return to class and compare findings.\n\n3. **Life Cycle of a Flowering Plant Poster:** Students create a multi-panel poster showing the stages of a flowering plant: seed → seedling → mature plant → flower → pollination → seed formation → new seeds. Label flower parts and pollination processes. This connects to reproduction and life cycles.\n\n4. **Flower Parts Scavenger Hunt:** Prepare images of 8–10 different flowers (roses, sunflowers, orchids, daisies, tulips, etc.). Students identify and label the external parts on each, noting how structures differ but functions stay the same. Discuss why diversity in flower structure is beneficial.\n\n5. **Plant Reproduction Explanation Video or Storyboard:** Students create a short video, animation, or illustrated storyboard explaining how flowers use their structures to reproduce. Include narration using scientific vocabulary. Share with the class or other grade levels.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
