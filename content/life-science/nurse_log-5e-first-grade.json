Observe and describe what happens to a fallen log over time and identify living things that use logs as homes.\n2. Explain that logs provide shelter and food for plants, animals, and tiny decomposers that help things grow.\n3. Design a small shelter or home structure for an animal, using what they learned about how logs protect living things.\n4. Compare a healthy, living tree with a decaying log and describe how they are different but connected in nature.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about fallen logs and the creatures that live in them.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital display of the photograph (nurse log with visible decay and hollow center)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Small pieces of bark or rotting wood (if safely available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Let students look at it silently for 15-20 seconds while soft music plays (this builds anticipation).\n\n2. **Ask these specific questions** to spark curiosity (pause after each for responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What's happened to this wood?\"\n   - \"Do you think anything could live *inside* this log? What might live there?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this log is so soft and broken? What could have made it this way?\"\n   - \"If you were a tiny bug or a baby plant, would you want to live in this log? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what's hiding inside this log right now. What do *you* wonder about it?\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper. Accept all responses without judgment. Celebrate curiosity.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become log detectives! We'll learn what really lives in fallen logs and why they're so special for forest creatures and plants.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover what logs do in nature by observing, handling, and predicting what lives in decaying wood.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 3-4 pieces of rotting wood or bark (medium-sized, safe to handle; collect from outside or purchase from garden center; ensure no sharp splinters)\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per pair of students)\n- Paper plates or trays (1 per pair)\n- Small paintbrushes (to gently move debris)\n- Observation recording sheets (simple template with space to draw/write)\n- Hand sanitizer or wipes\n- Optional: A few small toy animals or plant figures for dramatic play\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Safety first:** Demonstrate how to handle rotting wood gently and safely. Show students that they should never put wood in their mouths and should wash hands after.\n\n2. **Pair students.** Give each pair a paper plate with a piece of rotting wood on it.\n\n3. **Guided exploration (8 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at your wood very carefully. Use the magnifying glass. What does it feel like? Is it hard or soft? Light or dark?\"\n   - \"Gently brush away some bits. What do you see inside? Are there any tiny tunnels or holes? Can you find any creatures?\" (Ants, pill bugs, beetles, fungi are common.)\n   - \"Does your wood look like the log in the picture? How is it the same or different?\"\n\n4. **Recording observations (5 minutes):**\n   - Students draw or dictate what they found in their wood piece.\n   - Prompt: \"Draw something you think lives in this log.\"\n\n5. **Share and compare (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 pairs to briefly show their wood and one thing they noticed. Did everyone find the same things? Different things?\n\n6. **Dramatic connection (2 minutes):**\n   - If using toy animals: \"Let's imagine a small animal finds this log. Where could it make a home? Show me with the toy.\" Students place toys in/on the wood pieces.\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you think *that* hole is for? Could an ant live here? What would it eat?\" Avoid correcting observations; instead, ask follow-up questions to deepen thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students should discover evidence of living things in wood (tunnels, small creatures, soft areas), recognize that logs have spaces to hide in, and begin to understand that logs are homes.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts, connecting exploration to the role of logs in nature.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard with drawn or printed images of:\n  - A healthy standing tree\n  - A fallen log\n  - A decaying log with visible decomposers (fungi, insects) and new plant growth\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (4 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Who found something living in their wood? Raise your hand if you saw a tiny creature or a tunnel.\"\n   - \"Why do you think all those bugs and creatures want to live in the wood?\"\n   - Guide them toward: *The log is soft, has spaces to hide, and has food.*\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Display and define each term with pictures:\n\n     **Decomposer** – A tiny living thing (like fungi or bacteria) that eats dead wood and breaks it into smaller pieces. Point to the dark, soft areas in the photograph. \"This soft part? Decomposers are eating it and making it crumbly.\"\n     \n     **Decay** – When something dead, like a log, slowly breaks apart and rots over many, many days. \"That's what's happening to our log—it's decaying.\"\n     \n     **Habitat** – A home where plants and animals live and find food and shelter. \"This log is a habitat for many creatures!\"\n     \n     **Nutrients** – Special stuff in soil that helps plants grow big and strong. \"When the log decays, it turns into nutrients that help new plants grow.\"\n     \n     **Nurse Log** – A special name for a fallen log that becomes home to plants, animals, and decomposers. (This is visible in the photograph—notice the moss and plants growing ON the log!) \"This log 'nurses' or helps new life grow.\"\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to different parts: \"See how dark and soft this center is? Decomposers have been working here for a long time.\"\n   - \"See this lighter wood on the sides? This part is newer and not decayed as much yet.\"\n   - \"Notice the plants growing around it? This log is giving them nutrients as it breaks down.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"If I saw a beetle living inside a log, what would we call that log?\"\n   - \"What tiny decomposers are making this log soft and crumbly?\"\n   - Accept responses and affirm correct vocabulary use.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Decomposer:** A tiny living thing that eats dead wood and breaks it into smaller pieces.\n- **Decay:** The slow breaking down and rotting of something that was once alive.\n- **Habitat:** A home or safe place where living things find food, water, and shelter.\n- **Nutrients:** Special materials in soil that help plants grow.\n- **Nurse Log:** A fallen, decaying log that becomes home to animals and plants while feeding the forest soil.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students should understand that logs decay over time, that decomposers cause this, and that logs are homes for creatures and sources of nutrients for new plants.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing their own shelter inspired by how logs protect living things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small boxes, paper towel tubes, fabric scraps, leaves, small sticks, clay\n- Tape and glue (non-toxic)\n- A small toy animal figure (insect, mouse, pill bug, etc.) per student or pair\n- Design planning sheet (simple template with picture + words)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set the context (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember how logs have dark spaces and soft places to hide? Imagine a tiny creature needs a new home. Can you design a shelter like a log?\"\n\n2. **Think-pair-share (3 minutes):**\n   - Think: \"What does an animal need in a home to stay safe?\" (Darkness, warmth, space, protection from weather.)\n   - Pair: \"Turn to a partner and share one thing a home needs.\"\n   - Share: Call on 3-4 pairs. Write their ideas on the board.\n\n3. **Design and build (10 minutes):**\n   - Give each student (or pair) materials and a toy animal.\n   - Directions: \"Build a shelter for your creature using these materials. Make it like a log—dark, cozy, and hard to find. Your creature should be able to fit inside and hide.\"\n   - Circulate and ask: \"Why did you choose that material? What does your shelter do to keep your creature safe?\"\n   - Encourage students to think about what they learned from the real logs.\n\n4. **Gallery walk or share-around (3 minutes):**\n   - Briefly display shelters. Ask students: \"Which shelter would keep a creature safest? Why?\"\n   - Connect back to the log: \"Real logs do this for creatures in the forest!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** Ask guiding questions but let students lead the design. Celebrate creative thinking and connections to the photograph's log.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students create a shelter showing understanding that logs provide protection, dark spaces, and safety for animals.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of logs as habitats and the role of decomposers in nature.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Explore phase: Were they able to identify evidence of living things in wood?\n- Listen to vocabulary use during Explain: Did they use \"habitat,\" \"decay,\" \"decomposer\" appropriately?\n- Review observation sheets and drawings from Explore.\n- Ask students to explain their designs during Elaborate: \"Why is your shelter like the log in the picture?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (5 minutes):**\nAdminister orally or as a simple written/drawn response. Ask students to respond to **any two of the following:**\n\n1. \"Show me or tell me: What lives inside a decaying log? Draw it or tell me about it.\"\n2. \"Why would a small bug want to live in a log? What does the log give it?\"\n3. \"What happens to a log over a long, long time? Use the word 'decay' if you can.\"\n4. \"If you were a tiny plant, why might a fallen log be a good place to grow?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students recognize that logs are habitats for living things (insects, fungi, small animals, plants).\n- Students identify or infer that logs provide shelter and/or food.\n- Students use at least one vocabulary term correctly (decomposer, decay, habitat, or nutrients).\n- Students show understanding that logs change over time and support new life.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most first graders should be able to identify at least one creature or decomposer living in/on a log.\n- They should explain that logs provide shelter or homes.\n- They should demonstrate understanding that logs break down and help plants grow.\n- Responses will vary in sophistication, but all should show observation skills and curiosity about forest habitats.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Vocabulary scaffolding:** Use picture cards continuously during Explain and Elaborate phases. Pair vocabulary words with movements (decay = crumble your fingers, habitat = make a house with your hands) to build multi-sensory understanding.\n\n2. **Guided observation:** During Explore, pair struggling readers/writers with strong partners. Use hand-over-hand guidance if needed to help them handle materials safely and notice details. Provide a simpler recording sheet with only picture boxes (no writing required).\n\n3. **Simplified design task:** Instead of building a shelter, have students place a toy animal on a pre-made model log and explain where it hides. Reduce the number of design materials available so they're not overwhelmed.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research extension:** Ask: \"Can you find out what kinds of animals or insects actually live in logs? Let's look at a book together.\" Have them create a picture guide of log creatures using classroom or library resources.\n\n2. **Prediction and observation:** Challenge them to predict what stage of decay their wood sample is in (early, middle, late) based on its color, hardness, and what's living in it. Have them sketch a \"timeline\" showing a log from fresh-fallen to fully decomposed.\n\n3. **Complex design challenge:** Ask them to design a shelter that includes: (1) a hiding space, (2) a food storage area, (3) protection from water. Have them label their design and explain how it mimics a real log.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Forest walk and log hunt:** Take students on a supervised outdoor walk (if available) to find real fallen logs. Have them observe without handling, draw what they see, and count how many logs they find. Discuss: \"Are any of these nurse logs? How can we tell?\" This reinforces outdoor learning and real-world connection.\n\n2. **Decomposition time-lapse observation:** Set up a classroom \"log decay station\" with several wood samples at different decay stages (fresh, medium, very soft). Photograph them weekly and create a simple time-lapse display. Students can predict: \"Which one will be next to look like the picture?\"\n\n3. **Story or dramatic play:** Read a picture book about forest habitats (e.g., *A Log's Life* by W. J. Moore, or similar) and have students act out the life of a log—starting as a healthy tree, falling, being inhabited, decaying, and becoming soil. This combines language arts with deeper science understanding and is highly engaging for first graders.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\nThis lesson builds first-grade observation and inferential reasoning skills while fostering wonder about nature. The photograph of the nurse log is concrete and visually compelling for young learners. By moving from observation → hands-on exploration → vocabulary → design, students construct deep understanding of how logs support life in ecosystems. The lesson is safe, inclusive, and aligns with the natural curiosity of six- and seven-year-olds about creatures and forests.",
