ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, high-resolution projection or printed copy of the cicada photograph\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board without any introduction. Let students look silently for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask students to turn to a partner** and respond to these questions (give 2-3 minutes for discussion):\n   - \"What living thing do you see in this picture? What is it doing?\"\n   - \"How many legs do you count? What else do you notice about its body?\"\n   - \"Why do you think it might be sitting on this plant?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate a whole-class discussion** using these guiding questions:\n   - \"Can anyone name this insect?\" (Accept answers; confirm it's a cicada if no one knows.)\n   - \"What body parts can you see that help this insect survive?\" (Look for: wings, legs, antennae, eyes, colored body.)\n   - \"If you were a bird hunting for food, would you be able to spot this insect easily? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What do you wonder about how this insect uses its body parts to stay alive?\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper (e.g., \"How does it use its antennae?\" \"Why are its colors brown and orange?\" \"Where does it go at night?\").\n\n5. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"Think about an insect you've seen before. How do you think its body is similar to or different from this cicada? Turn and talk to your partner.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become bug detectives! We'll explore how insects like cicadas use their body parts to survive, find food, and stay safe. Let's start by examining an insect up close.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- Plastic or dried insect specimens (crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, or high-quality insect models from science suppliers) — **OR** high-resolution printed insect images on laminated cards if live specimens are unavailable\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- White paper or the \"Insect Body Parts Explorer\" worksheet (teacher-prepared, see directions below)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Ruler\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Your group has been given an insect to study closely. You may be looking at the actual insect (if it is safely preserved) or a detailed picture of one.\"\n\n2. \"Using your hand lens, examine the insect very carefully. Look for these body parts and list them on your paper:\n   - Legs (count them!)\n   - Wings\n   - Antennae\n   - Eyes\n   - Any colors or patterns on the body\"\n\n3. \"Draw a simple labeled diagram of your insect on your white paper. Label at least 5 external body parts. Write one or two words next to each part explaining what you think it does. For example: 'Legs — for walking' or 'Antennae — for feeling things.'\"\n\n4. \"Now, think like a scientist: If your insect wanted to find food on a plant, which body parts would be most helpful? Circle those parts on your diagram.\"\n\n5. \"Turn to your group members and share: How could the colors and shape of your insect help it hide on a tree branch or leaf? Take turns talking.\"\n\n6. **Record observations on the worksheet** (teacher provides a simple table: \"Body Part | What I See | What I Think It Does\").\n\n**Connection to photograph:** \"Notice how the cicada in our photo has long legs for gripping the plant stem, wings for flying away if danger comes, and antennae for sensing the world around it — just like the insect you're studying!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups with prompting questions: \"Why do you think this body part is shaped this way?\" \"What might happen if an insect didn't have antennae?\" \"How does this help the insect survive?\"\n- Ask students to **explain their thinking** rather than telling them the answers.\n- Support groups that struggle by asking them to simply describe what they observe first, then think about why that might matter.\n- Ensure hand lenses are used safely and specimens/images are treated gently.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Each student produces a labeled insect diagram with at least 5 body parts identified.\n- Students record observational data on the worksheet showing which body parts they noticed.\n- Students begin to make connections between body structure and survival function (e.g., \"Wings help insects escape\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- The original cicada photograph (projected or large print)\n- Pre-made poster or digital slide with vocabulary terms and images\n- Student notebooks or paper for recording definitions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Invite 2-3 groups to share** their diagrams and observations (3 minutes). Ask the class: \"What body parts did most insects have in common?\" Guide students to notice: legs, wings, antennae, eyes.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** using student-friendly language and the photograph as reference:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **External structures (or external body parts):** The parts on the outside of an animal's body that we can see. \"The legs, wings, and antennae of a cicada are external structures.\"\n\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. \"A cicada's wings are an adaptation that lets it fly away from danger.\"\n\n- **Camouflage:** Colors or patterns on an animal's body that help it hide from other animals. \"The brown and orange colors of this cicada are camouflage that matches the plant stem — predators have a harder time seeing it!\"\n\n- **Senses:** Ways an animal gets information about the world (sight, touch, smell, hearing, taste). \"Cicadas use their antennae to sense (touch and smell) what's around them.\"\n\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. \"A cicada's habitat is on trees and plants.\"\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:** \n   - Point to the cicada's wings and say: \"The cicada has wings on the outside of its body. This is a structure that helps it survive. Why? Because if a bird comes, it can fly away quickly!\"\n   - Point to the antennae and say: \"Those long, thin parts coming from its head are antennae. The cicada uses them to sense the world — to find plants to eat and to know if danger is near. That's how it uses its senses to respond.\"\n   - Point to the colors and say: \"Notice the brown, orange, and green colors. This is camouflage. The cicada is sitting on a stem with red leaves. Its colors are similar, so birds flying overhead have trouble spotting it. This adaptation helps it stay safe!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding** by asking:\n   - \"Who can point to an external structure on the cicada and tell me how it helps the insect survive?\"\n   - \"Why is camouflage an important adaptation for a cicada?\"\n   - Ask students to turn and talk: \"What senses do you think a cicada uses the most when it's on a plant? Why?\"\n\n5. **Anchor chart creation:** Create a simple T-chart on poster paper:\n   - **Left side:** \"Cicada Body Parts\" (draw or paste a labeled diagram)\n   - **Right side:** \"How It Helps the Cicada Survive\" (legs = gripping the plant; wings = escaping predators; antennae = finding food and detecting danger)\n   - Post this in the classroom for reference throughout the unit.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can define external structures, adaptations, camouflage, and senses in their own words.\n- Students can identify at least two external structures on the cicada and explain their survival function.\n- Students understand that insects use their senses to gather information and respond to their environment.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Scenario cards (teacher-prepared, printed) with different insect situations\n- Large paper and markers for group posters\n- Pictures of different insects in different habitats (optional; can download from science websites)\n- \"Insect Survival Challenge\" worksheet (teacher-prepared)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Insect Survival Challenge (Recommended for most classes)**\n\n1. **Present a scenario to the class:** \"A cicada wants to lay eggs on a plant. To do this safely, it needs to find the right plant, move to the plant without getting eaten, and know where to lay its eggs. Which of its body structures and senses does it need to use?\"\n\n2. **Divide the class into 3-4 small groups.** Assign each group a different insect scenario card:\n   - **Card 1:** \"A cricket needs to find food at night. What body parts help it hunt in the dark?\"\n   - **Card 2:** \"A grasshopper is escaping from a predator. How do its body structures help it get away?\"\n   - **Card 3:** \"A beetle is camouflaged on tree bark. How does its body help it hide?\"\n   - **Card 4:** \"A dragonfly catches flying insects for food. What body parts does it need to use?\"\n\n3. **Each group discusses and creates a poster** that includes:\n   - A drawing or diagram of their insect\n   - Labels for at least 3 body structures\n   - Explanations of how each structure helps the insect solve its survival problem\n   - A sentence about how the insect uses its senses\n\n4. **Gallery walk:** Groups post their posters around the room. Students walk and read each one. Teacher asks reflective questions: \"Which adaptation would you want if you were an insect? Why?\"\n\n**Option B: \"If I Were a Bug\" Creative-Scientific Task (Alternative)**\n\n1. Students choose an insect from the ones studied (or the cicada).\n2. They write and/or draw: \"If I were a [insect name], I would use my [body part] to [survival action] because [reason].\"\n3. Example: \"If I were a cicada, I would use my wings to fly to a new plant because predators are dangerous on my old plant.\"\n4. Students share aloud or post responses.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate group discussions by asking: \"Why did you choose that body part? How does it solve the problem?\"\n- Guide students to think about **multiple senses** and **multiple structures** working together.\n- Encourage students to use the vocabulary from the Explain phase naturally in their explanations.\n- Prompt connections: \"How is this insect's solution similar to what we learned about the cicada?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students apply knowledge of external structures and adaptations to new insect scenarios.\n- Students can explain connections between specific body parts and survival functions.\n- Students recognize that multiple body structures and senses work together to help insects survive.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n\n- **Observation checklist** (teacher uses during Explore and Elaborate):\n  - ☐ Student accurately identifies external body parts.\n  - ☐ Student explains how at least two structures help survival.\n  - ☐ Student uses sensory language (e.g., \"feels,\" \"detects,\" \"senses\").\n  - ☐ Student makes connections between body structure and function.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide students with a simple exit ticket (on index card or half-sheet) with one or more of these prompts:\n\n**Option 1: Diagram with Explanation**\n- \"Draw the cicada from our photograph. Label its wings, legs, and antennae. Write one sentence for each: How does this body part help the cicada survive?\"\n\n**Option 2: Short Answer**\n- \"A cicada sits on a green plant stem. Why is its brown and orange coloring an important adaptation? How does it help the cicada?\"\n- \"Imagine a cicada's antennae stop working. What problems might the cicada have? Explain your thinking.\"\n\n**Option 3: Multiple Choice (for differentiation)**\n- \"Which body part helps a cicada escape from a bird?\n  - A) Antennae\n  - B) Wings\n  - C) Legs\n  - D) Eyes\n  Explain why you chose that answer.\"\n\n**Option 4: Think-Pair-Share Exit**\n- Students think about: \"What was the most interesting thing you learned about how insects' bodies help them survive?\" Then share with a partner, and teacher listens to 3-4 pairs to gauge understanding.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery when they:\n\n1. **Identify at least 3 external structures** of insects and correctly name them.\n2. **Explain how at least 2 structures help the insect survive**, using specific examples (e.g., \"Wings help it escape\" or \"Antennae help it find food\").\n3. **Describe camouflage or adaptation** in their own words and connect it to the cicada's survival.\n4. **Use the term \"senses\"** or name specific senses (sight, touch, smell) when discussing how insects interact with their habitat.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- 80% of students will correctly identify external structures and their survival functions on the exit ticket.\n- Students can explain, in writing or verbally, how at least two body parts help an insect survive.\n- Students show understanding of the connection between body structure, adaptation, and survival.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Provide a body parts reference sheet** during the Explore phase: A laminated card showing labeled diagrams of common insect parts with simple words and pictures. Students can match their observations to the reference.\n\n2. **Use sentence starters** for exit tickets and explanations:\n   - \"This body part helps the insect __________ because __________.\"\n   - \"The cicada's __________ color helps it hide on __________.\"\n   - \"The antenna is used for __________.\"\n\n3. **Offer a simpler observation task:** Instead of drawing a detailed diagram, students can point to body parts on a photograph and say or write the name and one word about its function. Teacher or peer scribe records responses.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Comparative anatomy task:** Provide pictures of several insects (cicada, grasshopper, dragonfly, ant, ladybug). Students analyze: \"How are their body structures different? What does each insect's body tell us about where it lives and what it eats?\" Students create a comparison chart or poster.\n\n2. **Research and presentation:** Assign students to research the **complete life cycle** of a cicada (egg → nymph → adult) and create a diagram showing how the insect's body structures change as it grows. How do these changes help it survive at different life stages?\n\n3. **Design an insect:** Students create an imaginary insect that must survive in a specific habitat (e.g., underwater, in a cave, in the desert). They design the insect's body structures and explain how each adaptation helps it survive in that environment. Encourage detailed drawings and written explanations.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Insect Hunt Field Trip / Classroom Observation Station:**\n   - If safe and feasible, take students outdoors to observe insects on plants (or set up a terrarium in the classroom with live insects such as crickets or mealworms).\n   - Students sketch what they see, locate the insect's external structures, and record: \"Where is the insect? What is it doing? What structures help it do that?\"\n   - Debrief indoors: \"How did this living insect's body structures match what we learned from the cicada?\"\n\n2. **Create an Insect Identity Card Game:**\n   - Teacher or students create illustrated cards for 6-8 different insects (cicada, ladybug, grasshopper, butterfly, ant, dragonfly, bee, beetle).\n   - Each card includes a labeled diagram and 3-4 clues about the insect's adaptations and habitat.\n   - Students play in pairs: One student reads clues aloud (\"I have long, powerful back legs,\" \"I can jump 20 times my body length\"), and the partner guesses the insect. Discuss why that insect's body is suited to its survival needs.\n\n3. **\"Predator and Prey\" Movement Game:**\n   - Act out the cicada's escape response using the classroom space.\n   - Half the class are \"predators\" (birds hunting); half are \"cicadas.\"\n   - Cicadas must move to \"plants\" (marked areas) and hide using camouflage (students hold colored paper matching the plant's \"color\").\n   - After the game, discuss: \"Which body structures did the cicada use to survive? (Legs to run, wings to fly, camouflage to hide.) How did the predator try to find it? (Eyes, senses.)\"\n   - This kinesthetic activity reinforces how structures and senses work together for survival.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Photography connection:** The original cicada photograph is excellent for repeated reference. Consider printing a large version to display throughout the unit and refer back to it frequently: \"Remember the cicada we studied? What body part helped it survive?\"\n\n- **Scaffold the \"why\" questions:** Fourth graders are still developing causal reasoning. Help them by modeling: \"The cicada has wings. Why? Because if a predator comes, it needs to fly away. Staying put would be dangerous.\"\n\n- **Safety reminder:** If using live or preserved insects, review classroom norms: gentle observation only, hand washing after activities, and respect for living creatures.\n\n- **Vocabulary spiraling:** Use these terms repeatedly throughout the unit and other life science lessons. Consider creating a \"Science Word Wall\" with pictures and student-friendly definitions.\n\n- **Parent engagement:** Send home a simple \"Insect Detective\" homework sheet asking students to find a picture of a backyard insect (from a book, magazine, or website) and label its external structures. Students can share findings with the class.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson strongly aligns with 4-LS1-1 by having students construct arguments about how external structures function for survival, and with 4-LS1-2 by exploring how animals receive and respond to sensory information from their environment.**",
