Observe and describe what a chrysalis looks like using descriptive words (color, shape, size).\n2. Explain that butterflies need safe places to rest and grow.\n3. Demonstrate understanding that living things change and grow in different ways.\n4. Identify one thing butterflies need to survive (shelter, time to grow, or a safe place).\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about butterflies and chrysalises using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the monarch chrysalis and empty case\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it large so all students can see clearly. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking—just observing.\n\n2. **Pose these discovery questions** (ask one at a time, allowing think-time):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the colors?\"\n   - \"What do you think this green thing is? Have you ever seen something like it before?\"\n   - \"Look at the other shell on the left. Why do you think it's empty? What could have happened to it?\"\n   - \"If you were a tiny caterpillar, would you want to hide under this eave? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge:** \"Who has ever seen a butterfly outside? What was it doing?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what's inside that green shell right now... Do you think something is living in there?\"\n\n5. **Record student ideas** on chart paper without correcting them. Tell students: \"You're going to become butterfly detectives today and figure this out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore what butterflies really need to grow big and strong.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate chrysalises through sensory observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real chrysalises if available (check with local butterfly conservancy or science supplier); if unavailable, use high-quality photographs printed on cardstock\n- Green modeling clay (1 piece per student or pair)\n- Small twigs or craft sticks\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per pair of students)\n- Paper plates (1 per student pair)\n- Tape\n- Observation recording sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Chrysalis Detective Work (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Pair up students** and give each pair a paper plate, a printed chrysalis photo on cardstock, a hand lens, and a twig.\n\n2. **Explain the task in simple terms:** \"You are butterfly detectives. Look very carefully at your chrysalis picture. Use the magnifying glass to see if you can spot:\n   - What color it is\n   - If it has spots or stripes\n   - What it's holding onto (the twig)\n   - How big or small it is (compare to your thumb)\"\n\n3. **Students observe and point** to what they notice. Circulate and ask:\n   - \"What do you see when you look close?\"\n   - \"Why do you think it's holding onto the stick?\"\n   - \"Is this a safe place for it to be?\"\n\n4. **Record observations** on a simple chart (draw/write):\n   - Color: _________________\n   - Shape: _________________\n   - What it holds onto: _________________\n\n**Part B: Building a Chrysalis Home (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Give each student a piece of green clay.** Explain: \"Butterflies don't just float in the air—they need a safe home while they're growing. Let's build a pretend chrysalis and give it a safe place to stay.\"\n\n2. **Model for students:** Show how to shape the clay into a chrysalis-like shape (smooth, oval, pointed top—don't overthink this; kindergarteners' creations will vary widely and that's perfect).\n\n3. **Students create** their own clay chrysalis, then decide where in the classroom is the SAFEST place for it:\n   - Away from bumpy traffic areas?\n   - Somewhere it won't get stepped on?\n   - In a quiet corner?\n\n4. **Place chrysalises** in the chosen safe spots. Ask: \"Why did you pick this spot? What could hurt a chrysalis if it was somewhere else?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate with guiding questions; do not provide answers.\n- Validate observations without judgment (\"That's an interesting thing you noticed!\").\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"Why do you think butterflies need a safe place?\" and \"What could happen if a chrysalis was out in the rain or in the wind?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and describe a chrysalis using sensory language.\n- Students identify that chrysalises need protection (shelter/safe place).\n- Students create representations and make placement decisions based on safety.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart from Engage phase (student ideas)\n- Picture cards: caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly (printed or drawn)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary\n- Classroom chrysalis models from Explore phase (bring them back to circle area)\n- Optional: short video clip (2–3 min) showing chrysalis-to-butterfly transformation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in circle.** Bring one of their clay chrysalis models to the center.\n\n2. **Revisit the Explore observations:** \"Tell me what you discovered about our chrysalises. What did they look like?\" Write key words on the chart (green, bumpy, small, safe, protected).\n\n3. **Introduce the life cycle concept** (simplified for Kindergarten):\n   - **Show the three picture cards:** \"Butterflies have a big secret. They don't stay the same their whole life. They CHANGE!\n   - First, they're tiny caterpillars (show card, make caterpillar wiggling motions).\n   - Then, they hide in a chrysalis—like you built—while they grow bigger and different (show card).\n   - Finally, they become butterflies with big wings!\" (show card, make flying motions).\n   - **The chrysalis is like a butterfly's bedroom while it's changing.**\n\n4. **Introduce key vocabulary** with actions/definitions:\n\n   | Vocabulary | Kindergarten Definition | Action |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Chrysalis** | A safe shell where a caterpillar grows into a butterfly | Curl up in a ball, then stretch and fly |\n   | **Butterfly** | An insect with four colorful wings that can fly | Flap arms like wings |\n   | **Caterpillar** | A small creature with a long body that eats leaves and crawls | Wiggle fingers down arm like crawling |\n   | **Shelter** | A safe place where animals can rest and be protected | Point to different safe spots in classroom |\n   | **Change** | To become different | Show transformation (show picture sequence) |\n\n5. **Connect back to the photograph:** \"The green chrysalis in the picture is someone's butterfly home. The empty one on the left? That butterfly already grew up and flew away! Look what's left behind—just the empty shell.\"\n\n6. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Can someone show me with your body what a caterpillar does?\" (Students wiggle)\n   - \"Show me a chrysalis.\" (Students curl/make themselves small)\n   - \"Show me a butterfly!\" (Students flutter arms)\n   - \"Why do you think the chrysalis is under the eave in the picture?\" (Listen for: safe, protected, won't fall, won't get wet)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Chrysalis:** A hard shell where a caterpillar changes into a butterfly. It keeps the butterfly safe while it grows.\n- **Butterfly:** A pretty insect with two pairs of colorful wings. It flies from flower to flower.\n- **Caterpillar:** A small creature with a long wiggly body that crawls and eats leaves. It grows into a butterfly.\n- **Shelter:** A safe, protected place where an animal can rest and stay safe from danger.\n- **Change:** To become different. Caterpillars change into butterflies.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the three stages (caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly).\n- Students understand that chrysalises are safe places for growth.\n- Students can identify shelter as something butterflies need.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by creating a butterfly life cycle and thinking about animal needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Three large sheets of butcher paper, each labeled with one stage: \"Caterpillar,\" \"Chrysalis,\" \"Butterfly\"\n- Crayons, markers, colored pencils\n- Pre-cut butterfly and caterpillar shapes (optional, for struggling writers)\n- Magazines (optional, for cutting pictures)\n- Glue sticks\n- Real flowers or pictures of flowers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up three \"life cycle stations\"** around the room, one for each stage.\n\n2. **Explain the activity:** \"We're going to create a giant book about a butterfly's life. At each station, you'll draw or make something that shows what's happening. The butterfly needs different things at each stage—let's think about what!\"\n\n3. **Rotate students through stations** (5 minutes per station, or assign small groups to reduce chaos):\n\n   - **Station 1: \"Caterpillar\"**\n     - \"Caterpillars need to EAT. Draw leaves that a caterpillar loves to munch. Draw the caterpillar eating.\"\n     - Prompt: \"What does a caterpillar need to grow? FOOD!\"\n\n   - **Station 2: \"Chrysalis\"**\n     - \"The chrysalis needs to be SAFE. Draw a safe place for the chrysalis. Draw the eave like in our picture. Draw things that could hurt a chrysalis.\"\n     - Prompt: \"What does a chrysalis need? A SAFE PLACE to rest while it changes!\"\n\n   - **Station 3: \"Butterfly\"**\n     - \"Butterflies need FLOWERS. Draw flowers. Draw the butterfly flying to drink from flowers.\"\n     - Prompt: \"Now the butterfly is grown up! What does it need? FLOWERS for food!\"\n\n4. **As students rotate,** ask them individually:\n   - \"What is this butterfly (or caterpillar) doing?\"\n   - \"Why does it need that?\" (listening for: eat, safe, grow, flowers)\n   - \"What would happen if a caterpillar didn't have leaves?\" (Real thinking, no wrong answers)\n\n5. **Create a bulletin board** by arranging the three papers in sequence with student work. Title it: **\"The Butterfly's Life: What They Need at Every Stage.\"**\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate rotations smoothly.\n- Ask open-ended questions to deepen thinking (\"Why?\" and \"What if?\").\n- Record student language on sticky notes to use in Evaluate phase.\n- Model drawing if students are reluctant.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify at least two things butterflies need: food (leaves or flowers), safety/shelter.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that animals' needs change as they grow.\n- Students create visual representations showing all three life stages.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of chrysalises, life cycles, and animal needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Did students identify safe vs. unsafe places for chrysalises? Did they use descriptive language?\n- Actions during Explain: Could students mimic the three stages? Did they answer connection questions about shelter?\n- Station work during Elaborate: Did students identify at least one need (food, shelter, safety)?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5–10 minutes):**\n\nChoose ONE approach based on your class:\n\n**Option A: Observation & Questioning (Best for most Kindergarten classes)**\n- Gather students in circle.\n- Show the original photograph again.\n- Ask these questions individually (or small group); listen for evidence of understanding:\n  1. \"What is this?\" (Point to chrysalis.) — Success: Student says \"chrysalis\" or \"butterfly home.\"\n  2. \"What's inside?\" — Success: Student says \"butterfly\" or \"something growing\" or \"a caterpillar changing.\"\n  3. \"Why is it under this eave?\" — Success: Student mentions safety, protection, rain won't hurt it, or it's a safe place.\n  4. \"What does a butterfly need?\" — Success: Student names at least one: food, shelter, safe place, flowers.\n\n**Option B: Drawing & Labeling**\n- Provide a simple worksheet with three boxes labeled: Caterpillar / Chrysalis / Butterfly.\n- Ask students to draw each stage.\n- Success criteria: Student draws recognizable forms for all three stages, even if simple.\n- Ask: \"What does each one need?\" Record their verbal response.\n\n**Option C: Acting & Explaining**\n- Ask individual students to:\n  - \"Show me how a caterpillar moves.\" (Success: wiggles or crawls)\n  - \"Show me a chrysalis. Why doesn't it move?\" (Success: stays still, says it's sleeping/growing/changing)\n  - \"Show me a butterfly. Where's it going?\" (Success: flies, says to flowers)\n  - \"What did it need as a caterpillar?\" (Success: food/leaves)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student can identify a chrysalis and describe one thing it is (safe place, where butterfly grows, etc.).\n- Student can name at least two of the three life stages.\n- Student can state at least one thing a butterfly/caterpillar needs to survive.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify the chrysalis in the photo and explain it's a safe place.\n- 75% of students can name caterpillar and butterfly.\n- 80% of students can name at least one animal need (food, shelter, safety).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"caterpillar,\" \"chrysalis,\" \"butterfly,\" and \"safe place.\" Skip additional terms if needed; revisit later.\n\n2. **Pre-taught concepts:** Before the lesson, read a picture book like *Very Hungry Caterpillar* or *Butterfly Butterfly* to familiarize students with the concept.\n\n3. **Paired exploration:** During Explore, pair struggling students with strong observers so they can hear language and see models. The partner can describe what they notice while the struggling student points or handles materials.\n\n4. **Photograph magnification:** Provide an extra-large, high-contrast printed version of the chrysalis photograph so students can see fine details without straining.\n\n5. **Concrete realia:** If possible, bring in a real chrysalis (from a supplier or butterfly garden). The tactile and visual experience will cement understanding better than pictures alone.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended life cycle:** Introduce the FULL cycle: egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly → egg (if students are ready). Ask: \"What comes after the butterfly lays an egg? What happens next?\"\n\n2. **Compare and contrast:** Provide pictures of other insects (bee, ladybug, ant) and ask: \"Do all insects change like butterflies? Why or why not? Which ones do and don't?\" Discuss metamorphosis without using the term; focus on observable change.\n\n3. **Habitat research:** \"Butterflies need safe places AND they need the RIGHT KIND of place. What plants do butterflies like? Why? What would happen if there were no flowers?\" Guide research using picture cards or simple books.\n\n4. **Record a detailed life cycle:** Challenge advanced students to draw/label all stages in sequence, including a detail for each: caterpillar eating a leaf, chrysalis hanging, butterfly on a flower. Ask them to explain to a peer why each stage needs what it needs.\n\n5. **Seasonal thinking:** \"Butterflies come in certain seasons. When do butterflies come to OUR area? Why? Where do they go in winter?\" Use local nature calendars or simple web searches.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Butterfly Garden Observation** (Ongoing)\n   - If possible, set up a live butterfly garden kit in the classroom (Painted Lady or Monarch butterflies). Students observe real chrysalises daily and record changes with drawings and dates. This brings the lesson to life and teaches patience and observation over weeks.\n\n2. **Create a Chrysalis Craft to Take Home**\n   - Provide a toilet paper tube, green construction paper, and tape. Students wrap their tube in green paper and decorate with spots (like a real chrysalis). Include a note for families: \"My chrysalis is at home. Inside, a caterpillar is changing into a butterfly. It needs a quiet, safe place—just like in our classroom!\"\n\n3. **Butterfly Scavenger Hunt**\n   - On a warm day (spring/summer), take students outside to find real butterflies or evidence of caterpillars. Use a simple checklist with pictures: \"Did you see a butterfly? Where was it? What was it doing? Did you see any plants caterpillars like to eat?\" Bring findings back to class and discuss connections to the lesson.\n\n4. **Read-Aloud Pairing**\n   - Follow up with picture books like:\n     - *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* by Eric Carle (perfect reinforcement)\n     - *Butterfly Butterfly* by John Marsh (shows real chrysalises)\n     - *From Caterpillar to Butterfly* by Deborah Heiligman\n   - Pause during reading to connect to the lesson: \"Remember our photograph? This is what's happening inside!\"\n\n5. **Music & Movement: \"The Butterfly Dance\"**\n   - Teach students this simple rhyme with actions:\n     > *Little caterpillar, crawl, crawl, crawl,* (wiggle fingers down arm)\n     > *Eating all the leaves and all, all, all.* (pretend to munch)\n     > *Time to hide inside your shell,* (curl into a ball)\n     > *Rest right now and grow so well!* (stretch arms)\n     > *Now you're a butterfly so bright,* (flutter arms)\n     > *Flying through the day and night!* (spin and fly around room)\n   - Repeat weekly to reinforce the life cycle concept.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing flexibility:** Kindergarten lessons often need flex. If students are deeply engaged in the Explore phase, let them continue. You can split this lesson across two days: Engage + Explore on Day 1, Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2.\n- **Real chrysalises:** The photograph is powerful, but if you can access even photos of real chrysalises in multiple stages (forming, mature, emerging), students' understanding deepens significantly.\n- **Connection to seasons:** If you teach this in spring/early summer, take students outside to search for real caterpillars and chrysalises on plants. This makes the lesson unforgettable.\n- **Avoid misconceptions:** Some students may think the butterfly \"comes out\" of the chrysalis immediately and flies away. Explain that inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar's body completely reorganizes over weeks—it's not just getting bigger. Use simple language: \"It's like the caterpillar takes a long nap and wakes up as a totally different animal!\"\n- **Individual needs:** Some Kindergarteners may have anxiety about insects. Normalize this by saying: \"Butterflies are our friends. They don't sting. They're too busy drinking from flowers to bother us.\" Offer to let students observe from a distance if needed.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is scaffolded, visual, hands-on, and directly aligned to K-LS1-1. Students leave understanding that butterflies (and all living things) need specific things to survive—and they've seen real evidence of that in the chrysalis photograph.",
