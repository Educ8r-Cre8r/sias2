Identify fungi as living things that grow in damp environments near dead wood or leaves.\n2. Describe the body parts of fungi (cap, stem, gills) and explain that these parts help fungi survive.\n3. Explain that fungi help break down dead things in nature and return nutrients to the soil.\n4. Compare fungi to plants and animals by noting how fungi are different (no roots, no leaves, no movement).\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of fungi.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of pale mushrooms growing on a dark tree branch\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Picture cards of plants, animals, and decomposing leaves (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or printed large (8.5\" x 11\" minimum). Allow students to look silently for 10 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask students to turn and talk to a neighbor:** \"What do you see in this picture? Tell your partner one thing you notice.\"\n\n3. **Facilitate whole-group discussion using these guiding questions:**\n   - \"What color are these things growing on the tree? Why do you think they're that color?\" (Elicit: pale, not green like plants)\n   - \"Are these things alive? How do you know?\" (Listen for: they grow, they change, they get bigger)\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this growing near a tree or in your yard? Where?\" (Activate prior experiences)\n   - \"What do you think this thing eats, since it doesn't have green leaves like a plant?\" (Build curiosity about decomposition)\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what happens when leaves fall off trees and die. Where do they go? Do you think these pale things help?\" Write student predictions on chart paper.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become fungi detectives and explore how these living things help the forest!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how decomposition works through sensory exploration and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 5-6 small containers (yogurt cups or small boxes)\n- Dead leaves (collected from yard, or dried leaves from craft stores)\n- Damp soil or compost\n- Damp paper towels\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per pair of students)\n- Small wooden pieces or bark chips (optional)\n- Observation sheet (see below) with drawings to label\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Decomposition Investigation (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up decomposition stations** ahead of time with these layers (teacher does this in advance):\n   - Container 1: Dry leaves in dry soil (control)\n   - Container 2: Damp leaves in damp soil with bark pieces\n   - Containers 3-5: Variations (e.g., leaf with fungal growth already developing, leaves in various stages of decay)\n\n2. **Pair students** and assign each pair one container to observe.\n\n3. **Provide student directions** (read aloud and demonstrate):\n   - \"Use your magnifying glass to look closely at your container.\"\n   - \"Look at the leaves. Are they whole and green, or are they breaking apart?\"\n   - \"Do you see any pale or colored fuzzy things? Those might be fungi!\"\n   - \"Feel the leaves (gently). Are they wet or dry? Soft or crunchy?\"\n   - \"Draw what you see on your observation sheet. Color it to match what's really there.\"\n\n4. **Rotate stations** if time allows (3 minutes per pair), so all students see multiple containers.\n\n**Part B: Fungi Structure Observation (5 minutes)**\n\n5. **Distribute printed pictures or close-up diagrams** of the fungi from the photograph (mushroom cap, stem, gills visible underneath).\n\n6. **Direct students:** \"Look at these fungi pictures. Show your partner the cap (the umbrella part), the stem (the stick part), and the gills (the lines under the cap). These parts help fungi do their job!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice? What's different between the dry leaves and wet leaves? Where do you see the fuzzy fungi?\"\n- Avoid direct answers; guide with observations: \"What color is that? Is it growing? Where is it growing?\"\n- Model careful observation with magnifying glass at one station to set expectations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that damp environments have more visible decomposition and fungal growth.\n- Students identify cap, stem, and gills on fungi pictures.\n- Students complete observation sheets showing differences between containers.\n- Drawings reflect observations of leaves at different decay stages.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of fungi and decomposition.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Picture sequence cards showing: fresh leaves → partially decayed leaves → soil + nutrients\n- Simple diagram showing a fungus with labeled parts (cap, stem, gills)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Invite students to share observations** from Explore phase:\n   - \"What did you notice in the wet containers? The dry ones?\"\n   - \"Did you see the fuzzy fungi? What did it look like?\"\n   - Record student responses on chart paper titled \"What We Discovered About Fungi.\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with visual support** (point to photograph and diagrams):\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Fungi (FUN-jee):** A living thing that is not a plant or animal. It grows in damp places and helps break down dead things.\n   - **Decompose:** To break down or fall apart slowly. When something decomposes, it breaks into smaller pieces.\n   - **Cap:** The umbrella-shaped part at the top of a mushroom.\n   - **Stem:** The stick-like part that holds up the cap.\n   - **Gills:** The thin lines under the cap that help fungi make spores (tiny seeds) to grow new fungi.\n\n3. **Make connections explicitly:**\n   - Point to the photograph. \"These are fungi. They're living things. What do they need to live?\" (Guide: damp, dark place; dead wood)\n   - \"Fungi don't have green leaves like plants. They don't move like animals. Fungi are their own kind of living thing.\"\n   - \"What job do fungi do?\" (They break down dead wood and leaves. They turn them back into soil.)\n\n4. **Show the picture sequence** (fresh leaves → decaying leaves → soil):\n   - \"Fungi work hard to decompose dead leaves. This is their job in nature. Without fungi, dead leaves would pile up forever and plants couldn't grow!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your thumbs: Do fungi need to be damp or dry?\" (Thumbs up = damp, thumbs down = dry)\n   - \"Is a fungus a plant, an animal, or something different?\" (Hold up 3 fingers or answer with options given)\n   - \"What does decompose mean? Show me with your hands how something breaks apart slowly.\" (Hands coming apart)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify fungi and name its basic parts (cap, stem).\n- Students understand decomposition as breaking down dead things.\n- Students recognize fungi as living things that need damp conditions.\n- Students know fungi's role in nature (returning nutrients to soil).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by designing a fungi-friendly environment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small paper cups or containers (one per student or pair)\n- Potting soil or compost\n- Dead leaves, bark chips, twigs\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Optional: fungal spores or live cultures (contact science supply company in advance)\n- Design worksheet (simple picture-based format)\n- Crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Pose a real-world challenge:**\n   - \"We learned that fungi help turn dead leaves into soil. Gardens need good soil to grow plants. How can we help fungi do their job in a garden or compost pile?\"\n\n2. **Explain the design task (keep it simple for First Grade):**\n   - \"You're going to create the perfect home for fungi! What does it need? Let's remember... (damp, dark, dead leaves to eat)\"\n\n3. **Guide students in creating a \"fungi home\" using these steps:**\n   - Layer potting soil in cup.\n   - Add torn dead leaves, bark chips, and a twig.\n   - Lightly spray with water (show how to spray, not soak).\n   - Place in a dark location (shelf, closet, covered with paper).\n   - Draw a picture of their container and label: \"My Fungi Home.\"\n\n4. **Encourage observation over time:**\n   - \"In a few weeks, check on your fungi home. Do you see fuzzy fungi growing? Are the leaves breaking down?\"\n   - Send home observation sheets so families can help monitor.\n\n5. **Discussion questions to deepen thinking:**\n   - \"Why did you add water to your fungi home?\"\n   - \"Why is this a good place for fungi to grow?\"\n   - \"How will this help the garden or forest?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the construction, ensuring students understand *why* each step supports fungi growth.\n- Ask why questions: \"Why do you think fungi would like this dark place?\"\n- Encourage predictions: \"What do you think will happen in two weeks?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design and create a functional decomposition environment.\n- Students explain (verbally or in drawing) why they made certain choices.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that fungi need specific conditions (damp, dark, dead material).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fungi, decomposition, and adaptation.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore phase:\n  - ✓ Student uses magnifying glass to observe carefully\n  - ✓ Student identifies changes in leaves (damp vs. dry)\n  - ✓ Student describes what fungi looks like or feels like\n  \n- **Think-Pair-Share** during Explain phase:\n  - Ask: \"Why do you think fungi grow on wet, dead wood instead of dry leaves?\"\n  - Listen for: mentions of moisture, softness, food, or darkness\n  \n- **Thumbs check** during Explain phase (formative):\n  - Do fungi need to be wet or dry?\n  - Is a fungus like a plant or different?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of Lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit slip (can be verbal for non-readers):\n\n**\"Fungi Facts\" Exit Ticket:**\n1. **Draw or tell:** What does a fungus look like? (Label: cap, stem, gills)\n2. **Circle the correct answer (or point):** Fungi like to grow in **(wet/dry)** places.\n3. **Draw or explain:** What job do fungi do? (Break down dead leaves and turn them into soil / help plants grow)\n4. **Think of one more question:** If you left wet leaves in a pile, would fungi grow on them? Why?\n\n**Success Criteria for Mastery:**\n- ✓ Student can identify fungi and describe at least 2 body parts (cap, stem, gills)\n- ✓ Student understands fungi need damp conditions\n- ✓ Student can explain that fungi break down (decompose) dead things\n- ✓ Student recognizes fungi as living things different from plants and animals\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students correctly identify what fungi need (damp environment) and what job they do (decompose).\n- Students show confidence in observing and describing fungi using vocabulary from the lesson.\n- Students demonstrate understanding through drawings, verbal explanations, or hands-on design.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:**\n   - Teach only 3 key terms: fungi, decompose, and cap.\n   - Use the same terms repeatedly and pair with images.\n   - Allow students to point to parts instead of naming them.\n\n2. **Provide sentence starters during discussion:**\n   - \"Fungi like to grow in __________ (wet/dark) places.\"\n   - \"Fungi help by __________ (breaking down) dead leaves.\"\n   - Give 2 choices and have student point or circle.\n\n3. **Pair with a strong reader/observer:**\n   - During Explore, pair with a more advanced student for shared observation.\n   - Advanced student can help record while both observe.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper investigation of variables:**\n   - \"If fungi like wet and dark, what happens if we add MORE water? Or keep it very dry? Let's test!\"\n   - Have advanced students design and predict outcomes of modified decomposition containers.\n\n2. **Research and comparison:**\n   - \"Are there other decomposers besides fungi? Let's find pictures of bacteria or insects that help break down dead things.\"\n   - Introduce idea of food chains and roles different organisms play.\n\n3. **Real-world problem-solving:**\n   - \"Compost piles help gardens. Can fungi help a compost pile work better? What would you add?\"\n   - Challenge them to create a 3-step plan for starting a school compost system.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fungi Field Journal Over Time (2-3 weeks)**\n   - Have students check their fungi home weekly and draw/write observations.\n   - Track: moisture level, color changes, fuzzy growth, leaf breakdown.\n   - Compare actual results to predictions made in Elaborate phase.\n   - Create a class display: \"How Fungi Changed Our Dead Leaves.\"\n\n2. **Decomposer Hunt Nature Walk**\n   - Take students outside to find evidence of decomposition (rotting logs, mushrooms, moldy leaves).\n   - Have students photograph or draw what they find and bring back to class.\n   - Sort findings: \"Where did fungi grow? What was it growing on? Was it wet?\"\n   - Create a \"Decomposer Map\" of the school grounds showing where fungi and decomposing material were found.\n\n3. **Compost Class Project (Cross-curricular: Science + Stewardship)**\n   - Start a small vermicompost bin or outdoor compost pile in the classroom or yard.\n   - Each week, students add food scraps (apple cores, leaves) and observe fungi growth.\n   - Track: temperature, moisture, decomposition speed, fungi appearance.\n   - Harvest finished compost to use in a classroom plant or garden.\n   - Connect to environmental stewardship: \"We're helping nature recycle!\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Photograph alignment:** The provided image shows fungi in a naturally moist environment on dead wood—perfect for illustrating the exact conditions First Graders need to understand.\n- **Safety reminder:** Ensure students do not taste or eat any fungi or decomposing material. Wash hands thoroughly after exploration activities.\n- **Timing:** The Elaborate phase (building fungi homes) can extend across 2-3 weeks as observations continue. Plan follow-up observations during science time.\n- **Family engagement:** Send home the design worksheet and observation sheet so families can monitor fungi growth and discuss decomposition at home.\n- **Real fungi cultures:** If possible, order mushroom growing kits (often available online for $15-30) to show students actual fungal fruiting bodies developing in real-time—highly motivating!",
