Explain how a decaying log (nurse log) provides food, shelter, and growing space for living organisms.\n2. Identify at least three organisms (plants, animals, or decomposers) that live in or depend on a decaying log and describe how their body structures help them survive there.\n3. Construct an argument that the structures of decomposers and organisms help them break down dead wood and recycle nutrients into soil.\n4. Model the relationship between a decaying log and the organisms that depend on it, showing how they meet their needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the photograph and activate prior knowledge about decomposition and interconnected life.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (nurse_log.jpg) printed large or displayed on a screen\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: hand lens for students to examine details\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without explanation. Allow students 1–2 minutes of silent observation. Encourage them to look closely at the textures, colors, holes, and what might be growing on or in the log.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions** to spark curiosity (display on the board or read aloud):\n   - \"What do you notice about this log? What happened to it?\"\n   - \"This log looks like it's falling apart. Is it dead? Is it useless?\"\n   - \"What do you think lives inside or on this log?\"\n   - \"Could a dead log actually be important to a forest? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Record predictions** on chart paper with the heading \"What Lives in a Decaying Log?\" Have students turn and talk to a partner, then share out. Write 5–7 student predictions (bugs, fungi, new plants, worms, etc.) without judgment.\n\n4. **Introduce the term \"nurse log\"** simply: \"Scientists call a fallen log like this a 'nurse log' because it actually nurses—or helps—new life grow. Today, we're going to discover how!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore what's really happening inside and on this log by building our own small version and observing what wants to live there.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate organisms and their structures by creating and observing a decaying log habitat model.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3–4 students):**\n- Clear plastic container or terrarium (quart-size or larger)\n- Small pieces of bark or actual decaying wood (if safe and available) OR pre-softened wood (soak cardboard tubes or untreated wood chunks in water for 24 hours)\n- Soil (2 cups)\n- Leaves, grass, or organic debris\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Hand lens or magnifying glass\n- Small organisms to introduce (optional but effective):\n  - Isopods (pill bugs/roly-polies)—2–3 per container\n  - Earthworms—1–2 per container\n  - Mealworms—optional\n  - Mushroom spores or fungi (optional; they often colonize naturally)\n- Food coloring (optional, for tracking decomposition)\n- Observation sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Build the model** (10 minutes):\n   - Have each group layer their container: soil on bottom (1.5 inches), decaying wood pieces in the middle, more soil, leaves/debris on top.\n   - Lightly spray with water until moist (not soggy).\n   - Introduce 2–3 pill bugs and 1–2 earthworms. Explain: \"These are decomposers and detritivores—organisms that eat dead stuff and break it down.\"\n   - Seal the container loosely (lid on but not airtight) to allow airflow.\n\n2. **Observe and record** (10 minutes over next session):\n   - Use the hand lens to examine the initial setup. Ask: \"Can you see the organisms? What body parts help them move and eat?\"\n   - Introduce the **Observation Sheet** (provided below). Students sketch and label:\n     - Where organisms are positioned\n     - What they see happening to the wood (changes in color, texture)\n     - Any signs of fungi (white threads, spots) or new growth\n   - Check daily (or every other day) over the next 1–2 weeks. Record changes.\n\n**Observation Sheet Template:**\n```\nName: ________________     Date: ________________\n\n**What I see in my nurse log model:**\n\nSketch of the container:\n[Space for drawing]\n\nOrganisms I can see: _________________________________\n\nChanges I notice in the wood: _______________________\n\nChanges I notice in the soil: ________________________\n\nQuestions I have: ___________________________________\n```\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to groups and ask guiding questions: \"Why do you think the earthworm burrowed deeper? What might it be doing to the wood?\"\n- Prompt observations of structures: \"Look at the pill bug's legs. How do they help it move through the soil and wood?\"\n- Avoid giving answers; redirect to observation: \"What do you notice happening where the organisms have been?\"\n- Ensure containers stay moist but not waterlogged; demonstrate proper misting.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe pill bugs and earthworms moving through and eating decaying material.\n- They note changes in wood texture and soil color over time.\n- They begin to understand that organisms are actively breaking down the dead wood.\n- They record observations that will connect to the explanation phase.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and ecological concepts connecting organisms, structures, and decomposition.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n- Vocabulary cards (optional; printed or handwritten)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations** (6 minutes):\n   - Ask 2–3 groups to share one observation from their models. Ask: \"What did you see? What surprised you?\"\n   - Record observations on a class chart titled \"How Organisms Change a Dead Log.\"\n\n2. **Introduce and define key vocabulary** (8 minutes):\n   - Display each term on the board and provide student-friendly definitions. Use the photograph and student observations as examples.\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph** (3 minutes):\n   - Point to the holes, cavities, and discolored areas in the photograph. Explain: \"This is what happens over months and years. Animals make tunnels. Fungi break down the wood fibers. Insects lay eggs. The log slowly becomes soil.\"\n   - Show how the exterior looks different from the interior—weathered on outside, crumbly/broken down on inside—and explain that decomposers work from the inside out.\n\n4. **Check for understanding**:\n   - Ask: \"Why is a decaying log called a nurse log?\" (It nurses new life by providing food and homes.)\n   - Ask: \"What body parts help earthworms break down wood?\" (Mouthparts, muscular body for burrowing.)\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if there were no decomposers?\" (Dead logs would pile up, nutrients wouldn't return to soil, new plants couldn't grow.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Decomposition** | The natural process of dead things breaking down into smaller pieces and returning to the soil. |\n| **Decomposer** | An organism (like bacteria, fungi, or certain insects) that breaks down dead plants and animals. |\n| **Detritivore** | An animal (like earthworms, pill bugs, millipedes) that eats dead material and helps break it down. |\n| **Nutrient** | Food and minerals that living things need to grow and stay healthy; decomposers release nutrients back into soil. |\n| **Habitat** | A place where an organism lives and finds food, water, and shelter. A decaying log is a habitat! |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that decomposition is an active process carried out by living organisms.\n- They can name at least two organisms that live in decaying logs and describe one body structure each organism uses to break down dead wood or find food.\n- They grasp that decomposition returns nutrients to soil, supporting new plant growth.\n- They make connections between the photograph and the vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new context and deepen their knowledge of how organisms' structures allow them to survive in decaying wood.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photographs of decomposers/detritivores (fungi, millipedes, beetles, earthworms, snails—printable or from nature books)\n- \"Organism Survival Cards\" (see activity below)\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Optional: short video clip (2–3 min) of decomposition time-lapse or organisms in logs (available on YouTube or National Geographic Kids)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the \"Organism Survival Challenge\"** (3 minutes):\n   - Explain: \"Scientists studying decomposition noticed that different organisms have different body structures that help them survive in and break down logs. Let's be detective scientists and figure out which structure helps each organism do its job.\"\n\n2. **Partner investigation** (12 minutes):\n   - Give each pair one \"Organism Survival Card\" with a picture and basic information. Examples:\n     - **Earthworm:** soft, muscular body; no hard skeleton; segments that move.\n     - **Beetle Larva:** strong jaws; hard exterior; six legs.\n     - **Fungus:** thread-like structures that spread through wood; no mouth—absorbs nutrients.\n     - **Millipede:** many legs; hard body segments; strong mandibles.\n   \n   - Ask each pair to discuss and answer (on the card or a separate sheet):\n     - \"How does this organism's body structure help it live in a decaying log?\"\n     - \"What does it eat or break down?\"\n     - \"How does it help create a nurse log for new plants?\"\n\n3. **Gallery walk and class discussion** (3 minutes):\n   - Post cards around the room. Have students do a quick walk to see all organisms.\n   - Facilitate a brief whole-group share: \"Which organism do you think is the strongest decomposer? Why?\"\n\n4. **Extension prompt**:\n   - Ask: \"What would happen if we only had fungi in a log and no insects? What if we only had earthworms and no fungi? Could the log still become soil?\" Guide students to understand that different organisms have different structures and play different roles—we need them all.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why does a fungus spread like threads instead of moving like an earthworm?\"\n- Encourage students to connect structures to function: \"What can that beetle's jaws do that an earthworm's mouth cannot?\"\n- Validate observations and reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students explain how at least two organisms' body structures help them decompose wood or survive in a decaying log.\n- They understand that different structures = different jobs, and ecosystems need diversity.\n- They can argue that the internal (mouthparts, digestive systems) and external (legs, jaws, body segments) structures of organisms determine their role in decomposition.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student mastery of learning objectives through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation of groups during Explore: Are students noting changes? Asking questions?\n- Vocabulary check during Explain: Can students use terms correctly?\n- Listen to partner discussions during Elaborate: Are they connecting structures to function?\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (distribute at end of Elaborate or Session 2):**\n\nPrint and distribute this exit ticket. Students complete independently (5–8 minutes).\n\n---\n\n**NURSE LOG EXIT TICKET**\n\n**Name: ________________________     Date: ____________**\n\n**1. Look at this picture of a decaying log. Circle THREE things you think are happening inside or on the log.**\n- [ ] Plants are dying\n- [ ] Organisms are breaking it down\n- [ ] Nutrients are returning to soil\n- [ ] New seeds are growing\n- [ ] Bugs are hiding\n\n**2. Which organism's body structure helps it break down a decaying log? Draw and label.**\n\n*[Space for drawing]*\n\n**3. Why is a decaying log called a \"nurse log\"? Use a complete sentence.**\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n**4. Imagine all the decomposers disappeared from a forest. What would happen to fallen logs?**\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- **Proficient:** Student correctly identifies 2+ processes; names an organism with accurate structure; explains \"nurse log\" concept (provides food/shelter/nutrients); predicts logical consequence of no decomposers.\n- **Approaching:** Student identifies 1 process; names an organism but structure description is vague; explains \"nurse log\" with support; prediction is partially correct.\n- **Below Standard:** Student struggles to identify processes; cannot name an organism or describe structures; concept of \"nurse log\" unclear; no prediction or illogical prediction.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding that:\n- Decaying logs are active habitats where organisms with specific structures break down dead wood.\n- These organisms' internal and external structures enable them to survive in and decompose decaying logs.\n- Decomposition recycles nutrients, supporting new life—the role of a \"nurse log.\"\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support for Struggling Learners:**\n\n1. **Scaffold vocabulary:** Pair students with a vocabulary reference sheet (pictures + definitions) during activities. Use real-life comparisons: \"An earthworm's body is like a flexible hose—it can squeeze through tight spaces.\"\n\n2. **Simplified observation sheet:** Provide a sheet with picture prompts and sentence starters:\n   - \"I see ________________ (organism).\"\n   - \"It is ________________ (color, texture).\"\n   - \"I think it helps the log by _________________.\"\n\n3. **Partner with strong peer:** Pair struggling student with a peer for model-building and observation. Assign clear roles: one draws, one writes; one observes organisms, one records time.\n\n**Challenge for Advanced Learners:**\n\n1. **Research extension:** Provide access to books or websites to research specific decomposers (fungi types, beetle larvae, springtails, isopods). Have students create a detailed \"Decomposer Field Guide\" with drawings, lifecycle info, and habitat requirements.\n\n2. **Prediction and hypothesis:** Challenge students to predict which organisms will break down different wood types fastest. Have them design a modified experiment comparing rotting rates of softwood vs. hardwood logs in their models.\n\n3. **Ecosystem modeling:** Ask: \"What would a nurse log look like after 5 years? 10 years?\" Have them create a visual timeline showing stages of decomposition and illustrate how the log transforms into soil and supports new plant growth.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Forest Floor Investigation Field Trip:**\n   - If possible, take students outdoors to find fallen logs in a wooded area or park.\n   - Have them use hand lenses to observe decomposers and structures (fungi, insects, holes, textures).\n   - Collect (non-invasively) photos or sketches of different organisms they find.\n   - Compare real-world observations to classroom models.\n\n2. **Nutrient Cycle Diagram and Animation:**\n   - Students create a labeled diagram showing how a \"dead tree → decaying log → decomposers → nutrients in soil → new plant growth.\"\n   - Advanced option: use digital tools (Google Slides, drawing apps) to create an animated sequence showing decomposition over time.\n\n3. **Decomposer Adaptation Matching Game:**\n   - Create a set of cards with organism pictures and a separate set with adaptations/structures (strong jaws, thread-like body, burrowing legs, flexible body).\n   - Students match organisms to adaptations and explain why each structure is useful in a decaying log.\n   - Can be played as a memory game or a timed challenge.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\n- Sources for organisms: local outdoor areas, biology supply companies, or pet stores (pill bugs, earthworms, mealworms are low-cost and easy to maintain).\n- Keep models in a cool, dark area (under a desk) to minimize mold overgrowth while still allowing decomposition to occur.\n- Maintain moisture but avoid waterlogging; models will smell earthy (not foul) if managed correctly.\n- This lesson naturally connects to 5-LS2-1 (matter cycles) if you extend into upper elementary; it's a strong springboard for food webs and energy flow in Grade 5.",
