ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the katydid in grass.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed or projected image of the katydid in grass\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: katydid illustration chart (showing the insect circled or highlighted)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph:** Project or hold up the image so all students can see. Do NOT point out or circle the katydid yet.\n\n2. **Challenge students to find the hidden animal:** Say: \"I have a special photo of an animal hiding in the grass. Can you find it? Look carefully. The animal is right there in the picture, but it's hard to see. Take 30 seconds and point to where you think it is.\"\n\n3. **Discussion questions (calibrated for 1st grade):**\n   - \"Did you find the animal? What color is the grass?\"\n   - \"What color is the animal? Why do you think its color might help it?\"\n   - \"Have you ever played hide-and-seek? How do you hide where nobody can find you? Why is that?\"\n   - \"If this animal is green like the grass, what might happen if a bird or other animal tries to find it for lunch?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** Say: \"Today we're going to learn about a special trick this animal uses to stay safe. We're going to discover why being green helps animals that live in grass survive.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore this amazing animal more closely and see what special body parts help it hide and survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate camouflage and animal adaptations through hands-on observation and a hiding activity.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Printed image of the katydid (smaller version, 5\"x7\")\n- Colored pencils or crayons (green, yellow, brown, tan, black)\n- Plain white paper\n- Scissors\n- Glue stick\n- Pre-cut grass pieces from green construction paper (various shades: light green, dark green, yellow-green) OR natural dried grass collected by teacher\n- Student observation sheet (simple picture-based chart with boxes to check or circles to color)\n- Hand lens or magnifying glass (optional, for advanced observation)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Part A: Detailed Observation (8 minutes)**\n   - Distribute the printed katydid image and observation sheet to each student or pair.\n   - Guide students: \"Look carefully at the katydid using your eyes. You can use the magnifying glass if you want to see tiny details.\"\n   - Call out for students to observe and point to or color on their sheet:\n     - \"What color is the katydid's body?\"\n     - \"Can you see its legs? How many legs do you see?\"\n     - \"Does it have wings? What do they look like?\"\n     - \"Does the katydid look like the grass around it?\"\n   - Students mark or color observations on their sheet.\n   - Teacher circulates, asking: \"Why do you think the katydid is green? What color is the grass?\"\n\n2. **Part B: The Camouflage Creation Challenge (14 minutes)**\n   - Give each student/pair a sheet of white paper and pre-cut grass materials (construction paper pieces or real grass).\n   - Say: \"Now YOU are going to hide an animal in grass, just like the katydid hides. Here's your challenge: Create a picture of grass on your paper using your green and yellow-green pieces. Arrange them however you want—tall grass, short grass, mixed together!\"\n   - Students glue grass pieces to create a grassland scene (5-7 minutes).\n   - Then distribute colored pencils: \"Now draw or color an animal that lives in grass. Make it colors that match the grass so it's hard to see! You can draw a bug, a mouse, a grasshopper, anything that lives in grass. Use green, yellow, and brown so it blends in!\"\n   - Students create their camouflaged animal (7-8 minutes).\n\n3. **Documentation:**\n   - Students write or dictate: \"My animal is _____ (color). It is hard to see because _____.\" (Teacher records or students draw pictures.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate throughout, asking guiding questions: \"Why did you choose that color?\" \"Will your animal be easy or hard to see?\" \"What color grass matches your animal?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the \"right\" answer—let them experiment and discover.\n- Encourage risk-taking: \"You can try different colors. What happens if you use a color that's very different from the grass?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a camouflaged animal in a grass environment.\n- Students verbally or through drawings show understanding that color helps animals hide.\n- Students observe and identify body parts of the katydid.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of camouflage and animal survival using observations from the Explore phase.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed katydid image (poster-sized for demonstration)\n- Real or life-like model of a katydid (optional)\n- Chart paper for anchor chart\n- Markers\n- Student camouflage pictures from Explore phase\n- Picture cards of other camouflaged animals (optional: stick insect, praying mantis, frog, butterfly)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gallery Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Display 3-4 student camouflage pictures (with permission).\n   - Ask: \"Why is this animal hard to see? What color did they use? Why did they pick that color?\"\n   - Students explain their choices.\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Explanation (8 minutes):**\n   - Point to the large katydid image: \"This animal is called a katydid. Let's look at it closely together.\"\n   - Circle or point to key features: body, legs, wings, antennae.\n   - Say: \"The katydid is green. The grass is green. When the katydid sits very still in the grass, it's hard to see. Can you see it now?\" (Allow students to locate it again.)\n   - Introduce the key concept: \"When an animal blends in with where it lives, it's using a special trick called **camouflage**. Camouflage helps animals hide from animals that might eat them. It keeps them safe.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think hiding helps the katydid survive? What might happen if the katydid was purple?\" (Allow discussion—predators could see it easier, so it wouldn't be safe.)\n\n3. **Anchor Chart Creation (5 minutes):**\n   - Create a simple chart with two columns or sections:\n     - **Left side:** Picture/photo of katydid in grass\n     - **Right side:** Labeled body parts and the word \"CAMOUFLAGE\"\n   - Write simple sentence: \"The katydid is green. It hides in green grass. This keeps it safe.\"\n   - Optionally, show 1-2 other camouflaged animals (stick insect, frog) and note the colors match their environments.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or pattern helps it blend in with its environment so it's hard to see. (Kid-friendly: \"A hiding trick using colors.\")\n- **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive. (Kid-friendly: \"A special feature that helps an animal live.\")\n- **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals. (Kid-friendly: \"An animal that eats other animals.\")\n- **Survive:** To stay alive and be healthy. (Kid-friendly: \"To live and stay safe.\")\n- **External body parts:** The parts of an animal you can see on the outside, like legs, wings, and antennae. (Kid-friendly: \"The outside parts of an animal's body.\")\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Ask: \"If you were a bird looking for lunch, would you see the green katydid in the green grass? Why or why not?\"\n- Ask: \"Why is camouflage helpful for the katydid?\"\n- Ask: \"What external parts do you see on the katydid?\" (Point and have students repeat: legs, wings, body, antennae.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that camouflage is a way animals hide using colors that match their environment.\n- Students can name and point to external body parts of the katydid.\n- Students connect camouflage to survival (staying safe from predators).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply camouflage concepts to solve a real-world problem and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Variety of small colored paper squares or foam pieces (green, brown, tan, yellow, orange, purple, blue, red, white, black)\n- White paper or colored poster board (variety of colors: grass green, white, brown, blue)\n- Glue sticks\n- Scissors\n- Small paper insects or animal cutouts (pre-made or student-drawn from earlier activity)\n- Chart showing different habitats (grassland, forest, desert, ocean, snow)\n- Camera or student drawings to document\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-World Problem Introduction (2 minutes):**\n   - Say: \"We have a problem! Zookeepers at an animal refuge are helping animals survive in their natural habitats. But some animals are hard to protect because hunters can see them. How can we help the animals hide better?\"\n\n2. **Habitat Camouflage Design Challenge (14 minutes):**\n   - Divide class into 3-4 small groups or pairs.\n   - Assign or let students choose a habitat from the chart: grassland, forest, desert, or snow.\n   - Give each group:\n     - Poster board or paper in a color that represents their habitat\n     - Small paper animal cutouts or allow them to draw/color one\n     - Colored paper squares\n   - Task: \"Design a habitat for your animal. Arrange the colored squares to create camouflage that matches the habitat. Then place your animal on the habitat. The animal should be hard to see. If you can hide it well, a hunter won't find it!\"\n   - Groups work together to create, arrange, and glue pieces.\n   - Circulate and prompt: \"Does that color match your habitat?\" \"Will your animal be safe?\" \"What colors do you see in a real desert/forest/grassland?\"\n\n3. **Gallery Walk and Reflection (2 minutes):**\n   - Display finished habitats.\n   - Ask: \"Whose camouflage is hardest to see? Why? What colors did they use?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group work; encourage collaboration and problem-solving.\n- Ask questions, not provide answers: \"What colors are in a desert?\" \"How can you hide your animal better?\"\n- Photograph or collect work for assessment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a camouflaged animal in a realistic habitat, showing deeper understanding of how adaptation matches environment.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that camouflage is specific to habitat and uses colors found in nature.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of camouflage, animal body parts, and adaptation for survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessments (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Did students recognize the connection between color and hiding?\n- Observation during Explain: Can students identify body parts and explain camouflage in simple terms?\n- Observation during Elaborate: Do students intentionally match colors to habitats?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes, end of Day 2 or final session):**\n\nAdminister one of the following:\n\n**Option A: Verbal Exit Interview (for English learners or students needing support)**\nShow the katydid photo again and ask:\n1. \"Can you point to the katydid? Where is it hiding?\"\n2. \"Why is the katydid green?\"\n3. \"What body parts can you see?\" (Point and name at least 2.)\n4. \"How does being green help the katydid stay safe?\"\n\n**Option B: Picture-Based Exit Ticket**\nProvide a simple worksheet with:\n- Picture of katydid in grass\n- Blank sentence: \"The katydid is _____ (color). It hides in the _____ (color) grass. This helps it _____.\"\n- Box to draw another animal that camouflages in grass\n\n**Option C: One-Question Drawing**\n\"Draw a picture of an animal hiding in its habitat. Show how the animal's color helps it hide. You can write or tell me about it.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- **Developing:** Student can identify the katydid in the photo and say it is green.\n- **Proficient:** Student can explain that the katydid is green to hide in grass, and can name at least 2 body parts (legs, wings, etc.). Student creates a camouflaged animal that matches an environment.\n- **Advanced:** Student explains that camouflage keeps animals safe from predators, can name multiple body parts, and discusses how different animals camouflage in different habitats.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents demonstrate understanding by:\n- Locating the katydid in the photograph\n- Explaining camouflage in simple terms (\"It hides because it's the same color as the grass\")\n- Identifying at least 2 external body parts\n- Creating or recognizing camouflaged animals\n- Using color vocabulary (green, grass, hide, safe)\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners or English learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Language & Visuals:** Use single-word responses and picture cards instead of sentences. Create a visual anchor chart with labeled images of the katydid's body parts that stays displayed throughout the lesson. Use repetitive sentence frames: \"The katydid is _____. It hides in _____.\"\n\n2. **Guided Observation:** During Explore, pair the student with a peer buddy or provide a pre-made observation sheet with pictures and checkboxes only (no writing required). Use a hand lens to make observation concrete and engaging. Reduce the number of color choices during camouflage creation to 2-3 realistic colors (green, brown, yellow).\n\n3. **One-on-One Check-Ins:** During Elaborate, sit with the student to ask guiding questions and model color matching: \"This grass is dark green. What color should your animal be to hide?\" Record their verbal responses for exit ticket.\n\n---\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-Habitat Comparison:** Ask students to design camouflage for the same animal in two different habitats (e.g., a rabbit in grass vs. a rabbit in snow). Have them explain why the camouflage must change. Introduce the term \"adaptation\" and discuss why animals in cold places have white or thick fur, etc.\n\n2. **Predator-Prey Simulation:** Conduct a simple game where students hide paper insects (colored differently) in a habitat, and other students try to find them. Count how many each color hiding. Graph results and discuss: \"Which colors were found most/least? Why?\" This connects to natural selection informally.\n\n3. **Research & Present:** Have advanced students look at pictures of other camouflaged animals (stick insects, leaf-tailed geckos, snowshoe hares) and create a poster showing 2-3 animals and explaining how each one camouflages. Have them present to the class.\n\n4. **Extension Vocabulary:** Introduce related terms like \"mimicry\" (looking like something else, like a moth that looks like tree bark) and have students sort pictures of animals by camouflage type.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Camouflage Hunt\" in the School Garden or Outdoor Area:**\n   Take students outside to search for real camouflaged insects or animals (katydids, grasshoppers, spiders, etc.). Create a simple chart on clipboard to record what they find and what color/texture it matched. Sketch or photograph discoveries. Bring findings back to class and discuss: \"How did we find it even though it was hidden?\" This connects lesson to real-world observation.\n\n2. **Predator-Prey Game (Extending 1-LS1-1):**\n   Scatter colored foam pieces or beads (representing insects) on a grassy area or fabric with various colors. Students (acting as predators) try to collect as many \"insects\" as possible in 30 seconds. Afterward, count by color and graph results on a bar chart. Discuss: \"Were more red or green insects found? Why?\" This demonstrates how camouflage affects survival. Variation: Have some insects match the background and some not—predators catch fewer camouflaged ones.\n\n3. **Family Activity: \"Camouflage Scavenger Hunt\" (Home Connection):**\n   Send home a simple instruction sheet asking families to find 3 things around their home or yard that blend in with their surroundings (a green frog on a leaf, a brown pencil on a wooden desk, etc.). Ask students to take a photo or draw a picture and bring it back to share. Create a classroom gallery of family discoveries with labels: \"This grasshopper is green like the leaf. It uses camouflage to hide!\"\n\n4. **Read-Aloud Connection (Extending 1-LS1-2):**\n   Read age-appropriate books about camouflage or animal survival, such as \"The Mixed-Up Chameleon\" by Eric Carle or \"Hiding Places\" by T. S. Rice. Discuss how animals learn to use their body parts to survive, connecting to parental behaviors and offspring survival.\n\n5. **Sensory Matching Activity:**\n   Provide students with fabric swatches of different textures and colors (fuzzy brown felt, smooth green satin, rough green burlap). Have students match them to habitat pictures and discuss: \"Does this look and feel like real grass/bark/snow? How would the katydid feel on this?\" This builds tactile awareness of how adaptations work in real environments.",
