Exploring Plants in a Garden Habitat**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or 90 minutes across two days)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 3-LS4-3: Construct an argument with evidence that in a particular habitat some organisms can survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all.\n  - 3-LS3-2: Use evidence to support the explanation that traits can be influenced by the environment.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Identify different plants living in a garden habitat and describe their characteristics (color, height, leaf shape, flower type).\n2. Explain how environmental conditions (sunlight, soil, water) influence which plants survive in different parts of a garden.\n3. Construct an argument using evidence that some plants are better suited to specific spots in a habitat than others.\n4. Observe and record variations in plant traits and predict how traits help plants survive in their environment.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed color copy of the backyard garden photograph (large enough for all students to see clearly)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: garden photographs from different seasons or locations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Say: \"This is someone's backyard garden. I want you to look carefully at everything you can see growing here.\"\n\n2. **Allow 1–2 minutes of silent observation**, then ask these discussion questions one at a time, giving students time to turn and talk to a partner before sharing out:\n   - \"How many different types of plants can you spot in this garden? What makes them different from each other?\" (Students should notice different flower colors, heights, leaf shapes, and types.)\n   - \"If you were a plant, where in this garden would you want to grow? Why?\" (This activates thinking about environmental conditions.)\n   - \"Do you think all of these plants need the same amount of sunlight and water to be healthy? Why or why not?\" (Builds understanding that plants have different needs.)\n   - \"What do you think would happen if someone planted a plant that likes shade right in the middle of the sunny area with all the yellow and white flowers?\" (Promotes prediction and reasoning.)\n\n3. **Record student observations and predictions** on chart paper under the heading \"What We Notice\" and \"Our Predictions.\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder which plants in this garden are the happiest here, and which ones might struggle to grow. Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now you're going to explore some real plants to see how different they are and figure out where they like to live in a garden.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3–4 students):**\n- 4–5 potted plants or plant cuttings representing different types (e.g., succulent, shade-loving houseplant like pothos, sun-loving flower like marigold, ornamental grass, and a broad-leaved plant like coleus) — use classroom plants, borrowed plants from office/nurse's room, or inexpensive plants from a garden center\n- Hand lenses (magnifying glasses)\n- Observation recording sheets (template provided below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Access to a sunny window and a shady corner of the classroom\n- Optional: grow lights or lamp to represent different light conditions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide students into small investigation groups** (3–4 per group).\n\n2. **Give each group 2–3 plants** to observe. Say: \"Your job is to be plant detectives. You're going to examine these plants carefully and figure out what makes each one different.\"\n\n3. **Student investigation steps:**\n   - Observe each plant using hand lenses and record descriptions on the observation sheet:\n     - Leaf shape and size (round, pointy, big, small, thick, thin)\n     - Leaf color (dark green, light green, purple-tinged, variegated)\n     - Height and overall plant shape\n     - Presence of flowers, buds, or special features\n     - Texture of leaves (fuzzy, smooth, waxy)\n   - Draw a simple picture of each plant\n   - Make a prediction: \"Where in the backyard garden photo would this plant survive best—in a sunny spot, a shady spot, or both?\"\n   - Explain their prediction: \"Why do you think this plant would do well there?\"\n\n4. **Teacher role:**\n   - Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the leaves on this plant compared to that one?\" \"Why might a plant with thick, waxy leaves not need as much water?\" \"If a plant has small leaves, do you think it might need more or less sunlight?\"\n   - Point out features without naming them directly: \"Look at how thin these leaves are. How might that help the plant?\" (This guides them toward discovering concepts of adaptation.)\n   - Encourage students to touch and examine (safely) and to use descriptive language.\n\n5. **What students record:**\n   - Sketches and written descriptions of plant traits\n   - Predictions about where each plant would survive best\n   - Simple explanations of their reasoning\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should discover that plants have diverse, measurable traits (leaf size, shape, color, texture; height; flower presence).\n- Students should begin to make connections between specific traits and environmental conditions (e.g., thick leaves on succulents might mean they like dry conditions; shade-loving plants have thinner leaves).\n- Students should recognize variation among similar organisms (plants are different from each other).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Photograph from Engage (displayed again)\n- Optional: close-up images of garden plants showing different traits\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2–3 groups to share one interesting observation from their plant investigation.\n   - Record key words and observations on chart paper.\n   - Ask follow-up: \"Did you notice that one group's plant had different leaves than another group's plant?\"\n\n2. **Mini-lesson (8–10 minutes):** Use student observations to introduce concepts:\n   - \"You're all plant detectives, and you discovered something important: plants that look different from each other have different **traits**. Traits are things about a plant—like the shape of its leaves, its color, or how tall it grows.\"\n   - Point to the photograph: \"In this garden, we see plants with yellow flowers, purple flowers, white flowers, and some with no flowers at all. These are all different **traits**.\"\n   - \"Now here's the interesting part: Plants have different traits because they survive best in different environments. The **environment** is everything around a plant—the sun, the soil, the water, and the space.\"\n   - Point to sunny vs. shady areas in the photo: \"Some plants in this garden have lots of sunlight. See how bright and yellow those flowers are? Other plants are in the shade near the fence. They look different because they need less sunlight to be healthy.\"\n   - \"When a plant has traits that help it survive in its **habitat**—that's the place where it lives—the plant does really well. But if you put a plant somewhere that doesn't match its traits, it might struggle.\"\n\n3. **Connect back to exploration:**\n   - Hold up or reference the succulent from the Explore activity: \"This plant has thick, waxy leaves. This trait helps it survive in dry, sunny places with less water. Where in the garden photo would this plant be happiest?\" (Students should point to sunny areas.)\n   - Show a shade-loving plant (pothos or similar): \"This plant has thin leaves and stays green even with less light. This trait helps it survive in the shade. Where would this plant be happiest?\" (Students should point to the shadier areas near the fence.)\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2–3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Tell your partner: What is one plant trait you observed? Why might that trait help a plant survive?\"\n   - Listen to partner conversations; select 1–2 pairs to share out.\n   - Ask: \"Can everyone show me with your hands whether a sunny place (arms up and open) or a shady place (arms folded like a shadow) would be better for a succulent?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Trait** | Something about how a plant or animal looks or acts. Plants can have traits like leaf color, leaf shape, or flower size. |\n| **Environment** | Everything around a plant that affects it—the sunlight, soil, water, temperature, and space. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where a plant or animal lives. It's the home that has everything the organism needs to survive. |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy. Plants survive when their habitat has what they need. |\n| **Variation** | When organisms of the same type look different from each other. Example: Two flowers can both be daisies but have different colors. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should be able to name and define trait, environment, habitat, and survive in their own words.\n- Students should understand that plant traits and environmental conditions are connected.\n- Students should be able to match plants to suitable habitats based on observed traits and discussed concepts.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheet of paper (11\" × 14\" or larger) per group\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Pre-drawn or printed outline of a garden space (optional: print a simple 2-section or 4-section garden template)\n- Index cards with plant names/pictures (succulent, shade plant, sun-loving flower, fern, ornamental grass, etc.)\n- Access to the original garden photograph for reference\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Garden design challenge:** Say: \"Now you're going to use what you learned to design your own garden. You'll decide where to place plants based on their traits.\"\n\n2. **Provide each small group with:**\n   - A large sheet of paper divided into two areas: a **sunny spot** (draw or leave one side bright) and a **shady spot** (draw or shade the other side darker).\n   - Index cards showing different plants (with pictures and names).\n\n3. **Student task:**\n   - Groups receive 5–7 different plant cards.\n   - Students must place each plant in the sunny or shady area where it would survive best.\n   - Under each plant picture, students write or draw one reason for their choice (e.g., \"Succulent here because it likes lots of sun and doesn't need much water\").\n   - Use observations from the Explore phase and the photo to justify placement.\n\n4. **Teacher role:**\n   - Circulate and ask probing questions: \"Why did you put the fern in the shade?\" \"What trait of this plant made you choose that spot?\" \"Would a succulent be happy here? Why or why not?\"\n   - Guide students to use evidence from their observations and the photograph.\n   - Encourage students to explain their thinking using the vocabulary (trait, environment, habitat, survive).\n\n5. **Gallery walk (optional, if time permits):**\n   - Display completed garden designs around the room.\n   - Students do a quick walk to see how other groups arranged their plants.\n   - Ask: \"Did everyone put the same plants in the same spots? Why do you think some groups made different choices?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should accurately place plants based on light requirements and observed traits.\n- Students should provide evidence-based explanations for their choices using words like \"trait,\" \"survive,\" and \"habitat.\"\n- Students should recognize that multiple correct solutions exist (e.g., some sun-loving plants could tolerate partial shade).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student responses to guiding questions in Engage and Explore phases.\n- Review Explore observation sheets for accuracy and reasoning.\n- Listen to student explanations during partner talks and group shares.\n- Note whether students use vocabulary (trait, environment, habitat, survive) correctly in context.\n\n**Exit ticket (summative assessment) — administer at end of Day 2:**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper and ask them to respond to the following (pictures + words are acceptable for all responses):\n\n1. **Draw or write:** \"Show one plant trait you observed. What does this trait help the plant do?\"\n\n2. **Write or explain:** \"Where in the garden photo would you put a plant with big, thin leaves that doesn't like bright sunlight? Why?\"\n\n3. **Draw and label:** \"Draw a simple picture of a garden with a sunny spot and a shady spot. Place one sun-loving plant and one shade-loving plant. Label or explain why you put each plant there.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- **Proficient:** Student correctly identifies 1+ plant traits, explains how a trait helps a plant survive, and accurately matches at least one plant to an appropriate habitat with evidence-based reasoning.\n- **Developing:** Student identifies a trait and attempts to explain its function or makes mostly accurate plant-habitat matches with some support needed for reasoning.\n- **Beginning:** Student needs additional instruction on traits and habitat matching; reasoning is minimal or absent.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should demonstrate:\n- Understanding that plants have observable traits (color, leaf shape, height, texture).\n- Recognition that traits vary among similar organisms.\n- Ability to connect plant traits to environmental conditions.\n- Understanding that some plants survive well in specific habitats while others do not.\n- Use of evidence from observations and the photograph to support reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified observation sheets:** Provide pre-labeled drawings of plants with only 2–3 traits to identify (e.g., \"Is the leaf thin or thick?\" \"Is the plant tall or short?\"). Students check boxes or circle answers rather than write.\n\n2. **Plant pairing activity:** Instead of designing a full garden, give students pre-sorted pairs of plants + habitat cards (e.g., \"Cactus + Sunny Spot\"). Students match the cards and discuss why, with teacher prompting.\n\n3. **Visual reference during Elaborate:** Provide a large photo of the garden on a table or wall where students can point to and refer to examples of plants in sun vs. shade while making their garden design.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Three-zone garden design:** Instead of sunny/shady, ask advanced students to design a garden with three zones: full sun, partial shade, and full shade. Provide 8–10 plant options and require written justification for each placement.\n\n2. **Trait investigation:** Ask students to research or hypothesize: \"What other traits besides color and leaf shape might help a plant survive in a habitat?\" (Root depth, leaf thickness, flower size, water storage, growth speed). Have them sketch or write how these traits connect to environmental needs.\n\n3. **Adaptation exploration:** Introduce the word \"adaptation\" and ask: \"Which traits of these plants are adaptations—changes that help them survive in their habitat?\" Students identify and explain 2–3 adaptations from plants they observed.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seasonal garden investigation:** If possible, revisit the same garden (or a local garden) in a different season. Compare which plants are thriving now vs. in other seasons. Discuss: \"Why do different plants succeed at different times of year? What changed in the environment?\" (Connects to 3-LS3-2 and 3-LS4-3.)\n\n2. **Create a classroom habitat display:** Using potted plants from the Explore phase, designate one sunny windowsill and one shaded corner. Students tend the plants over 2–3 weeks, observe growth differences, and record data in a simple chart: \"Which plants look healthier in sun? Which look healthier in shade?\" This reinforces the idea that environments directly influence plant survival.\n\n3. **Design a wildlife-friendly garden:** Extend the learning to animals by asking: \"What does a butterfly need in a garden? What does a bee need?\" Students research and sketch a garden design that provides habitats for both plants and animals (flowers for nectar, shelters for insects, etc.). This prepares students for future lessons on ecosystems and interdependence.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Prior knowledge check:** Before starting, briefly assess whether students understand the difference between living and non-living things and can name common plants.\n- **Plant selection:** Choose plants with obvious trait differences (e.g., succulent vs. fern vs. sunny flower) so traits are visually apparent to third graders.\n- **Classroom garden alternative:** If you have a school garden or access to local gardens, consider doing the Explore phase outside with real plants instead of potted plants. This deepens engagement and makes the habitat concept more concrete.\n- **Vocabulary reinforcement:** Post the vocabulary cards (trait, environment, habitat, survive, variation) in the classroom for the duration of the unit. Use them in other contexts so students internalize the words.\n- **Connection to prior learning:** If students have studied plant parts (roots, stems, leaves), briefly reference how different leaf shapes serve different purposes in different environments.",
