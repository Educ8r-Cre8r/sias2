Identify physical features of snails (shell, foot, tentacles) and explain how each feature helps them survive.\n2. Describe the habitat requirements snails need to survive (moisture, food, shelter).\n3. Explain how a snail's shell and slime protect it from danger and help it move in its environment.\n4. Construct an argument using evidence about why snails can survive in some habitats but not others.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the snail on lichen/moss\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Picture of the snail printed for students (optional, one per pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster. Allow students 30-60 seconds to simply observe without talking.\n\n2. **Pose these discovery questions one at a time, allowing think-pair-share time (20-30 seconds per question):**\n   - \"What do you notice about this animal's body? What parts can you see?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this snail is living? What things do you see around it?\"\n   - \"What do you think that hard, bumpy thing on top of the snail is for? Why might a snail need it?\"\n   - \"How do you think this snail moves from place to place?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"If you were a tiny snail, what would you need to survive and stay safe? What would your home look like?\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper with two columns: \"What We See\" and \"What We Wonder.\" Keep this visible throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become snail detectives and find out how snails have amazing special features that help them survive!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Live snail(s) in a clear container with moist soil/moss and a leaf or piece of lettuce (container should have a loose lid with holes for air; source snails from biological supply company or local garden)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Observation worksheet (printed, see below)\n- Paper towel\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring shell)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and display with visuals):**\n\n1. \"Carefully observe your snail for 3-4 minutes without touching it. Use your hand lens to look closely. Draw or write what you see.\"\n2. \"Gently touch the snail's shell with your finger. What does it feel like? Is it hard or soft? Smooth or bumpy? Record this.\"\n3. \"Watch the snail move. Can you see the muscular 'foot' it uses to glide? Does it leave anything behind? (This is slime!)\"\n4. \"Look for the tentacles (the longer stalks on top). What do you think these are for?\"\n5. \"Offer the snail a piece of lettuce or leaf. Watch for 2-3 minutes. Does it eat? Does its mouth move?\"\n6. \"Mist the soil with water. What does the snail do? Does it move more or less?\"\n7. \"Gently tap on the snail's shell. What happens? Where does it go?\"\n\n**Observation Worksheet** (to be filled in with drawings and words):\n- Draw the snail and label: shell, foot, tentacles\n- Write 3 words that describe how the shell feels\n- Draw what happens when the snail eats\n- Write: \"The snail's slime helps it by...\"\n- Write: \"The snail's shell helps it by...\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups; ask open-ended questions: \"What did you observe?\" \"Why do you think it did that?\" \"What happened when you sprayed water?\"\n- Do NOT provide answers; redirect with observations: \"I see you noticed the snail went into its shell. Why might that be important?\"\n- Manage snail safety: ensure containers stay moist, snails are not overhandled, proper ventilation.\n- Help with recordkeeping but allow students to lead discovery.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and record the snail's physical features (shell, foot, tentacles).\n- Students discover through observation that snails eat plants, secrete slime, and retract into shells when threatened.\n- Students begin to infer that these features have a purpose (protection, movement, feeding).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with snail diagram (pre-drawn or drawn with students)\n- Markers\n- Snail \"Feature Card\" set (printed cards with pictures and labels)\n- Photograph from lesson displayed prominently\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on carpet.** Briefly discuss what students observed during Explore: \"Who saw their snail eat? Who saw it go into its shell? Who noticed the slime?\"\n\n2. **Create a labeled diagram of a snail** together on chart paper. Point to the photograph and the live snail (if still visible). Draw and label:\n   - **Shell** – the hard, spiral home\n   - **Foot** – the muscular part underneath that moves and makes slime\n   - **Tentacles** – the longer stalks (eyes on tips)\n   - **Mouth** – a tiny opening that scrapes food\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary with student-friendly explanations:**\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Third Grade-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Shell** | A hard house that grows with the snail and protects its soft body. |\n   | **Foot** | The muscular part underneath the snail that moves it forward and produces slime. |\n   | **Slime** | A wet, sticky liquid that the snail makes to help it move and protect itself. |\n   | **Tentacles** | Long feelers on top of a snail's head that help it sense (feel and see) its surroundings. |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives that has everything it needs (food, water, shelter). |\n   | **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment. |\n\n4. **Make explicit connections back to the photograph and observations:**\n   - \"See the snail in the picture? It's on green moss and lichen. This is its habitat—it has food and moisture here.\"\n   - \"The shell protects it from predators and keeps it from drying out in the sun.\"\n   - \"The slime trail helps it move across rough surfaces and keeps it moist.\"\n   - \"The tentacles help it find food and sense danger.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Why is the snail's shell important?\" (Wait for student responses: protection, home, keeps it moist)\n   - \"What does the snail use to move?\" (Foot and slime)\n   - \"Why do you think the snail needs slime?\" (To move, to stay wet)\n   - Ask students to point to parts on the live snail or photo as they answer.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and point to at least 3 snail body parts.\n- Students understand that each part has a job that helps the snail survive.\n- Students can explain the purpose of the shell and slime in basic terms.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards or paper (one per student)\n- Colored pencils/markers\n- Habitat scenario cards (printed, see below)\n- Chart paper titled \"Where Snails Can Survive\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Matching Task**\n\nProvide each pair or individual student with 3-4 \"habitat scenario cards\" with these environments:\n1. *A hot, dry desert with no plants*\n2. *A cool, damp forest floor with lots of leaves and moss*\n3. *Inside a sealed plastic box with no air or water*\n4. *A garden with plants, wet soil, and mulch*\n\n**Student Task:** \"Which habitats would the snail survive in? Which ones would be difficult? Why?\"\n\nStudents should use evidence from their observations and the Explain phase:\n- \"A snail needs moisture, so the desert would be bad because...\"\n- \"A snail needs food (plants), so a garden would be good because...\"\n- \"A snail needs to breathe, so a sealed box would be bad because...\"\n\n**Option B: Snail Superpower Poster**\n\nStudents create a labeled poster showing \"How Snails Survive\" with 3 drawings:\n1. **Shell Shield** – Draw the snail with its shell protecting it from danger\n2. **Slime Highway** – Draw the slime trail and explain how it helps movement\n3. **Tentacle Tracker** – Draw the tentacles and what they help the snail find\n\nStudents write one sentence for each: \"The [part] helps the snail survive by...\"\n\n**Option C: Design a Snail Home**\n\nStudents draw or create (with paper/cardboard) an ideal snail habitat, labeling: moisture source, food, shelter, and air. They explain to a partner why each element is necessary.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"What evidence from your observation supports that choice?\"\n- Push thinking: \"Would a snail survive here long-term? Why or why not?\"\n- Record student reasoning on a class chart: \"Why Snails Survive (or Don't Survive) in Different Places\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply knowledge to evaluate different habitats.\n- Students construct reasoning with evidence: \"A snail can survive in a forest because it has moisture, food, and dark places to hide.\"\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding that organisms have specific environmental needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of snail adaptations and habitat requirements.\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Observation of student engagement during Explore (were they making predictions and observations?)\n- Listen to student explanations during pair-shares in Engage and Elaborate\n- Review observation worksheets for evidence of noticing snail features and behaviors\n- Ask checking questions during Explain phase\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet or index card. Read aloud or display each question:\n\n**Question 1:** \"Draw a snail. Label at least 2 body parts.\"\n\n**Question 2:** \"How does a snail's shell help it survive?\" (Students write or draw the answer)\n\n**Question 3:** \"Where can a snail survive? Name one habitat and tell why the snail can live there.\" (Example: \"A snail can survive in a garden because it has wet soil and plants to eat.\")\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Students correctly identify and label at least 2 snail body parts (shell, foot, tentacles)\n✓ Students explain that the shell provides protection OR keeps the snail moist\n✓ Students identify a habitat with at least one reason why snails survive there (moisture, food, shelter)\n✓ Students use evidence from observations to support their answers\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets will show whether students can name body parts, explain their functions, and connect snails to habitats.\n- Struggling students may label only the shell and foot; advanced students will identify all parts and provide detailed explanations.\n- All students should be able to explain at least one reason snails need their shell or slime.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Sentence Starters for Written/Verbal Responses:**\n   - \"The snail's shell helps it by...\"\n   - \"A snail can survive in [habitat] because it has...\"\n   - \"I know the snail likes [food] because I saw...\"\n\n2. **Simplified Observation Worksheet:**\n   - Instead of open-ended recording, provide a checklist: \"Check the box if you see: the shell ☐, the foot ☐, slime ☐, the snail eating ☐\"\n   - Ask yes/no questions: \"Did the snail move faster when you sprayed water? Yes or No?\"\n\n3. **Small Group Explanation:**\n   - Review vocabulary and snail parts with a small group using the live snail or a picture before the larger group Explain phase.\n   - Provide a pre-labeled diagram to reference during independent work.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Comparative Adaptations:**\n   - \"How is a snail's shell different from a turtle's shell? How are they the same? Why do both animals need shells?\"\n   - Provide pictures of other shelled animals (armadillo, clam, hermit crab).\n\n2. **Habitat Design Challenge:**\n   - \"Design the BEST possible habitat for a snail using materials from around the room. Tell why each feature helps the snail survive.\"\n   - Have students predict and test: \"Would a snail prefer wet or dry soil? How could we find out?\"\n\n3. **Life Cycle Extension:**\n   - Introduce the concept: \"Snails lay tiny eggs. The babies look like mini snails. How does having a shell help a baby snail survive?\" (Connect to 3-LS1-1 if desired for future lessons.)\n   - Have students sequence pictures of a snail's life stages.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Snail Race Observation:** \n   - Place snails on paper and mark the starting line. Race them and measure distance traveled in 1 minute. Compare speeds and discuss: \"Why might some snails be faster? Is it the size of their shell? The amount of slime?\" (Connects to 3-LS3-2: traits influenced by environment)\n\n2. **Create a Class Field Guide:**\n   - Take photos of the classroom snail. Students write and illustrate a one-page field guide: \"All About Snails\" with labeled diagrams, interesting facts, and a section titled \"This is Where Snails Live.\"\n\n3. **Snail Habitat Terrarium Project (Home or Classroom):**\n   - Students build a long-term snail habitat in a clear container with soil, moss, lettuce, and water. Over 2-3 weeks, observe and record snail behavior, growth, and eating patterns. Discuss: \"Is this a good habitat? Would the snail survive here long-term?\"\n\n4. **Read-Aloud Connection:**\n   - Pair with a picture book such as *Snail, Snail, Come Out!* by Tana Hoban or *The Snail's Spell* by Joanne Ryder. Discuss how the story shows snails in their habitat and what the snail needs to be happy and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- **Live Snails:** Source from a local garden (after rain), a biological supply company (e.g., Carolina Biological Supply Co.), or a local university. Garden snails or land snails work well. Keep them in a moist habitat with ventilation and return to habitat after lesson if possible.\n- **Snail Safety:** Handle gently, keep moist, provide food, ensure airflow, and avoid extreme temperatures. Do not use pesticide-exposed snails.\n- **Allergy Check:** Ask families about gastropod allergies (rare but possible) before lesson.\n- **Timing:** If live snails are unavailable, the lesson works with high-quality photographs and pre-recorded videos of snails in behavior; learning outcomes are still met.",
