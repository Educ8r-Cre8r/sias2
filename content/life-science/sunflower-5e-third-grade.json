ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about plant growth and life cycles.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph of the sunflower bud on green stem\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Sunflower seeds (one per student, in a small bag)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Do NOT explain it yet. Allow students 30 seconds of silent looking time while they observe details.\n\n2. **Ask students to turn and talk to a partner:** \"What do you see in this picture? What do you notice?\" (2 minutes). Listen for observations about the green stem, the brown bud/seed coat, water droplets, and growth.\n\n3. **Facilitate a quick whole-class share-out** (3–4 minutes). Record student observations on chart paper without correcting or adding information. Examples might include: \"It has a green stick,\" \"There's a brown thing on top,\" \"It looks wet,\" \"It's growing.\"\n\n4. **Spark curiosity with these specific questions:**\n   - \"Has anyone ever planted a seed? What did you see happen?\" (Activate prior knowledge)\n   - \"What do you think this brown part at the top is? Where did it come from?\" (Encourage prediction about seeds/seed coat)\n   - \"What do you think will happen to this plant in the next few weeks?\" (Build anticipation about growth/life cycle)\n   - \"Why do you think there are water drops on it? What do plants need to live?\" (Connect to environmental needs)\n\n5. **Wonder prompt:** \"I'm wondering... if we could plant our own sunflower seeds, what would we need to do to help them grow into plants just like the one in this picture? Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to act like plant scientists and investigate what sunflower seeds need to grow. Then we'll trace the whole journey a sunflower takes from a tiny seed to a flowering plant like the one we see here.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the sunflower plant life cycle and the environmental conditions seeds need to grow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Sunflower seeds (3–5 per student or per small group)\n- Small clear cups or jars (one per group)\n- Potting soil or garden soil (enough to fill cups halfway)\n- Water in a spray bottle or small cups\n- Labels and pencils for marking cups\n- Optional: Second set of seeds kept dry (in an envelope) for comparison\n- Rulers (optional, for measuring growth later)\n- **Picture sequence cards** showing sunflower life stages (cut from images online or drawn by teacher; see Extension Activities for sourcing):\n  - Seed in soil\n  - Sprouting root visible\n  - Seedling with first leaves\n  - Growing plant with stem\n  - Flowering plant\n  - Sunflower with mature seeds\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Planting & Observation Setup (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials to each group** (groups of 3–4 students work best). Explain: \"We're going to plant sunflower seeds and take care of them so we can watch the life cycle happen before our eyes.\"\n\n2. **Step-by-step student directions for planting:**\n   - Fill your cup with soil until it's about 2 inches from the top.\n   - Make a small hole in the soil with your finger (about 1 inch deep).\n   - Place one sunflower seed in the hole and cover it gently with soil.\n   - Spray the soil lightly with water until it's moist (but not soggy).\n   - Label your cup with your group's name and today's date.\n   - Place it in a warm, sunny window or under a grow light.\n\n3. **Teacher guidance:** Circulate and ensure cups are labeled and watered appropriately. If seeds will not be observed over several weeks due to time constraints, use **pre-started seedlings** (3–5 days old) that students can pot and observe for a shorter window.\n\n4. **Introduce comparison:** Show students 2–3 dry, unplanted seeds in a clear envelope. Ask: \"What's different between these dry seeds and the seed we just planted in the soil? What do you think will happen to this one if we never water it?\" (This sets up the environmental conditions concept for Explain phase.)\n\n**Part B: Life Cycle Sequencing (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute the picture sequence cards** showing sunflower life stages (one set per group, or display as a poster).\n\n2. **Student task:** \"Your job is to arrange these pictures in order from the very beginning (the seed) to the end (the mature sunflower with seeds). Talk with your group about why you put them in that order. What happens at each stage?\"\n\n3. **Student recording:** Have groups sketch or write (or you scribe for them) the order on a piece of paper, labeling each stage with one or two words (e.g., \"Seed,\" \"Sprouting,\" \"Growing,\" \"Flowering,\" \"Making seeds\").\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate during planting and sequencing activities.\n- Ask guiding questions rather than giving answers: *\"What do you notice about the seed? What part comes out first when a seed grows? What comes next?\"*\n- Listen for student reasoning about why they ordered the cards that way—this reveals their current understanding of plant life cycles.\n- Do NOT correct misconceptions yet; that happens in Explain.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully plant seeds and create a labeled cup that will grow over the coming weeks.\n- Students arrange life cycle cards in a logical order (most will correctly sequence them; some may reverse the last two stages).\n- Students observe and can describe what a seed looks like and what a growing plant looks like.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and anchor student observations in the sunflower life cycle framework.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The photograph from Engage phase\n- Student-planted cups from Explore\n- Picture sequence cards (still visible)\n- Optional: Simple diagram or poster showing sunflower life cycle with labeled stages\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2–3 groups to share their life cycle sequencing. Display their ordered cards.\n   - Ask the class: \"Do these look the same or different? Why might the orders be the same or different?\"\n   - Validate all attempts; gently guide any reversed sequences by asking: *\"What has to happen before the flower can bloom?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce the life cycle concept (7 minutes):**\n   - Display the sunflower photograph again and the ordered life cycle cards.\n   - Explain: \"Every living thing—plants, animals, even you—goes through a life cycle. That means it has stages it passes through: it's born, it grows, it makes babies (reproduces), and eventually, it dies. A sunflower's life cycle looks like this...\" \n   - Point to each stage and name it simply:\n     - **Birth/Sprouting:** The seed breaks open and a tiny root grows down, then a sprout grows up.\n     - **Growth:** The seedling develops leaves and a stem. It gets taller and stronger.\n     - **Reproduction/Flowering:** The plant makes a big beautiful flower. Inside, it makes seeds.\n     - **Death (optional for third graders, but can mention):** Eventually, the plant stops growing and dies.\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to the image: \"This sunflower in the picture—which stage of the life cycle is it in? How do we know?\"\n   - Guide students to see: It's in the **growth stage**. We can tell because the seed has sprouted (the brown seed coat is still visible), there's a green stem, and a bud is forming (which will become the flower).\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If this sunflower keeps getting water and sunlight, what will happen to that brown bud at the top? What stage comes next?\"\n   - Expected answer: The bud will open into a flower.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Life cycle** | The stages a living thing goes through from birth to death (born → grows → makes babies → dies). |\n| **Seed** | The beginning of a plant. It contains a baby plant and food inside a hard coat. |\n| **Sprout/Sprouting** | When a seed cracks open and starts to grow; the first leaves and roots appear. |\n| **Stem** | The green part of a plant that holds it up and carries water from the roots to the leaves. |\n| **Bud** | A small bump on a plant that grows into a flower or leaves. It's like a package waiting to open. |\n| **Reproduction** | When a plant or animal makes babies. For plants, this happens when flowers make seeds. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the four main stages of a plant life cycle (birth, growth, reproduction, death—though death can be simplified).\n- Students can identify which stage the sunflower in the photograph is in and explain their thinking.\n- Students understand that seeds need to sprout, grow, and eventually flower to continue the cycle.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of life cycles and environmental conditions to a new context or scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Two clear cups with pre-planted sunflower seedlings (or use students' from Explore if growth is visible):\n  - **Cup A:** Placed in sunlight, watered regularly\n  - **Cup B:** Placed in a dark closet or shaded area, watered the same amount\n- Chart paper labeled \"What Plants Need to Grow\" (with columns for \"Sunlight,\" \"Water,\" \"Soil\")\n- Magazines or pictures of plants in different environments (optional)\n- Student notebooks or paper for recording predictions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the scenario (3 minutes):**\n   - Show both cups. Explain: \"We planted two sunflower seeds exactly the same way. But we put one in a sunny window and one in a dark closet. Both are getting water. What do you think will happen? Will they both grow the same?\"\n\n2. **Student prediction (4 minutes):**\n   - Have students turn and talk: \"Which plant do you think will grow better? Why?\"\n   - Record predictions on chart paper. Some students may predict the dark one will be fine; use this to explore.\n\n3. **Discuss environmental influences (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What does a sunflower plant need from its environment to grow well?\"\n   - Guide students toward: **sunlight, water, and soil.**\n   - Record these on chart paper.\n   - Explain: \"The plant in the dark won't get sunlight, so even though it's getting water and soil, it might look pale or weak. Plants need sunlight to make their own food.\"\n   - Connect back to the photograph: \"In this picture, we see the sunflower is growing in a place where it's probably getting sunlight and water. That's why it's green and growing so well.\"\n\n4. **Application task (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"If you wanted to help a sunflower grow as big and healthy as the one in the photo, where would you place it in your home? What would you do every week?\"\n   - Students share ideas. Reinforce: sunny window + water regularly = healthy growth.\n\n**Optional extension:** Show pictures of plants in extreme environments (cactus in desert, water lily in pond) and ask: \"How might these plants be different from sunflowers? What do you think they need?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide inquiry without directing outcomes.\n- Use the two cups as a concrete tool to explore cause-and-effect (environment → trait).\n- Validate predictions; use them as teaching moments to introduce the concept that traits CAN be influenced by environment (3-LS3-2).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that environmental conditions (sunlight and water) directly affect plant growth.\n- Students can explain why the sunflower in the photo looks healthy (it's getting what it needs).\n- Students can predict how a plant would change if an environmental condition changed (e.g., \"If we didn't water it, it would get dry and brown\").\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students understand the sunflower life cycle and how environment influences growth.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Observe student plant sequencing—do they understand the logical order of stages?\n- **During Explain:** Listen to student responses when you ask which stage the photograph shows. Can they justify their answer?\n- **During Elaborate:** Note student predictions about the two cups. Can they explain why environment matters?\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5–7 minutes):**\n\nDistribute a half-sheet of paper to each student with one or both of these prompts (adjust based on reading level; you may read aloud):\n\n**Option A (Illustration with labels):**\n\"Draw a sunflower's life cycle. Show at least 3 stages: a seed, a sprouting plant, and a flowering plant. Label each stage.\"\n- **Success criteria:** Three recognizable stages are shown in logical order; at least 2 stages are labeled.\n\n**Option B (Short answer—can be oral for struggling writers):**\n1. \"The sunflower in the photo is in the _________ stage of its life cycle. How do you know?\"\n   - Expected answer: Growth stage; because it has sprouted and is growing a stem and bud.\n2. \"What are two things a sunflower seed needs to grow into a big plant like in the photo?\"\n   - Expected answer: Water and sunlight (or soil, water, sunlight).\n3. \"What do you think will happen to the bud on this sunflower in the next few weeks?\"\n   - Expected answer: It will open into a flower.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student can identify at least 2 stages of the life cycle correctly.\n- Student can name at least one environmental need (water, sunlight, or soil).\n- Student can predict the next stage of the plant's growth.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most third graders will correctly identify the life cycle stages and show understanding of the progression from seed to flower.\n- Students will recognize that water and sunlight (or both) help plants grow.\n- Students may vary in their explanations, but should reference what they observed in the photograph or their own planted seeds.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Scaffold the life cycle sequencing:**\n   - Provide only 3 picture cards instead of 5–6 (seed, sprouting plant, flowering plant).\n   - Offer sentence starters: \"First, the seed ___. Next, the plant ___. Finally, the flower ___.\"\n\n2. **Use tactile/concrete supports:**\n   - Let students hold and feel an actual sunflower seed before planting; let them compare it to a picture of a seedling to make the transformation tangible.\n   - Use a real sunflower flower (or large photo) during Explain to point out the seed head, reinforcing the reproductive stage.\n\n3. **Modify exit ticket:**\n   - Offer a **multiple-choice version:** \"What comes after the seed sprouts? (a) A flower (b) A stem and leaves (c) Death\" \n   - Allow drawing instead of writing; scribe student responses.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Explore environmental variations more deeply:**\n   - Set up 3 cups: one in sunlight (watered), one in shade (watered), one in sunlight (not watered). Have students predict and observe differences over 1–2 weeks.\n   - Ask: \"Which plant is healthiest? Why? What does this tell us about what plants need?\"\n\n2. **Extend the life cycle:**\n   - Research or discuss: \"What happens after a sunflower flowers? Where do the seeds go? How could a sunflower seed get to a new place to grow?\"\n   - Introduce pollination: \"How do you think sunflower flowers get the pollen they need to make seeds?\"\n\n3. **Compare life cycles:**\n   - Provide picture sequences of other plants (bean, tomato, apple tree) and ask: \"How is the sunflower's life cycle the same as this plant's? How is it different?\"\n   - Introduce the concept of variation: \"Why might different sunflower seeds grow at different speeds?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Sunflower Growth Journal (ongoing over 2–4 weeks):**\n   - Students sketch and measure their planted sunflowers weekly.\n   - They record observations: \"This week, my sunflower grew ___ inches. I see ___ leaves. The stem is ___.\"\n   - Connect to data collection and life cycle tracking. Display growth over time on a class chart.\n   - *Links to NGSS 3-LS1-1: Students document the growth stage of the life cycle.*\n\n2. **Plant Needs Investigation: The Three Cups Experiment (extension activity or follow-up lesson):**\n   - As described in Elaborate, formally set up three cups representing different conditions:\n     - Cup A: Sunlight + water (control, should thrive)\n     - Cup B: No sunlight (dark closet) + water (should be pale/weak)\n     - Cup C: Sunlight + no water (dry, should wilt)\n   - Over 2 weeks, students observe and record which plant does best and why.\n   - This reinforces *3-LS3-2 (environment influences traits).*\n\n3. **Sunflower Life Cycle Book:**\n   - Students create a simple 4-page booklet with one life cycle stage per page.\n   - Each page has an illustration and a sentence: \"1. The seed grows roots. 2. The plant grows leaves. 3. A flower blooms. 4. The flower makes new seeds.\"\n   - Can be illustrated or assembled from printed images and labels.\n   - *Reinforces vocabulary and life cycle understanding; good formative assessment.*\n\n4. **Guest Visit: A Farmer or Gardener:**\n   - Invite a local farmer or master gardener to discuss growing sunflowers in real life.\n   - Students ask: \"How long does it take? What problems do they face? How do they keep plants healthy?\"\n   - *Extends learning to real-world application and community engagement.*\n\n5. **Sunflower Facts Hunt:**\n   - Provide a short fact sheet (or read aloud) about sunflowers: They follow the sun, they can grow very tall, bees pollinate them, seeds can be eaten, etc.\n   - Students draw or write their favorite fact.\n   - *Adds engaging context to the life cycle lesson; encourages reading/listening comprehension.*\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Timing:** If you have access to a classroom or outdoor garden space, students' actual planted seeds will provide 2–4 weeks of real-time observation. If not, use pre-started seedlings (nursery-bought or pre-grown by the teacher) to show visible growth during the lesson cycle.\n  \n- **Photograph usage:** Return to the photograph during each 5E phase. It serves as an anchor to help students make connections: *\"Remember this picture? This is what a growing sunflower looks like. This is the stage our plant is in right now.\"*\n\n- **Life cycle language:** Third graders may be uncomfortable with \"reproduction\" and \"death.\" You can use simpler language: *\"Making new plants/seeds\"* and *\"Getting old and stopping,\"* or simply focus on the first three stages (birth, growth, making seeds) and introduce death only if students ask.\n\n- **NGSS alignment:** This lesson hits 3-LS1-1 (life cycles) strongly and 3-LS3-2 (environment influences traits) through the water/sunlight investigation. You can deepen 3-LS3-2 with the extension cup experiments.\n\n---\n\n## References & Resources\n\n- **Life cycle picture sequences:** Search \"plant life cycle for kids\" on Google Images, or use resources from:\n  - Scholastic.com (free printables)\n  - Pinterest\n  - Teachers Pay Teachers (free/paid resources)\n  \n- **Sunflower seeds:** Standard variety seeds available at any garden center or online. Choose a dwarf or medium variety for faster growth in a classroom.\n\n- **Real-time documentation:** Use a classroom tablet or camera to photograph plants weekly and create a digital life cycle story.",
