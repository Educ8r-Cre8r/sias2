ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Activate curiosity about seeds, growth, and what plants need to survive by introducing the photograph in an engaging, wonderment-filled way.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Large photograph printed in color or displayed on a screen\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Real seeds (bean seeds work well) in a small bag for passing around\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Display the photograph** on a board or screen where all students can see clearly. Say: \"Look at this special picture! Something exciting is happening underground and at the surface. What do you notice?\"\n\n  2. **Guide observation with specific, open-ended questions:**\n     - \"What do you see poking out of the ground? What does it look like?\"\n     - \"Do you see anything white or cracked in the soil? What could that be?\"\n     - \"What color is the soil? Is it wet or dry? How can you tell?\"\n     - \"What else is in the picture besides the sprouting plants—can you see leaves, sticks, or other things?\"\n\n  3. **Activate prior knowledge** by asking: \"Has anyone planted a seed before? What happened?\" Allow 2-3 students to share briefly.\n\n  4. **Create a Wonder Chart:** On chart paper, write \"What do seeds need to grow?\" at the top. Record student predictions and wonderings (e.g., \"Water,\" \"Sun,\" \"Dirt\"). Do not correct; simply record all ideas.\n\n  5. **Pass around real seeds** and let students hold them gently. Ask: \"How do you think something so small becomes a big plant?\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today we're going to be seed scientists and discover what plants really need to grow strong and healthy, just like the seeds in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate germinating seeds hands-on to discover the conditions needed for growth.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Shallow clear plastic cups or containers (one per student or pair)\n  - Bean seeds (lima or kidney beans work best—pre-soaked overnight is ideal)\n  - Potting soil or garden soil\n  - Water in a spray bottle or small cup\n  - Paper towels\n  - Labels and crayons/markers\n  - Observation journals or drawing paper\n  - Optional: magnifying glasses\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Organize students into pairs or small groups** of 3-4. Assign each pair/group a container and seeds.\n\n  2. **Demonstrate the setup** step-by-step before students begin:\n     - Fill the container halfway with moist soil\n     - Plant 2-3 seeds about an inch deep\n     - Gently press soil around the seed\n     - Label the cup with the student's name and date\n     - Place the cup in a sunny, warm location\n\n  3. **Student directions (use simple language and model each step):**\n     - \"Place your seed deep in the soil—pretend you're tucking it into a cozy bed.\"\n     - \"Sprinkle water on top gently until the soil feels damp (not soaking).\"\n     - \"Put your cup where the sun can reach it.\"\n     - \"We will check on your seeds every day for the next few days.\"\n\n  4. **Daily Observations (over 3-5 days):**\n     - Students return to their seed cups each day (or every other day).\n     - Using magnifying glasses, they look closely at the soil surface and any changes.\n     - **Recording:** Students draw what they see on observation paper or in journals. Encourage labels like \"dirt,\" \"water,\" \"seed,\" \"sprout,\" \"root,\" \"leaf.\"\n     - Ask guiding questions: \"Did anything change? What's different from yesterday? Why do you think the seed is changing?\"\n\n  5. **Teacher Role:** \n     - Circulate and ask open-ended questions rather than providing answers\n     - Prompt observation: \"What do you notice? Look more carefully. What changed?\"\n     - Refrain from saying \"Yes, that's right\" or correcting—instead ask \"What makes you think that?\"\n     - Ensure seeds have consistent moisture and sunlight; adjust care as needed\n\n  6. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n     - Students observe visible sprouting (roots breaking through soil, leaves emerging)\n     - Students notice that seeds need water (soil dries if not watered; sprouting is slower)\n     - Students see that sunlight matters (compare sunny vs. shaded locations if possible)\n     - Students produce drawings showing change over time\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations back to the photograph and survival concept.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Photographs from Explore phase or one student seed cup showing sprouting\n  - Picture cards or labels for vocabulary (optional: water droplet, soil, sun, root, sprout)\n  - The original lesson photograph displayed\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Gather students and revisit the lesson photograph.** Say: \"Remember this picture? Now that you've watched your own seeds grow, what do you think is happening in this photo?\"\n\n  2. **Share observations from Explore phase:**\n     - Invite 3-4 students to show their drawings and describe what they saw change.\n     - Ask: \"What made your seeds start to grow? What was happening under the soil?\"\n\n  3. **Introduce vocabulary with student-friendly definitions and real examples:**\n\n     **Vocabulary:**\n     - **Seed:** A tiny package that holds a baby plant and food to help it start growing\n     - **Soil:** The dirt in the ground that holds water and nutrients to feed growing plants\n     - **Water:** The liquid that seeds and plants drink through their roots to grow big and strong\n     - **Sprout:** A baby plant that starts to grow from a seed\n     - **Root:** The part of a plant that grows underground and drinks water to help the plant grow\n\n  4. **Create a visual summary chart** titled \"Plants Need These Things to Survive and Grow\":\n     - Draw/glue pictures or simple icons for: water (water droplet), soil (brown dirt), sunlight (yellow sun)\n     - Point to each and say: \"Seeds need water to drink. Seeds need soil to hold them and feed them. Seeds need sunlight to help them grow.\"\n\n  5. **Connect back to original photograph:**\n     - Point to the soil: \"This soil has water in it—can you see it looks darker and damper?\"\n     - Point to the sprouting seeds: \"These are sprouts—they're baby plants growing from seeds!\"\n     - Point to the decay/organic matter: \"This old plant stuff breaks down and becomes food in the soil for new seeds.\"\n\n  6. **Check for understanding:**\n     - Ask each student individually or in turn: \"Name one thing a plant needs to grow.\" Accept any of the three: water, soil, sunlight.\n     - Ask: \"In this picture, can you show me where the soil is? Where might the water be? Where is the sunshine coming from?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students can name 2-3 things plants need to survive (water, soil, sunlight)\n  - Students understand that seeds are baby plants\n  - Students can point to evidence in the photograph and their observations\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply understanding by predicting and testing what happens when one essential resource is removed.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Additional seeds and containers (3 cups per pair)\n  - Soil, water, labels\n  - Paper towels\n  - Sunny and dark locations (or one sunny spot and a dark cupboard)\n  - Observation paper/journals\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Pose a new question:** \"What if we grew seeds but took away one thing they need? What would happen? Let's test it!\"\n\n  2. **Set up a simple comparative investigation:**\n     - **Cup A (Control):** Plant a seed with soil, water, and sunlight (normal conditions)\n     - **Cup B (No Water):** Plant a seed with soil and sunlight, but do not water it\n     - **Cup C (No Light):** Plant a seed with soil and water, but place it in a dark location (cupboard or box)\n\n  3. **Student predictions:** Before starting, ask: \"What do you think will happen to each seed? Will they all sprout the same? Why or why not?\"\n\n  4. **Observation over 3-4 days:**\n     - Students check seeds daily and draw observations\n     - Ask: \"Which seed looks the healthiest? Which one is struggling? Why?\"\n\n  5. **Discussion after observation period:**\n     - \"The seed with water and sun grew tall and green. Why?\"\n     - \"The seed without water didn't sprout. What does this teach us?\"\n     - \"The seed in the dark didn't grow well. What does this teach us?\"\n     - Conclude: \"Plants really do need water, soil, and sunlight to survive!\"\n\n  6. **Teacher Role:**\n     - Facilitate the setup\n     - Ask questions to guide thinking, not to give answers\n     - Help students connect results to survival needs\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students make and test predictions\n  - Students observe differences in growth based on conditions\n  - Students understand that removal of resources harms plant survival\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of what plants need to survive.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n     - Observe students during Explore phase: Can they carefully handle seeds and describe changes?\n     - Listen to student language during discussions: Do they use vocabulary (seed, sprout, soil, water)?\n     - Review observation drawings: Do they show evidence of noticing change?\n\n  2. **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n     Use one or more of the following (adapt language for Kindergarten):\n     \n     - **Drawing Task:** \"Draw a seed in the ground. Show me two things it needs to grow big and strong.\"\n       - **Success Criteria:** Student draws a seed and labels or shows water and soil (or sunlight).\n     \n     - **Observation Question:** Show the original lesson photograph and ask: \"What is happening in this picture? What do the seeds need?\"\n       - **Success Criteria:** Student identifies sprouting/growing and names at least one resource (water, soil, or sun).\n     \n     - **Verbal Checklist:** Ask each student individually:\n       - \"What is this?\" (point to a seed) → Should say \"seed\" or \"baby plant\"\n       - \"What do plants need to grow?\" → Should name at least two of: water, soil, sun\n       - \"Why do you think the plant needs water?\" → Should explain (even simply, e.g., \"to drink\")\n       - **Success Criteria:** Student correctly identifies 2 out of 3 questions.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students successfully identify seeds and sprouting\n  - Students name 2-3 resources plants need (water, soil, sunlight)\n  - Students provide simple reasoning (e.g., \"Plants need water because they drink it\")\n  - Students show evidence of observation and increased vocabulary use\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n  1. **Pair with a strong observer:** During Explore phase, pair a struggling student with a peer who can model careful observation and recording.\n  2. **Provide vocabulary cards with pictures:** Use labeled images of water, soil, sun, seed, and sprout. Students can match pictures to real observations rather than generate words independently.\n  3. **Simplify recording:** Instead of drawing and labeling, allow students to point and tell you what they see; you record their words. This reduces the writing/drawing demand while maintaining observation practice.\n\n- **Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n  1. **Extend the comparative investigation:** Have advanced students design their own test (e.g., \"What if we used sand instead of soil?\" or \"What if we used salt water instead of fresh water?\"). They predict, test, and explain results.\n  2. **Introduce the water cycle:** Explain that water in soil came from rain, and rain comes from clouds. Have students make a simple water cycle diagram showing how water moves from sky to soil to plants and back.\n  3. **Research and share:** Have advanced students look at picture books or videos about plant life cycles and create a simple poster showing seed → sprout → plant → flower, explaining what the plant needs at each stage.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grow a Bean in a Jar:** Create a \"seed germination jar\" by layering soil, sand, and gravel in a clear jar. Plant beans between the jar wall and soil so students can see roots growing underground. This extends Explore observations and shows the hidden root system.\n\n2. **Plant a Classroom Garden:** If outdoor space is available, have students plant seeds in a garden bed or large container. Over weeks/months, students observe growth, water the plants, and harvest vegetables or flowers. This connects survival needs to real-world gardening and provides long-term observation.\n\n3. **Life Cycle Book:** Create a simple flip book or accordion-fold booklet showing the life cycle of a plant: seed → sprout → plant with leaves → plant with flowers/fruit. Students draw or glue pictures for each stage and label what the plant needs at each stage (water, soil, sun, etc.). This solidifies understanding of growth and changing needs.\n\n---",
