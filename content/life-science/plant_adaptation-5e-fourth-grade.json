Identify external structures on plants (such as thorns, spines, and bumpy bark) and explain how these structures help plants survive.\n2. Construct an evidence-based argument that explains how a specific plant structure functions to protect the plant or help it meet its needs.\n3. Compare different plant external structures and determine which structures are best suited for specific survival purposes in different environments.\n4. Apply their understanding of plant adaptation by designing a plant with structures suited to a particular environment or challenge.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest in plant structures and activate prior knowledge about how plants protect themselves.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Photograph of thorny branches (displayed on projector or printed for students to observe)\n  - Student observation sheets (paper and pencils)\n  - Real plant samples with protective structures (optional: rosemary sprigs, cacti, or branches with thorns—handle with care)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  Display the photograph prominently and allow students 30 seconds of silent observation. Then pose these discussion questions in order:\n  \n  1. **\"What do you notice about the branches in this picture? What's different about them compared to branches you might see on other trees?\"** (Guide students to observe the sharp, pointy structures on the branches.)\n  \n  2. **\"Why do you think these branches have thorns or sharp points on them? What purpose might they serve for the plant?\"** (Accept all predictions—students may suggest protection, defense, or warning animals to stay away.)\n  \n  3. **\"If you were an animal looking for food or a place to rest, would you want to touch this plant? Why or why not?\"** (Help students connect structure to function and survival.)\n  \n  4. **\"Can you think of other plants or animals you've seen that have sharp or pointy parts? What do those parts do?\"** (Accept examples like porcupines, cacti, rose bushes, holly bushes, etc.)\n  \n  Have students share one wonder or question: *\"I wonder why some plants have thorns and other plants don't...\"* or *\"I'm curious about...\"* Write these questions on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become plant scientists and investigate how different plants use their external structures—the parts we can see on the outside—to survive in their environments. Let's explore what we can learn from real plants!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate plant structures hands-on and observe how external features function to protect plants.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - 4-5 different plant specimens (in small pots or small branches/leaves): examples might include:\n    - Rosemary (needle-like leaves)\n    - A thorny branch (hawthorn, blackthorn, or similar)\n    - A cactus or succulent with spines\n    - A smooth-barked plant (such as birch or maple)\n    - A fuzzy-leafed plant (like lamb's ear or African violet)\n  - Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per pair)\n  - Observation recording sheets (with drawings/labels)\n  - Gloves (for handling thorny plants safely)\n  - Metric rulers\n  - Colored pencils\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  Organize students into pairs or small groups. Assign each group one plant specimen to investigate. If you have fewer plants, rotate groups through stations.\n  \n  **Student Directions:**\n  \n  1. Put on gloves if your plant has thorns or sharp parts.\n  \n  2. Carefully observe your plant using your eyes and hand lens. DO NOT put bare hands on thorny or spiky parts.\n  \n  3. On your observation sheet, draw what the outside of your plant looks like. Pay special attention to any sharp, bumpy, fuzzy, or unusual features.\n  \n  4. Measure and record:\n     - The length of a thorn, spine, or pointy part (if it has one)\n     - How many thorns or sharp features you can count on a small branch\n     - The texture description (smooth, bumpy, fuzzy, sharp, etc.)\n  \n  5. Discuss with your partner: **\"What do you think these structures do? How might they protect this plant or help it survive?\"**\n  \n  6. Try this gentle test: Carefully touch the back of your hand to the plant (avoiding thorns). What sensations do you feel? (rough, smooth, prickly, soft?) Does this structure feel like it would discourage an animal from eating it?\n  \n  7. Write or draw one hypothesis: *\"I think this structure helps the plant by...\"*\n\n- **Teacher Role:** \n  - Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions without providing answers: \"What do you notice about the texture?\" \"How might an animal react to this structure?\" \"What would happen if an animal tried to eat this plant?\"\n  - Ensure safe handling of thorny plants; remind students about proper use of hand lenses.\n  - Encourage groups to think about cause and effect: *\"What is the problem the plant might face? How does this structure solve that problem?\"*\n  - Take anecdotal notes on student observations and reasoning.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students will make detailed observations of external plant structures.\n  - Students will record measurements and descriptions.\n  - Students will generate initial explanations connecting plant structures to survival functions (protection, defense, discouraging predators).\n  - Groups will produce observation sheets with drawings and written/pictorial evidence.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts; connect student observations to plant adaptations and survival.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Photograph of thorny plant from the lesson introduction\n  - Plant structure vocabulary cards (with images and definitions)\n  - Student science notebooks\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):**\n  Have each group present their plant specimen and share:\n  - What external structures they observed\n  - How they think those structures help the plant survive\n  - One interesting measurement or observation\n  \n  As groups present, record their ideas on chart paper under the heading: *\"How Plant Structures Help Plants Survive.\"*\n  \n  **Direct Instruction with Vocabulary (8-13 minutes):**\n  \n  Introduce and define the following key terms using the photograph and student examples:\n  \n  1. **External Structure:** A part of a plant that you can see on the outside, like leaves, thorns, bark, or branches. These structures help the plant survive, grow, and reproduce.\n  \n  2. **Adaptation:** A special feature or behavior that helps a living thing survive in its environment. The thorns on this plant are an adaptation because they protect it from being eaten.\n  \n  3. **Defense/Protection:** Something that keeps a living thing safe from harm. Thorns are a defense because they keep animals from eating the plant or breaking the branches.\n  \n  4. **Function:** The job or purpose that a body part does. The function of thorns is to protect the plant from animals that want to eat it.\n  \n  5. **Environment:** The place where a plant or animal lives, including the weather, soil, water, and other living things around it. Plants develop different structures based on their environment.\n  \n  **Connection Back to Photograph and Exploration:**\n  Point back to the original photograph: \"The thorns we see here are external structures. Their function is to protect the plant. This is an adaptation—a special feature that helps the plant survive in its environment. Just like the plants you observed, this plant's thorns discourage animals from eating it or damaging its branches.\"\n  \n  Refer to student observations: \"When [Group A] measured their thorns, they found they were [X] cm long. That sharp, pointy shape makes them very effective at protecting the plant!\"\n  \n  **Check for Understanding:**\n  Ask students to \"turn and talk\" with a partner to answer:\n  - \"What is one external structure we observed today?\"\n  - \"What is the function of that structure? How does it help the plant?\"\n  - \"Is it an adaptation? Why or why not?\"\n  \n  Listen to partner conversations and select 2-3 pairs to share whole-group responses.\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **External Structure:** A part of a living thing that is on the outside and can be seen and touched (like leaves, thorns, skin, or feathers).\n  - **Adaptation:** A special feature or behavior that helps a living thing survive and thrive in its environment.\n  - **Defense:** Protection from harm; a structure or behavior that keeps something safe.\n  - **Function:** The job or purpose something does (example: the function of roots is to take up water and hold the plant in soil).\n  - **Environment:** The place where a living thing lives, including all the things around it (weather, soil, water, other plants and animals).\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students will understand and use vocabulary related to plant structures and adaptation.\n  - Students will connect their observations to the concepts of function and adaptation.\n  - Students will be able to explain how an external structure helps a plant survive.\n  - Students will recognize that different plants have different external structures suited to their environments.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding of plant structures and adaptations by designing a plant suited to a specific environment.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Scenario cards (printed descriptions of different environments)\n  - Design sheets (large paper divided into two sections: \"My Plant Design\" and \"External Structures and Their Functions\")\n  - Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n  - Optional: craft materials (pipe cleaners, foam, felt, toothpicks) for 3D plant designs\n  - Chart showing different environments (desert, rainforest, arctic tundra, grassland, rocky mountain)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  Present this scenario: *\"You are a plant designer. Your job is to create a new plant that will survive in a specific environment. Think about the challenges the plant will face. What external structures would help it survive?\"*\n  \n  **Student Directions:**\n  \n  1. Your teacher will give you a scenario card that describes an environment (such as \"You are a plant in a hot, dry desert where many animals want to eat leaves\" or \"You are a plant in a cold, windy mountain where it snows\").\n  \n  2. On your design sheet, draw what your plant would look like. Include at least 3 external structures.\n  \n  3. For each structure, label it and write or draw:\n     - **What is it?** (Is it a thorn, thick waxy coating, fuzzy hairs, deep roots, etc.?)\n     - **Why did you give your plant this structure?** (What problem does it solve? How does it help the plant survive?)\n  \n  4. Be ready to explain your plant design to the class using this sentence frame: *\"My plant has [STRUCTURE] because [ENVIRONMENT/PROBLEM/SURVIVAL NEED].\"*\n  \n  **Example Scenario Cards:**\n  - **Desert Environment:** It's very hot and dry. Few animals live here, but grasshoppers and beetles eat plant leaves. Your plant needs to save water and protect itself.\n  - **Rainforest Environment:** It's warm and wet year-round. Many animals eat leaves and plant parts. Your plant grows in shade under tall trees.\n  - **Windy Mountain Environment:** It's cold and very windy. Snow falls in winter. Few animals live here, but deer sometimes graze. Your plant must be strong against wind.\n  - **Grassland Environment:** It's warm but with dry seasons. Many animals graze here, eating grass and leaves. Fires sometimes occur.\n  - **Swampy Environment:** It's very wet with standing water. Insects are abundant. The plant needs to prevent rot and protect against insects.\n  \n  **Teacher Role:**\n  - Distribute scenario cards randomly to students or pairs.\n  - Ask probing questions during design work: \"What challenge will your plant face in this environment?\" \"How does this structure help solve that problem?\" \"Could you add another structure to help it survive even better?\"\n  - Encourage students to revisit their observations from the Explore phase: \"Remember the cactus we observed? Why might it have thick, waxy skin?\"\n  - Allow flexibility in representation—drawings, labeled diagrams, or even 3D constructions are all acceptable.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students will design a plant with at least 3 external structures.\n  - Students will provide a clear reasoning for each structure based on environmental challenges.\n  - Students will demonstrate understanding that plant structures are adaptations to specific environments.\n  - Students will be able to explain their design choices using the concept of function and environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant external structures, adaptation, and survival function.\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n  - Observation sheets and drawings from Explore phase\n  - Turn-and-talk responses during Explain phase\n  - Plant design and explanations from Elaborate phase\n  - Anecdotal notes from teacher circulation and questioning\n  \n  **Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) — Administer at end of Lesson 2:**\n  \n  Provide each student with this assessment (can be written, drawn, or verbal depending on student needs):\n  \n  *Choose ONE plant from today's lesson that you observed (thorny branch, rosemary, cactus, fuzzy plant, or smooth bark). Answer these questions in sentences or with drawings:*\n  \n  1. **What is one external structure of this plant?** (Draw and label it, or describe it in words.)\n  \n  2. **What is the function of this structure? How does it help the plant survive?**\n  \n  3. **Why do you think this plant has this structure? What problem does it solve?** (Think about what animals might do or what the environment is like.)\n  \n  4. **Is this structure an adaptation? Explain your thinking.**\n  \n  **Success Criteria:**\n  \n  Students demonstrate understanding if they can:\n  - ✓ Identify at least one external plant structure from the lesson (observation, description, or drawing)\n  - ✓ Explain how that structure functions to support plant survival (with reasoning connected to protection, water conservation, or other survival need)\n  - ✓ Make a connection between the structure and the plant's environment or survival challenges\n  - ✓ Use at least one piece of vocabulary correctly (adaptation, external structure, function, environment, or defense)\n  - ✓ Provide evidence or reasoning based on observations or experiences from the lesson\n  \n  **How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n  \n  - **Learning Objective 1 (Identify external structures and explain function):** Review exit tickets and Elaborate task completions. Students should be able to name and describe at least one structure and explain its purpose.\n  \n  - **Learning Objective 2 (Construct evidence-based argument):** Evaluate the reasoning in exit tickets and design explanations. Look for connections between structure, function, and survival challenge.\n  \n  - **Learning Objective 3 (Compare structures for different purposes):** Assess responses during group presentations and turn-and-talk moments. Can students distinguish between different structures and their specialized functions?\n  \n  - **Learning Objective 4 (Design plant with appropriate structures):** Evaluate Elaborate task. Does the plant design demonstrate understanding that different environments require different adaptations?\n  \n  If a student struggles with any objective, provide brief re-teaching during small-group time or one-on-one conferences before moving to new content.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary and Sentence Frames:**\n   - Provide students with pre-printed vocabulary cards with images and simple definitions.\n   - Offer sentence frames for explanations: *\"This structure helps the plant by ___.\"* or *\"Animals don't eat this plant because ___.\"*\n   - Use consistent, repeated language throughout the lesson (e.g., always say \"external structure\" and \"function\" together).\n\n2. **Tactile and Visual Support:**\n   - Allow students extra time with hand lenses to observe plant structures closely.\n   - Encourage drawing and labeling rather than writing lengthy explanations.\n   - Provide real plant specimens to touch (safely) rather than relying on photographs alone.\n   - Use color-coding on observation sheets (e.g., \"Use a green circle to show the structure, and a red line to show what it does\").\n\n3. **Peer Support and Modified Tasks:**\n   - Pair struggling students with a strong science partner during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n   - Provide a choice of 2-3 pre-selected environments for the Elaborate task rather than an open choice.\n   - Allow students to answer exit ticket questions orally to a teacher or peer rather than in writing.\n   - Simplify the exit ticket to focus on just two questions (what is the structure, and what does it do).\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Analysis and Comparison:**\n   - Ask advanced students to compare multiple plant structures within the same plant and explain why that plant might need different structures for different functions.\n   - Pose higher-order questions: *\"If a plant loses its thorns, how might that affect its survival? What would be the consequences?\"* or *\"How might a plant's external structures change if its environment changed?\"*\n   - Have students research and present on real plant adaptations (Venus flytraps, pitcher plants, bristlecone pines, etc.) and present findings to peers.\n\n2. **Complex Design Challenges:**\n   - Ask students to design a plant that must survive in TWO different environments (e.g., both wet and dry seasons).\n   - Have students create a detailed \"Plant Care Manual\" that explains what conditions their designed plant needs to thrive, including how its structures support survival in those conditions.\n   - Challenge students to design a plant that solves a human problem (e.g., a plant with structures that prevent erosion, or that pollinates efficiently).\n\n3. **Extended Investigation:**\n   - Have advanced students conduct a research project comparing external structures across plant families (such as comparing defensive structures in the rose family, cactus family, and legume family).\n   - Ask students to predict how a plant's external structures might evolve over time if its environment changes (connecting to adaptation and environmental change).\n   - Have students create an illustrated field guide or infographic about plant defenses and adaptations suitable for publishing or sharing with younger grades.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Plant Adaptation Nature Walk (Outdoor Investigation, 30-45 minutes):**\n   Organize a guided nature walk around the school grounds or local park. Students search for and photograph (or sketch) plants with various external structures (thorns, rough bark, fuzzy leaves, etc.). Create a class chart back in the classroom organizing observations by plant type and structure. Students write captions explaining what each structure does. This extends the lesson by showing that adaptation is all around them.\n\n2. **Design a Protective Plant Illustration Series (Art & Writing Integration, 45-60 minutes):**\n   Students select one real plant with notable protective or survival structures (cactus, rose, thistle, stinging nettle, holly, porcupine grass, etc.) and research it. They create a detailed illustration labeled with external structures, then write a short informational paragraph explaining how each structure helps the plant survive. Compile illustrations into a class \"Plant Defense Guide\" or shared digital resource.\n\n3. **Interactive Model: Build Your Own Protective Plant (Hands-On Craft, 30-40 minutes):**\n   Provide craft materials (pipe cleaners, foam, felt, toothpicks, clay, tissue paper, etc.) and have students construct a 3D model of a plant with specific external structures designed for a chosen environment. Students write or record an explanation of why each structure is important. Display models alongside scenario cards so classmates can guess the environment and explain their reasoning. This kinesthetic approach reinforces understanding of form-function relationships.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
