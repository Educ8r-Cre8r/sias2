Identify that mushrooms are living organisms with body parts that help them survive.\n2. Observe and describe the external structures of mushrooms (cap, gills, stem).\n3. Explain how mushrooms' shapes help them live in damp environments like soil and grass.\n4. Recognize that mushrooms are different from plants but are still living things.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about mushrooms as unusual living things and activate prior knowledge.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital copy of the photograph (large enough for all students to see)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: actual mushroom specimen in a clear container (if available and safe; verify it is not toxic)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and observe:** Project or display the photograph on a screen or board. Ask students to look carefully without speaking for 15-20 seconds.\n\n2. **Opening questions (ask 3-4):**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe it to a friend next to you.\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this in your yard or a park? When and where?\"\n   - \"Do you think this living thing is a plant, an animal, or something else? Why?\"\n   - \"What is the bumpy/ridgy part underneath the hat? Why do you think it looks like that?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder why mushrooms pop up in the grass after it rains. What do YOU wonder about mushrooms?\"\n\n4. **Record responses** on chart paper under \"What We Wonder About Mushrooms.\" Affirm all contributions.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be mushroom detectives and explore what makes mushrooms special living things!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate mushroom structures and discover their function through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or printed images of mushrooms in various habitats (4-5 different images showing mushrooms in grass, on logs, in wet areas)\n- Model mushrooms made from craft materials (paper cups as caps, paper towel tubes as stems, or bring actual mushrooms if safe and approved by administration)\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per pair of students)\n- Paper and crayons/markers for recording\n- \"Mushroom Detective Recording Sheet\" (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Station setup (if using images):** Place 4-5 different mushroom images at stations around the room OR display them on document camera one at a time.\n\n2. **Partner exploration:** Assign students to pairs. Provide magnifying glasses.\n\n3. **Guided investigation:**\n   - \"Look at the mushroom closely. What body parts do you see? Point to them with your finger.\"\n   - \"Feel the texture of the cap (if using model/real mushroom). Is it smooth or bumpy?\"\n   - \"Look underneath the cap. What do you see? (The gills!) Do you see how they're arranged like lines? Draw what you see.\"\n   - \"Find the stem. What does it do? (Holds up the cap!)\"\n\n4. **Recording:** Students draw or label a simple mushroom diagram on their recording sheet, marking the cap, gills, and stem.\n\n5. **Key observation prompt:** \"Why do you think the gills are on the bottom of the cap? What might they do?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among pairs, asking open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Why do you think that part is shaped like that?\"\n- Guide observation without giving answers; encourage students to make their own discoveries\n- Model using magnifying glasses correctly\n- Ensure safe handling of any materials\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students draw or identify the three main parts of a mushroom\n- Students notice differences in texture and structure\n- Students propose ideas about function (e.g., \"The gills help the mushroom...\" or \"The stem holds it up\")\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain how mushroom structures help them survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled mushroom diagram\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Sentence frame poster: \"Mushrooms have _____ that help them _____.\"\n- Picture cards of mushrooms in different environments\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 3-4 pairs to share what they drew and discovered. Affirm observations.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** (write each word on the chart with a picture):\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Mushroom** | A living thing that grows in damp places and is not a plant or an animal |\n| **Cap** | The flat, umbrella-shaped top part that protects the gills |\n| **Gills** | Thin, ridged lines underneath the cap where the mushroom makes tiny seeds to create new mushrooms |\n| **Stem** | The stick-like part that holds up the cap and connects it to the soil |\n| **Fungi** (fun-jee) | A group of living things (like mushrooms) that breaks down dead leaves and helps soil |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Look at this mushroom in the grass. See the flat cap? It's shaped like an umbrella. Why is that helpful? (Protects the gills, collects water.)\"\n   - \"See how thin the stem is? It's strong but not thick. Why doesn't this mushroom need thick roots like plants? (It gets food from dead plant stuff in the soil, not from making its own food.)\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Use sentence frames: \"A mushroom's cap is shaped like _____ to help _____.\"\n   - Ask: \"Show me with your hands how big the gills are\" or \"Point to the part that holds it up\" (stem).\n   - Play \"Mushroom Parts\" game: Call out a body part; students point to it on the diagram.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Mushroom** — A living thing that grows in wet places and is not a plant\n- **Cap** — The flat top part of a mushroom\n- **Gills** — The bumpy/ridgy parts under the cap\n- **Stem** — The stick part that holds up the cap\n- **Fungi** — A group of living things that includes mushrooms\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name the three main mushroom parts\n- Students understand that mushroom parts help it survive in damp environments\n- Students recognize that mushrooms are living things, but different from plants and animals\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing how a mushroom's shape helps it survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Craft materials: paper cups, paper towel tubes, markers, tape, scissors\n- Paper plates or construction paper\n- Example of a model mushroom (teacher-made)\n- \"Mushroom Homes\" scenario sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario introduction:** \"Imagine we need to design a mushroom to live in a very wet, shady spot in the garden. How should we shape it? What parts do we need?\"\n\n2. **Design challenge:** \"Using your materials, build a mushroom that can survive in wet soil. Make sure it has:\n   - A cap (the flat part on top)\n   - A stem (so it stands up)\n   - A way to release seeds (gills or bumpy parts underneath)\"\n\n3. **Student task:**\n   - Students work in pairs or small groups\n   - Provide a simple template: \"My mushroom has a _____ cap to _____, a _____ stem to _____, and _____ underneath to _____.\"\n   - Students complete: \"My mushroom is built this way because _____.\"\n\n4. **Gallery walk (optional):** Display finished models; students observe classmates' designs.\n\n5. **Discussion:** \"Which mushroom design do you think would work best in wet soil? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide materials and ask guiding questions: \"What shape is best for holding water?\" \"How strong does the stem need to be?\"\n- Encourage students to explain *why* they made their choices\n- Model the design process: \"I made my cap flat because...\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students construct a mushroom model with recognizable parts\n- Students explain how their mushroom's shape helps it survive in a damp environment\n- Students make connections between structure and function\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of mushroom structures and how they help mushrooms survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Listen to student responses during Explore and Explain phases\n- Observe drawings and models for accurate identification of parts\n- Note explanations during group discussions and design activity\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment:**\nProvide 3 items (choose based on student needs):\n\n**Option 1: Drawing with labels**\n- \"Draw a mushroom. Label the cap, stem, and gills. Tell me one thing each part does to help the mushroom survive.\"\n\n**Option 2: Multiple choice (with picture support)**\n- \"Which part holds up the mushroom?\" (point to or circle: cap / stem / gills)\n- \"Where are the gills?\" (under the cap / on top / on the stem)\n- \"Why do mushrooms grow in wet places?\" (Read 2-3 options with pictures)\n\n**Option 3: Sentence completion**\n- \"A mushroom's cap is shaped like _____ to help _____.\"\n- \"The stem is _____ so the mushroom can _____.\"\n- \"Mushrooms are living things because they _____.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify and name 2-3 mushroom parts\n- ✓ Student explains why at least one part helps the mushroom (e.g., \"The cap keeps the gills safe\" or \"The stem holds it up\")\n- ✓ Student recognizes mushrooms are living organisms, different from plants and animals\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding through drawings, labels, and verbal explanations\n- Students show emerging ability to connect structure to function\n- Students can distinguish mushrooms from plants and animals based on observations\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified recording sheet:** Provide pre-drawn mushroom outline with blanks for students to match labels (cap, stem, gills) rather than draw\n   - Offer picture/word cards to sort into the correct categories\n   - Pair with a strong reader/observer during Explore phase\n\n2. **Concrete manipulatives:** Use actual mushroom (if available) or larger tactile model so students can physically touch and feel structures\n   - Ask yes/no questions instead of open-ended (\"Is the stem thick or thin?\")\n   - Use sentence frames for all verbal responses: \"The cap is _____. It helps the mushroom _____.\"\n\n3. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on cap, stem, and gills only; introduce \"fungi\" in context but don't require students to memorize it initially\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Deeper investigation:** Ask students to compare 2-3 different types of mushrooms (using images). \"How are these mushrooms the same? How are they different? Why might different mushrooms look different?\"\n   - Have them predict: \"Where do you think this mushroom lives? What does it need to survive there?\"\n\n2. **Extended design project:** \"Design a mushroom for a DIFFERENT environment (dry garden, dark closet, sunny windowsill). What would it need to look like? Draw and explain.\"\n\n3. **Decomposition inquiry:** Introduce that mushrooms help break down dead plants. \"If you left a dead leaf under a mushroom, what do you think would happen over time? Why?\"\n   - Provide observation journals for multi-day observation if feasible\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Mushroom hunt field walk:** (If school grounds have safe mushrooms, or take photos in advance)\n   - Take students outside to look for mushrooms in damp areas (after rain is ideal)\n   - Document with photos or drawings\n   - Discuss habitat: \"Why did we find it here and not in the sunny, dry area?\"\n   - **Safety note:** Teach \"Never touch or pick wild mushrooms without permission from an adult\"\n\n2. **Grow mushrooms (optional, if time/budget allows):**\n   - Use a simple mushroom growing kit (available online; follow package directions)\n   - Have students observe and record changes daily for 1-2 weeks\n   - Connect observation to life cycle: \"The mushroom grew from tiny seeds in the soil, just like plants grow from seeds\"\n\n3. **Story/picture book exploration:**\n   - Read age-appropriate books about fungi (e.g., *Mushrooms* by Gail Gibbons or *A Tree Is Nice* which mentions mushrooms)\n   - Have students draw their own \"Mushroom Story\" using the sentence frame: \"One day, a mushroom grew because _____. It had a _____ to help it _____.\"\n\n---\n\n## Connections to NGSS Performance Expectations\n\n**1-LS1-1** — This lesson emphasizes how the mushroom's external parts (cap, stem, gills) help it survive and meet its needs in a damp environment. The Elaborate phase directly addresses designing structures based on function.\n\n**1-LS3-1** — Through observation, students compare mushrooms to plants and animals, recognizing they are similar (all living) but not exactly the same (different structure and function).\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** If using real mushrooms, verify they are non-toxic and handle appropriately. Some species are fragile; consider using model mushrooms instead.\n- **Timing:** This lesson can be taught across two 40-minute periods (Engage/Explore on Day 1; Explain/Elaborate/Evaluate on Day 2) or in one extended session with a movement break between Explore and Explain.\n- **Accessibility:** Ensure magnifying glasses fit comfortably in small hands. Have images large and clearly visible for all learners.\n- **Prior knowledge:** This lesson assumes students have basic familiarity with plants and animals but may not have considered fungi as a separate group.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson brings the photograph to life by having students investigate, design, and apply their knowledge of mushroom structures and their survival function in real-world contexts.",
