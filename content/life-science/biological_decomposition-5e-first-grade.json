ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph while building curiosity about tree homes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the hollow tree (displayed on screen or printed large)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projected screen. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing think-pair-share time):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the big, dark opening in the tree?\"\n   - \"Why do you think there is a hole in this tree? What could live inside?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a tree like this? Where do you think an animal would want to live?\"\n   - \"If you were a small animal like a squirrel or owl, would you want to live in this tree? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder what animals might make a home inside this tree? Let's predict together!\" Record student predictions on chart paper with simple drawings or words.\n\n4. **Wonder question:** \"How do trees help animals stay safe and warm?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Today we're going to explore how trees are like homes for animals, just like houses are homes for us. Let's discover what animals need to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (23 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how trees provide shelter by building simple models and exploring natural materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small boxes or containers (one per student or pair)\n- Natural materials: twigs, leaves, bark pieces, moss, grass, small stones (collected beforehand or provided)\n- Tape or glue sticks\n- Chart paper titled \"What Animals Need in a Home\"\n- Photos of tree-dwelling animals (owl, squirrel, woodpecker, raccoon) – simple picture cards\n- Pencils and paper for recording observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Identifying Animal Needs (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Show pictures of tree-dwelling animals one at a time (owl, squirrel, woodpecker, raccoon).\n\n2. For each animal, ask:\n   - \"What do you think this animal needs to be safe?\"\n   - \"Where would it hide from cold weather or from animals that might hurt it?\"\n   - \"Why is a tree home better than being out in the open?\"\n\n3. Record student ideas on chart paper under headings: \"Protection,\" \"Warmth,\" \"Safety.\"\n\n**Part 2: Building a Tree Home Model (13 minutes)**\n\n1. Give each student or pair a small box or container and natural materials.\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Pretend your box is the inside of a tree trunk. Your job is to make it into a cozy home for a small animal.\"\n   - \"Use the twigs, leaves, bark, and grass to create a safe, warm shelter inside your box.\"\n   - \"Think about: Where would you put soft materials so an animal could be comfortable? Where would you put hard materials like twigs to make it strong?\"\n\n3. As students build, circulate and ask:\n   - \"Why did you choose that material?\"\n   - \"What animal do you think would live here?\"\n   - \"Is your home warm and safe? How do you know?\"\n\n4. Have students draw or label their model to show what materials they used and why.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions rather than providing answers.\n- Guide students to think about comfort, safety, and protection.\n- Encourage them to use a variety of materials, explaining their choices.\n- Take photos or sketch student models for documentation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create models that show understanding that animals need soft, protected spaces.\n- Students explain their material choices using simple language (\"The leaves are soft for sleeping,\" \"The bark keeps it dry\").\n- Students connect their models to the photograph of the actual tree.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect exploration to formal concepts about how external parts help animals survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Photograph of the hollow tree (displayed again)\n- Simple picture cards of animal body parts and tree parts\n- Student-created models from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3–4 students to show their tree home models and explain one material choice.\n   - Ask the class: \"How is their model like the tree in the photograph?\"\n   - Reinforce: \"Trees have special parts that help animals survive!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   Create a simple anchor chart with words, pictures, and definitions:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Shelter:** A safe, protected place where an animal can rest and hide from danger and bad weather.\n   - **Trunk:** The large, thick main part of a tree that provides strong protection and creates homes for animals.\n   - **Bark:** The hard outer layer of a tree that keeps the inside safe and dry for animals living inside.\n   - **Hollow:** An empty space inside something; in this tree, it creates a perfect room for an animal to live.\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy by having what you need (food, shelter, warmth, safety).\n\n3. **Connection to the photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to the hollow opening in the photo.\n   - \"This tree has a big, hollow space inside. See how dark it is? That darkness means it's protected. An owl or a raccoon could stay warm and safe inside this hollow.\"\n   - \"The thick bark and trunk protect the animal from rain, wind, and other animals.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"What word means a safe place for animals to live?\" (Shelter)\n   - Ask: \"What part of the tree keeps animals warm and dry?\" (Bark and trunk)\n   - Ask: \"Why is the hollow space in this tree good for an animal?\" (It's dark, safe, and protected)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use new vocabulary to describe how trees help animals.\n- Students point out the trunk, bark, and hollow space in the photograph.\n- Students explain that trees are shelters that help animals survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a solution to a problem using tree-like structures.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture of a real animal that needs a home (show a squirrel, owl, or other tree-dwelling animal)\n- Craft materials: paper bags, paper towel tubes, construction paper, tape, markers, natural materials (leaves, twigs)\n- Problem scenario card (teacher-made, with simple words and pictures)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Design Challenge: Create a Home for a Tree-Dwelling Animal**\n\n1. **Present the problem:** Show a picture of a specific animal (e.g., a squirrel or owl). \n   - \"This [animal name] needs a home in a tree. But the trees in the city don't have big hollow spaces like the tree in our photograph. How can we help this animal? Can you design a home that has the same external parts as a real tree – a trunk, bark, and a safe hollow space inside?\"\n\n2. **Design Process:**\n   - Students work individually or in pairs.\n   - Using craft materials, they design a simple artificial tree home that includes:\n     - A \"trunk\" (rolled paper bag or tube)\n     - \"Bark\" covering (brown construction paper or real bark pieces)\n     - An opening or hollow space where the animal could enter\n   - Students should label or draw the external parts they included.\n\n3. **Student Reflection:**\n   - \"What part of your design keeps the animal safe?\" (Bark, walls)\n   - \"What part of your design creates the hollow space?\" (Opening, interior)\n   - \"Why did you choose these materials?\"\n\n4. **Gallery Walk (optional):**\n   - Display designs around the room.\n   - Students observe others' designs and notice similarities and differences.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without solving the problem for students.\n- Ask questions: \"What does your animal need most – safety, warmth, or space?\"\n- Encourage experimentation and creative solutions.\n- Celebrate diverse approaches.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a functional shelter design that mimics key features of a tree (trunk, bark, hollow interior).\n- Students articulate how their design meets the animal's needs.\n- Students show understanding that external structures (like tree parts) help animals survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how trees provide shelter and how external parts help animals survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe and document student explanations during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Ask guiding questions and listen for use of vocabulary and connections to survival.\n- Review drawings and labels on student models.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5–7 minutes):**\n\nAdminister one of the following options:\n\n**Option A: Visual + Verbal (for emerging readers)**\n- Show the photograph of the hollow tree again.\n- Ask three questions (one at a time, allowing verbal responses):\n  1. \"What do you see in this tree that animals could use?\" (Listen for: hole, hollow, dark space, safe place)\n  2. \"How does this tree help an animal survive?\" (Listen for: shelter, protection, warmth, safe from danger)\n  3. \"What part of the tree keeps an animal safe?\" (Listen for: bark, trunk, walls)\n\n**Option B: Simple Written/Drawn Response**\n- Provide a worksheet with one sentence frame and a drawing space:\n  - \"A tree helps an animal survive by _______________________.\"\n  - \"Draw an animal that could live in a tree home.\"\n- Accept drawings, words, or a combination.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Developing:** Student identifies that trees have holes or hollow spaces.\n- **Proficient:** Student explains that trees provide shelter and keep animals safe.\n- **Advanced:** Student explains how specific external parts of a tree (trunk, bark, hollow space) help an animal meet its needs for safety and protection.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that trees provide shelter for animals.\n- Students identify and name external parts of trees that help animals survive.\n- Students explain, in first-grade language, why animals need and use trees as homes.\n- Students apply this concept to design simple structures that mimic tree features.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visuals:** Use only 2–3 vocabulary words (shelter, trunk, bark) with consistent pictures. Repeat these words frequently throughout the lesson.\n\n2. **Guided model-building:** Provide a partially pre-made container with one or two materials already inside. Ask the student to add one more material and explain why. Scaffold with sentence starters: \"I chose _____ because it is _____.\"\n\n3. **Reduce design complexity in Elaborate:** Instead of designing a full structure, provide a pre-made paper tube and ask the student to cover it with bark and cut a small hole for the animal entrance. Focus on the concept of external parts rather than independent design.\n\n4. **Peer partnerships:** Pair with a confident peer who can model language and thinking.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extended design challenge:** Ask students to design a tree home for TWO different animals and explain how each animal's needs might be different. For example, \"A small mouse needs a tiny hole, but a raccoon needs a bigger opening.\"\n\n2. **Research and compare:** Provide picture cards or simple texts about different tree-dwelling animals (woodpecker, owl, squirrel, bat). Ask students to sort animals by the type of tree home they would need and create a chart: \"Who lives where and why?\"\n\n3. **Problem-solving extension:** Present a scenario: \"What if a tree loses all its bark? How does that change whether an animal can live there?\" Ask students to explain or draw their thinking.\n\n4. **Construct a larger collaborative tree:** Invite advanced students to help build a life-size or large-scale tree model for the classroom using paper tubes, brown paper, leaves, and other materials. They can problem-solve how to make it sturdy and safe for smaller animals to explore.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Virtual Tree Home Hunt:**\n   - Show photos of different trees (real images or illustrated) with and without holes or hollow spaces.\n   - Ask students to predict which trees might be homes for animals and why.\n   - Read aloud a simple book about tree homes (e.g., *In a Tree* by Ellen Stoll Walsh or *The Tree House* by Jan Lööf) and identify which trees the characters live in and why.\n\n2. **Outdoor Tree Observation:**\n   - Take students on a short nature walk around the school or neighborhood.\n   - Have them look for real trees with holes, hollow spaces, or interesting bark.\n   - Collect safe materials (fallen bark, twigs, leaves) and have students create a nature collage representing \"tree homes.\"\n   - Document observations with photos or simple sketches for a class \"Tree Home Book.\"\n\n3. **Interview and Share:**\n   - Invite a parent, school custodian, or community member who works with plants or animals (e.g., a groundskeeper, wildlife educator, veterinary tech) to share photos or stories about animals that live in trees.\n   - Have students prepare 1–2 questions in advance (with teacher help): \"What animals live in trees? How do trees help them survive?\"\n   - Have students draw or write about what they learned after the interview.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
