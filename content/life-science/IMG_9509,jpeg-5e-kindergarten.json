Observe and describe what a young plant needs to grow (soil, water, light).\n2. Identify the basic parts of a plant (roots, stem, leaves) and describe what each part does.\n3. Explain that plants grow from seeds and change over time.\n4. Use observations to predict what happens when plants get the things they need.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (or digital display on screen/smartboard) of the seedling in mulch\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around printed copies so all students can see clearly. Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see?\"\n\n2. **Ask these specific Kindergarten-level discussion questions:**\n   - \"What is the green thing in the middle of this picture?\" (Guide them to say: a plant or baby plant)\n   - \"What is all that dark, crumbly stuff around it?\" (Soil, dirt, mulch—accept all answers)\n   - \"Why do you think the green plant is sitting in that dark stuff?\" (Encourage thinking about roots and growing)\n   - \"Have you ever planted a seed before? What did you do?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... if we planted a seed in soil and gave it water and sunlight, what would happen? Do you think a tiny seed could grow into a big plant like the ones in our school garden?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper titled \"What We Think Will Happen to Seeds.\" Accept all ideas without judgment.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an experiment! We're going to plant our own seeds and watch what happens, just like the seed in this picture grew.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small paper cups (one per student, labeled with their name)\n- Potting soil or garden soil in a bin\n- Bean seeds (pinto or lima beans work best for K—large and easy to handle)\n- Water in a spray bottle or small watering can\n- Markers or labels\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Newspaper or plastic tablecloths to protect work surfaces\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Prepare the workspace:** Cover tables with newspaper. Place soil bin, seeds, cups, and water in accessible locations. Show students the photograph again and say: \"See how the plant is sitting in soil? We're going to make a home for our seeds just like this.\"\n\n2. **Step-by-step student directions:**\n   - \"Take a cup and find your name on it. That's your plant's home!\"\n   - \"Use your hands to scoop soil into your cup. Fill it almost to the top, but leave a little space.\"\n   - \"Make a small hole in the soil with your finger—about as deep as your thumb.\"\n   - \"Drop one seed into the hole and cover it gently with soil.\"\n   - \"Spray or sprinkle water on the soil until it's damp, but not soaking wet.\"\n   - \"Put your cup in the sunny window where we can watch it grow.\"\n\n3. **Connection to photograph:** As students work, point out: \"See? Just like in the picture, our seeds are going into soil. The soil will give the seed food. Water will help it grow. And the sun will give it energy.\"\n\n4. **Documentation:** Have students draw a picture of their planted seed on a worksheet or in a science journal (stick figures and simple pictures are perfect). They can label it: \"My seed in soil.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What does your seed feel like? Why do you think we're putting it in soil? What does the seed need?\"\n- Avoid saying \"right\" or \"wrong\"—instead, encourage observation with phrases like: \"Tell me what you notice...\" or \"What do you think the soil will do for the seed?\"\n- Help students who struggle with fine motor skills (scooping, planting) while allowing independence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each student plants one seed in soil.\n- Students observe and describe what they see: the seed, the soil, the water.\n- Students create a simple visual record of their planting.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Students' planted cups\n- Picture cards or real examples (if available): bean plant roots, a leaf, a stem (optional but helpful)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather students in a circle where they can see the photograph. Ask: \"What did you do when you planted your seed?\" Call on 4-5 students to share one thing they did or observed. Affirm each response: \"Yes! You put soil in your cup. You gave it water. Those are things plants need!\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with Kindergarten-friendly definitions:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Seed:** A tiny package that has a baby plant inside. When it gets soil, water, and sun, it can grow into a big plant.\n   - **Roots:** The parts of a plant that grow down into the soil. They drink water and hold the plant in the ground.\n   - **Leaves:** The green parts of a plant that catch sunlight. They help the plant make food.\n   - **Soil:** The dark, crumbly stuff plants grow in. It gives plants food and water.\n   - **Grow:** When something gets bigger and changes over time.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:** Point to the seedling in the picture. \"See the green leaves at the top? Those catch sunlight. See how it's sitting in soil? Those roots (point) go down into the soil to drink water. In a few weeks, your seeds will look like this one!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:** Ask simple yes/no and \"what\" questions:\n   - \"Do plants need soil?\" (Yes)\n   - \"What do roots do?\" (Drink water / hold the plant in the ground)\n   - \"Where do the leaves get energy?\" (From the sun)\n   - Observe student responses and body language. If a student seems confused, rephrase and use the photograph or their cup as a reference.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can repeat or recognize the vocabulary terms when you say them.\n- Students can point to parts of a plant and say what they do.\n- Students understand that seeds, soil, water, and sun are all important for plants.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Drawing paper or science journal pages\n- Colored pencils, crayons, or markers\n- Optional: Sentence frame poster: \"A plant needs _______ to grow.\"\n- Real leaf samples (from school garden or brought from home) to touch and observe\n- Photograph displayed\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario-based application:** Say: \"Let's pretend we have a seed, but we forget to give it water. Or we plant it in a dark closet instead of the sunny window. What do you think will happen?\" Take predictions. Explain: \"Plants are living things. They need specific things to survive and grow, just like you need food, water, and sleep.\"\n\n2. **Choice activity—Pick one based on your class:**\n\n   **Option A (Drawing & Recording):**\n   - Give each student paper divided into two sections: \"What a Plant Needs\" and \"What Happens When It Grows.\"\n   - In the first section, students draw or write (with your help) three things plants need: soil, water, and sun. Teacher can draw simple icons or provide picture cards to glue.\n   - In the second section, students draw what they think their seed will look like in 2 weeks (small plant with leaves).\n\n   **Option B (Sensory Exploration & Discussion):**\n   - Pass around a real leaf (or several). Let students touch, smell, and observe it carefully.\n   - Ask: \"What color is it? How does it feel? Why do you think plants have leaves?\" \n   - Compare the real leaf to the leaves in the photograph.\n   - Have students create a leaf rubbing: place paper over a leaf, rub with crayon to capture the leaf pattern.\n\n3. **Apply to real-world context:** Point to any plants in your classroom or visible through the window. \"These plants are growing right now because they have what they need. Our seeds will grow too if we remember to take care of them.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate small group discussions while students work.\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why do you think the plant has green leaves?\" \"What would happen if we never watered it?\"\n- Scribe for students who cannot write yet; let them dictate their ideas.\n- Celebrate observations and creative thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create visual or written records showing what plants need.\n- Students make predictions about plant growth.\n- Students connect the photograph to a real plant in the classroom.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant needs and life cycle concepts.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe students during the Explore phase: Can they follow multi-step directions? Do they handle the seed and soil carefully?\n- Listen to student language during Explain and Elaborate: Do they use vocabulary (seed, soil, roots, leaves)?\n- Review drawings and journal entries: Do they show understanding that plants have parts and need soil/water/sun?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes):**\n\nUse **one of these strategies** based on your class:\n\n**Strategy 1: Picture-Based Sorting (Non-reader friendly)**\n- Show students three large picture cards:\n  - Picture 1: Soil, water, sun\n  - Picture 2: A seed in darkness with no water\n  - Picture 3: A growing plant with leaves\n- Ask: \"Which picture shows what a seed needs to grow?\" (Picture 1)\n- \"Which picture shows what happens when a seed doesn't get what it needs?\" (Picture 2)\n- Observe which students can correctly identify.\n\n**Strategy 2: Oral Interview (Individual)**\n- Pull aside 3-4 students at a time and ask:\n  - \"Where did you plant your seed?\" (In soil)\n  - \"What does your seed need to grow?\" (Water, sun, soil)\n  - \"What do you think will happen in two weeks?\" (It will grow into a plant with leaves)\n- Record yes/no responses on a simple checklist.\n\n**Strategy 3: Drawing Explanation (All students)**\n- Say: \"Draw a picture of your seed. Show everything it needs to grow.\"\n- Students draw (with your scribe help if needed).\n- Ask each student to tell you one thing their seed needs.\n- Record on their paper: \"_____ needs ________ to grow.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Student can identify at least **two things plants need** (e.g., soil and water; water and sun).\n\n✓ Student can **name at least one plant part** and describe what it does (e.g., \"Roots drink water\").\n\n✓ Student demonstrates understanding that **seeds grow into plants** (through drawing, prediction, or verbal explanation).\n\n✓ Student **follows planting directions** and cares for their seed appropriately.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most Kindergarteners will be able to identify soil and water as plant needs.\n- Many will understand that seeds grow into plants.\n- All students will have planted a seed and begun observing growth over the coming weeks.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners):\n\n1. **Pair with a buddy:** Team a student who struggles with fine motor skills with a peer or aide during the Explore phase. One plants while the other watches and describes; then they switch.\n\n2. **Vocabulary repetition and visuals:** Use the photograph and real objects (seed, soil, leaf) repeatedly. Create a \"Plant Needs\" poster with pictures (not just words) showing soil, water, and sun. Point to it often.\n\n3. **Simplified assess:** During evaluation, ask yes/no questions instead of open-ended: \"Does a plant need water?\" rather than \"What does a plant need?\" Allow pointing to pictures instead of drawing.\n\n4. **Extra sensory exploration:** Let students touch soil, smell soil, feel a seed multiple times. Sensory input helps cement understanding for struggling learners.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners):\n\n1. **Deeper observation:** Ask advanced students to make detailed predictions in a journal: \"Draw what you think will happen to the seed in 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks.\" Encourage them to predict root growth below the soil and more leaves above.\n\n2. **Life cycle sequencing:** Provide a series of pictures showing a seed → sprouting → seedling → mature plant. Ask students to arrange them in order and explain what's happening at each stage.\n\n3. **Comparative investigation:** Give advanced students two cups: one with soil and water, one with water only. Ask: \"Which seed will grow better? Why?\" Over weeks, they observe and record differences, discovering that soil is necessary for sustained growth.\n\n4. **Research and share:** Invite advanced students to find pictures of different seeds (acorn, sunflower, pumpkin) and share with the class: \"All these are seeds. They all grow into plants!\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Plant Growth Journal (Multi-week):**\n   - Have students observe and draw their planted seed weekly for 4-6 weeks.\n   - Create a class book titled \"From Seed to Plant\" with each student's weekly illustrations.\n   - Display in the library or hallway. Families love seeing plant growth over time!\n   - This extends K-LS1-1 by having students document patterns of what plants need as they observe growth.\n\n2. **Classroom Garden Observation Walk:**\n   - Take students to a school garden, playground plants, or natural area.\n   - Point out living plants and ask: \"What do you think this plant is getting from the soil? From the sun? Where are its roots?\"\n   - Have students collect fallen leaves safely and bring them back to examine.\n   - Connects learning to real-world ecosystems and reinforces that plants are everywhere.\n\n3. **Seed Sorting & Classification:**\n   - Bring various seeds to the classroom: beans, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, birdseed.\n   - Let students sort by color, size, or texture.\n   - Plant a few different kinds and compare growth rates over weeks.\n   - This introduces the idea that different plants have different needs and grow at different speeds—extending observation skills.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Success\n\n- **Timing flexibility:** If your school has shorter attention spans, split this into three 30-minute sessions across different days rather than one 90-minute block.\n- **Photo reference:** Keep the original photograph displayed throughout the unit so students continually reference it as their plants grow.\n- **Weekly check-ins:** Every few days, gather students around the planted cups. Ask: \"What do you notice? Has anything changed? What do you think is happening underground?\" This keeps the learning alive.\n- **Real-world connection:** If your school has a garden or outdoor space, connect this lesson to outdoor plant observations. Show students that the concepts they're learning apply to all plants around them.",
