ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal structures and survival using the lizard photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the green lizard on rock\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Do not provide a title or explanation yet.\n\n2. **Launch with a mystery question:** \"This animal lives on rocky cliffs and needs to hide from predators. Look carefully at the picture. What do you notice about its body that might help it stay safe?\" Allow 30 seconds of silent observation, then invite students to turn and talk to a partner.\n\n3. **Facilitate a whole-group discussion** with these specific questions (pause 10-15 seconds after each for thinking time):\n   - \"What colors do you see on this animal? Why might those colors be useful where it lives?\"\n   - \"Look at the animal's eye. Where is it positioned on its head? Why do you think it's placed there?\"\n   - \"Can you see the nostrils (nose holes) and the bumpy area where its ear might be? What information might these body parts help the animal gather?\"\n   - \"What is different about this animal's skin compared to your skin?\"\n\n4. **Record student observations** on chart paper under two headings:\n   - \"Body Structures We See\"\n   - \"How They Might Help the Animal\"\n   \n   Do not correct student ideas yet; this activates prior knowledge.\n\n5. **Prediction prompt:** \"This lizard uses its eyes, nose, and ears to sense danger or find food. How do you think it decides what to do next? What does it do when it detects something?\" Write predictions on the chart to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate how this lizard's body structures work together with its senses to keep it alive. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how sensory input and body structures function together to support survival behavior.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copies of the lizard photograph (one per pair or small group)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Magnifying glasses (optional, but recommended)\n- \"Lizard Senses Lab Sheet\" handout (see template below)\n- Chart paper for recording observations\n- Small objects: a piece of food (raisin or cereal), a scent item (lemon or mint scent), a sound maker (bell or clicker)\n- Blindfold (or students can close their eyes)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Sensory Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into pairs.** Give each pair a copy of the lizard photo and a magnifying glass.\n\n2. **Direct students to examine the photo closely** and complete the \"Lizard Senses Lab Sheet\" by:\n   - Drawing arrows from each sense organ (eye, nostril, ear area) on a copy of the lizard's head\n   - Labeling what each structure senses (light/sight, smell, sound)\n   - Writing or drawing what information each sense might gather (e.g., \"Eye senses: Is there movement? Is a predator coming? Can I find food?\")\n\n3. **Circulate and ask guiding questions** (do not provide answers):\n   - \"What do you think this structure does?\"\n   - \"What information would be important for this lizard to know to stay safe?\"\n   - \"Why is the position of the eye helpful?\"\n\n**Part B: Human Senses Simulation (10 minutes)**\n\n4. **Transition to a whole-group activity.** Explain: \"Let's experience how senses help animals respond to their world. We'll be like the lizard, gathering information through our senses.\"\n\n5. **Conduct three brief sensory simulations:**\n\n   **Simulation 1 — Sight (3 minutes):**\n   - Show students a raisin or small object. Ask: \"What information does my eye give me about this?\" (color, size, shape, movement)\n   - Have students close their eyes and try to identify an object by touch only. Ask: \"What information are you missing without your eyes?\"\n\n   **Simulation 2 — Smell (3 minutes):**\n   - Hold up a lemon or mint scent item. Ask: \"What does my nose tell me about this? Why would a lizard need to smell?\"\n   - Explain: \"A lizard's nose helps it find food and detect if danger is near.\"\n\n   **Simulation 3 — Hearing (4 minutes):**\n   - Make a soft sound with a bell or clicker. Ask: \"What does my ear tell me? Is the sound close or far? Is it a threat?\"\n   - Have students close their eyes and identify the direction a sound is coming from. Ask: \"Why would this be important for a lizard?\"\n\n6. **Guide students to record observations** on the lab sheet: \"After experiencing these senses, what do you think the lizard's brain does with all this information?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate careful observation without directing conclusions.\n- Ask questions that prompt thinking, such as: \"What happens next after the lizard sees something?\" or \"How does the lizard decide to run or stay still?\"\n- Encourage students to use evidence from their observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify at least three external structures (eye, nostril, ear) and their sensory functions.\n- Students recognize that sensory information helps animals respond to their environment.\n- Students begin connecting structures to survival behaviors (hiding, hunting, detecting threats).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student exploration to scientific concepts about structures, senses, and animal behavior.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Vocabulary cards with images\n- Enlarged diagram of lizard head (printed or drawn on chart paper)\n- Video clip (optional): \"How Animal Senses Work\" (2-3 minutes from reputable source like PBS Learning Media or National Geographic Kids)\n- Student notebooks or response sheets\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share out from Explore phase (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 pairs to share their observations from the lab sheet.\n   - Display their labeled diagrams on a bulletin board.\n   - Ask the group: \"What was similar in all your diagrams? What surprised you?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   \n   Display and define each term using the enlarged lizard diagram as reference:\n\n   - **External Structures:** Body parts on the outside of an animal that help it survive. (Point to the scales, eye, nostrils, tail on the diagram.) \"These are like tools the animal uses.\"\n   \n   - **Sensory Organs:** Special body parts that collect information about the world. (Point to eye, nostrils, and ear area.) \"The eye sees light, the nose smells, the ear hears. These send messages to the brain.\"\n   \n   - **Stimulus:** Something in the environment that an animal detects with its senses. (Example: \"A shadow moving across a rock is a stimulus the lizard sees.\")\n   \n   - **Response:** What an animal does after its brain processes sensory information. (Example: \"If the lizard sees a shadow, it might stay very still or run away. That's the response.\")\n   \n   - **Camouflage:** Colors, patterns, or shapes that help an animal blend with its surroundings. (Point to the green color.) \"This lizard's green color is camouflage. It helps the animal hide from predators.\"\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Let's say a hawk is flying above this lizard's rock. The lizard's **eye** (sensory organ) **sees** the shadow (stimulus). Its **brain** processes this danger. What **response** does it have? Should it stay still and use its **camouflage**, or should it run?\" \n   - Have students discuss in pairs, then share responses.\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Who can show me a sensory organ on this lizard and tell me what information it gathers?\"\n   - Ask: \"Can you give an example of a stimulus a lizard might experience and how it would respond?\"\n   - Listen for use of vocabulary and understanding of the stimulus-response connection.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Chart (Display and keep posted throughout unit):**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition | Example from the Lizard |\n|------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| **External Structure** | A body part on the outside of an animal that helps it survive | Scales, eye, nostrils, tail |\n| **Sensory Organ** | A body part that gathers information from the world | Eyes (see), nose (smell), ears (hear) |\n| **Stimulus** | Something the animal detects with its senses | Movement, smell of food, sound |\n| **Response** | What the animal does after sensing something | Run away, stay still, hunt |\n| **Camouflage** | Colors or patterns that help an animal hide | Green and yellow scales that match rocks |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use vocabulary to describe the lizard's structures and behaviors.\n- Students understand the connection: Stimulus → Sensory Organ → Brain → Response.\n- Students recognize that multiple structures work together for survival.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of sensory structures and responses to a new animal scenario and design their own survival challenge.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards or slips of paper\n- Colored pencils, markers\n- Large paper for sketching\n- \"Animal Challenge Cards\" (pre-made with descriptions of different animals and environments)\n- Rulers (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Animal Senses Detective (9 minutes)**\n\n1. **Present a new scenario:** \"Scientists discovered a new creature living in a dark cave. The creature cannot use its eyes because it's too dark. What senses would be most important for this animal to survive? What external structures might it have?\"\n\n2. **Provide \"Animal Challenge Cards\"** describing fictional or real animals in different environments:\n   - Card 1: A fish living in murky river water\n   - Card 2: A desert snake that hunts at night\n   - Card 3: A bird looking for seeds in tall grass\n   - Card 4: An animal living in a busy, noisy forest\n\n3. **Assign each pair or small group one card.** Direct them to discuss and record:\n   - Which senses would be most important for this animal?\n   - What external structures would help it sense its environment?\n   - What kinds of responses might it have? (How would it behave?)\n\n4. **Circulate and prompt thinking:**\n   - \"Why would this sense be more important than another in this environment?\"\n   - \"What structure would help the animal do this?\"\n   - \"What would happen if the animal's stimulus was detected? How would it respond?\"\n\n**Part B: Design a Survival Challenge (9 minutes)**\n\n5. **Introduce the design challenge:** \"Now you're going to create your own animal that has the perfect senses and structures to survive in a specific place.\"\n\n6. **Give each student a scenario card:**\n   - \"You live in a very wet, swampy place where it's hard to see far. Design an animal that could survive here.\"\n   - \"You live on a sunny, open beach with lots of wind. Design an animal that could survive here.\"\n   - \"You live in a dense forest where many predators hunt by smell. Design an animal that could survive here.\"\n\n7. **Direct students to draw or sketch their animal and label:**\n   - At least three external structures (with labels)\n   - At least two sensory organs (with labels explaining what they sense)\n   - One example of a stimulus the animal might experience and how it would respond\n\n8. **Have students write or dictate a short caption:** \"This animal survives in _____ because it has _____ (structure) that helps it sense _____ (stimulus) and respond by _____ (response).\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate brainstorming and question-asking rather than providing answers.\n- Encourage students to reference the photograph of the lizard or the vocabulary chart when stuck.\n- Validate creative thinking while grounding it in scientific reasoning: \"Why would that structure help in that environment?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design an animal with realistic sensory structures adapted to an environment.\n- Students use evidence-based reasoning to connect structures, senses, and survival.\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding by applying concepts to a novel scenario.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how animal structures and senses support survival and behavior.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n- Observation of pair discussions during Explore phase (Are students making sensory-structure-response connections?)\n- Questioning during Explain phase (Can students define and apply vocabulary?)\n- Review of Elaborate drawings and written explanations (Are students reasoning scientifically about structure-function relationships?)\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (end of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a response sheet containing this assessment. Students may respond with words, drawings, or both.\n\n**Exit Ticket Prompt:**\n\nLook at the photograph of the green lizard one more time.\n\n**Question 1:** \"Name two external structures you can see on this lizard. For each one, explain how it helps the lizard survive.\"\n\n**Question 2:** \"A lizard is resting on a rock when it hears a snake slithering nearby. Describe what happens using these words: stimulus, sensory organ, response.\"\n\n**Question 3:** \"Why is the green color of this lizard's skin important for its survival?\"\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria (What does mastery look like?):**\n\n✓ **Question 1:** Student correctly identifies two structures (eye, nostril, ear, scales, tail, etc.) and explains a realistic survival function for each (e.g., \"The eye helps the lizard see predators coming\" or \"The scales protect the lizard's skin\").\n\n✓ **Question 2:** Student uses at least two of the vocabulary terms correctly in a logical sequence: \"The stimulus is the sound of the snake. The lizard's ear [sensory organ] hears it. The lizard's response is to run away/hide.\"\n\n✓ **Question 3:** Student explains that green color helps the lizard hide or blend in with rocks and plants (camouflage/survival concept).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- All students can identify at least one external structure and its survival function.\n- Most students (80%) can describe a stimulus-response connection using appropriate vocabulary.\n- All students understand that animal structures and senses are related to survival.\n- Advanced students elaborate on multiple structures working together or explain the role of camouflage.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary and Sentence Frames:**\n   - Provide a word bank with images for the exit ticket: \"stimulus,\" \"sensory organ,\" \"response,\" \"external structure.\"\n   - Offer sentence starters: \"The lizard's eye helps it because _____.\" \"When the lizard sees movement, it _____.\"\n   - Allow students to answer Question 2 with a simple drawing instead of words (draw the stimulus, draw the sensory organ, draw the response).\n\n2. **Reduced Task Complexity During Elaborate:**\n   - Instead of designing a new animal, have the student compare the lizard to a familiar animal (rabbit, dog) and identify which senses are most important for each.\n   - Provide a partially completed diagram of an animal with some structures labeled; student completes it.\n   - Use a simpler scenario: \"This animal lives in the grass. What would it need to see and hear?\"\n\n3. **Hands-On Anchor Activity:**\n   - Create a tactile sensory station: students can touch models or images of different textures (scales, smooth skin, fur) and discuss which would protect an animal in a rocky habitat.\n   - Use a real lizard or high-quality video footage for repeated viewing and observation.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Design Task:**\n   - Ask students to design an animal for a *complex* habitat with multiple challenges (e.g., \"This animal must survive in a dark cave AND avoid being eaten by predators AND find food at night\").\n   - Require them to identify 4-5 structures and explain trade-offs: \"This animal has large ears to hear well, but they use a lot of energy. What other adaptations help it survive?\"\n   - Have them research a real animal and present how its actual structures match environmental demands.\n\n2. **Research and Explanation:**\n   - Ask: \"How is the green lizard's camouflage different from other animals' camouflage?\" (e.g., octopus color-changing, polar bear white fur). Have students research and compare.\n   - Challenge them to explain: \"If the lizard's brain processes sensory information, what do you think the brain is made of? How does it send signals to the body to make it respond?\"\n   - Provide articles on animal adaptation and ask them to identify stimulus-response cycles in nature.\n\n3. **Create a Teaching Tool:**\n   - Ask advanced students to create a \"Sensory Field Guide\" for 3-4 animals, complete with labeled diagrams, vocabulary, and real-world examples.\n   - Have them design a classroom poster or digital presentation explaining how a specific animal's structures help it survive.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Lizard Habitat Diorama:**\n   - Students build a small habitat box (shoebox) for the green lizard using rocks, sand, and plants.\n   - They label the sensory organs on a small lizard cutout placed in the diorama.\n   - They write labels identifying stimuli present in the habitat (predators, food sources, shelter) and explain how the lizard's senses would help it respond.\n   - This connects structures to real-world application and provides creative, kinesthetic learning.\n\n2. **Comparative Senses Chart — \"Whose Senses Are Best?\"**\n   - Create a class chart comparing sensory abilities across animals: lizards, snakes, birds, fish, insects.\n   - For each animal, research and record which senses are most developed and why.\n   - Example: \"Snakes have poor eyesight but excellent heat-sensing pits. This helps them hunt in the dark.\"\n   - Students present findings and discuss how different animals are adapted to different environments.\n   - This extends understanding to biodiversity and adaptation.\n\n3. **Sensory Simulation Game — \"Lizard's Day\":**\n   - Create a classroom game board or digital simulation where students role-play as a lizard navigating its day.\n   - Each space on the board presents a stimulus (shadow overhead, smell of food, sound of predator).\n   - Students must describe the sensory organ involved and the likely response.\n   - Introduce obstacles (the lizard's eye is blocked by sand, the lizard's nose is closed) and ask: \"What happens now? How does it survive with limited senses?\"\n   - This reinforces stimulus-response and structure-function relationships in an engaging, game-based format.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Notes for Teachers\n\n**Why This Lesson Works:**\n- The lizard photograph is visually rich and contains clear evidence of external structures with obvious survival value.\n- Fourth graders can observe and infer without needing molecular-level biology.\n- The 5E model scaffolds understanding from observation → exploration → vocabulary → application.\n- The stimulus-response framework is developmentally appropriate and connects sensory structures to animal behavior (addressing both NGSS standards).\n\n**Common Student Misconceptions to Address:**\n- *\"The lizard's color is just pretty.\"* → Emphasize that green color helps the lizard hide (function, not decoration).\n- *\"The lizard thinks about what to do.\"* → Clarify: The brain processes sensory information, but the response is mostly automatic (the lizard doesn't \"choose\").\n- *\"All animals need all five senses equally.\"* → Highlight that animals have different sensory needs based on their environment.\n\n**Connections to Other Standards:**\n- This lesson pairs well with 3-LS4-2 (adaptations and survival advantages) if you want to extend into Grade 3 concepts.\n- It naturally connects to 4-LS1-1 (internal structures support functions), which could be explored in future lessons on skeletal systems or digestion.",
