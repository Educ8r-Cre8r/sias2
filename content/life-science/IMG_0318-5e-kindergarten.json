Identify three things a bird needs to survive (food, water, shelter).\n2. Describe one body part of a bird and explain what it helps the bird do.\n3. Observe a photograph and discuss what the bird in the picture might need in its habitat.\n4. Sort pictures or objects into categories: \"Food,\" \"Water,\" and \"Shelter.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about birds and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, printed or projected photograph of the bird (IMG_0318.jpg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pointer or stick\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or show the large bird photograph on the board. Give students 30 seconds to look without talking.\n\n2. **Spark Wonder with Questions:**\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? What is it doing?\"\n   - \"Look at the bird's beak. Why do you think it has a beak that looks like that?\"\n   - \"The bird is sitting on the ground with sticks and dirt around it. What might it be looking for here?\"\n   - \"What do you think this bird needs to be happy and healthy, just like you need food, water, and a cozy place to sleep?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Turn and talk to a friend: If this bird lived near your house, what would it need to find to stay alive? Think about what YOU need every day.\"\n\n4. **Chart Student Ideas:** Record student responses on chart paper under the title \"What Do Birds Need?\" (Responses might include: food, water, a place to sleep, a nest, etc.)\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Now we're going to be bird detectives and explore what birds really need to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate bird survival needs through hands-on exploration and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bird habitat setup (or pictures/video of bird habitats):\n  - Small container/tray with soil, sticks, leaves, pebbles\n  - Bowl with water\n  - Small seeds or crackers\n  - Magnifying glasses (optional but helpful)\n- Picture cards showing: seeds, berries, worms, water, grass, branches, holes in trees, nests\n- Chart or worksheet with three columns labeled with pictures: \"Food,\" \"Water,\" \"Shelter\"\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Glue sticks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set Up Stations (or use one demonstration table):**\n   - **Station 1 – Food Hunt:** Students observe seeds, crackers, and pictures of food birds eat. They pick up (or point to) items a bird might eat.\n   - **Station 2 – Water Station:** Students look at the water bowl and discuss how birds drink and splash in water.\n   - **Station 3 – Shelter Exploration:** Students examine the habitat tray with sticks and leaves; discuss where a bird might hide, rest, or build a nest.\n\n2. **Student Investigation Steps:**\n   - In small groups, rotate through stations (or observe as a class).\n   - At each station, students pick up or observe one item and answer: \"Is this something a bird needs to survive?\"\n   - Students draw or place a picture card into the matching column on their \"What Birds Need\" chart.\n\n3. **Observation Prompts (Teacher asks as students explore):**\n   - \"Can you find something soft that might make a good nest?\"\n   - \"Show me something a bird might eat with its beak.\"\n   - \"Point to where water is. Why do birds need water?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"Why do you think the bird needs that?\"\n- Use think-aloud: \"I notice this stick is long and thin—I wonder if a bird could use it to build something?\"\n- Encourage students to touch, observe, and make predictions without correcting.\n- Avoid saying \"right\" or \"wrong\"; instead say, \"That's an interesting idea! What made you think of that?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify at least 2–3 items as things birds need.\n- Students physically manipulate and observe materials in a habitat.\n- Students begin connecting body parts (like the beak) to how birds use items.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and solidify understanding using observations from Explore.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with three labeled columns: \"FOOD,\" \"WATER,\" \"SHELTER\"\n- Picture cards of: seeds, worms, berries, water, nest, hole in tree, branches\n- The original bird photograph (large, visible to all)\n- Marker\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather for Group Share-Out (5–7 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you find at each station? Show us what a bird might eat / drink from / hide in.\"\n   - Have 3–4 volunteers place or tape their picture cards onto the correct category column on the chart.\n   - Teacher verbally affirms and adds any missing items (e.g., \"Yes! Birds eat seeds AND insects called worms\").\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary with Visuals (5–7 minutes):**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Food:** Anything a bird eats to stay strong and healthy. (Show picture of seeds, worms, berries. Gesture to the bird's beak in the photograph: \"The bird uses its beak to pick up food from the ground.\")\n   - **Water:** A liquid birds drink to stay healthy. (Show water picture/bowl: \"Birds drink water and also splash in it to stay cool and clean.\")\n   - **Shelter:** A safe place where a bird can rest, hide, and build a nest. (Point to sticks and trees in the photograph: \"This bird's shelter is made from twigs, leaves, and holes in trees.\")\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs. (Point to the photograph: \"This rocky, stick-covered ground is a bird's habitat.\")\n   - **Beak:** A bird's special mouth part shaped to help it pick up and eat food. (Point to the bird's beak in the photo: \"See how this beak is small and pointed? Perfect for picking up tiny seeds!\")\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (3–5 minutes):**\n   - Reshow the bird photograph.\n   - Ask: \"Now that we know what birds need, point to something in this picture that the bird can eat. Point to where it might find water. Where could it hide or sleep?\"\n   - Use a pointer to highlight: the ground (food sources), any water visible or implied nearby, sticks and soil for shelter.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - **Thumbs-Up/Middle/Down:** \"If you think you know what birds need to survive, show thumbs up.\"\n   - **Repeat-After-Me:** \"Birds need three things: food, water, and shelter. Say it with me!\"\n   - **Quick Question:** Hold up pictures one at a time and ask, \"Is this food? Water? Shelter?\" (Students answer with thumbs or verbal response.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Food:** Things birds eat to stay healthy and strong.\n- **Water:** The liquid birds drink and bathe in.\n- **Shelter:** A safe, cozy place where birds rest and hide.\n- **Habitat:** The home where animals live and find food, water, and shelter.\n- **Beak:** A bird's special mouth part used to pick up and eat food.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and describe the three things birds need.\n- Students understand that the bird's body parts (like the beak) help it survive in its habitat.\n- Students can point to examples in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by creating a bird habitat or matching activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Option A (Habitat Creation):\n  - Paper plates or small boxes (one per student or per pair)\n  - Soil or sand, pebbles, small sticks, tissue paper, magazines\n  - Glue, tape, scissors\n  - Picture cards of birds and food items\n  \n- Option B (Sorting Game):\n  - Picture cards: bird, seed, worm, water, nest, tree, soil\n  - Three large envelopes or pockets labeled \"FOOD,\" \"WATER,\" \"SHELTER\"\n  - Sort cards by category\n\n**Activity – Choose One:**\n\n**Option A: \"Design a Bird's Home\" (Hands-On Creation)**\n\n1. Give each student (or pair) a paper plate or small box.\n2. Show the photograph again: \"This is a bird's natural habitat. Now, create a home where a bird could survive.\"\n3. Students glue soil, sticks, and leaves to create a miniature habitat.\n4. Teacher prompts: \"Where will the bird find food? Where will it drink? Where will it sleep?\"\n5. Students place a picture of a bird in their habitat and explain what the bird needs there.\n6. Display all habitats and take a \"bird's-eye view\" gallery walk.\n\n**Option B: \"Sorting Bird Needs\" (Categorization Game)**\n\n1. Show picture cards one at a time.\n2. Students decide: Is this FOOD, WATER, or SHELTER for a bird?\n3. Teacher calls out a category: \"Hold up a card that is a shelter!\" Students race to find one.\n4. Place cards in the correct envelope together.\n5. Review the final sorted pile and discuss why each item belongs.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without directing the \"right answer.\"\n- Ask: \"Why did you choose that for shelter?\" or \"How would the bird use that?\"\n- Encourage collaboration: \"Talk with your friend about where this goes.\"\n- Circulate and listen for understanding; note misconceptions for the Evaluate phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create or sort items that reflect understanding of bird survival needs.\n- Students articulate why something is food, water, or shelter (even simply: \"The bird eats this\" or \"The bird sleeps here\").\n- Students demonstrate deeper engagement with habitat concepts.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what birds need to survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Listen to their language: Do they use \"food,\" \"water,\" \"shelter,\" \"habitat,\" \"beak\"?\n- Note which students confidently match items to categories and which need support.\n- Ask individual students: \"Tell me one thing a bird needs. Why does it need that?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes, end of lesson):**\n\n**Option 1 – Drawing & Labeling (Preferred for Kindergarten):**\n- Give each student a paper with a simple bird outline.\n- Ask: \"Draw three things a bird needs to survive around the bird. You can draw: food, water, and a place to sleep.\"\n- Students draw and teacher (or aide) labels or takes dictation.\n- **Success Criteria:** Student includes at least two of the three needs with a recognizable drawing.\n\n**Option 2 – Verbal Check-In (For students who struggle with fine motor):**\n- Ask individually or in small groups:\n  - \"Name one thing a bird eats.\" (Expected: seed, worm, insect, food)\n  - \"What does a bird need to drink?\" (Expected: water)\n  - \"Where does a bird rest?\" (Expected: nest, tree, shelter, home)\n- **Success Criteria:** Student correctly answers 2 out of 3 questions.\n\n**Option 3 – Picture Sorting Task:**\n- Show four picture cards: one of each (food, water, shelter, non-essential item like a toy).\n- Ask: \"Point to the things a bird needs to survive.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student correctly identifies all three needs and explains one (e.g., \"The bird eats seeds\").\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting K-LS1-1:**\n- Student can identify at least **two of three survival needs** (food, water, shelter) when shown the photograph or habitat materials.\n- Student can **describe or point to** at least one survival need with a reason (e.g., \"The bird eats that\" or \"The bird hides there\").\n- Student demonstrates understanding through drawing, sorting, or verbal explanation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can name or identify at least two things birds need.\n- 60% of students can describe WHY a bird needs that thing.\n- All students show engagement and curiosity about bird survival.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce Cognitive Load:**\n   - Focus on one category at a time (e.g., only \"food\" in first round, then add \"water,\" then \"shelter\").\n   - Use real objects instead of pictures (a bowl of water vs. a picture of water).\n   - Pair the student with a peer buddy during exploration.\n\n2. **Provide Sentence Stems:**\n   - \"A bird needs _____ to _____.\" (Food / Water / Shelter / stay alive / stay healthy / be safe)\n   - Model the sentence; have student repeat and fill in the blank.\n\n3. **Use Gestures and Actions:**\n   - Act out eating, drinking, sleeping, hiding.\n   - Have student mirror your actions and say the word.\n   - Use TPR (Total Physical Response): \"Show me how a bird eats\" → student mimes.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Deepen Inquiry:**\n   - \"Different birds eat different foods. Find pictures of three birds. What do YOU think each bird eats? Why?\"\n   - \"Some birds build nests in trees, some on the ground. Where in OUR school or playground would a bird make a shelter?\"\n\n2. **Make Connections:**\n   - \"Just like birds need food, water, and shelter, what do YOU need to survive? Draw a picture of your habitat (your home and neighborhood).\"\n   - \"If we took away the water / food / shelter from this bird's habitat, what would happen?\"\n\n3. **Expand to Other Animals:**\n   - \"Let's look at a picture of a dog / squirrel / fish. What does THAT animal need? Is it the same as a bird or different?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bird Feeder Craft (Take-Home or Classroom):**\n   - Provide pinecones, peanut butter (or suet), and birdseed.\n   - Students coat the pinecone and hang it outside the classroom or at home.\n   - Observe birds visiting over the next week and record what they eat (draw pictures or tally marks).\n   - Discuss: \"Which birds visited? Did they eat a lot or a little?\"\n\n2. **Habitat Hunt in the School Yard (Field Observation):**\n   - Take students outside (with clipboards and cameras/drawing paper).\n   - Search for evidence of birds: feathers, nests, droppings, footprints, broken seeds.\n   - Discuss: \"Where did this feather come from? What does that tell us about the bird?\"\n   - Draw or photograph three things the bird needed: where it found food, where it drank, where it slept.\n\n3. **Read-Aloud & Discussion:**\n   - Read a Kindergarten-level book: *Beaks!* (by Sneed B. Collard) or *What Do Animals Need?* (by Lisa Bullard).\n   - After reading, ask: \"Did the bird in our picture need the same things as the birds in the book?\"\n   - Create a class chart: \"All Birds Need...\" and fill in the three categories.\n\n---\n\n**Final Notes for the Teacher:**\n\nThis lesson is designed to be hands-on, visual, and inquiry-based—perfect for Kindergarten learners. The photograph of the bird in its natural habitat is the anchor for all learning; return to it frequently to reinforce concepts. Expect that some students will need repeated exposure to vocabulary and that fine motor tasks (sorting, drawing) will vary widely in quality. Celebrate effort and curiosity over precision. Consider doing this lesson in early fall when bird migration and activity are high; tie it to outdoor observations!",
