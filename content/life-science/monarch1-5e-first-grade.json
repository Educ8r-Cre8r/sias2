ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the photograph (or large printed copy)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Whiteboard for recording student ideas\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Introduce:** Project the photograph on the board or pass around a large printed version. Say: *\"Today we're going to solve a mystery! Look carefully at this picture. What do you see? There are some special things here that tell us a story about an animal.\"*\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (calibrated for First Grade):**\n   - *\"What do you notice in this picture? What colors do you see?\"* (Activate observation skills; expect: green, tan, bumpy surfaces, etc.)\n   - *\"Have you ever seen anything like this before? Do you know what this might be?\"* (Activate prior knowledge; accept all guesses—caterpillars, bugs, cocoons, etc.)\n   - *\"Look at the green shape and the tan shape. Do you think they are the same thing or different things? Why?\"* (Begin comparing; encourage thinking about differences.)\n   - *\"I'm going to tell you a secret: both of these shapes are part of ONE animal's story. Can you guess what animal it might be?\"* (Build curiosity and prediction.)\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** *\"Here's our mystery: How does a tiny caterpillar become a beautiful butterfly? Today, we're going to find out! What questions do you have about butterflies and how they grow?\"* Write student questions on chart paper to reference later.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Now let's explore what happens to an animal when it grows and changes. Let's do some activities to discover the answer!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chrysalis and caterpillar picture cards or cutouts (pre-made or have students draw during this phase)\n- Sequence cards showing life cycle stages (caterpillar → chrysalis → adult butterfly) — can be printed pictures or student-drawn images\n- Paper, crayons, colored pencils\n- Butterfly/caterpillar books at grade-appropriate level (e.g., *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* by Eric Carle or *From Caterpillar to Butterfly* by Deborah Heiligman)\n- Chart paper with three columns labeled: \"Caterpillar,\" \"Chrysalis,\" \"Butterfly\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Station Exploration (divide class into small groups or rotate stations):**\n\n   **Station 1 – Picture Sequencing:**\n   - Provide students with four mixed-up picture cards showing: egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, adult butterfly.\n   - Student directions: *\"Put these pictures in order to show how a butterfly grows. Start with the tiniest stage and end with the adult butterfly. Talk to a friend about WHY you put them in that order.\"*\n   - Students arrange pictures left to right or top to bottom on a large sheet.\n\n   **Station 2 – Observation & Drawing:**\n   - Display the photograph again (or a zoomed-in image on a tablet/computer).\n   - Student directions: *\"Look very carefully at this picture. Draw what you see. Label what you think each shape is: Is it a caterpillar? A chrysalis? Something else? Use colors to match what you see.\"*\n   - Students draw and label on paper.\n\n   **Station 3 – Comparing Bodies:**\n   - Provide two large outlines (one of a caterpillar, one of a butterfly—or have students draw them).\n   - Student directions: *\"Compare these two animals. They are the same animal at different times! How are they the same? How are they different? Draw or write what you notice. Does one have legs? Wings? Which one can fly?\"*\n   - Students record observations using drawings, words, or checkmarks on a T-chart.\n\n2. **Connection to Photograph:** As students work, reference the photograph: *\"Remember the mystery picture? The green shape is a chrysalis—that's like a tiny house where the caterpillar rests and changes. The tan shape might be an old shell the caterpillar left behind!\"*\n\n3. **What Students Record:**\n   - Drawings of life cycle stages in order\n   - Labeled observations of the photograph\n   - Comparisons of caterpillar and butterfly bodies\n   - Pictures with written or dictated explanations\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each station, asking open-ended questions: *\"Tell me what you're noticing.\" \"Why did you put that picture first?\" \"What changed about the butterfly's body?\"*\n- Do NOT provide answers—guide with questions like: *\"What do you think would happen if the caterpillar didn't go into a chrysalis?\"*\n- Listen for misconceptions and gently redirect: *\"That's an idea! Let's look at the picture again and see what we find.\"*\n- Scribe student observations if needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students sequence pictures of the butterfly life cycle (with some support or peer discussion).\n- Students draw and label observations from the photograph.\n- Students identify at least one difference between a caterpillar and an adult butterfly (e.g., wings, legs, size, color).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with two columns: \"Caterpillar\" and \"Butterfly\"\n- Photograph (projected or printed)\n- Picture book excerpt or short video (2-3 minutes) on butterfly metamorphosis (optional but helpful)\n- Vocabulary poster or cards with images\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - Gather students in a circle. Ask: *\"What did you discover at your station? Tell us one thing you learned about how butterflies grow.\"*\n   - Record key observations on chart paper. Affirm that many different details can be noticed.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (with First Grade-friendly definitions):\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Caterpillar** | A young butterfly that looks like a tiny worm with many legs. It eats lots of leaves to grow big. |\n   | **Chrysalis** | A special hard shell where a caterpillar rests and changes into a butterfly. It's like a sleeping bag that protects the butterfly while it transforms. |\n   | **Butterfly** | The adult insect with colorful wings, a thin body, and special legs. It flies from flower to flower. |\n   | **Metamorphosis** | (Pronunciation help: met-uh-MOR-fuh-sis) The big changes an animal goes through as it grows. For butterflies, it means changing from a caterpillar into a completely different-looking butterfly. |\n   | **Life cycle** | All the stages an animal goes through from when it's born until it grows up. For butterflies: egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → adult butterfly. |\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Point to the photograph again. *\"Remember our mystery picture? Here's what we now know: The green shape is a chrysalis. That's where a caterpillar goes to rest and change. The tan shape is probably an empty chrysalis—the butterfly already came out! The caterpillar didn't disappear; it just changed A LOT.\"*\n   - Use hand motions: *\"The caterpillar crawls. Creep, creep, creep. [move fingers slowly] Then it goes into a chrysalis and sleeps. But inside, AMAZING things are happening! [make transformation gesture] And then... out comes a butterfly! [flap arms like wings] Now it can FLY!\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"A caterpillar and a butterfly—are they the same animal or different animals?\"* (Same animal at different stages.)\n   - Ask: *\"Why is a chrysalis important?\"* (It protects the caterpillar while it changes.)\n   - Ask: *\"What's one big difference between a caterpillar and a butterfly?\"* (Caterpillar has no wings; butterfly has wings. Or: caterpillar crawls; butterfly flies.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Caterpillar:** A young butterfly; looks like a tiny worm with legs and eats leaves.\n- **Chrysalis:** A hard shell or cocoon where a caterpillar rests and changes into a butterfly.\n- **Butterfly:** An adult insect with wings, a body, and antennae; it flies and drinks nectar from flowers.\n- **Metamorphosis:** Big changes an animal goes through as it grows (from one form to another).\n- **Life cycle:** The stages an animal goes through in its life, starting from birth through adulthood.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name the three main stages visible in the photograph.\n- Students understand that a caterpillar and butterfly are the same animal at different life stages.\n- Students can explain (in simple words) that the chrysalis is where the change happens.\n- Students use at least one new vocabulary word when describing butterflies.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large chart paper or poster board\n- Markers, crayons, colored pencils\n- Cut-out paper shapes (circle, oval, rectangle) or pre-folded paper strips\n- Glue sticks\n- Optional: yarn, tissue paper, pipe cleaners for 3D models\n- Index cards with life cycle stage labels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Project: \"My Butterfly Life Cycle Poster or Model\"**\n\n1. **Student Directions:**\n   - *\"You're going to make your own picture or model showing how a butterfly grows. Show ALL the stages: egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, and adult butterfly.\"*\n   - Option A (Drawing): Fold a paper into four squares. Draw each stage in order. Label or dictate labels for each.\n   - Option B (Collage): Cut pictures from magazines or use pre-made pictures; arrange them in order on poster board and glue.\n   - Option C (3D Model): Use paper shapes, yarn, and pipe cleaners to build a caterpillar and a butterfly; arrange them to show the chrysalis between them.\n\n2. **Guiding Questions as Students Work:**\n   - *\"Tell me about this stage. What does the butterfly look like here?\"*\n   - *\"What happens NEXT?\"*\n   - *\"Why do you think it's important to show the chrysalis?\"*\n   - *\"How does this stage help the butterfly survive?\"*\n\n3. **Real-World Connection:** *\"Butterflies are all around us in gardens and parks. When you see a butterfly outside, remember that it used to be a tiny caterpillar crawling on a leaf! Caterpillars help plants by... [teach that caterpillars eat leaves, which is part of nature].\"*\n\n4. **Application to Problem-Solving (1-LS1-1 connection):**\n   - *\"If you were a tiny caterpillar, how would you STAY SAFE? A chrysalis protects the caterpillar. What are other ways that animals protect themselves?\"* \n   - Students can draw or discuss: shells (snails), fur (bears), spines (hedgehogs), etc.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions to extend thinking.\n- Take photos of student work for documentation.\n- Encourage students to explain their life cycle to a peer.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation showing at least three life cycle stages in order.\n- Students can verbally explain or point to show the sequence.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that the chrysalis is a transformation stage.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of butterfly life cycles and the concept that young and adult animals look different but are the same organism.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage discussion questions.\n- Review station work for accuracy in sequencing and observations.\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain group share-out.\n- Note which students can correctly identify chrysalis and caterpillar in the photograph.\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (Show/Tell):**\n\nConduct a brief 1-on-1 or small group exit conversation (2-3 minutes per student). Use at least TWO of these prompts:\n\n1. **Show the photograph again.** *\"Show me the chrysalis in this picture. What happens inside it?\"*\n   - **Success:** Student points to the green shape and explains that the caterpillar changes into a butterfly inside.\n\n2. **Sequence Check.** *\"Here are pictures of a caterpillar and a butterfly. Show me which one comes first, and which one comes second. Why?\"*\n   - **Success:** Student places caterpillar first and butterfly second, and explains that the caterpillar is young and the butterfly is grown-up.\n\n3. **Comparison Question.** *\"Is a caterpillar the baby of a butterfly, or is it a completely different animal?\"*\n   - **Success:** Student responds that they are the same animal at different stages; caterpillar is young, butterfly is adult.\n\n4. **Drawing Prompt.** *\"Draw a caterpillar and a butterfly. Tell me one way they are the same and one way they are different.\"*\n   - **Success:** Student draws recognizable representations and identifies one similarity (same animal, same life cycle) and one difference (wings, body shape, color, legs, movement).\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies the chrysalis in the photograph.\n- ✓ Student can place life cycle pictures in correct sequence with reasoning.\n- ✓ Student explains that a caterpillar and butterfly are the same animal at different ages.\n- ✓ Student identifies at least one structural difference between caterpillar and adult butterfly.\n- ✓ Student creates a visual life cycle representation with at least three recognizable stages.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most First Grade students will correctly identify the chrysalis and describe its role in transformation.\n- Students will sequence life cycle stages with 80-90% accuracy (with support).\n- Students will verbally or pictorially explain that caterpillars and butterflies are the same animal.\n- Students will articulate at least one observable difference between the two forms.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:**\n   - Reduce vocabulary to two key terms: \"caterpillar\" and \"butterfly.\"\n   - Use only the photograph and one picture book repeatedly; build familiarity before adding complexity.\n   - Provide picture-word cards students can point to rather than producing words independently.\n\n2. **Simplified Sequencing:**\n   - Reduce sequencing to just two stages: caterpillar → butterfly (omit egg and chrysalis initially).\n   - Provide pre-made picture cards with one clearly labeled example; student matches remaining cards.\n   - Use hand-over-hand guidance or peer buddy support for station activities.\n\n3. **Visual Supports:**\n   - Pair every vocabulary word with a clear, large image.\n   - Use color-coded arrows to show progression (green caterpillar → green chrysalis → colorful butterfly).\n   - Create a \"story board\" on the wall with photographs and simple sentences students can reference throughout the lesson.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Life Cycle Research:**\n   - Introduce the egg stage: *\"Before the caterpillar, there's a tiny egg on a leaf! Can you research what a monarch egg looks like? Draw it and add it to your life cycle.\"*\n   - Extend to other insects: *\"Do all insects change like butterflies? Let's compare frogs, beetles, and ladybugs. How are their life cycles the same or different?\"*\n\n2. **Problem-Solving Application:**\n   - *\"A caterpillar needs to find a safe place to make its chrysalis. Design a perfect spot for a caterpillar to transform. Where would it be? Why is that place safe?\"*\n   - *\"Monarchs migrate thousands of miles. How do you think the chrysalis helps the butterfly survive this long journey?\"*\n\n3. **Writing & Documentation:**\n   - Have students write or dictate a 3-4 sentence \"butterfly journal\" from the perspective of a caterpillar: *\"Today I was born as an egg. Tomorrow I will...\"*\n   - Create a butterfly life cycle poster with labels, arrows, and a written explanation for each stage.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n**For Early Finishers & Follow-Up Lessons:**\n\n1. **Butterfly Garden Research & Design:**\n   - *\"Butterflies need flowers to drink nectar. Design a garden that would make butterflies happy. What flowers would you plant? Where would you put the garden? Draw your butterfly garden and label the flowers.\"*\n   - Students can create a garden plot diagram or collage and present to a peer.\n   - **Real-world extension:** Discuss planting a butterfly garden outside the classroom (monarch-friendly plants: milkweed, zinnias, marigolds).\n\n2. **Life Cycle Craft & Animation:**\n   - **Paper chain life cycle:** Students create a paper chain with four links, each colored and labeled for a different stage. Arrange on the wall or hang from ceiling to show progression.\n   - **Flip-book animation:** Students draw each life cycle stage on index cards, stack them, and flip through quickly to show \"animation\" of the transformation.\n   - **Interactive poster:** Create a large class poster with parts that lift or flip to reveal the chrysalis \"inside.\"\n\n3. **Comparative Life Cycles:**\n   - *\"Butterflies aren't the only animals that change! Let's learn about frogs and how they change from tadpoles to frogs. How is a tadpole like a caterpillar? How is a frog like a butterfly?\"*\n   - Read a short book about tadpole life cycles (e.g., *From Tadpole to Frog* by Gianna Marino).\n   - Students create a comparison poster: \"Butterfly Changes\" vs. \"Frog Changes.\"\n   - **Advanced:** Explore insects that do NOT go through big changes (like grasshoppers)—why are metamorphosis changes important?\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Pacing:** If First Graders need more time with the Explore stations, split this lesson across THREE 30-40 minute sessions instead of two 45-minute sessions.\n- **Real-World Connection:** If possible, show a brief video clip (1-2 minutes) of an actual chrysalis opening and a butterfly emerging. This concrete visual is powerful for young learners.\n- **Classroom Observation:** After this lesson, students will likely notice and ask about insects outdoors. Use these \"teachable moments\" to reinforce concepts.\n- **Family Connection:** Send home a simple one-page butterfly life cycle guide with the lesson vocabulary and an invitation to find and observe real caterpillars or butterflies outdoors together.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly addresses the mystery posed by the photograph: What are these two shapes, and why do they matter? By the end, students understand that both structures are part of one animal's incredible transformation—making the \"boring\" chrysalis suddenly fascinating and scientifically meaningful.**",
