Explain that fungi are living organisms that break down dead plant and animal material in ecosystems.\n2. Describe how fungi return nutrients from dead matter back into soil for plants to use.\n3. Identify fungi as decomposers and explain their role in a food web or ecosystem model.\n4. Provide evidence that mushrooms are part of the cycling of matter between living and nonliving things.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the mushroom photograph (or display on projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small notebook for wonder sketches\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display & Introduction:** Project or display the mushroom photograph large enough for all students to see clearly. Allow 20 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the structure under the mushroom's cap? What might those lines be for?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this mushroom is growing, and what might it be standing on or connected to?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen mushrooms in your yard or forest? Where were they, and what was around them?\"\n   - \"Is a mushroom a plant? How do you know?\" (Students often assume mushrooms are plants—this is a key misconception to surface.)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... what would happen to a fallen tree in the forest if there were no mushrooms or fungi to break it down?\" Record student wonderings on chart paper.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate what mushrooms actually do in nature and why they're so important to keeping ecosystems healthy.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4-5 clear plastic bags or containers\n- Soil samples (2-3 cups per group)\n- Dead leaves, twigs, grass clippings, small pieces of cardboard (pre-collected)\n- Water spray bottle\n- Observation journals or paper\n- Hand lenses (1 per student or per pair)\n- Paper towels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and display on board):**\n\n1. \"You are going to build a **Decomposition Observation Container** to see how matter breaks down over time.\"\n\n2. \"In your container, layer: (1) a cup of soil on the bottom, (2) torn pieces of dead leaves and small twigs on top, (3) another cup of soil, (4) a sprinkle of water.\"\n\n3. \"Seal your container loosely (one corner open to allow air flow). Leave it in a cool, dim corner of the classroom.\"\n\n4. \"Observe and sketch what you see TODAY. In 2-3 weeks, you'll open it again and record what has changed.\"\n\n5. \"Right now, use your hand lens to examine a dead leaf or twig. Ask: 'Where might tiny organisms (too small to see) be hiding? How might they break this down into smaller and smaller pieces?'\"\n\n6. \"Draw or write: What do you think will happen to the dead leaves and twigs inside the container over the next few weeks?\"\n\n**Connections to Photograph:**\n- \"The mushroom in our photo grows in soil full of dead plant material—just like what you put in your containers.\"\n- \"Underneath the mushroom cap, there are cells making tiny spores to help create more fungi.\"\n- \"Fungi are master decomposers, breaking down dead things so that nutrients go back into the soil.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask clarifying questions: \"What do you think is happening in the soil? Why might the dead leaves get softer over time?\"\n- Do NOT explain decomposition yet—guide observation.\n- Ensure containers are set up with consistent moisture (not soaked, but moist).\n- Label containers with student names and dates.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create containers with visible layers of soil and organic material.\n- Students generate initial predictions about what will happen.\n- Students hypothesize that \"something invisible\" might be breaking down the material.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary posted\n- Photograph of mushroom displayed again\n- Simple drawing/diagram of fungal hyphae (teacher-drawn or printed)\n- Optional: close-up images of mushroom gills\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - Ask 3-4 students: \"What did you predict would happen in your decomposition containers, and why?\"\n   - Record responses on chart paper.\n   - Affirm all predictions as hypotheses to test.\n\n2. **Introduce Fungi & Decomposers (Teacher-Led, 10 minutes):**\n\n   \"The organism we see as a mushroom is actually just the **fruiting body**—like an apple on an apple tree. The real fungus is hidden underground or in dead wood. It looks like tiny white threads called **hyphae** [show diagram]. These threads break down dead plants and animals by releasing special chemicals that soften the material. This process is called **decomposition**.\n\n   Fungi are called **decomposers** because their job in nature is to break down, or decompose, dead material. Without decomposers like fungi, dead leaves, fallen trees, and dead animals would pile up and never go away! Instead, fungi turn that dead material into nutrients that mix with soil. Plants then use those nutrients to grow. It's like nature's recycling system.\"\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph:**\n   - Point to the gills underneath the mushroom cap.\n   - \"These gills make millions of tiny spores—like invisible seeds. When spores land on dead wood or soil, they grow into new fungi. That's how new mushrooms appear.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding Strategy:**\n   - Quick partner talk: \"Turn to your neighbor and explain: What is a decomposer? Use the word 'dead' in your answer.\"\n   - Listen to 2-3 pairs share aloud.\n   - Correct misconceptions gently: \"Great start—remember, fungi break down **dead** things, not living plants.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Fungi** | Living organisms that are not plants or animals; they break down dead material to get energy |\n| **Decomposer** | A living thing (like fungi or bacteria) that breaks down dead plants and animals and returns nutrients to soil |\n| **Decomposition** | The process of breaking down dead material into smaller and smaller pieces |\n| **Hyphae** | Tiny, thread-like structures that make up the body of a fungus (plural of hypha) |\n| **Fruiting Body** | The visible part of a fungus that we see above ground, like a mushroom or toadstool |\n| **Spores** | Tiny, invisible reproductive cells that fungi release to grow new fungi |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that fungi are living decomposers, not plants.\n- Students can explain that decomposers break down dead material and return nutrients to soil.\n- Students recognize the mushroom as the visible part of a larger fungus.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Drawing paper or poster board\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: \"Food Web/Cycle of Matter\" template (see below)\n- Photograph of mushroom still displayed\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Choice 1 – Food Web & Matter Cycle Diagram (Recommended for 5-LS2-1):**\n\nProvide students with a simple ecosystem diagram or ask them to create one showing:\n- Dead leaves on the ground\n- A mushroom or fungi decomposing those leaves\n- Soil with nutrients\n- A plant growing from the soil\n- An arrow system showing how matter moves\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. \"Draw a simple picture showing: dead leaves → fungi → soil nutrients → growing plant.\"\n2. \"Use arrows to show how nutrients cycle back and forth.\"\n3. \"Label each part: decomposer, dead material, nutrients, soil.\"\n4. \"Write one sentence: 'Without fungi (decomposers), what might happen to dead leaves?'\"\n\n**Choice 2 – Fungi Field Guide Page (Alternative):**\n\nStudents research and illustrate one local fungus (mushroom or toadstool) and write:\n- Name and basic facts\n- Where it grows\n- What it decomposes\n- How it helps the ecosystem\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"How does this fungi fit into the movement of matter in an ecosystem?\"\n- Prompt students to extend thinking: \"What if fungi disappeared from forests? What would happen?\"\n- Provide sentence starters if needed: \"Without fungi, dead leaves would... Plants would struggle because...\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a diagram or model showing matter cycling through decomposers.\n- Students explain with evidence why decomposers are essential to ecosystems.\n- Students make connections between fungi, soil, and plant growth.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Listen to partner discussions (Check for Understanding #4 above).\n- Observe Explore activity predictions for evidence of thinking about unseen organisms.\n- Review Elaborate diagrams and written explanations for conceptual understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment – 5 minutes):**\n\nDisplay these three questions on the board or provide as a handout:\n\n1. **\"What do fungi do in an ecosystem?\"**\n   - ☐ They eat plants that are alive\n   - ☐ They break down dead material and return nutrients to soil\n   - ☐ They only grow on mushrooms\n   - ☐ They prevent plants from growing\n\n2. **\"Why is the mushroom in our photo important to the forest?\"** (Students write 1-2 sentences with evidence.)\n\n3. **\"Draw or label: What happens to dead leaves because of fungi?\"** (Quick sketch with labels.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student selects correct answer to Question 1 (choice B).\n- ✓ Student explains that fungi break down dead material and nutrients cycle back (Question 2).\n- ✓ Student demonstrates understanding that fungi decompose dead matter (Question 3).\n- ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary term correctly (decomposer, fungi, nutrients, decomposition).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will show understanding of fungi as decomposers and nutrient recyclers.\n- Students will make connections between the mushroom in the photograph and the ecosystem function they learned about.\n- Misconceptions (fungi = plants, fungi eat live things) will be identified and addressed in small-group follow-up.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support\n\n**For Struggling Learners:**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a visual anchor chart with pictures + simple words (Fungi = breaks down dead leaves, Decomposer = helper in nature, Soil = home for nutrients). Point to it frequently during Explain and Elaborate.\n\n2. **Sentence Starters for Exit Ticket:** Provide frame sentences:\n   - \"Fungi are important because they _________.\"\n   - \"Without fungi, dead leaves would _________.\"\n\n3. **Pair with Peer During Explore:** Assign struggling students to pairs with strong observers to co-build decomposition containers and jointly record predictions.\n\n### Challenge\n\n**For Advanced Learners:**\n\n1. **Extended Research:** Ask students to investigate: \"How do different fungi (molds, mushrooms, yeasts) break down different materials?\" Provide access to kid-friendly science websites or books to explore variations in decomposition.\n\n2. **Multi-Cycle Thinking:** \"If fungi break down a tree into nutrients, trace where those nutrients go next. What eats the plants that grow? What happens when that animal dies?\" Create a more complex food web or matter cycle diagram.\n\n3. **Real-World Application:** \"Many industries use fungi to break down pollutants or create medicine. Research one example and present how fungi help solve real-world problems.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Ongoing Decomposition Container Observation (2-3 weeks):**\n   - Open containers at 1-week and 3-week intervals.\n   - Observe and sketch changes in leaf structure, soil color, texture.\n   - Document whether fungi or mold appeared.\n   - Graph or chart changes over time.\n   - Discuss: \"How did decomposition happen? Was it visible? What evidence do you have?\"\n\n2. **Fungal Spore Print Art & Investigation:**\n   - Collect fresh mushroom caps (or order from online supplier for budget-friendly option).\n   - Place gill-side down on paper or foil overnight.\n   - Observe spore prints left behind (students will see fine powder).\n   - Discuss: \"These are spores—how do you think they travel to new places? What might disperse them (wind, water, animals)?\"\n   - Optional: Use spore prints as nature art and label with scientific names.\n\n3. **Citizen Science: Forest Floor Fungi Hunt:**\n   - Take students on a nature walk or outdoor observation session to search for fungi in logs, soil, leaf litter, or on trees.\n   - Use hand lenses to observe mushrooms, shelf fungi, or mold.\n   - Photograph findings and create a class \"Fungi Field Guide\" poster.\n   - Discuss ecosystem locations: \"Why do fungi grow here? What are they decomposing?\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety Reminder:** Do not allow students to taste or ingest any mushrooms, even those found in the classroom or outdoors. Emphasize that only mycologists (fungi scientists) can safely identify edible mushrooms.\n- **Moisture Management:** Check decomposition containers weekly. They should be moist but not waterlogged (similar to a wrung-out sponge). Mold growth is expected and should be celebrated as evidence of decomposition!\n- **Timing:** If teaching in early fall, outdoor fungi will be abundant. If teaching in winter/spring, order mushroom caps or dried leaves/twigs online to supplement.\n- **Connection to Prior Learning:** This lesson builds on K-2 observations about living/nonliving things and PS-LS connections about energy and matter. It directly prepares students for middle school concepts about cellular respiration and nutrient cycles.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is designed to meet 5-LS2-1 by having students develop and refine a model of matter movement through decomposers and the environment. The hands-on decomposition container activity anchors abstract concepts in concrete observation, and the exit ticket ensures you can assess understanding before moving forward.",
