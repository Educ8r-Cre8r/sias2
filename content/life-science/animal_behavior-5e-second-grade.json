Observe and describe how the lizard's body features help it survive in its habitat.\n2. Compare the characteristics of animals that live in different environments.\n3. Identify at least two features of a lizard that help it blend into its rocky or tree habitat.\n4. Explain why different animals need different habitats to survive.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the green lizard.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the green lizard on rock/bark background\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Show the image on a large screen or printed copy. Do NOT immediately tell students what the animal is.\n\n2. **Guiding Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe what you notice.\"\n   - \"What color is this animal? Why do you think it might be that color?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this animal lives? What in the picture gives you clues?\"\n   - \"How does this animal's color help it stay safe in this place?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder why this animal is so green when so many other animals we know are brown or gray. What do you think?\"\n\n4. **Prior Knowledge Activation:** Ask students to share about animals they have seen outside and where those animals live (yards, parks, forests). Record responses on chart paper.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to explore how animals like this green lizard have special features that help them live in their homes. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how animal features match their habitats through hands-on observation and sorting.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pictures of 8-10 different animals (lizard, fish, bird, bear, frog, snake, monkey, penguin, polar bear, desert fox—printed or drawn)\n- Picture cards of different habitats (forest, desert, ocean, arctic/snow, grassland, tree, rock, wetland—printed or drawn)\n- Index cards for each animal\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Clipboards or hard surfaces for writing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set Up the Investigation:**\n   - Give each pair or small group of students a set of animal and habitat picture cards.\n   - Display the green lizard picture prominently where all can see.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n   - \"Look at each animal card. Point to the animal and name it.\"\n   - \"Now look at the habitat cards. These show different homes or places where animals live.\"\n   - \"For each animal, decide which habitat it lives in. Match the animal to its home by placing the cards near each other.\"\n   - \"Think about WHY each animal belongs in that habitat. What features does the animal have that help it live there?\"\n   - \"On your index card, draw the animal and write or copy one thing about it that helps it survive (e.g., 'The fish has fins to swim,' 'The polar bear is white to hide in snow').\"\n\n3. **Connection to the Photograph:**\n   - Point students back to the green lizard: \"The green lizard lives on rocks and trees. Its green color helps it hide. What else do you notice about this lizard that helps it live in this habitat?\"\n\n4. **What Students Record:**\n   - Drawings of animals in their habitats\n   - One or two features per animal that match its habitat (with teacher support/scribe help as needed)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Why did you put the penguin there?\" \"What does the polar bear need to survive in the snow?\"\n- Provide sentence starters: \"The _____ lives in the _____ because it has _____.\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answers; encourage them to observe and think.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will match at least 5-7 animals to appropriate habitats with reasoning.\n- Students will identify 1-2 physical features per animal that help it survive (color, body shape, body coverings, etc.).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration. Connect discoveries to the green lizard photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Green lizard photograph\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words written out\n- Picture examples showing adaptation (color, texture, body parts)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - Ask 3-4 student pairs to share one animal-habitat match and explain their thinking.\n   - Record their ideas on chart paper under \"How Animals Fit Their Homes.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n   - **Habitat:** A home or place where an animal lives that has the things it needs (food, water, shelter, safety).\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or color that helps an animal live and survive in its habitat.\n   - **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or pattern matches its surroundings so it is hard to see.\n   - **Feature:** A part of an animal's body or the way it looks (like color, size, shape, or skin).\n\n3. **Vocabulary Activity – Spot It in the Photo:**\n   - \"The green lizard is an example of camouflage. Its green color is an adaptation. Can you see how it blends with the rocks and trees? That's its habitat.\"\n   - Ask: \"What is ONE feature of the green lizard that helps it survive?\" (Possible answers: green color, bumpy scales, eye position, slim body.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"Show me where the lizard's habitat is in this picture.\" \"What color is a good camouflage for living on rocks?\"\n   - Use thumbs up/sideways/down to quickly assess understanding: \"Does everyone think camouflage means hiding by matching colors?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Habitat** | The home or place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part, color, or behavior that helps an animal live in its habitat |\n| **Camouflage** | When an animal's color or pattern makes it hard to see because it matches its surroundings |\n| **Feature** | A special part of an animal's body or the way it looks (color, size, skin texture, etc.) |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and safe |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define habitat, adaptation, and camouflage in their own words.\n- Students can point to the green lizard and explain how its color is an adaptation for its habitat.\n- Students understand that different animals need different habitats because of their adaptations.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by creating their own animal-habitat match or design.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Drawing paper (8.5\" × 11\" or larger)\n- Colored pencils, crayons, or markers\n- Optional: magazines for cutting and pasting\n- Glue sticks (if using magazines)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Design Your Own Habitat-Matched Animal (Recommended for visual learners)**\n- Provide a habitat scenario: \"Imagine an animal that lives in a snowy forest\" or \"An animal that lives in a sandy desert.\"\n- Students draw or create a new animal that would survive in that habitat.\n- Students must include at least TWO features that help it survive (color, body parts, etc.).\n- Students label their drawing and write or dictate why each feature helps the animal survive.\n\n**Option B: Habitat Detective (Recommended for kinesthetic learners)**\n- Provide pictures of four different real animals without labels.\n- Students identify each habitat and match the animal to it.\n- Students write or draw one reason why each animal fits its habitat.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"What habitat did you choose?\" \"What color is your animal and why?\" \"How does that body part help it survive?\"\n- Encourage students to think beyond just color: \"Does this animal need sharp claws? Wings? A thick coat?\"\n- Provide sentence frames: \"My animal lives in the _____ so I made it _____ to help it _____.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a drawing of an animal with at least two adaptation features labeled.\n- Students can explain how each feature helps the animal survive in its habitat.\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding that organisms are shaped by their environments.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal habitats and adaptations.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe during Explore: Are students matching animals to habitats logically? Can they articulate why?\n- Listen during Explain: Do students use habitat and adaptation vocabulary correctly?\n- Review Elaborate drawings: Do students show understanding of feature-habitat connections?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal for emergent writers). Ask:\n\n1. **Picture Identification:** Show the green lizard photo again. \"Point to the lizard's habitat. What is it?\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Check:** \"If I said 'camouflage,' what would you think of? (Show the lizard or describe hiding.)\"\n\n3. **Application Question:** \"I'm going to tell you about an animal: It has thick white fur and lives where it snows. Why does it have white fur?\" (Look for answer about hiding/staying warm/matching environment.)\n\n4. **Open-Ended:** \"Tell me one way the green lizard is different from the polar bear. Why are they so different?\" (Look for understanding that animals are different because they live in different places.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- **Proficient:** Student can identify at least two features of the green lizard and explain how they help it survive. Student uses vocabulary (habitat, adaptation, camouflage) correctly at least once.\n\n- **Developing:** Student can identify one feature and describe its purpose. Student uses vocabulary with prompting.\n\n- **Emerging:** Student can point to features of the green lizard but may need support explaining how they help survival. Vocabulary use requires heavy scaffolding.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly match animals to habitats and explain at least one reason why.\n- 70% of students will use the word \"adaptation\" or \"camouflage\" appropriately.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that animal bodies match their habitats.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce Choices:** Provide only 3-4 habitat and animal options instead of 8-10. Focus on the green lizard, fish, penguin, and polar bear as examples.\n\n2. **Sentence Stems and Word Banks:** Provide pre-written cards with sentence starters:\n   - \"The lizard is green so it can _____.\"\n   - \"This animal lives in the _____ because _____.\"\n   - Include picture word cards (green, scales, rocks, hide, safe, tree).\n\n3. **Pair with Strong Partner:** During Explore, pair with a student who can model thinking aloud: \"I think this animal goes here because...\"\n\n4. **Scribe Support:** Offer to write responses for students who struggle with writing but have ideas verbally.\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Comparison:** Ask: \"How would a green lizard change if it moved to a desert? What new color would it need? Why would it need longer legs?\" Have students redesign the lizard for a new habitat.\n\n2. **Multiple Adaptations:** Challenge students to identify 3-4 features of the green lizard (not just color: eye placement, body shape, scale texture, size). Have them research or explain what each does.\n\n3. **Habitat Creation:** Provide materials (paper, fabric, natural items) and ask students to build a 3D habitat for the green lizard. Include plants, rocks, shelter, and explain how each part of the habitat helps the lizard survive.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis:** Provide pictures of two similar-looking animals with very different habitats (e.g., green lizard vs. green tree frog). Ask: \"Why are these both green but have different bodies? What does each animal need to do in its habitat?\" Write a short explanation.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom Habitat Display:** Create a bulletin board or display area where students contribute animal pictures, habitat pictures, and descriptions. Add photos of local animals and habitats from your area. Update it as students learn about new animals. **Real-World Connection:** \"Many of our local animals are adapted to live near us. Can you find an animal living in your neighborhood and describe its adaptations?\"\n\n2. **Camouflage Game – \"Hide and Seek\":** \n   - Place 10 small paper animal cutouts (different colors) in a \"habitat\" (classroom area with paper trees, rocks, grass, etc.). \n   - Some animals match the habitat colors; others don't. \n   - Students hunt for animals. Count how many they find. Discuss: \"Which animals were easiest to find? Why? Which were hardest? Why?\" \n   - This reinforces camouflage and adaptation concepts through play.\n\n3. **Family Nature Walk & Observation Sheet:** \n   - Send home a simple observation sheet: \"Go for a walk and find one animal (or its home, tracks, or signs). Draw it. Where did you find it? What color is it? What features do you see?\" \n   - Students bring back observations to share. Create a class chart of local animals and where they live. **Connects to:** Real habitats in students' own community and emphasizes that adaptation is all around them.\n\n---\n\n**Notes for Teachers:**\n- The green lizard photograph is powerful for second graders because it's clear, colorful, and shows obvious camouflage. Use it as an anchor image throughout the lesson.\n- Second graders are concrete thinkers, so focus on observable features (color, size, texture) rather than abstract behaviors.\n- Repetition of vocabulary across all five phases helps build retention.\n- Allow students to move around during Explore and Elaborate—kinesthetic engagement increases understanding at this age.",
