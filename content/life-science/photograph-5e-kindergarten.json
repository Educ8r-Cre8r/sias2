A Peek at Nature from Above**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90 minutes total (can be split into two 45-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - **K-LS1-1** — Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Observe and name at least two living things that live in a forest.**\n2. **Describe one thing that plants need to grow (sunlight, water, or soil).**\n3. **Explain how at least one animal uses trees or plants for food or shelter.**\n4. **Predict what animals might live in a forest based on what they observe in the photograph.**\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of a forest landscape.\n\n#### Materials\n- Large printed or projected photograph (or display on interactive board)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: binoculars (toy or real) as a prop to build excitement\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Introduction:**\nDisplay the photograph prominently. If using a projector, zoom in on different sections so students can see details. You might hand out toy binoculars to 2-3 students and say: *\"We're going to take an airplane ride over a forest and see what we can discover!\"*\n\n**Discussion Questions (Ask these one at a time, allowing 30-60 seconds for responses):**\n\n1. *\"What do you see in this picture? Can you point to something green?\"* (Activate observation; accept all answers)\n2. *\"This is a forest taken from way, way up in the sky — like from an airplane! Do you think animals live down in all those trees? Which animals might be there?\"* (Activate prior knowledge about forest habitats)\n3. *\"Why do you think there are so many green trees? What do plants need to be that green and healthy?\"* (Begin thinking about plant needs)\n4. *\"Look at this road running through the trees. What do you notice? Are there as many trees here as in the forest?\"* (Begin comparing forest vs. non-forest areas)\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n*\"I wonder... if we could shrink down and walk through this forest, what would we see, hear, and find? What do you wonder about?\"*\n\nWrite 2-3 student wonderings on chart paper under the heading **\"Forest Wonderings\"** — keep this visible throughout the lesson.\n\n#### Transition\n*\"Let's become forest explorers! We're going to build our own small forest and discover what lives there and what living things need to survive.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate plant and animal needs through hands-on exploration of a miniature forest ecosystem model.\n\n#### Materials\n- One shallow bin or tray per small group (or one per 4-5 students)\n- Soil (potting soil, enough for 2-3 inches per bin)\n- Small plant starts or seeds (grass seed, bean seedlings, or potted herbs like basil)\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Small figurines of forest animals (plastic toys: deer, squirrel, fox, birds, insects)\n- Natural materials: twigs, leaves, small rocks, moss (if available)\n- Observation sheet (picture cards with: sun, water, soil, animal shelter symbols)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Setup (Teacher-led, 3 minutes):**\n- Divide students into small groups of 4-5\n- Assign each group a bin (or share one bin per pair)\n- Pre-fill bins with 2-3 inches of moist soil\n\n**Student Exploration Steps:**\n\n1. **\"Plant the forest\" (5 minutes):**\n   - Give each group 2-3 small plant starts or a small handful of grass seed\n   - Students gently place plants in soil and pat soil around them\n   - Teacher narrates: *\"You're the forest builders now! Plants need soil to grow their roots.\"*\n\n2. **\"Add shelter and decorations\" (5 minutes):**\n   - Students add twigs, leaves, and small rocks to create \"homes\" and \"hiding spots\"\n   - Teacher asks: *\"Where would a squirrel hide? Can you make a cozy spot?\"*\n\n3. **\"Meet the forest animals\" (5 minutes):**\n   - Give each group 3-4 plastic animal figurines\n   - Students place animals in the forest: *\"Where would this deer stand? Why?\"*\n   - Teacher prompts: *\"Is the squirrel near food (the plants)? Is the fox near other animals?\"*\n\n4. **\"Give the forest a drink\" (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Demonstrate using the spray bottle gently\n   - Students spray their forest lightly (showing plants need water)\n   - Teacher says: *\"Just like you need water to drink and grow, plants need water too!\"*\n\n**What Students Record:**\nOn an observation sheet with picture cards, students:\n- Circle or check off what their forest has: ☀️ sun, 💧 water, 🌍 soil, 🏠 animal homes\n- Draw one animal they added and where it is in the forest\n- Draw one plant they can see\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate among groups with questions, not answers: *\"Tell me about your forest. Why did you put that animal there?\"*\n- Observe which students are connecting plants to shelter/food\n- Guide without leading: *\"What do you think the rabbit needs to live here?\"*\n- Ensure safe, gentle handling of materials\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students create a simple miniature forest with plants and animals\n- Students begin observing that animals are near plants and shelter\n- Students handle the spray bottle and understand plants need water\n- Students make predictions about animal placement based on their own logic\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and solidify understanding of forest habitats and what living things need.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper (or whiteboard)\n- The student-created forest models from Explore\n- The photograph (displayed again)\n- Picture cards or simple drawings: plant, animal, water, shelter, sunlight, forest\n- Optional: real leaves, twigs, or a small potted plant to hold up\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n- Ask 3-4 groups to briefly show their forest\n- Ask: *\"Tell us one thing your forest has. Why is that important?\"*\n- Record observations on chart paper:\n  - *\"Plants need...\"* → soil, water, sunlight\n  - *\"Animals need...\"* → food, water, shelter, other animals\n\n**Introduce Key Vocabulary (7-10 minutes):**\n\nPresent each term with a concrete definition and reference back to the photo or models:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Kindergarten-Friendly Definition** | **Connection** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Forest** | A place with many, many trees and plants growing close together where animals live | Point to the photograph and the models |\n| **Habitat** | A home where an animal or plant lives and finds everything it needs | The forest IS a habitat; trees are homes |\n| **Shelter** | A safe place to rest, hide, and stay safe from danger | The twigs and leaves they added; holes in trees |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy | Plants need sun/water; animals need food/shelter |\n\n**Check for Understanding (3-5 minutes):**\n\nUse these quick strategies:\n- **Thumbs Up/Down:** *\"Do plants need water? Show me with your thumbs!\"*\n- **Point to the Picture:** *\"Show me where an animal might find shelter in the forest photograph.\"*\n- **Echo Back:** *\"Say this with me: Animals need food and water to survive!\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students use/understand the words: forest, habitat, shelter, survive\n- Students can name at least one thing plants need (water, soil, sunlight)\n- Students can name at least one thing animals need (food, water, shelter, home)\n- Students connect their model forest to the real forest in the photograph\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nApply and deepen understanding by exploring how specific forest animals depend on plants.\n\n#### Materials\n- Printed picture cards of forest animals (deer, squirrel, bird, fox, rabbit) and forest plants/features (acorns, berries, grass, tree hollow, branches)\n- Chart paper with two columns: **\"This animal eats...\"** and **\"This animal finds shelter in...\"**\n- Glue sticks\n- Optional: matching game cards (animal to food/shelter)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Scenario-Based Exploration:**\n\nGather students in a circle with the photograph visible and the miniature forests nearby.\n\n**Teacher narrates a story (2 minutes):**\n*\"A squirrel wakes up in the forest. It's hungry! The squirrel looks around. It sees trees with acorns. Yum! That's the squirrel's food. Then it gets cold. The squirrel finds a hollow spot inside a big tree. That's its shelter. The squirrel is happy because the forest gave it food and shelter.\"*\n\n**Match Animals to Their Needs (8-10 minutes):**\n\n1. Show picture cards of animals one at a time\n2. Ask: *\"What does the squirrel eat? (Show picture of acorns) Where does it sleep?\"* (tree hollow)\n3. Do 2-3 more animals (deer eats grass; bird eats berries and builds nests in branches)\n4. As a class, create a visual chart by gluing pictures:\n   - **Squirrel** → eats acorns (from trees) → lives in tree hollow\n   - **Deer** → eats grass and leaves → hides under branches\n   - **Bird** → eats berries → builds nest in tree branches\n\n**Real-World Connection (3-5 minutes):**\n*\"In the forest in our photograph, right now, squirrels are finding acorns, deer are eating plants, and birds are building homes in trees. The forest has everything these animals need. That's why the forest is a perfect habitat!\"*\n\nAsk: *\"Are there any trees where YOU live? Do you see animals using them?\"* (Connect to their neighborhood)\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Guide the matching with questions, not answers: *\"What might a deer eat? Meat or plants?\"*\n- Celebrate multiple correct answers: *\"Yes! The bird could eat berries OR insects!\"*\n- Reinforce vocabulary: *\"The tree is like an animal's home — we call that shelter.\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students identify 2-3 animals and what they need from the forest\n- Students understand that plants provide both food and shelter\n- Students begin to see connections (relationships) between organisms\n- Students can explain (in simple terms) why forests are good habitats for animals\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of forest habitats and what plants and animals need to survive.\n\n#### Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson)\n- **Observations during Explore:** Did students place animals logically near shelter and plants?\n- **Listen to language during Explain:** Do students use words like \"forest,\" \"habitat,\" \"shelter,\" \"survive\"?\n- **Questions during Elaborate:** Can students answer: *\"Why does the squirrel live in the tree?\"* or *\"What does the bird eat?\"*\n\n#### Summative Exit Activity (5-10 minutes): \"Forest Checklist\"\n\n**Administer individually or in small groups:**\n\nShow the photograph again. Ask these four questions one at a time. Record responses (Yes/No or student's spoken answer):\n\n1. **\"Show me a plant in this forest. What does it need to grow?\"**\n   - ✓ Success: Student points to trees and names at least one need (water, soil, or sun)\n\n2. **\"What animals might live here? Name one.\"**\n   - ✓ Success: Student names any realistic forest animal (deer, squirrel, bird, fox, etc.)\n\n3. **\"What does that animal need to survive?\"**\n   - ✓ Success: Student mentions food, water, or shelter\n\n4. **\"Is this a good home (habitat) for animals? Why?\"**\n   - ✓ Success: Student says \"yes\" and gives a reason (has food, trees for shelter, water, plants, etc.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student answers 3 out of 4 questions correctly = **Meets objective**\n- Student answers 2 out of 4 = **Approaching objective** (needs reinforcement)\n- Student answers 1 or fewer = **Not yet meeting objective** (provide individual support)\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students demonstrate understanding that forests are habitats\n- Students can identify at least one plant and one animal\n- Students explain at least one thing a living thing needs to survive\n- Students use observations and exploration to support their answers\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce Language Load:** \n   - Use picture cards instead of asking open-ended questions\n   - Ask yes/no questions: *\"Does this animal eat plants?\"* instead of *\"What does this animal eat?\"*\n   - Pair student with a buddy during Explore phase\n\n2. **Concrete, Simplified Materials:**\n   - Provide only 2 animal figurines and 1-2 plants (reduce choices)\n   - Use larger, easier-to-manipulate figurines\n   - Pre-moisten soil so it's easier to work with\n\n3. **Guided Questioning:**\n   - Provide sentence stems: *\"The squirrel needs _____ to live.\"* (show pictures of food, water, shelter)\n   - Use the photograph to model: *\"Look, the forest has trees. Trees are shelter. This forest is good for animals.\"*\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Connections:**\n   - Ask: *\"What would happen if there were NO trees in the forest? Where would the squirrel go?\"*\n   - Challenge: *\"Can you find a food chain? What eats what?\"* (herbivore → carnivore)\n   - Design challenge: *\"Build a forest that would be good for THREE different animals. What does each animal need?\"*\n\n2. **Research-Based Extension:**\n   - Provide a simple forest animal fact card (1-2 sentences, picture-heavy)\n   - Ask: *\"What does THIS animal eat? Can you find that food in our forest?\"*\n   - Have them teach peers one fact about their animal\n\n3. **Extended Documentation:**\n   - Ask students to draw a detailed picture of their forest labeled with: plants, animals, water, shelter, sunlight\n   - Create a simple written or verbal explanation: *\"My forest is a good home for _____ because...\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### Extension 1: **Forest Sensory Exploration**\nTake students on a neighborhood \"forest walk\" (even a small park or tree-filled area). Have them observe and collect natural items (leaves, twigs, acorns — nothing protected). Back in class, sort by \"comes from plants\" vs. \"homes for animals.\" Discuss: *\"Real forests have even MORE living things than our models!\"*\n\n**Time:** 1-2 sessions of 30 minutes each\n\n---\n\n### Extension 2: **Create a Forest Diorama Poster**\nProvide a large poster board divided into sections: **Plants in Our Forest** | **Animals in Our Forest** | **What Our Forest Needs** (sun, water, soil). Students draw or glue pictures to create a labeled forest poster. Use this to assess and reinforce vocabulary and concepts.\n\n**Time:** One 30-minute session\n\n---\n\n### Extension 3: **\"Forest Friends\" Role-Play**\nAssign small groups different forest animals. Have them act out a day in the forest: *\"I'm a squirrel looking for food. I find an acorn under this tree (point to a drawn tree). Now I climb up (students act this out). I rest in a hole. I'm safe!\"* Students narrate and act, reinforcing that animals find food and shelter in forests.\n\n**Time:** 20-30 minutes\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Notes\n\nThis lesson directly aligns with **K-LS1-1** by having students:\n- **Observe** the photograph and miniature forests to identify plants and animals\n- **Describe patterns** of what forests provide (food, water, shelter, soil)\n- **Understand** that living things need specific things to survive\n\nThe photograph (from above) makes the ecosystem concept concrete and visible for Kindergarteners, and the hands-on exploration ensures understanding is grounded in direct experience rather than abstract learning.",
