Exploring Garden Habitats**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n  - Session 1: Engage + Explore (45 minutes)\n  - Session 2: Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate (45 minutes)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-LS4-1: Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Identify and describe** different animals and plants that live in a garden habitat.\n2. **Explain what animals need** to live in a habitat (water, food, shelter, light).\n3. **Compare** the features of a garden habitat and explain why different organisms live there.\n4. **Create a simple model** of a habitat showing where animals and plants need certain things to survive.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animal homes and habitats using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph printed in color (8.5\" × 11\" or larger) OR displayed on interactive board\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Sticky notes (one per student)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or hold it up so all students can see clearly. Do NOT explain it yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause 5–10 seconds after each to allow thinking time):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you point to something living and something not living?\"\n   - \"Look at the water in the middle. What animals do you think might live there? Why do you think they live in water?\"\n   - \"I see rocks, plants, and flowers all around. Why do you think the person who made this garden put these things here? What do animals need?\"\n   - \"If you were an animal, would you want to live in this garden? What would you like about it?\"\n\n3. **Record student responses** on chart paper as a class. Use their own language; do not correct.\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today we're going to be detectives and explore what makes a good home for animals. We're going to build our own mini-habitat and see what animals and plants need to survive!\"\n\n5. **Show enthusiasm:** \"Let's discover what animals really need to be happy and healthy!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now it's time to explore and build — let's make our own garden habitat and see what we learned!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what animals and plants need by creating a miniature habitat model.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic containers or small terrarium jars (one per student or pair; 2–3 cups capacity)\n- Potting soil or sand\n- Small pebbles or gravel\n- Water (in a spray bottle and small cups)\n- Live plant cuttings (grass, small houseplants, or seedlings from the classroom or home)\n- Pictures of small animals (drawn or printed images: beetles, snails, ants, birds, frogs, fish) to place IN or AROUND the habitat\n- Construction paper cut into animal shapes (if live plants unavailable)\n- Craft labels and markers\n- Optional: small plastic animals or figurines\n\n**Activity: Students create a \"Mini Habitat in a Container\"**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"First, put a layer of small pebbles or gravel at the bottom of your container. This helps water drain.\"\n\n2. \"Add 2–3 inches of soil on top of the pebbles. Press it down gently with your finger.\"\n\n3. \"Plant a small living plant cutting into the soil. Press the soil around it. This is food and shade for animals!\"\n\n4. \"Spray the soil with a little water until it is damp (not soaking). Remember: animals need water!\"\n\n5. \"Place your animal picture cards or figurines near or in the habitat. You're showing where this animal would live.\"\n\n6. \"Use your marker to write on a label: 'What does my animal need?' Then draw or write: water, food, shelter, light.\"\n\n7. **Document and observe:** Have students draw or photograph their habitat and answer these prompts on a worksheet:\n   - \"What plant did you put in your habitat?\"\n   - \"What animal lives here?\"\n   - \"Why does this animal like living here? What does it need?\"\n\n**How this connects to the photograph:** The garden habitat in the photo has rocks for shelter, plants for food and shade, and water for fish and other animals. Students are building a smaller version to understand these needs.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask students: \"Why did you add water? What does your animal need to drink?\" \n- Observe without giving answers; encourage students to make predictions.\n- Assist with plant placement and watering only; let students lead the building.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each student/pair creates a working miniature habitat.\n- Students can identify at least 2 things their animal needs to survive.\n- Students can explain (verbally) why they put certain items in their habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to habitat science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers (for anchor chart)\n- Student-created habitats from Explore phase\n- Photograph of the garden (displayed again)\n- Picture cards of 4–5 animals and their habitats (provided by teacher)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3–4 student pairs to show their mini-habitat and share:\n     - \"What animal lives in your habitat?\"\n     - \"What did you put in it? Why?\"\n   - As students share, highlight common themes on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Create an anchor chart titled \"**What Animals Need in a Habitat**\"\n   - Define and illustrate each term with pictures from the garden photo:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Habitat** | A place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs to stay healthy. |\n| **Shelter** | A safe place where an animal can hide from danger and stay warm or cool. Examples: rocks, plants, bushes. |\n| **Water** | A liquid that all animals need to drink to survive. The pond is a water source. |\n| **Food** | What animals eat to get energy. Plants make their own food; animals eat plants or other animals. |\n| **Sunlight/Light** | Energy that helps plants grow. Animals need light to see and stay warm. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the garden photo and say: \"Let's find these things in the garden. Can you show me where the water is? Where are the rocks for shelter? Where are plants for food?\"\n   - Have students come up and point to examples.\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we took away the water from this garden, what would happen to the fish? Why?\" \n   - Ask: \"Where would an animal hide if there were no rocks or plants?\"\n   - Listen for students to use new vocabulary words.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the vocabulary words: habitat, shelter, water, food, sunlight.\n- Students can point to examples of each in both the photograph and their mini-habitat.\n- Students explain that animals need multiple things to survive in a habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by comparing two different habitats and predicting what animals might live there.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos of 2 different habitats (e.g., forest, ocean, desert, pond — use age-appropriate images)\n- \"Habitat Detective\" worksheet (provided below)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: actual outdoor space if available for observation walk\n\n**Activity: \"Habitat Detective — Compare Two Habitats\"**\n\n**Scenario:**\n\"You are a scientist. You found two different places. One is a dark, wet forest with lots of trees. One is a sunny desert with sand and rocks. What animals would live in each place? Why?\"\n\n**Directions:**\n1. Show two habitat pictures side-by-side (forest and desert, or pond and grassland — choose based on your teaching materials).\n\n2. **Worksheet or chart work (pair/small group or individual):**\n   - Draw or write about the first habitat: \"What do I see?\" (trees, water, shade, etc.)\n   - Draw or write about the second habitat: \"What do I see?\" (sand, sun, rocks, etc.)\n   - Draw an animal that lives in each habitat.\n   - Explain: \"Why does this animal live here? What does it find in this habitat?\"\n\n3. **Gallery walk or share-out:**\n   - Post student work around the room.\n   - Students walk and observe others' thinking.\n   - Discuss as a group: \"Which animal needs more water? Which likes the sun better?\"\n\n**Alternative (if outdoor space available):**\n   - Take students on a short \"habitat walk\" around the school yard or nearby garden.\n   - Have them observe and mark on a checklist: \"I see water,\" \"I see shelter (rocks, plants),\" \"I see sunlight,\" \"I see animals or animal homes.\"\n   - Report back and compare findings.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What does a forest animal need that a desert animal doesn't? Why?\"\n- Validate all reasonable predictions; explain that different animals are adapted to different habitats.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different habitats have different features.\n- Students predict which animals live in specific habitats based on features.\n- Students explain reasoning using vocabulary: shelter, water, food, sunlight.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitats and animal needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (ongoing, throughout the lesson):**\n- Observe student conversations during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Use teacher questioning checklist: Students can name at least 2 things animals need? Students can point to examples in the photograph?\n- Review student drawings and writing from Explore phase mini-habitat explanations.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nAdminister one of the following (choose based on your class's literacy level):\n\n**Option A (Drawing-based, for emerging writers):**\nShow the garden habitat photograph one final time. Ask students:\n1. \"Draw an animal you think lives in this garden.\"\n2. \"Draw one thing it needs to survive here (water, food, shelter, or light).\"\n3. Students write or dictate: \"My animal is ______. It needs ______ to live here.\"\n\n**Option B (Written response, for developing writers):**\n1. \"What is a habitat?\"\n2. \"What does an animal need to live in a habitat? Name 2 things.\"\n3. \"Look at the garden picture. Tell me why a fish might live in this habitat.\"\n\n**Success Criteria (Students met objectives if they can):**\n- Identify at least 2 features of a habitat (water, shelter, plants, sunlight).\n- Name at least 2 things an animal needs (water, food, shelter).\n- Explain why a specific animal would live in the garden habitat photo.\n- Use habitat vocabulary correctly in responses (habitat, shelter, water, food, sunlight).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students (80%+) correctly identify basic habitat needs.\n- Students show understanding through drawings, words, or oral explanations.\n- Students demonstrate ability to connect the photograph to real animal needs.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Habitat Need Cards:** Provide picture cards showing water, food, shelter, and sunlight. Students sort or match habitat features to needs, rather than generating their own ideas. Reduces language demand.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames:** Provide starter sentences for exit ticket: \"This animal needs ______. It can find ______ in the garden.\" Students fill in blanks with picture options or word bank.\n\n3. **Pair with a peer buddy:** Assign a strong communicator to support during Explore. Student pairs build ONE habitat together, with struggling learner handling the water/plant care while buddy facilitates discussion.\n\n4. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only 3 key terms instead of 5 (habitat, shelter, water). Repeat these consistently; introduce other terms in future lessons.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Multi-habitat design:** \"Design a habitat for TWO animals that live together in the garden (e.g., a bee and a flower, a snail and a plant). What does each one need? How do they help each other?\" Students create a labeled model and present reasoning.\n\n2. **Habitat problem-solving:** Pose a problem: \"What if all the plants died in this garden? What would happen to the animals? How could we fix it?\" Students design a solution and explain their thinking.\n\n3. **Observation journal:** Advanced students keep a more detailed habitat journal, sketching daily observations over one week (does the plant grow? does the soil dry out? why?), connecting to concepts of plant growth and water needs (2-LS2-1 preview).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Build a Class Terrarium:** Create a large, enclosed terrarium in a glass container or plastic storage bin. Layer soil, rocks, plants, and add water. Students observe for 2–3 weeks, noting what happens (plant growth, moisture). Discuss: \"Why does it stay wet inside? Why does the plant grow?\" Extends into plant needs and water cycles.\n\n2. **Habitat Sorting Game:** Create picture cards of animals and habitat features (sun, water, tree, rocks, snow, sand, etc.). Students match animals to features: \"Does a penguin go with ice or a desert?\" Play repeatedly, discuss reasoning. Builds concept that different animals live in different places.\n\n3. **Community Garden Visit (if available):** Visit a real garden or school garden plot. Students sketch or photograph plants and animals in a real habitat. Back in class, compare to the photograph and their mini-habitats. Ask: \"What real animals did you see? What were they doing? What did they need?\" Authentic connection to real science.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
