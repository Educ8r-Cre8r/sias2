Both organisms are connected in their habitat.\n- **Herbivore classification and diet:** Grasshoppers are herbivores (plant-eaters) whose diet directly depends on available vegetation in their environment.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**What's for Dinner? How Grasshoppers and Plants Are Connected**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-LS2-1: Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Describe the relationship between grasshoppers and plants in a food chain.\n2. Identify and label the body parts of a grasshopper and explain how each part helps it find and eat food.\n3. Create a model showing how matter (food) moves from plants to animals in an ecosystem.\n4. Explain why grasshoppers depend on plants for survival and how this affects their habitat choices.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about insects, plants, and what animals eat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of grasshopper on hibiscus bud (projected on smartboard or printed for groups)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- KWL chart template (printed or displayed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking. (Show the image large and clear.)\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe everything you notice.\"\n   - \"What is the grasshopper doing? Why do you think it's positioned this way?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a grasshopper or insect eating a plant? What happened?\"\n   - \"Why would an insect want to eat a flower bud instead of a fully opened flower?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \"I wonder... if grasshoppers eat plants, what would happen to the plant? What would happen to the grasshopper if there were no plants around?\" Have students write or sketch one prediction.\n\n4. **Create a class KWL chart:** \n   - **K (Know):** What do we already know about grasshoppers and plants?\n   - **W (Want to Know):** What questions do we have?\n   - **L (Learn):** We'll fill this in by the end of the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to discover how grasshoppers and plants are connected, and why both of them need each other to survive. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover the structural features of grasshoppers and how insects interact with plants through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Plastic or rubber grasshopper models (or printed diagrams if models unavailable) — one per pair\n- Hand lenses (magnifying glasses)\n- Lettuce leaves or other soft plant material\n- Paper plates\n- Observation sheet (provided below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: Live crickets in a contained habitat with plants (if available and ethically sourced)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Grasshopper Body Part Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute a grasshopper model and hand lens to each pair of students.\n\n2. Students use hand lenses to examine the grasshopper carefully, focusing on:\n   - The **head** (eyes, antennae, mouthparts)\n   - The **legs** (notice there are six legs; the back two are very large)\n   - The **body color** (why might it be green?)\n   - Any other visible features\n\n3. Students sketch the grasshopper and label the parts they observe on their observation sheet.\n\n4. **Ask guiding questions:**\n   - \"What body parts do you think help the grasshopper find food?\"\n   - \"Why are the back legs so much bigger than the front legs?\"\n   - \"What might those tiny parts around the mouth be used for?\"\n\n**Step 2: Plant-Eating Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute a paper plate with a fresh lettuce leaf to each pair.\n\n2. Explain: \"This lettuce represents the plant food grasshoppers eat. Without touching it yet, predict what a grasshopper's mouth would need to do to eat this leaf.\"\n\n3. Have students gently tear, crumble, and break apart the lettuce leaf with their fingers to simulate what grasshopper mouthparts do.\n\n4. Students observe:\n   - How easy or hard it is to break the leaf apart\n   - What the leaf looks like after being broken into pieces\n   - Where bits of the leaf go\n\n5. **Record observations:** Students draw or write what they think happens when a grasshopper eats a plant.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between groups and ask open-ended questions: \"What are you noticing?\" \"Why do you think that happens?\" \"What would happen if the plant was tougher?\"\n- Resist giving answers; guide students to notice details independently.\n- Ensure all students handle materials safely and respectfully.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify grasshopper body parts and their functions.\n- Students recognize that grasshoppers have specialized structures (strong legs, chewing mouthparts) adapted for eating plants.\n- Students begin to understand the physical interaction between predator and food source.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after hands-on discovery.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Labeled diagram of a grasshopper (printed or projected)\n- Chart paper for class notes\n- Photograph of grasshopper on hibiscus bud (reference again)\n- Vocabulary cards (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Group Share-Out (5 minutes)**\n\n1. Ask 3–4 pairs to share one thing they discovered about the grasshopper's body parts or how they thought a grasshopper would eat the plant leaf.\n\n2. Create a class list on chart paper titled \"How Grasshoppers Are Built to Eat Plants.\"\n\n**Step 2: Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes)**\n\n1. Display each term with a simple definition. Use the photograph and student observations to illustrate.\n\n2. Have students repeat each term aloud and use it in a sentence.\n\n3. Post vocabulary cards in the classroom.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Herbivore:** An animal that eats only plants. (Point to the grasshopper: \"A grasshopper is a herbivore because it eats plants.\")\n- **Food chain:** A sequence showing how food energy moves from plants to animals. (Draw simple arrows: Plant → Grasshopper → Bird)\n- **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. (Grasshopper's strong legs = adaptation for jumping away from danger; chewing mouthparts = adaptation for eating tough plants.)\n- **Consumer:** A living thing that eats other living things to get energy. (Grasshoppers are consumers because they eat plants.)\n- **Producer:** A living thing (usually a plant) that makes its own food from sunlight and water. (The hibiscus plant is a producer.)\n\n**Step 3: Connect Back to the Photograph (4 minutes)**\n\n1. Display the original photograph again.\n\n2. Use the vocabulary to describe what's happening: \"This grasshopper is a **herbivore** and a **consumer**. The hibiscus bud is a **producer**. This is part of a **food chain**. The grasshopper has **adaptations** — like strong legs and chewing mouthparts — that help it survive by eating plants.\"\n\n3. Ask: \"Can anyone use one of our new words to tell the class what's happening in this picture?\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Ask students to hold up fingers (1–5) to show confidence: \"On a scale of 1 to 5, how well do you understand what a herbivore is?\"\n- Ask quick verbal questions: \"Is a grasshopper a producer or a consumer? Why?\"\n- Have students turn to a partner and say one vocabulary word in a complete sentence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand and can use the vocabulary terms appropriately.\n- Students recognize the grasshopper's role in a food chain as a consumer.\n- Students see the connection between adaptations and survival.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students deepen understanding by creating a model of matter movement and applying concepts to a new scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or poster board (one per pair or small group)\n- Colored paper, scissors, glue\n- Markers\n- Optional: Digital tool (Google Draw, Canva) for creating digital models\n- Sentence stems handout (optional support)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Build a Food Chain Model**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:** \"We're going to create a **model** — a picture that shows how matter (food and energy) moves from plants to animals. Our model will show a grasshopper's food chain.\"\n\n2. **Explain the structure:**\n   - Start with the **sun** (provides energy)\n   - Show the **hibiscus plant** (uses sun's energy to grow, produces food)\n   - Show the **grasshopper** (eats the plant, gets energy from it)\n   - Optionally add: **bird** (eats the grasshopper)\n\n3. **Student directions:**\n   - Cut out or draw pictures of each organism.\n   - Arrange them on the paper from bottom to top: plant → grasshopper → (bird).\n   - Draw **arrows** showing the direction matter/energy moves (always from food source to eater).\n   - Label each organism and write 1–2 sentences explaining what that organism does.\n   - Example: \"The grasshopper eats the plant. The plant gives the grasshopper energy to jump and move.\"\n\n4. **Extension prompt:** \"What would happen to the grasshopper if all the hibiscus plants in its area died?\"\n\n5. **Real-world connection:** \"Grasshoppers live in gardens, fields, and prairies. They always choose places where their favorite plants grow. Why do you think grasshoppers live where they do?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide sentence stems if needed: \"The _____ eats the _____ to get _____.\" \"If the plant died, the grasshopper would _____ because _____.\"\n- Ask students to explain their models: \"Tell me about your food chain. How does matter move?\"\n- Challenge advanced students: \"Can you add another animal to your food chain? What would eat the grasshopper?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual model showing the flow of matter from producers to consumers.\n- Students articulate the role of the grasshopper in its ecosystem.\n- Students understand that organisms are dependent on their food source and habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of food chains, herbivores, and adaptations.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Did students identify body parts correctly? Did they make connections between structure and function?\n- Group discussions: Can students use vocabulary naturally?\n- Food chain model: Does it show accurate relationships and proper arrow direction?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (digital or paper) with these questions:\n\n**Question 1:** Draw a simple food chain with the grasshopper in it. Label the producer and the consumer.\n\n**Question 2:** Name two body parts of a grasshopper and explain how each one helps it eat plants.\n\n**Question 3:** What would happen to a grasshopper if it lived in a place where there were no plants? Why?\n\n**Possible Answer Key:**\n\n| Question | Success Criteria |\n|----------|------------------|\n| Q1 | Student draws plant → grasshopper with arrows pointing toward grasshopper. Plant is labeled \"producer,\" grasshopper is labeled \"consumer.\" |\n| Q2 | Student names two parts (e.g., mouthparts, legs) and correctly connects them to eating (e.g., \"mouthparts chew food,\" \"legs help it jump to plants\"). |\n| Q3 | Student explains grasshopper would have no food / would starve / would die / would move away. Shows understanding of dependency. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- All students meet at least 2 of 3 success criteria.\n- Struggling students correctly identify the food chain structure and one adaptation.\n- Advanced students may add additional organisms or explain predator-prey relationships.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Provide a labeled grasshopper diagram** during the Explore phase so students don't have to rely on their drawings to identify parts. Students can trace and color the diagram instead of creating original sketches.\n\n2. **Use sentence stems during Explain and Elaborate phases:**\n   - \"A grasshopper is a _____ because it eats _____.\"\n   - \"The grasshopper's _____ helps it _____.\"\n   - Allow students to copy these frames to scaffold their explanations and exit tickets.\n\n3. **Reduce the food chain model to three organisms** (sun, plant, grasshopper) and allow students to use pre-cut images instead of creating their own. Focus on getting the arrow direction correct rather than artistic quality.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Expand the food chain:** Ask students to add a predator to their model (e.g., bird eats grasshopper). Have them explain: \"What would happen to the bird population if all the grasshoppers disappeared?\"\n\n2. **Research real habitats:** Assign students to research a specific habitat (prairie, garden, grassland) and create a food web (multiple connected food chains) showing all the herbivores and their plant food sources.\n\n3. **Adaptation deep dive:** Have students investigate why grasshoppers are green (camouflage adaptation). Ask: \"What other adaptations help grasshoppers survive? How do their antennae help them find food?\" Students can create a labeled diagram explaining 4–5 adaptations.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Observation Journal – Grasshopper Behavior in Nature:**\n   - If possible, take students outdoors to observe grasshoppers in their natural habitat (field, garden, schoolyard).\n   - Students sketch and write observations about where grasshoppers are found, what plants are nearby, and how they move.\n   - Back in class, discuss: \"Why did we find grasshoppers in these specific locations? What plants were growing there?\"\n   - **Connection:** Links the lesson to real-world ecosystems and reinforces habitat-organism relationships.\n\n2. **Build a Miniature Habitat:**\n   - Provide students with a clear container, soil, and seeds (fast-growing plants like grass or clover).\n   - Students plant the seeds and, once sprouted, carefully add grasshoppers or crickets (optional; can be observed without insects).\n   - Over 1–2 weeks, students observe and record:\n     - How plants grow\n     - What insects eat\n     - Changes in the habitat\n   - Students present observations: \"What happened to the plants? Why?\"\n   - **Connection:** Students see the food chain and ecosystem dynamics in action.\n\n3. **Food Chain Card Game – \"Who Eats Whom?\"**\n   - Create cards with different organisms: sun, grass, clover, grasshopper, cricket, bird, snake, hawk.\n   - Students work in pairs/groups to arrange cards in correct food chains using arrows.\n   - Variation: Include multiple possible chains (a bird might eat a grasshopper OR an insect).\n   - Challenge students to explain: \"Can there be more than one correct food chain? Why?\"\n   - **Connection:** Reinforces food chain sequencing and introduces the concept of a food web in a playful, interactive way.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety Reminder:** If using live insects, handle them gently and follow school protocols for ethically sourcing and caring for classroom animals. Never release non-native species.\n- **Pacing:** The Explore phase may take longer if students are deeply engaged. This is valuable time—allow extra investigation if students ask questions.\n- **Photography Connection:** Consider taking photos of students' models and observations throughout the lesson. These can be added to a classroom display or digital portfolio.\n- **Home Connection:** Send home a simple \"Notice and Wonder\" sheet asking families to observe insects or plants in their yard/neighborhood and report back, reinforcing real-world connections.\n\nThis lesson directly addresses how matter moves through ecosystems (NGSS 5-LS2-1) by having students observe, model, and explain the flow of food (matter) from plants to herbivores, with adaptations as the foundation for survival in that relationship.",
