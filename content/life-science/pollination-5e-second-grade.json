Identify what bees do when they visit flowers and explain why flowers need bees.\n2. Describe how a bee's body parts help it collect pollen and nectar from flowers.\n3. Create a simple model showing how bees pollinate flowers.\n4. Recognize that bees and flowers depend on each other to survive and grow.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of bee on purple flower (or display on screen/projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: hand magnifying glasses (one per student or pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Ask students to sit where they can see it clearly. Do not label or explain anything yet.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me everything you notice about the bee and the flower.\"\n   - \"Why do you think the bee is on the flower? What might the bee be doing there?\"\n   - \"Do you think the bee is helping the flower? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What do you think the bee is looking for on the flower?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen to flowers if there were no bees to visit them. What do you think?\"\n\n4. **Record student responses** on chart paper. Accept all ideas without correction—this is prior knowledge activation.\n\n5. **Pass around magnifying glasses** (optional but recommended) and let 3-4 students look closely at the photo to see the yellow stuff on the bee's body.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to do some activities to discover the amazing connection between bees and flowers—and why they need each other.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small cups of water (one per pair)\n- Yellow tempera paint or yellow food coloring\n- Cotton balls or cotton swabs (one per student)\n- Construction paper flowers (pre-cut, 5-6 per pair) with \"nectar\" (small dot of honey or corn syrup in the center)\n- Plastic flowers or real flowers if available (1-2 to pass around)\n- Paper plates or shallow trays\n- Paper towels\n- Hand mirrors (optional, one per pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Pair students** and give each pair a paper flower with a small dot of honey in the center and a cotton ball.\n\n2. **Student directions (read aloud and demonstrate as you speak):**\n   - \"Watch as I dip my cotton ball in this yellow paint. This paint represents pollen—the yellow powder on real flowers.\"\n   - \"Now I'm going to press my cotton ball gently into the honey on my paper flower, just like a bee would drink nectar.\"\n   - \"Look! Yellow paint stuck to the flower. That's like pollen sticking to the bee's body.\"\n   - \"Now, watch what happens when I visit another flower with my paint-covered cotton ball. I'll touch it to this second flower's center.\"\n   - \"See? The paint (pollen) came off on the new flower! That's what bees do for real flowers.\"\n\n3. **Student turns:**\n   - Each pair gets 2-3 paper flowers and one cotton ball.\n   - They dip their cotton ball in yellow paint.\n   - They visit their first flower (press into the honey center).\n   - They record on a simple chart: \"Did pollen stick to my cotton ball?\" (circle yes/no with picture support).\n   - They visit a second flower with their paint-covered cotton ball.\n   - They record: \"Did pollen come off on the new flower?\" (circle yes/no).\n\n4. **What students document:**\n   - Completed observation chart (yes/no with drawings)\n   - Compare two flowers: one that was visited with paint, one that was not (color difference observation)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice? Is the pollen moving? Where is it going?\"\n- Do NOT tell them they are \"pollinating\"—let them discover the transfer happening.\n- Help with cotton ball handling if needed.\n- Encourage peer observation: \"Look at your partner's flower. What do you see?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that pollen sticks to the cotton ball (bee).\n- Students observe that pollen transfers from one flower to another.\n- Students see a visible difference between flowers that were visited and those that were not.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- The original photograph (large display)\n- Simple diagram or drawing showing: bee → flower → pollen transfer (teacher-drawn on board)\n- Student observation charts from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 3-4 pairs to show their flowers and describe what they discovered. Use their language at first (\"the stuff came off,\" \"it got on the new flower\").\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with definitions:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Pollen:** The yellow powder inside flowers that flowers need to make seeds. It sticks to bees' fuzzy bodies.\n   - **Nectar:** Sweet juice inside flowers that gives bees food and energy.\n   - **Pollination:** When pollen moves from one flower to another flower, helped by bees or other animals.\n   - **Pollinator:** An animal (like a bee) that carries pollen from flower to flower while it eats or drinks.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Display the bee photo again. \"This bee is a pollinator. It's visiting the purple flower to drink the sweet nectar inside. As it does, look at the fuzzy yellow spots on its body—that's pollen! When this bee visits the next flower, some of that pollen will rub off, helping that flower make seeds.\"\n\n4. **Draw a simple cycle on the board:**\n   ```\n   Bee visits Flower 1 (drinks nectar, gets pollen on its body)\n          ↓\n   Bee visits Flower 2 (some pollen rubs off)\n          ↓\n   Flower 2 can now make seeds!\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Who can point to the pollen in our picture?\" (Students point to yellow spots on bee)\n   - \"Why does the flower need the bee to visit?\" (To move pollen so it can make seeds)\n   - \"What does the bee get from the flower?\" (Food—nectar)\n   - \"So who helps whom here?\" (Bee helps flower + flower helps bee)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand pollen and nectar are real things in flowers.\n- Students recognize pollination as the movement of pollen.\n- Students see that bees and flowers help each other.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards or construction paper\n- Crayons, colored pencils, or markers\n- Picture cards of pollinators (bees, butterflies, hummingbirds) - printed or teacher-drawn\n- Chart paper labeled \"Pollinators\" and \"How They Help\"\n- Optional: Real flowers in a vase (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce other pollinators:** Show picture cards of butterflies, hummingbirds, and bumblebees. \n   - \"Bees aren't the only animals that pollinate flowers. Let's discover others.\"\n   - Ask: \"Do you think butterflies visit flowers? Hummingbirds? What might they be doing there?\"\n\n2. **Create a pollinator discovery page:**\n   - Give each student or pair an index card with one pollinator picture.\n   - Ask them to draw their pollinator visiting a flower and label it with the pollinator's name.\n   - They write or dictate one sentence: \"[Pollinator name] helps flowers by carrying pollen.\"\n\n3. **Build a class chart:**\n   - Create two columns on chart paper: \"Pollinator\" and \"How It Helps Flowers\"\n   - Add each student's pollinator and help them complete: \"This _____ carries pollen when it visits flowers.\"\n\n4. **Real-world connection (if flowers are available):**\n   - Pass around a real flower (or show closely).\n   - Ask: \"Can you see the pollen inside? It might be yellow or orange. Real bees visit flowers like this.\"\n   - Gently brush a cotton ball inside a real flower center to show pollen transfer.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to see patterns: all pollinators visit flowers for food.\n- Ask: \"How is a butterfly like a bee? How is a hummingbird like a bee?\" (All visit flowers, all help with pollination)\n- Celebrate curiosity about other pollinators.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that multiple animal types are pollinators.\n- Students understand that pollination happens in nature with different animals.\n- Students see the broader plant-animal partnership beyond just bees.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pollination, animal-plant relationships, and the concept that living things depend on each other.\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n- Listen to student responses during Engage (prior knowledge).\n- Observe cotton-ball activity in Explore: Are students seeing pollen transfer? Can they explain it?\n- Check vocabulary understanding in Explain: Use thumbs up/sideways/down to show if they can answer quick questions.\n\n**Exit Ticket or Summative Assessment:**\n\nAdminister one of the following (use pictures and simple words):\n\n**Option A: Drawing with Labels**\n- Give each student a blank paper with a large flower drawn.\n- Ask them to draw a bee visiting the flower.\n- Ask them to label or point to: pollen, nectar, bee.\n- Ask: \"Why is the bee here?\" (Accept: \"to drink,\" \"to eat,\" \"to get food\")\n\n**Option B: Verbal Interview**\n- Ask individual students:\n  1. \"What is the yellow stuff on the bee called?\" (pollen)\n  2. \"What does the bee drink from the flower?\" (nectar)\n  3. \"How does the flower help the bee?\" (gives it food)\n  4. \"How does the bee help the flower?\" (moves pollen so it can make seeds)\n\n**Option C: Sorting Activity**\n- Show picture cards of: bee, flower, butterfly, sun, bee on flower, butterfly on flower.\n- Ask: \"Which pictures show pollinators visiting flowers?\" (Students sort)\n- Ask: \"Why are these animals visiting flowers?\" (to get food; to help flowers)\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- Student can identify pollen and/or nectar in pictures or diagrams.\n- Student can explain that bees visit flowers for food (nectar).\n- Student can explain that bees help flowers by moving pollen.\n- Student recognizes that bees and flowers depend on each other (even in simple language: \"bee helps flower, flower helps bee\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify pollen or nectar when asked.\n- 75% of students can explain at least one way a bee and flower help each other.\n- All students can observe and describe pollen transfer in the model activity.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Use more visuals and fewer words:** Provide printed picture cards showing bee → flower → pollen transfer in sequence. Have students arrange them in order while you narrate the story.\n\n2. **Shorten the Explore activity:** Instead of multiple flowers, have the student work with just one cotton ball and one flower throughout Explore. Repeat the pollen transfer 2-3 times to build understanding.\n\n3. **Pair with a stronger reader:** During activities, pair a student who struggles with vocabulary with a peer who can reinforce the meaning. Give them a word card with pictures (pollen = yellow dot, nectar = drop of honey).\n\n4. **Simplify exit ticket:** Use only yes/no or multiple-choice questions with pictures. \"Does the bee go to flowers for food? Yes or No?\" rather than open-ended responses.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Introduce life cycles:** Ask advanced students to predict: \"After pollination happens and the flower makes seeds, what happens next? Where do seeds go? How do new flowers grow?\" Have them draw a simple plant life cycle.\n\n2. **Research other pollinators:** Assign students to find pictures or information about one pollinator they haven't heard of (moths, beetles, bats). Have them present to the class: \"This animal also helps flowers.\"\n\n3. **Explore seed dispersal:** Connect pollination to the next step: \"Now that the flower is pollinated and makes seeds, how do seeds travel to new places?\" Use the 2-LS2-2 standard to introduce how animals help spread seeds (in fur, in stomach, via wind).\n\n4. **Design a pollinator experiment:** Challenge students to hypothesize: \"What if a flower had no pollen? Could a bee still pollinate it?\" or \"What if a bee had no fuzzy hair?\" Have them test their ideas with model flowers.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Pollinator Garden or Window Box Project:**\n   - Plan a small indoor or outdoor garden with flowers that attract pollinators (zinnias, marigolds, sunflowers—easy for kids to grow).\n   - Over several weeks, observe real bees, butterflies, or other insects visiting.\n   - Keep a \"Pollinator Observation Journal\" with sketches and notes: \"What animals visited today? What were they doing?\"\n   - This connects pollination to real-world habitat and biodiversity (2-LS4-1).\n\n2. **Create a \"Pollinator Helper\" Craft:**\n   - Students make a bee puppet or butterfly puppet from paper bags, pom-poms, and pipe cleaners.\n   - Use the puppet to act out pollination with a paper flower: \"My bee is looking for nectar. Now my bee is moving pollen to a new flower!\"\n   - Perform a short skit for the class showing pollination in action.\n\n3. **\"If Bees Disappeared\" Discussion & Writing:**\n   - Pose the question: \"What would happen if all the bees disappeared from Earth?\"\n   - Facilitate a discussion about how flowers would be affected, then food for other animals, then people.\n   - Have students draw or write: \"Flowers need bees because _____\" or \"If there were no bees, then _____\"\n   - This deepens understanding of interdependence and ecosystems (foundation for later learning).\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Tips & Notes\n\n- **Timing:** The two 45-minute sessions can be split as: Session 1 (Engage + Explore, 45 min) and Session 2 (Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate, 45 min). Or run as one 90-minute block if your schedule allows.\n\n- **Safety:** Yellow paint is non-toxic, but remind students not to taste the honey on the paper flowers. If a student has a bee allergy, reassure them this is safe—no real bees are present.\n\n- **Real flowers:** If you can obtain flowers from a garden or florist, bringing them in during Explain/Elaborate is powerful. Students can smell the nectar and see real pollen up close. Handle gently to preserve.\n\n- **Prior knowledge gaps:** Some students may fear bees or have only negative associations. Use this lesson to build appreciation: \"Bees aren't trying to hurt us. They're just visiting flowers for food, and they help plants in the process. Bees are helpful!\"\n\n- **Language-learner support:** Use consistent gesture language throughout (point to flower, make drinking motion for nectar, brush motion for pollen). Repeat key vocabulary multiple times in context.\n\n- **Connection to standards:** This lesson explicitly meets 2-LS2-2 (model showing animal's role in pollination) and supports 2-LS4-1 (observation of plants and animals in nature). It builds foundational understanding for later grades' ecosystems and interdependence standards.",
