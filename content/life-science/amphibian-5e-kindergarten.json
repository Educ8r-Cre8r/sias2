ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about frogs and what animals need.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of frogs (printed in color or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: toy frog or frog puppet\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around printed copies. Allow students to look closely for 1–2 minutes without speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (in sequence, allowing time for responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you tell me about these animals?\"\n   - \"What are these creatures called? Have you ever seen a frog? Where?\"\n   - \"Look carefully at the frog's body. What body parts do you notice? Point to its legs, eyes, and skin.\"\n   - \"What do you think this frog needs to be happy and healthy? What must it have?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what these frogs do every day to stay alive. What do you think they eat? Where do they sleep? Do they need water?\"\n\n4. **Create a class \"Wonder Chart\"** on chart paper. Write student predictions: \"Frogs need...\" and list what students think (water, food, a home, air, etc.).\n\n**Transition:** \"Great ideas! Let's explore what frogs really need by watching them and creating a frog habitat.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what frogs need by observing carefully and creating a simple frog habitat model.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small clear containers or plastic cups (one per pair or small group)\n- Soil or pebbles\n- Water (spray bottle or small cup)\n- Leaves, grass, or small sticks\n- Pictures of frogs in different environments (water, land, trees—for reference)\n- Observation sheets (simple drawings with labels: \"What does a frog need?\")\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Optional: live tadpoles or frog photos in sequence (tadpole → young frog → adult frog)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Show reference pictures** of frogs in their natural homes (pond, forest, wetland). Say: \"Frogs live in special places. Let's figure out what makes a good frog home.\"\n\n2. **Divide students into pairs or small groups.** Give each group a clear container and the materials listed above.\n\n3. **Provide simple directions** (use visuals and demonstrate):\n   - \"First, put soil and pebbles in your container. This is like the land where frogs rest.\"\n   - \"Now add some water. Frogs need water to stay wet and to find food.\"\n   - \"Add leaves and sticks so the frog has a place to hide. This is a shelter.\"\n   - \"Think about what else the frog needs—do they need air? Yes! We'll leave the top open or use a container with small air holes.\"\n\n4. **Ask guiding questions as students work:**\n   - \"Why do you think the frog needs water?\"\n   - \"Where would the frog hide in your habitat?\"\n   - \"What would the frog eat? Can you find or draw a small insect?\"\n\n5. **Observation task:** Give each student/group a simple worksheet showing a large frog outline. Students draw or label what their frog needs inside and around it: water, food, shelter, air.\n\n6. **Documentation:** Students draw or dictate what they added to their habitat and why.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask follow-up questions: \"Tell me about your habitat. Why did you add that?\"\n- Listen to student thinking without correcting; note misconceptions for the Explain phase.\n- Encourage students to observe carefully and make connections.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a simple habitat containing water, shelter, and land.\n- Students can point to and name at least two things frogs need.\n- Students record or draw observations showing what they included and why.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and concepts; connect Explore discoveries to the photograph and frog survival needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of frogs (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- Visual aids (pictures of frogs with body parts labeled)\n- Large poster board or digital display\n- Index cards with vocabulary terms and pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore:** Invite 3–4 groups to show their habitat and explain one thing they added. Ask: \"Why did you choose that?\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** with pictures and simple explanations:\n   - **Frog:** An animal that lives in water and on land.\n   - **Habitat:** A place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs.\n   - **Shelter:** A safe place to hide, rest, and stay cool.\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive (e.g., strong legs for jumping, skin that stays wet).\n\n3. **Revisit the photograph.** Point to specific features:\n   - \"Look at the frog's legs. They are long and strong. Why? So the frog can jump far and escape from danger!\"\n   - \"See the frog's skin? It looks bumpy and wet. Frogs use their skin to breathe and drink water. Neat!\"\n   - \"Frogs need water, food (like insects), shelter (under logs and leaves), and air.\"\n\n4. **Connect to the Wonder Chart:** Review the original predictions. Ask:\n   - \"We thought frogs need water—let's confirm. Why is water so important?\" (Frogs breathe through their skin, drink through their skin, lay eggs in water.)\n   - \"What about food? What do real frogs eat?\" (Insects, small creatures.)\n   - \"Did we think frogs need shelter? Let's look at the photograph again—where might these frogs hide?\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Show the photograph again. Ask: \"Can you point to the frog's legs? What do they help the frog do?\"\n   - \"I'm going to say a word. Show me with your body or tell me: If I say 'habitat,' what does that mean?\" (the place where the frog lives)\n   - Thumbs up/down: \"Do frogs need water? Do frogs need to fly?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Frog** | An animal with strong back legs, bumpy skin, and big eyes. Frogs live in water and on land. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives. A frog's habitat has water, land, and plants. |\n| **Shelter** | A safe place to hide and rest. Frogs hide under rocks, logs, and leaves. |\n| **Adaptation** | A body part or thing an animal does that helps it stay alive. Frog legs help them jump. Wet skin helps them breathe. |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy. Animals survive when they have what they need. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least three things frogs need (water, food, shelter, air).\n- Students understand that frogs have special body parts to help them survive.\n- Students can use one new vocabulary word in a sentence (with support).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by exploring what happens when frogs don't have what they need.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Pictures or videos of frog habitats (healthy vs. unhealthy)\n- Drawing paper and crayons\n- Optional: Frog life cycle cards (egg → tadpole → young frog → adult frog)\n- Picture cards showing: frog in water (safe), frog in dry place (not safe), frog with food nearby, frog with no shelter\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario exploration:** Show two pictures side by side:\n   - Picture A: A healthy pond with water, plants, rocks, and insects.\n   - Picture B: A dry, empty space with no water or shelter.\n   \n   Ask: \"Which place is better for a frog? Why? What would happen to the frog in the dry place?\"\n\n2. **Sorting activity:** Give students picture cards or simple drawings showing:\n   - A frog by a pond ✓ (safe place)\n   - A frog on dry pavement ✗ (not safe)\n   - A frog in tall grass ✓ (shelter)\n   - A frog in bright sunlight with no shade ✗ (not safe)\n   \n   Students sort or discuss: \"Would a frog be happy and healthy here? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Frog life cycle connection (if time allows):** Show or read a short sequence of how frogs grow:\n   - Eggs in water → Tadpoles with tails → Young frogs with legs → Adult frogs\n   - Discuss: \"Tadpoles live only in water. Adult frogs need water AND land. Why do you think that is?\"\n\n4. **Create a \"Frog Needs\" poster:** Students contribute drawings or cutouts to a class poster titled \"A Frog Needs...\" with sections for water, food, shelter, and air.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide thinking with questions: \"What would happen if...?\"\n- Accept all answers; redirect to evidence: \"Let's look at the picture. Can you see water there?\"\n- Celebrate connections: \"I like how you connected the frog's wet skin to needing water!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain (in simple terms) why a habitat is or isn't good for frogs.\n- Students identify consequences: \"If there's no water, the frog's skin gets dry and it can't breathe.\"\n- Students contribute to a class resource showing what frogs need.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of frog needs and adaptations.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Can students include water, shelter, and land in their habitat?\n- Listen to group discussions: Do students use vocabulary correctly? Can they explain \"why\"?\n- Check comprehension during Explain: Thumbs up/down responses, think-pair-share answers.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nAdminister one of these options (choose based on your class):\n\n**Option 1 (Draw & Label):**\n- Give each student a simple frog outline.\n- Ask: \"Draw three things this frog needs to survive.\"\n- Students draw and label (with your help if needed) or dictate labels.\n\n**Option 2 (Verbal/Listen & Respond):**\n- Ask each student individually or in small groups:\n  - \"Tell me one thing a frog needs to stay alive.\"\n  - \"Why does a frog need water?\"\n  - \"What is a shelter? Can you point to the shelter in our photograph?\"\n\n**Option 3 (Picture Sort):**\n- Show 4 pictures: water, insects, shelter, rocks.\n- Ask: \"Which of these does a frog need? Point to it and tell me why.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\nStudents demonstrate understanding when they:\n- ✓ Name at least **two** things frogs need (e.g., water + food OR water + shelter).\n- ✓ Use **observable evidence** from the photograph or their habitat (e.g., \"Frogs need water because they drink it and breathe through their skin\").\n- ✓ Connect a **body part** to survival (e.g., \"The frog has long legs so it can jump away\").\n- ✓ Use one new **vocabulary word** (habitat, shelter, adaptation, survive) in context.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify at least two frog needs with prompting.\n- 70% of students can explain one reason why frogs need something (with support).\n- Students demonstrate emerging understanding of habitats and adaptations appropriate for kindergarten.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on \"frog,\" \"water,\" \"food,\" and \"home\" rather than all five terms. Pre-teach vocabulary with picture cards one-on-one.\n\n2. **Provide sentence stems:** During discussions and exit tickets, offer frames like:\n   - \"A frog needs _______ because _______.\"\n   - \"I see _______ in the picture.\"\n   \n3. **Simplify the habitat task:** Pre-fill containers with water and soil. Students only add shelter materials (leaves, sticks). Provide photo cards showing what to add rather than open-ended choices.\n\n4. **Use hand-over-hand or peer support:** Pair with a strong student during Explore. Allow nonverbal responses (pointing, drawing, acting out) instead of speaking.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Compare habitats:** Provide pictures of frog habitats AND other animal habitats (turtle pond, bird nest, squirrel burrow). Ask: \"What does this animal need? How is it different from a frog?\" Extend to recognizing that all animals need similar basics but in different ways.\n\n2. **Investigate life cycles:** Show tadpole and frog pictures in sequence. Ask: \"Why do you think a tadpole lives only in water, but an adult frog can live on land too?\" Create a simple frog life cycle poster.\n\n3. **Design a better habitat:** Provide a larger container and more materials (sand, pebbles, multiple plants, water, insect pictures). Challenge: \"Make the BEST habitat for a frog. Think about what would make it happiest and safest.\" Have students explain their design choices.\n\n4. **Predict and explain:** Show the photograph and ask: \"Where do you think these frogs came from? What season is it? How do you know?\" Encourage inferences based on visible details.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frog Life Cycle Book:** Students create a 4-page mini-book showing the life cycle: egg → tadpole → young frog → adult frog. Add one sentence per page (dictated or drawn). Read-aloud: *From Tadpole to Frog* by Gauld or a similar picture book.\n\n2. **Frog Sensory Station:** Set up stations with different materials (water, wet sponges, textured cloth, smooth rocks) and pictures of frog body parts. Students explore: \"How does this feel? Do frogs need to feel different things?\" Discuss adaptations (bumpy skin, webbed feet, strong legs).\n\n3. **Compare: Frogs vs. Other Animals:** Create a Venn diagram or chart comparing frogs, fish, and ducks. What do they all need? What is different? Students draw or place pictures in the correct sections. Discuss: \"All animals need water, food, and shelter, but in different ways.\"\n\n4. **Classroom Tadpole / Frog Observation Tank:** If safe and appropriate, set up a small, monitored tank with tadpoles (or use a virtual observation). Record daily observations, measure growth, and track the transformation over weeks. Students create a class journal with drawings and observations.\n\n5. **Frog Movement Activity:** Use the photograph to inspire movement. Students practice frog movements: \"Show me how a frog sits. How does it jump? How does it land?\" Discuss why frogs have long, strong back legs. Create a frog movement song or chant.\n\n---\n\n**Lesson Plan Complete.**\n\nThis kindergarten-appropriate 5E lesson centers on observable features in the photograph to build understanding of what animals (specifically frogs) need to survive, directly addressing K-LS1-1. All activities use concrete, familiar materials and age-appropriate language while encouraging students to observe, wonder, and explain using evidence from the image and their own exploration.",
