Exploring Animal Homes in Nature\"**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 40-minute sessions (or flexible across two days)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - **1-LS1-1:** Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n  - **1-LS3-1:** Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that young plants and animals are like, but not exactly like, their parents.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Identify** at least three different animals that live in forests and describe one place where they make their homes.\n2. **Explain** why forests are good homes for animals by naming at least two things animals find there (food, shelter, water).\n3. **Observe** the features of a forest (trees, plants, space) and match those features to what animals need to survive.\n4. **Create or draw** a forest animal home and label one part that helps the animal survive.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by exploring the photograph and activating prior knowledge about homes and habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Aerial forest photograph (displayed large on screen, projector, or printed poster)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** in a location where all students can see it clearly. Give students 30 seconds of silent \"look and wonder\" time—no talking yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions one at a time, allowing 10-15 seconds of think time before raising hands:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me the colors you notice.\"\n   - \"Do you see any animals in this picture? Where might the animals be hiding?\"\n   - \"This is called a forest. Who has ever been to a forest or seen trees like these? What was it like?\"\n   - \"If you were a squirrel or a bird, would this be a good home? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what animals make their homes in this forest and why they choose to live here. Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Record 2-3 student ideas on chart paper:** \"Where do you think animals sleep/hide in a forest?\" Keep this visible for the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \n\"Today we're going to explore what animals live in forests and why forests make great homes for them!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate forest habitats and discover why animals live there through hands-on exploration and observation.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- A \"forest in a box\" (or \"habitat exploration station\") containing:\n  - A shallow container or shoebox with soil/sand base\n  - Small sticks, branches, leaves, moss, twigs (collected or artificial)\n  - Toy/plastic animals (squirrels, birds, rabbits, insects, deer)\n  - Water in a small container or dish\n- Picture cards of forest animals (8-10 different animals labeled with names)\n- Clipboards with paper for drawing/recording\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but engaging)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1:** Divide students into small groups. Assign each group a \"forest habitat station\" with the materials above.\n\n**Step 2:** Give students clear directions:\n   - \"Look at your forest home. What do you see that animals might need?\" (Let them explore freely for 3-4 minutes.)\n   - \"Pick one toy animal. Where would it like to sleep or hide in this forest? Why? Show me with the toy.\"\n   - \"Now, let's look at the animal picture cards. Which animals do you think would live in a forest like this? Why?\" (Provide 2-3 cards at a time.)\n\n**Step 3:** **Recording task:** Students draw or mark on their clipboard paper:\n   - One animal they found/placed in the forest\n   - One thing in the forest that helps that animal (tree branch, leaves, water, etc.)\n   - Teacher scribe alternative: Teacher walks around and asks, \"Tell me about your animal's home. What does it need?\" and writes their responses.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and listen to student thinking without correcting.\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"Why did you put the squirrel there?\" \"What do you think the rabbit is doing?\"\n- Guide placement by asking, not telling: \"Where do birds like to be? How would they get there?\"\n- Take brief notes on student observations for the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will place animals in logical forest locations (birds in trees, rabbits under leaves, etc.).\n- Students will identify 2-3 forest features that animals need (branches to climb, leaves for hiding, water to drink, etc.).\n- Drawings/recordings will show one animal and one reason they live in forests.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to forest ecology concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with title: \"What Do Forest Animals Need?\"\n- Picture of the aerial forest photograph (displayed again)\n- Vocabulary cards with images (trees, shelter, food, water, plants)\n- Marker\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Group Share (5 minutes)**\n- Ask 2-3 groups to show their forest habitats and explain where they placed an animal and why.\n- Teacher listens and rephrases using new vocabulary (see below): \"I see you put the squirrel up in the tree. We call that a **shelter**—a safe place to live.\"\n\n**Part 2: Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes)**\n\nCreate a simple anchor chart together. For each term, show the picture card and ask a student to point to an example in the photograph or habitat station:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Forest** | A place with lots of trees and plants growing together—like a neighborhood for animals. |\n| **Habitat** | A home or neighborhood where an animal lives and finds everything it needs (food, water, shelter). |\n| **Shelter** | A safe, cozy place where animals sleep, hide, and stay warm (like a hole in a tree or under leaves). |\n| **Plants** | Living things that grow from seeds—like trees, grass, and flowers. Animals eat some plants and hide in others. |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy by getting food, water, and shelter. |\n\nFor each term, ask: \"Can you find this in our forest picture?\" or \"Did you use this in your habitat station?\"\n\n**Part 3: Make Connections (5 minutes)**\n- Point back to the aerial photograph: \"All those trees we see from up high? That's a real forest. Hundreds of animals live there—just like the animals we put in our small forest.\"\n- Revisit the chart from Engage: \"You wondered where animals hide in forests. Now we know! They use **shelters** in the **habitat**.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Hold up a picture of a tree. \"Is this a shelter? A habitat? Or a plant? Turn to your neighbor and tell them.\"\n- Ask: \"If an animal doesn't have water or food, can it survive in a forest?\" (Elicit: No, it needs all three things.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use vocabulary words (forest, habitat, shelter, plants, survive) when describing where animals live.\n- Students will connect their habitat exploration to the real aerial forest photograph.\n- Students will understand that forests provide everything animals need.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students deepen understanding by designing a forest shelter for an animal and connecting to real-world animal adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Drawing paper or construction paper (one per student)\n- Colored pencils, crayons, markers\n- Modeling clay, craft sticks, leaves, and scraps (for 3D option)\n- Picture cards showing forest animals (from Explore) or photograph of real forest animals in their homes\n- Optional: Short video clip (2-3 minutes) of forest animals in their habitats (e.g., bird building a nest, squirrel in a tree hole)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Design a Forest Home (Recommended for all learners)**\n\n1. Show students pictures of real animal homes:\n   - A squirrel's nest in a tree\n   - A rabbit's burrow under ground\n   - A bird's nest\n   - A deer's shelter under thick branches\n\n2. Say: \"Animals build and find special shelters. You're going to design a perfect forest home for an animal!\"\n\n3. **Give students this task:**\n   - Pick one forest animal (squirrel, bird, rabbit, fox, or deer).\n   - Draw or build a shelter for that animal.\n   - The shelter must have at least ONE thing that helps the animal survive (a place to hide, a place to keep warm, protection from danger, etc.).\n   - Label or tell the teacher: \"This part helps my animal because...\"\n\n4. **Facilitation:**\n   - Provide sentence starter: \"My animal is a _____. It needs a shelter with _____ because _____.\"\n   - Ask guiding questions: \"What would keep your animal warm?\" \"Where would it be safe from bigger animals?\"\n   - Encourage creative use of materials but ground it in animal needs.\n\n**Option B: Compare Parent and Baby Animal Homes (Connection to 1-LS3-1)**\n\nIf time allows, introduce baby animals (kits, fawns, chicks):\n- Show pictures of a baby squirrel, baby bird, baby rabbit.\n- Ask: \"Does a baby squirrel need the same home as a grown squirrel? Why or why not?\"\n- \"What might be different? What might be the same?\"\n- Students draw or discuss: \"A grown-up _____ and a baby _____ both need shelter, but the baby also needs...\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create a labeled drawing or 3D model of a forest animal's home.\n- Students will explain at least one feature of the shelter and why it helps the animal.\n- Students will connect the design to real animals in real forests.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of forest habitats and animal needs.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** During Explore and Elaborate, note which students:\n  - Can match animals to appropriate forest locations\n  - Use new vocabulary (habitat, shelter, plants, survive)\n  - Explain why animals live in forests with 2+ reasons\n- **Student Drawings/Models:** Review Explore recordings and Elaborate creations for evidence of understanding.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\nAdminister as a brief conversation or drawing task. Show the photograph again and ask:\n\n**Option 1: Question and Draw**\n- \"Point to the forest in the picture. Now draw one animal that lives there. Under your drawing, write or tell me one thing that animal needs to survive.\"\n\n**Option 2: Oral Exit Ticket**\nAsk each student (or small groups) these three questions:\n1. \"What animal lives in a forest?\" (Student names any forest animal)\n2. \"Why is a forest a good home for that animal?\" (Student names at least one: shelter, food, water, or plants)\n3. \"What would happen if all the trees disappeared?\" (Student connects trees to animal survival)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they can:\n- ✓ Name at least one forest animal\n- ✓ Identify at least one thing forests provide (shelter, food, water, plants)\n- ✓ Use or understand at least two vocabulary words (habitat, shelter, plants, survive)\n- ✓ Explain why an animal needs a forest habitat (with one reason)\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Keep drawings and recordings in student portfolios.\n- Note any students who struggled with vocabulary or the concept of \"habitat\" for small-group review before next lesson.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:** Provide picture-word cards students can point to instead of saying words. Simplify definitions further:\n   - \"Forest = many trees\"\n   - \"Shelter = safe home\"\n   - \"Survive = stay alive\"\n\n2. **Habitat Station Modification:** Pre-place toy animals in correct locations so student only needs to identify where they are and why. Ask: \"Is the bird in a tree or underground? Why is that a good spot?\"\n\n3. **Drawing Support:** Offer pre-drawn forest outlines (tree, ground, sky) so student only adds an animal and one shelter feature. Sentence frame: \"This animal lives in the _____. It hides in/under the _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Multi-Animal Habitat Design:** \"Design a forest where THREE different animals can live together. Show where each one lives and why they don't bother each other. Can they share anything?\" (Encourages ecosystem thinking and observation of niche.)\n\n2. **Parent-Offspring Adaptation Task:** Show pictures of a parent animal and baby animal (e.g., adult deer and fawn). \"How is a baby animal's shelter different from a grown-up's? What does a baby need that a grown-up doesn't?\" (Connects to 1-LS3-1 and 1-LS1-2.)\n\n3. **Forest Problem-Solving:** Present a scenario: \"A forest loses all its water. Can the animals still live there? What would happen? What would they need to do?\" (Develops reasoning about habitat requirements and adaptation.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Forest Walk & Observation Journal (Outdoor or Virtual)**\n   - Take students on a nature walk (or show a video of a forest walk) and have them mark/draw animals they see or animal signs (nests, holes, footprints, etc.).\n   - Discuss: \"This is a real habitat! What did we find that animals need?\"\n\n2. **Animal Homes Around Us**\n   - Expand to non-forest habitats: Where do animals live near your school? (playground, garden, pond, bushes)\n   - Students observe and draw: \"This animal lives here because _____ is here.\"\n   - Compare to forest animals: \"How are these habitats alike and different?\"\n\n3. **Create a Classroom \"Living\" Forest**\n   - Set up a small terrarium or large container with soil, plants, water, and safe insects or pill bugs.\n   - Observe for 1-2 weeks: \"What do the animals do? Where do they go? What do they need to survive?\"\n   - Daily observation journal with drawings.\n\n4. **Family Connection: Home Hunt**\n   - Send home a simple sheet: \"Look for an animal home near your house (bird nest, ant hill, spider web, squirrel hole). Draw it and tell us about it.\"\n   - Share at circle time next week and compare to forest habitats.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Pacing Flexibility:** This lesson can stretch across 2-3 short sessions (one 20-minute Engage/Explore, one 20-minute Explain, one 15-20 minute Elaborate) or condense into one extended block if your schedule allows.\n- **Real Habitat Connection:** If possible, bring in a small branch with bark, leaves, or moss from outside so students can touch and smell a real forest piece. This concrete sensory experience greatly enhances learning at this age.\n- **Vocabulary Exposure:** Introduce words gradually and repeat them often. Don't expect all students to master all terms by the end—first graders are still learning to use new words.\n- **Photo Revisiting:** The aerial photograph is powerful because it shows scale and diversity—revisit it in the Explain and Elaborate phases to deepen understanding of how many animals live in one big forest.\n\n---\n\n**You're ready to teach this lesson! The combination of the striking aerial photo, hands-on exploration, and concrete animal engagement will help first graders understand that forests are living habitats—not just pretty places to look at.**",
