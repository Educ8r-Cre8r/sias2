ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the vibrant pink and yellow flower.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copies or digital display of the flower photograph (one per student or one for whole-class display)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: 3-4 fresh flowers with varying characteristics brought to class\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or provide printed copies to small groups. Allow 1-2 minutes of silent observation.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"Where do you think the beautiful pink color in this flower's petals came from? Who or what gave it this color?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the center of the flower is yellow and looks so different from the petals? What might be its job?\"\n   - \"If this plant made seeds, what do you think the baby plants would look like? Would they look exactly like this one or a little different? Why?\"\n   - \"What materials do you think this plant needed to grow big and strong enough to make such a beautiful flower?\"\n\n3. **Record student predictions** on chart paper under the heading \"Our Wondering About Flowers.\" Accept all ideas without judgment.\n\n4. **Show actual flowers (if available)** and pass them around for careful observation. Ask: \"Are any of these flowers exactly the same? How are they different?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become plant detectives. We're going to investigate where plants come from and how they get the things they need to grow. We'll also explore why flowers in the same garden can look different from each other.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant traits and how plants obtain materials through hands-on observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Fresh flowers (at least 3-4 with noticeable differences in color, petal shape, or size)\n- Hand lenses (1 per pair of students)\n- Observation sheets (student worksheet provided below)\n- Potted plant or plant cutting in water (to show water uptake)\n- Ruler (for measuring flower parts)\n- Paper towels\n- Clear cups or test tubes\n- Plant roots (if available; could be washed from soil or brought from outside)\n- Blue-tinted water (food coloring + water) or celery cutting in colored water (prepared ahead)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Trait Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute flowers** to small groups (2-3 students per group) along with hand lenses and observation sheets.\n\n2. **Provide these student directions:**\n   - \"Using your hand lens, carefully observe your flower. Look at the petals—what color are they? How many petals do you see? What shape are they?\"\n   - \"Look at the center of the flower. What color is it? Can you see tiny parts inside? What do you think they are for?\"\n   - \"Measure the width of the flower with your ruler. Write down all your observations on your sheet.\"\n   - \"Compare your flower to the flowers other groups are observing. How is your flower the same? How is it different?\"\n   - \"Record your similarities and differences.\"\n\n3. **What students should record:**\n   - A labeled sketch of their flower\n   - Color descriptions\n   - Petal count and shape description\n   - Size measurements\n   - Comparison chart (same/different from other flowers)\n\n**Part 2: Plant Materials Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display the blue-tinted water or colored celery cutting** that has been sitting for 24 hours.\n\n2. **Provide these student directions:**\n   - \"Look at how the celery (or flower stem) has changed colors. The water moved up through the tiny tubes in the stem. This shows that plants drink water, just like we do.\"\n   - \"Look at the plant roots (pass around examples). Roots are like straws that suck water from the soil.\"\n   - \"Plants also need air. The tiny holes on leaves (stomata) take in air from outside.\"\n   - \"With your partner, discuss: Where does the water go after it enters the plant? What does the plant use it for? Write your ideas.\"\n\n3. **What students should record:**\n   - Observations of the colored water moving through the stem\n   - A labeled drawing showing water entering through roots and moving up the stem\n   - Written predictions about what plants do with water and air\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups asking guiding questions: \"What details do you notice? How would you describe this to someone who hasn't seen it? Why do you think the water changed colors?\"\n- Do not provide answers; instead, ask students to make closer observations and think aloud.\n- Help students use hand lenses correctly and handle flowers gently.\n- Encourage students to compare observations across groups rather than expecting identical results.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will document specific plant traits (color, petal count, shape, size) and recognize variation among flowers.\n- Students will produce evidence that plants absorb water through their roots and transport it through their stems.\n- Students will begin to hypothesize about why plants need water and air.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after student exploration, connecting back to observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Diagram of a flowering plant (showing roots, stem, leaves, flower, and arrows for water/air movement)\n- Vocabulary cards or word wall\n- Images of plants that look different but are the same species\n- \"Where Plant Traits Come From\" anchor chart (teacher-prepared)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their flower observations and drawings.\n   - Ask: \"How were the flowers different? What caused those differences?\"\n   - Record observations on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Inherited traits:** Characteristics that a plant receives from its parent plants through genes. Just like you might have your mom's eyes, a plant might have its parent's flower color.\n   - **Genetic variation:** Differences in traits among individual plants of the same kind. Even though all zinnia flowers are zinnias, they can be pink, red, yellow, or orange because of different genes.\n   - **Genes:** Tiny instructions inside every plant cell that tell the plant what it should look like and how to grow.\n   - **Pollinator:** An animal (like a bee or butterfly) that carries pollen between flowers, helping plants make seeds and baby plants.\n   - **Reproduction:** The process by which plants (and animals) make babies or offspring.\n\n3. **Explain the connection to observations (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember how all your flowers looked a little different? That's because they inherited different traits from their parent plants. The genes from the parent plants gave each flower its special color and petal shape.\"\n   - \"Now, let's think about where plants get what they need to grow. Remember the colored water moving up the stem? **Plants get water from the soil through their roots.** They also get minerals from the soil that help them grow strong.\"\n   - \"But plants also need **air.** Tiny holes in the leaves called stomata take in air (especially carbon dioxide) from outside. Plants use this air to make food for energy—a process called photosynthesis.\"\n   - Display a simple diagram showing arrows: water in through roots, air in through leaves, and growth happening throughout.\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to a partner and explain: Where do plants get the water they need? Where do they get air? Why is it important that they get both?\"\n   - Call on 2-3 pairs to share. Listen for accurate use of vocabulary (roots, water, air, growth, traits).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the vocabulary terms correctly in sentences.\n- Students will explain that plants obtain water from soil (through roots) and air (through leaves).\n- Students will recognize that inherited traits come from parent plants and that genes create variation.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by creating a model and connecting concepts to real-world plant diversity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or poster board (1 per group)\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- Plant images (varieties of the same species: different colored roses, tomato varieties, etc.)\n- Model materials: pipe cleaners, yarn, paper, labels, arrows for showing movement\n- Optional: simple seed catalog or plant nursery photos\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the modeling task (2 minutes):**\n   - \"You're going to create a poster model that shows **how a plant gets what it needs and how it develops its traits.** Your model should show water coming in through roots, air coming in through leaves, and the traits the plant inherited from its parents.\"\n\n2. **Provide these group directions (10 minutes):**\n   - \"On your large paper, draw a plant (flowers, stem, roots, and leaves).\"\n   - \"Use arrows to show: water entering from the soil, air entering through leaves, and movement of these materials up the stem.\"\n   - \"Label each part and what it does.\"\n   - \"On another section of your poster, show: 'Inherited Traits' and draw 2-3 examples of how the same type of plant can look different (use the images provided).\"\n   - \"Include labels explaining that genes from parent plants cause these differences.\"\n\n3. **Real-world connection (5 minutes):**\n   - Show images of plant varieties: heirloom tomatoes in different colors, roses in different shades, zinnia varieties, etc.\n   - Ask: \"These are all tomatoes (or roses), but they look different. Why? What do they all still need to grow—water and air—even if they look different?\"\n   - Have students discuss how gardeners choose plants with certain traits (like color or size) to grow, but all plants still need the same basic materials.\n\n4. **Gallery walk (3 minutes):**\n   - Post finished models around the room.\n   - Have students do a quick silent walk to see others' models and notice similarities and differences.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask prompting questions: \"What does this arrow show? Why did you put that trait as inherited? Where does a plant get its energy from?\"\n- Ensure students are connecting both standards: plant materials (water/air) AND inherited traits from parent plants.\n- Provide encouragement and redirect without giving answers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce a visual model showing water and air entering a plant and supporting its growth.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that plant traits are inherited and that variation exists.\n- Students articulate the connection between environmental materials (water, air) and plant growth/reproduction.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant materials and inherited traits using formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- **During Explore:** Circulate and review student observation sheets. Look for accurate descriptions of flower traits and correct identification of water movement.\n- **During Explain:** Listen to partner discussions and call-outs. Note which students correctly use vocabulary terms and can explain where plants get water and air.\n- **During Elaborate:** Review models for accurate depiction of water/air movement and inherited trait examples.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an index card or digital form with the following questions:\n\n1. **Look at the flower photograph again.** What color are the petals, and where do you think the plant got the genes to make that color? (Where did those genes come from?)\n\n2. **Draw and label a simple plant.** Show with arrows where water comes in and where air comes in. Write one sentence explaining why plants need both.\n\n3. **True or False:** All plants of the same kind (like all zinnias) look exactly the same. Explain your answer.\n\n4. **Challenge:** If you were a gardener and wanted to grow pink flowers, how might you choose your parent plants to grow seeds from? What would you need to give those plants to help them grow?\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Student demonstrates mastery if they:**\n- Correctly identify that flower color is inherited (from parents/genes)\n- Accurately label a plant showing water entering roots and air entering leaves\n- Explain that water and air are both essential for plant growth and health\n- Recognize and explain genetic variation (plants of the same kind can look different)\n- Apply understanding to real-world gardening scenario\n- Use vocabulary terms (genes, inherited traits, water, air, roots) correctly and appropriately\n\n✓ **Student shows developing understanding if they:**\n- Partially identify inherited traits but need prompting on genes\n- Label plant parts but miss showing movement of materials\n- Recognize plants need water and air but struggle to explain why\n- Acknowledge variation exists but cannot fully explain the cause\n\n✓ **Student needs support if they:**\n- Cannot identify how traits are inherited\n- Struggle to show water and air movement in a plant\n- Confuse why plants need different materials\n- Do not recognize variation among similar plants\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified observation sheets:** Provide pre-drawn flower diagrams where students only need to fill in colors, count petals, or circle descriptions rather than generating their own sketches. Include sentence frames like \"My flower is ___ (color). It has ___ petals.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary anchoring:** Create a visual vocabulary wall with pictures alongside words (roots, traits, genes, water, air). Use the same images repeatedly during instruction. Pair students with stronger language learners during group work.\n\n3. **Guided modeling:** Provide a partially completed plant model template where students fill in labels and arrows with teacher or peer support rather than creating from scratch. Offer 3-4 specific examples of inherited traits already drawn; students choose and label 2.\n\n4. **Think-aloud strategies:** When explaining water uptake, physically demonstrate by pouring water into a cup and describing what happens: \"I pour water in. The plant roots are like a straw. The water goes up, up, up through the stem to feed the plant.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extended research:** Have students research and create posters about **pollination and genetic mixing.** Questions to guide: \"What happens when a bee takes pollen from one flower to another? Do the baby plants inherit traits from both parents? How does this create variation?\" Students can draw punnett squares or trait inheritance diagrams for simple plant traits.\n\n2. **Ecosystem connection:** Ask: \"Plants need water and air. Where does the water cycle fit in? How do plants help move water and air around our environment? Create a model or poster showing how a plant is part of the water cycle and air cycle in a garden ecosystem.\"\n\n3. **Comparative species study:** Provide images of multiple species in the same genus (e.g., different types of roses or multiple daisy species). Have students compare and contrast traits, hypothesize about shared ancestors, and create a visual \"family tree\" showing how different varieties might be related through inherited traits.\n\n4. **Design challenge:** \"Imagine you are a plant breeder. Your goal is to create a flower that is large, very colorful, and smells sweet. Which parent plants would you choose to breed together? What traits would each parent need to have? Explain your reasoning based on genetics.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Dissection and Germination Experiment:**\n   Students carefully open bean or sunflower seeds to examine the embryonic plant inside. Plant seeds in clear cups with soil and water. Over 2-3 weeks, observe and measure root growth, stem growth, and leaf emergence. Document with photos or drawings and discuss how water and air support development. Connect to the understanding that inherited information (genes in the seed) directs growth when given proper materials (water, air, light).\n\n2. **Pollinator and Trait Connection Project:**\n   Research an animal pollinator (bee, butterfly, hummingbird) and the flowers it pollinates. Create an information poster showing: the pollinator, the flowers it visits, the traits of those flowers that attract the pollinator (color, shape, scent), and how this relationship helps plants reproduce. Discussion prompt: \"Why might certain flower traits have evolved? How do pollinators 'select' which traits survive?\"\n\n3. **Garden Planning Challenge:**\n   Using seed catalogs or online plant databases, have students plan a pollinator garden. They must choose at least 4 different flowers, identify their traits (height, color, bloom time), explain what materials (water, sunlight, soil) each needs, and create a diagram showing where they would plant each one. Bonus: Calculate water needs or discuss how to support local pollinators. This connects plant material needs (5-LS1-1) with ecosystem relationships (5-LS2-1).\n\n4. **Time-Lapse Growth Journal:**\n   If possible, set up a fast-growing plant (bean, radish, or lettuce) with controlled variables (one with water and light, one with only water, one with only light). Have students predict, observe weekly, measure growth, and graph results. Create a scientific poster showing how different materials affect growth rate and plant health, supporting the argument that water and light are essential (5-LS1-1).\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Student Observation Sheet Template\n\n**Name: _________________________ Date: _____________**\n\n**Flower Observation Sheet**\n\n**Part 1: My Flower**\n\nDraw your flower:\n\n[Space for sketch]\n\n**Describe your flower:**\n- Petal color(s): _________________________________\n- Number of petals: _____\n- Petal shape: _________________________________\n- Center (stamen) color: _________________________________\n- Total flower width (measured): _____ cm\n- Other interesting features: _________________________________\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Comparing Flowers**\n\nLook at the flowers in other groups.
