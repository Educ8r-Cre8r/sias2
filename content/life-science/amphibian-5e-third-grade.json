Identify and describe at least three structural features of a frog that help it survive in its environment.\n2. Use evidence from the photograph to explain how a frog's body parts help it live and move in its habitat.\n3. Compare the traits of different individual frogs and explain how some traits help frogs survive better than others.\n4. Construct an argument about why frogs need specific habitats (like wet environments) to survive.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring the photograph of real frogs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (color preferred, at least 8.5\" × 11\")\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student science notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a document camera or board so all students can see clearly. Do not give any information yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds**, then have them turn to a partner and share one thing they notice about the animals in the picture.\n\n3. **Facilitate whole-group discussion** with these guiding questions (ask one at a time, allow wait time):\n   - \"What animal do you see in this photograph? How do you know?\"\n   - \"Look carefully at the frog's feet and legs. What do you notice? Why might a frog's feet look like that?\"\n   - \"There are frogs of different sizes in the picture. Why might frogs in the same family look a little different from each other?\"\n   - \"Where do you think these frogs live? What clues in their bodies tell you where they belong?\"\n\n4. **Create a \"Wonder Wall\"** on chart paper. Ask: \"What do you wonder about frogs and how they survive?\" Record 5-6 student wonderings (e.g., \"How do frogs climb on smooth walls?\" \"Why do frogs have bumpy skin?\" \"Can frogs live in dry places?\").\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be frog scientists and investigate how frogs' special body parts help them survive. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate frog adaptations through hands-on observation and comparison.\n\n**Materials (per student pair):**\n- Printed frog photograph (or access to the digital image)\n- Frog Adaptations Observation Sheet (provided below)\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Magnifying glass (optional)\n- Chart showing different habitats (provided by teacher: wet marsh, tree, pond, rocky ground)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1 – Detailed Observation (8 minutes)**\n- Distribute the **Frog Adaptations Observation Sheet** (see template at end of this section).\n- Instruct students: \"Look at the frogs in the photograph very carefully. Use your magnifying glass if you have one. On your sheet, circle the body parts you can see. Label: feet/toes, legs, eyes, skin texture, coloring.\"\n- Students work in pairs to identify and label at least 5 body parts on their observation sheet.\n\n**Step 2 – Comparative Analysis (10 minutes)**\n- Ask: \"Are the frogs all exactly the same? Look at the sizes, the colors, and any other differences you see.\"\n- Students complete the section: \"How are these frogs different from each other?\" by drawing and labeling 2-3 differences (e.g., one is larger, skin texture varies, slight color differences).\n- Prompt: \"If one frog is bigger, what might that tell us? Could the bigger one be older? Could it be better at escaping predators?\"\n\n**Step 3 – Habitat Matching (5 minutes)**\n- Display 4 habitat images: wet swamp, tree trunk, rocky pond shore, and dry grassland.\n- Ask: \"Which habitat would these frogs be best suited to live in? Why? Use what you learned about their body parts to explain.\"\n- Students place their photograph under the habitat they think is best and write one reason on their sheet (e.g., \"Frogs have sticky toe pads to climb trees\" or \"Frogs have moist skin so they need wet places\").\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"What do you see here?\" \"Why do you think that body part is helpful?\" \"How does this part help the frog survive?\"\n- Do NOT tell students answers; guide them to make observations first.\n- Take anecdotal notes on student observations for later discussion.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Observation sheets completed with labeled body parts and at least 2 differences identified.\n- Students articulate at least one connection between a frog body part and its function (e.g., sticky feet help with climbing; moist skin relates to wet habitats).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain how frog adaptations relate to survival and environmental influence.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary and definitions\n- Photograph (still visible)\n- Student notebooks\n- Optional: Picture cards showing frog body parts and their functions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A – Share Out and Discuss (8 minutes)**\n- Invite 3-4 student pairs to share their observations from the Explore phase.\n- Display their observation sheets and ask: \"What did you notice about the frog's feet?\" \"Why do you think these differences exist?\"\n- Reinforce observations: \"Great job noticing that frogs have different sizes. Scientists call this **variation**.\"\n\n**Part B – Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes)**\nUsing simple, direct language, write each term on chart paper and have students repeat:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment. (Example: Sticky toe pads help frogs climb.) |\n| **Trait** | A characteristic or feature of an animal that it inherits from its parents. (Example: The color or shape of a frog's skin.) |\n| **Variation** | Differences in traits among individuals of the same species. (Example: Some frogs are bigger or have different skin patterns than others.) |\n| **Environment** | The place where an animal lives, including the weather, water, plants, and other animals there. (Example: A wet swamp or a tree.) |\n| **Camouflage** | Coloring or patterns that help an animal hide or blend in with its surroundings. (Example: Gray speckled skin helps a frog blend into rocks and soil.) |\n\n**Part C – Connect to the Photograph (5 minutes)**\n- Point to different frogs in the image and ask:\n  - \"What adaptations do these frogs have?\" (Powerful hind legs for jumping; toe pads for climbing; moist skin for living in wet places.)\n  - \"Why do you think the frog's skin is bumpy and gray? How does that help it survive?\" (Camouflage—blends with rocks and plants; texture may help retain moisture.)\n  - \"We see three frogs of different sizes. Is size a trait? Could environment affect how big a frog grows?\" (Yes, size is inherited; yes, food and environment can influence growth.)\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Ask: \"Turn to your neighbor and explain: Why is a frog's sticky toe pad an adaptation?\" Listen to 2-3 pair explanations.\n- Quick verbal poll: \"Thumbs up if you think a frog would survive better in a dry desert or a wet swamp? Why?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define \"adaptation,\" \"trait,\" and \"environment\" in their own words.\n- Students identify at least two adaptations visible in the photograph and explain their purpose.\n- Students recognize that traits like size and color show variation among frogs.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by analyzing how specific frog traits provide advantages in survival and determining if frogs would thrive in different habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Habitat cards (wet swamp, forest canopy, pond shore, dry grassland) - 1 set per group\n- **Frog Survival Challenge Sheet** (provided below)\n- Colored pencils\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Task: The Frog Habitat Challenge**\n\n1. **Divide the class into 4 groups.** Assign each group one habitat card.\n\n2. **Present the scenario:** \"Imagine these three frogs need to move to your habitat. Based on what we've learned about frog adaptations, predict: Will this frog survive well, survive with difficulty, or not survive at all in your habitat? You must use evidence.\"\n\n3. **Each group completes the \"Frog Survival Challenge Sheet\":**\n   - Habitat: ________________\n   - **Frog Adaptations & Habitat Match:**\n     - \"These frogs have [adaptation]. This habitat has/needs [feature]. Does this match? Why or why not?\"\n     - Example: \"These frogs have moist, delicate skin. A dry grassland has very little water. This does NOT match because the frog's skin will dry out.\"\n   - **Survival Rating:** Circle one:\n     - ✓ Will survive well\n     - ? Will survive with difficulty  \n     - ✗ Cannot survive\n   - **Evidence:** Write or draw one reason from the photograph and what you know about the habitat.\n\n4. **Gallery Walk:** Post each group's response. Students walk around and read each one. Discuss as a class: \"Which habitat is best for these frogs? Which is worst? Why?\"\n\n5. **Synthesis Question:** \"What does this tell us about why frogs only live in certain places? Can you live anywhere you want? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group work by asking: \"What do these frogs need to survive?\" \"Does your habitat provide that?\"\n- Encourage evidence-based reasoning: \"Show me where in the photo you see that adaptation.\"\n- Push thinking: \"If frogs moved to a drier habitat, what might happen to their skin?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students construct an argument connecting frog adaptations to specific habitats.\n- Students provide at least one piece of evidence for their survival prediction.\n- Students articulate that organisms thrive best in habitats matched to their adaptations.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of frog adaptations, trait variation, and habitat dependence.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Note which students accurately identify body parts and articulate their functions.\n- **Listen-in during Explain:** Assess student ability to use new vocabulary in context.\n- **Group discussions during Elaborate:** Observe evidence-based reasoning and ability to make connections.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nAdminister this **3-question Exit Ticket** at the end of the lesson (individually, on paper or verbally):\n\n1. **Look at the frog in the photograph.** Point to one body part and tell me: How does this body part help the frog survive?\n\n2. **Why are wet swamps a better habitat for frogs than dry deserts?** Use one piece of evidence from the photo.\n\n3. **Two frogs in the photo are different sizes.** Is being bigger a trait? Can the environment affect how big a frog grows? Explain.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| **Criterion** | **Developing** | **Proficient** | **Advanced** |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Identifies adaptations** | Names a body part but struggles to explain its function | Names one body part and clearly explains one function (e.g., \"sticky feet help climb\") | Identifies multiple adaptations and explains how each aids survival |\n| **Uses evidence** | Provides limited or no reference to the photo | References the photo once; gives one clear reason | References photo details multiple times; uses multiple reasons |\n| **Understands trait variation** | Unclear about differences between frogs | Recognizes frogs look different; may note size or color | Explains size/color as traits influenced by inheritance and/or environment |\n| **Habitat reasoning** | No connection made | Connects one frog trait to habitat need (e.g., moist skin → wet place) | Constructs clear argument: multiple traits match habitat requirements |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify at least one frog adaptation and explain its survival purpose.\n- 75% of students can articulate why frogs need wet environments, citing evidence (moist skin, preference for water).\n- 70% of students recognize that frogs of different sizes show variation and this may be influenced by environment.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a pre-labeled diagram of a frog with only 3 key body parts to identify (feet, legs, eyes) rather than asking students to find 5+. Include visual sentence starters: \"The frog's feet look _____. This helps the frog _____.\"\n\n2. **Habitat Matching Reduced Complexity:** Instead of 4 habitats, present only 2 clear choices (wet swamp vs. dry desert) with large, obvious picture cards. Ask yes/no questions: \"Does a frog's moist skin need water? Does the desert have lots of water?\"\n\n3. **Buddy System:** Pair with a stronger reader/observer. Have the supporting student describe what they see while the struggling learner records or draws.\n\n4. **Vocabulary Support:** Provide a word bank with all 5 vocabulary terms and definitions on a card students can reference during Explain and Elaborate phases.\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Comparative Research Task:** Ask: \"Frogs live on every continent except Antarctica. Research or sketch two different types of frogs (e.g., tree frog vs. bullfrog). How are their adaptations different? Why do they have different adaptations?\" Students create a Venn diagram comparing traits and habitats.\n\n2. **Life Cycle Integration:** Extend to 3-LS1-1 by asking: \"Young tadpoles look very different from adult frogs. Why? How do their body parts change as they grow? Why would a tadpole need different adaptations than an adult frog?\" Have students create a labeled diagram of frog metamorphosis with adaptations at each stage.\n\n3. **Environmental Change Scenario:** Present a problem: \"A swamp is drying up due to climate change. What would happen to the frogs living there? Could they survive in a nearby forest? What adaptations would help them adapt?\" Students write a short explanation using evidence to support their claims.\n\n4. **Design Challenge:** \"Design a new frog that could live in a tree canopy. What adaptations would it need? Draw and label your frog, explaining each adaptation's purpose.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frog Observation Journal Project:** If live frogs or tadpoles are available (via classroom observation tank or local nature site visit), have students maintain a week-long observation journal, sketching and recording changes in body structures, behavior, and habitat use. Connect to 3-LS1-1 (life cycles) and 3-LS3-2 (environmental influence on traits).\n\n2. **Habitat Creation Challenge:** Provide small containers, soil, water, and craft materials. Challenge students (individually or in pairs) to create a miniature frog habitat that provides the conditions needed for survival. Students label each adaptation the frog would use and explain how their habitat meets those needs. Connect to 3-LS4-3 (habitat-organism matching).\n\n3. **Comparative Amphibian Study:** Expand to other amphibians (salamanders, newts, caecilians). Provide photographs and ask students to compare: \"Which amphibian adaptations are the same? Which are different? What different habitats do they live in?\" Create a poster or digital comparison showing how variation in traits relates to habitat diversity. Connects to 3-LS3-1 (variation in species).\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Reproducible Materials\n\n### Frog Adaptations Observation Sheet (For Explore Phase)\n\n**Name: ___________________________     Date: _______________**\n\n**Directions:** Carefully look at the frogs in the photograph.
