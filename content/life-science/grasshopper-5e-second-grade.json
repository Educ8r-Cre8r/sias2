ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the grasshopper on the seed pod (or displayed digitally on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: A live grasshopper in a clear container with plants (if available and safe)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Display and Introduction:**\nDisplay the photograph on a large screen or print it as a poster. Let students look silently for 15-20 seconds before asking questions. You might say: *\"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see? I'm going to ask you some questions about what's happening here.\"*\n\n**Discussion Questions:**\n1. \"What animal do you see in this picture? What is it doing?\" *(Students identify the grasshopper and notice it's on a flower or seed pod)*\n2. \"What color is the grasshopper? Why do you think it might be green and brown?\" *(Elicit ideas about hiding or blending in)*\n3. \"Do you see anything the grasshopper might be eating? What do you think?\" *(Students notice the plant/seed pod)*\n4. \"If you were a grasshopper, what would you need from plants?\" *(Students think about food and shelter)*\n\n**Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\nWrite these sentence starters on chart paper and have students complete one:\n- *\"I wonder why the grasshopper is on a flower...\"*\n- *\"I think the grasshopper uses this plant for...\"*\n- *\"I notice the grasshopper's legs look... because...\"*\n\nRecord 4-5 student responses on the chart to reference later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore how grasshoppers live in their plant homes and what special body parts help them survive!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Live grasshoppers (or crickets as substitute) in clear containers with ventilation holes\n- Fresh plant materials: grass clippings, clover, lettuce leaves, or dandelion leaves in cups\n- Magnifying glasses (1-2 per group)\n- Observation worksheet (see below)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Large paper for sketching\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Look at the grasshopper in your container. Use your magnifying glass to get a closer look. **Do not touch it yet!**\"\n\n2. \"Draw the grasshopper on your paper. Try to include: its head, body, legs, antennae, and wings if you can see them.\"\n\n3. \"Now watch what happens when we add fresh plants to the container. Where does the grasshopper go? Does it go toward the plants or away?\"\n\n4. \"Watch carefully for 3-5 minutes. Can you see the grasshopper's mouth moving? Can you see it eating? Draw what you see.\"\n\n5. \"Use your magnifying glass to look at the grasshopper's **back legs**. They look different from the front legs, don't they? How are they different? Can you make your own legs move like that?\"\n\n6. \"On your observation sheet, complete these sentences:\n   - The grasshopper has _______ long antennae.\n   - The back legs are _______ than the front legs.\n   - The grasshopper used the plants for _______.\n   - I noticed the grasshopper is colored _______ which helps it _______.\"\n\n**Connection to Photograph:**\nDisplay the original photograph again and ask: \"Is this grasshopper doing the same things your grasshopper is doing?\"\n\n**What Students Record:**\n- Labeled drawings of the grasshopper\n- Observations of body part differences\n- Notes about what the grasshopper does with the plants\n- Descriptions of color and camouflage\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nCirculate among groups and ask probing questions rather than telling:\n- *\"What do you notice about those back legs?\"*\n- *\"Why might the grasshopper stay near the green parts?\"*\n- *\"How is this grasshopper like the one in the picture?\"*\n\nDo **not** label parts; let students discover and describe them first.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that grasshoppers move toward plants\n- Students will notice the back legs are larger/longer\n- Students will see evidence of eating or chewing\n- Students will describe colors and placement in the habitat\n- Students will connect their observations to the photograph\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Labeled diagram of a grasshopper (teacher-created on poster board showing antennae, legs, wings, mouth)\n- The original photograph\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\nAsk 3-4 groups to share one observation:\n- *\"What did you notice about where the grasshopper stayed?\"*\n- *\"What did the grasshopper do with the plants?\"*\n- *\"How did the back legs look different?\"*\n\nRecord student words on chart paper (e.g., \"strong,\" \"bouncy,\" \"long,\" \"for eating\").\n\n**Formal Vocabulary Introduction:**\n\nPresent these terms with Second Grade-friendly explanations:\n\n1. **Antennae** (AN-ten-ee) - *\"The long feelers on the grasshopper's head. It uses them to sense things around it, like smelling food or feeling the ground.\"*\n\n2. **Adapt or Adaptation** - *\"A body part or color that helps an animal survive in its home. The grasshopper's green color is an adaptation because it helps the grasshopper hide in green plants.\"*\n\n3. **Habitat** - *\"The place where an animal lives. For a grasshopper, its habitat is plants and grass where it can find food and hide.\"*\n\n4. **Camouflage** (CAM-uh-flaj) - *\"Colors and patterns that help an animal blend in with its surroundings so predators can't see it easily. The grasshopper's green-and-brown color is camouflage.\"*\n\n5. **Depend** - *\"To need something to live. Grasshoppers depend on plants for food and shelter.\"*\n\n**Connection to Photograph & Explore Activity:**\nPoint to the photograph and say:\n*\"Look at this grasshopper. Its green color is camouflage—it matches the plant! Its long antennae help it find its way. Its strong back legs help it jump away from danger. Its mouth parts help it eat the plants. All of these things are adaptations that help the grasshopper survive on plants.\"*\n\nHold up student observation sheets and validate observations: *\"You noticed all of these things just like real scientists!\"*\n\n**Check for Understanding Strategy:**\nUse hand signals: \n- *\"If you saw the grasshopper's antennae working, show me thumbs up!\"*\n- *\"If you think camouflage helps the grasshopper hide, nod your head!\"*\n- *\"Show me with your fingers: How many pairs of back legs does a grasshopper have?\" (one pair—students show 2 fingers)*\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart:**\nCreate a visual anchor chart with the five vocabulary words, simple definitions, and drawings. Leave it displayed for the rest of the unit.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use new vocabulary to describe grasshopper body parts\n- Students will understand that grasshoppers are adapted to life on plants\n- Students will recognize camouflage and adaptation as survival strategies\n- Students will articulate that grasshoppers depend on plants\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pictures of different grasshoppers in different habitats (brown grasshoppers on soil, striped grasshoppers on grass, etc.)—printed or digital\n- Chart paper\n- Colored paper and craft materials\n- Crayons, colored pencils, or markers\n- Optional: pictures of other insects that eat plants\n\n**Activity: \"Grasshoppers in Different Homes\"**\n\n**Setup:**\nShow pictures of grasshoppers in different habitats (brown ones on sandy soil, green ones in tall grass, etc.). Say:\n*\"Grasshoppers don't all look the same! Some are different colors. Let's think about why.\"*\n\n**Student Task:**\nIn small groups or pairs, students receive a scenario card with a picture and question:\n\n- **Scenario 1 (Grasshopper on sand):** \"This grasshopper lives on sandy ground. Why do you think this grasshopper is brown instead of green?\"\n\n- **Scenario 2 (Grasshopper on leaves):** \"This grasshopper lives in the forest where there are lots of dark plants. Why might this grasshopper be darker green than the one in the photo?\"\n\n- **Scenario 3 (Grasshopper on flowers):** \"This grasshopper lives on colorful wildflowers. It has spots and stripes. How does that help it?\"\n\nStudents discuss and record their thinking on a worksheet or chart paper with sentence starters:\n- *\"The grasshopper is _______ because...\"*\n- *\"This color helps it _______.\"*\n\n**Extension Thinking:**\nAsk: *\"What would happen if a green grasshopper lived on brown dirt? Would it survive? Why or why not?\"*\n\n**Connection to Real World:**\n*\"Animals adapt to where they live. Grasshoppers that live in different places have different colors. This is how living things survive in their habitats!\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nFacilitate discussion without providing answers. Use questions like:\n- *\"What does the grasshopper need to hide from?\"*\n- *\"What color is this grasshopper's home?\"*\n- *\"Would its color help or hurt it here?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will apply the concept of camouflage to new scenarios\n- Students will reason that adaptation is related to habitat\n- Students will deepen understanding that color serves a survival purpose\n- Students will recognize diversity among grasshoppers\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observation of student drawings during Explore phase\n- Listen to student explanations during group discussions\n- Check hand signal responses during Explain phase\n- Monitor participation in Elaborate discussions\n\n**Summative Exit Ticket (End of Lesson):**\nProvide each student with an exit ticket. Read questions aloud; students can draw, circle, or write responses:\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. \"Draw a grasshopper and label (or point to) one body part. What does this part help the grasshopper do?\"\n\n2. \"Why does the grasshopper in our picture blend in with the plant? Circle the reason:\n   - [ ] Because it's hiding\n   - [ ] Because it likes green\n   - [ ] Because it is very small\"\n\n3. \"Grasshoppers depend on plants. What do they get from plants?\" *(Acceptable answers: food, home, place to hide, shelter)*\n\n4. \"If a grasshopper lives in grass, what color do you think it should be? Why?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Meets Standards:** Student can:\n- Identify at least 2 grasshopper body parts and describe their function\n- Explain that grasshoppers depend on plants (for food/shelter)\n- Use the word \"camouflage\" or \"hide\" to explain how color helps grasshoppers survive\n- Describe a connection between a grasshopper and its plant habitat\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student can:\n- Identify grasshopper body parts\n- Recognize grasshoppers eat plants\n- Understand color relates to survival (with prompting)\n\n✓ **Beginning:** Student observes grasshoppers and plants but needs significant support to articulate connections\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets reveal whether students grasp camouflage, adaptation, and habitat concepts\n- Drawings show understanding of grasshopper structure and function\n- Verbal explanations demonstrate grasp of dependency between animals and plants\n- Students can transfer learning to new grasshopper scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-Label Body Parts:** Provide a half-labeled grasshopper diagram during Explore so students only need to identify 1-2 unlabeled parts. Gradually remove labels in future lessons.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Picture Cards:** Create a set of picture cards matching vocabulary words (antennae with picture, habitat with pictures of plants, camouflage with color examples). Students can sort or match instead of recalling.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Exit Ticket:** Instead of open-ended questions, provide options to circle or point to:\n   - \"A grasshopper's antennae help it ________ [see / smell / feel]\"\n   - \"The grasshopper's color is _______ [green / brown]\"\n   - \"The green color helps the grasshopper ________ [hide / jump / eat]\"\n\n---\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Compare Multiple Habitats:** Provide images of grasshoppers in 3-4 different habitats (desert, meadow, forest, field). Ask students to predict and explain color differences and predict what plants grow there. Challenge: *\"If a grasshopper's color changes based on its home, what does this tell us about how animals adapt?\"*\n\n2. **Food Web Connection:** Introduce the concept of what eats grasshoppers (birds, snakes, spiders). Ask: *\"If we remove all the plants, what happens to grasshoppers? What happens to the birds that eat grasshoppers?\"* Create a simple food chain together.\n\n3. **Grasshopper Life Cycle Research:** Provide pictures of grasshopper eggs, nymphs, and adults. Ask students to sequence the life cycle and predict: *\"At which stage does the grasshopper need plants the most? Why?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Design a Grasshopper\" Art Activity:** \n   Students create an imaginary grasshopper for a habitat they choose (volcano, jungle, snow, under the ocean). They must decide: What color? What size legs? What shape antennae? They write/draw explanations for why their design would help the grasshopper survive. *Connects to: adaptation and design thinking*\n\n2. **Grasshopper Habitats Diorama or Display:**\n   In small groups, students build a small habitat in a shoebox or large container showing plants, soil, and a grasshopper (drawn or model). They label the parts of the habitat (food, shelter, hiding place) and present to the class. *Connects to: habitat structure and animal needs*\n\n3. **\"If You Were a Grasshopper\" Role-Play:**\n   Students act out a day in a grasshopper's life: finding food, hiding from a predator, jumping to new plants. Teachers prompt: *\"What do you feel? What do you see? How does your body help you?\"* Discuss afterward what animals must do to survive. *Connects to: perspective-taking and animal behavior*\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Live Organisms:** If live grasshoppers aren't available, crickets work well as substitutes. If no live insects are available, high-quality videos of grasshoppers feeding on plants can be substituted, though hands-on observation is strongly preferred.\n  \n- **Safety Reminder:** Ensure all students wash hands after handling containers or insects. Remind students to be gentle with living things.\n\n- **Habitat Setup:** Keep grasshoppers/crickets in a well-ventilated container with plants for no more than 2-3 days, then release them outdoors in an appropriate location.\n\n- **Connection to 2-LS4-1:** This lesson emphasizes observing animals (grasshoppers) in their habitat (plants) and recognizing diversity in how animals are adapted. Students compare observations across different habitats if using the habitat pictures in Elaborate.\n\n- **Connection to 2-LS2-2:** While this lesson doesn't explicitly focus on seed dispersal, you can extend it by discussing how grasshoppers might accidentally move seeds on their bodies or in their feces, introducing the idea of how animals help plants.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson plan is ready to implement. The progression builds naturally from curiosity to hands-on discovery to formal vocabulary to application. Second graders will develop concrete understanding of how grasshoppers and plants are connected in a habitat while practicing observation skills like real scientists!",
