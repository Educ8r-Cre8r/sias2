ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about spiders and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the spider photograph (on screen, tablet, or printed copy for display)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed format where all students can see it clearly. Say: *\"Look carefully at this creature. What do you notice? This animal lives in dry, rocky places like deserts and canyons.\"*\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause 5–10 seconds after each for think time):\n   - *\"What body parts do you see on this animal? Count and describe them.\"*\n   - *\"Why do you think this spider has such long, thin legs? What might they help it do?\"*\n   - *\"The spider's body is dark. How might that color help it survive in a rocky, sandy place?\"*\n   - *\"Have you ever seen a spider? Where? What was it doing?\"*\n\n3. **Activate wonder:** Say, *\"Spiders look very different from insects like ants or bees. I wonder... what special powers do spiders have that help them live in places where it's hot and dry?\"* Write student wonderings on chart paper (e.g., \"Can spiders climb? Do spiders drink water? Why are their legs so long?\").\n\n4. **Show the photograph one more time** and ask: *\"What do YOU think helps this spider survive in this rocky habitat?\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to become spider scientists and discover how spiders' bodies are perfectly designed for survival!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate spider body parts and habitat adaptations through hands-on modeling and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pipe cleaners (8 per student or pair) — 2 longer ones for body, 6 for legs\n- Small foam balls or clay (pea-sized) for body and head\n- Markers or paint\n- Index cards (one per student/pair)\n- Printed diagram of spider body parts (optional, for reference)\n- Chart: \"Spider vs. Insect Comparison\" (blank for students to fill)\n- Soil, sand, rocks, or dried leaves in a shallow bin or tray\n- Tape\n\n**Activity – Student Directions:**\n\n**Part A: Build a Spider Model (12–15 minutes)**\n\n1. *\"You are going to build your own spider using pipe cleaners and a foam ball. This will help us understand how spider bodies are designed.\"*\n\n2. Demonstrate the build as students follow along:\n   - Take two longer pipe cleaners and twist them together to form the body (cephalothorax and abdomen).\n   - Form a small circle on one end with clay or foam; this is the spider's head.\n   - Attach six pipe cleaner legs in pairs: bend three pipe cleaners in half, twist each around the body near the head. Space them evenly.\n   - *\"Notice: spiders have 8 legs, not 6 like insects. Let's add one more pair.\"*\n   - Bend and shape the legs to show how a spider might move or climb.\n   - Use markers to color the spider dark (brown or black) to match the photograph.\n\n3. *\"As you build, think: Why might spiders need 8 legs instead of 6?\"*\n\n**Part B: Test Your Spider in Its Habitat (8–10 minutes)**\n\n4. *\"Now we're going to see how well your spider is designed for dry, rocky places.\"*\n\n5. Place soil, sand, and rocks in a shallow bin. Carefully move your pipe-cleaner spider across this \"habitat\":\n   - Can the long legs help the spider move across rocks?\n   - Does the small body help it hide in tight spaces?\n   - Observe and record: *\"How does my spider move? What body parts are most useful?\"*\n\n6. On an index card, students draw or write: *\"One thing that helps my spider survive is... because...\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions without giving answers: *\"What happens when you put the spider on a rock? Does it stay stable? Why do you think that happens?\"*\n- Encourage students to try different leg positions.\n- Ask: *\"Where would this spider hide in the rocky soil? Why?\"*\n- Document student observations on a chart titled \"Spider Survival Skills.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a model recognizing spider body structure (8 legs, body segments, head).\n- Students observe that long legs help with stability and movement across uneven terrain.\n- Students predict or discover that dark coloring helps the spider blend into rocky soil.\n- Students record at least one adaptation and provide a reason.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and anchor observations in scientific understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Spider body diagram (labeled: cephalothorax, abdomen, legs, spinnerets)\n- Photograph (display again)\n- Chart paper\n- Vocabulary cards with images\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Ask 4–5 students to share their index card observations. Chart key discoveries:\n   - *\"What did you find helped your spider survive?\"*\n   - *\"Why do you think long legs are important?\"*\n   - *\"Did the dark color matter?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with images and definitions (8–10 minutes):**\n   - Display each term with a simple diagram and student-friendly definition:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Arachnid:** An animal with 8 legs and a body in two parts. Spiders, scorpions, and ticks are arachnids. (Different from insects, which have 6 legs.)\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. (Like long legs for a spider!)\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. (This spider lives in dry, rocky places.)\n- **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or pattern helps it blend into its surroundings so predators can't easily see it. (This spider's dark color helps it hide on dark rocks!)\n- **Spinnerets:** Tiny parts at the end of a spider's abdomen that make silk for webs. (Not all spiders use them the same way!)\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (3–4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the spider's legs: *\"See these 8 long legs? That's an adaptation that helps this spider walk across rocks without getting stuck.\"*\n   - Point to the body color: *\"This spider is dark, like the soil and rocks around it. That's camouflage—it helps hide from animals that want to eat it!\"*\n   - Say: *\"This spider is an arachnid, not an insect. Spiders have special adaptations that insects don't have, and that helps them survive in different places.\"*\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"Turn to a partner and say: What is one adaptation that helps this spider survive?\"*\n   - Listen to 2–3 partner conversations to assess understanding.\n   - Ask: *\"Why is a spider an arachnid and not an insect?\"* (Look for: 8 legs vs. 6 legs.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the vocabulary terms correctly in sentences.\n- Students can identify at least two adaptations in the photograph (long legs, dark color).\n- Students understand the difference between arachnids and insects.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of adaptations to a new scenario and deepen thinking about habitat fit.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Habitat scenario cards (printed or written on chart paper) — see below\n- Chart: \"Can the Spider Survive Here?\"\n- Images of different habitats (optional: rainforest, Arctic, ocean, desert)\n- Markers, pencils\n- Student journals or response sheets\n\n**Activity – Habitat Matching Challenge:**\n\n1. **Introduce the scenario (2 minutes):**\n   - *\"We've learned that this spider has special adaptations for dry, rocky places. But what if we moved this spider to a different place? Would it survive? Let's investigate!\"*\n\n2. **Present habitat scenarios (10–12 minutes):**\n   - Divide students into pairs or small groups.\n   - Assign each group one of these scenarios:\n\n   **Scenario A: Wet Rainforest Habitat**\n   *\"It rains almost every day. The ground is wet and muddy. There are lots of tall plants and trees. Animals here include big spiders, frogs, and snakes.\"*\n   \n   **Scenario B: Arctic Snow Habitat**\n   *\"It's very cold and snowy. There are few plants. The ground is frozen. Animals here include polar bears, seals, and Arctic foxes.\"*\n   \n   **Scenario C: Desert Habitat (Like the Photo)**\n   *\"It's hot and dry. The ground is rocky and sandy. There's not much water. Animals here include other spiders, lizards, and scorpions.\"*\n   \n   **Scenario D: Tall Grass Field**\n   *\"There are lots of tall grasses and wildflowers. The ground is soft soil. It rains sometimes. Animals here include grasshoppers, mice, and birds.\"*\n\n3. **Task for each group:**\n   - *\"Would THIS spider (the one in the photo) survive well, survive OK, or NOT survive in your habitat? Why?\"*\n   - Students record their thinking on a chart: *\"Habitat: ___ / Our Spider's Survival Chances: ___ / Why:\"*\n   - Encourage students to use evidence from what they learned:\n     - *\"Long legs help on rocks but might not help in wet mud...\"*\n     - *\"Dark color helps on rocks but might not help on green plants...\"*\n     - *\"This spider needs dry places, so it won't survive where there's lots of water...\"*\n\n4. **Gallery walk or share-out (3–4 minutes):**\n   - Have 2–3 groups share their conclusions.\n   - Ask the class: *\"Did you notice that this spider is really good at surviving in ONE type of place? Why do you think that is?\"*\n   - Reinforce: *\"Animals have adaptations for THEIR habitat. If their habitat changes, it becomes hard for them to survive.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Prompt thinking with questions: *\"Remember how long legs helped on rocks. Would long legs help in snow? Why or why not?\"*\n- Ensure groups are using evidence from the lesson, not just guessing.\n- Celebrate reasoning: *\"I like how you used what you learned about dark color to explain why this spider might stand out in a green field.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that the photographed spider is well-adapted to deserts/dry habitats.\n- Students predict that this spider would struggle in wet, cold, or very different habitats.\n- Students explain their thinking using vocabulary (adaptation, habitat, survival).\n- Students show understanding that different animals are suited to different places.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of spider adaptations and habitat fit.\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- Listen to partner conversations in the Explain phase.\n- Observe model-building and habitat testing in Explore phase—note whether students can identify body parts and predict function.\n- Circulate during Elaborate and listen for use of vocabulary and evidence-based reasoning.\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a response sheet or card with these prompts:\n\n**Exit Ticket: Spider Survival**\n\n*Answer on your paper or draw a picture:*\n\n1. **Draw and label** two body parts of a spider that help it survive in rocky, dry places. Write one sentence for each: *\"This helps the spider because...\"*\n\n2. **Circle the correct answer:**\n   - A spider has ☐ 6 legs ☐ 8 legs\n   - The spider in the photo is an ☐ insect ☐ arachnid\n\n3. **Choose one habitat below. Explain why this spider would or would not survive there:**\n   - Wet rainforest\n   - Snow-covered Arctic\n   - Your backyard\n\n   *\"This spider would / would not survive here because...\"*\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least 2 body parts (legs, dark body/color).\n- ✓ Student explains how each part helps survival (with phrases like \"helps it move,\" \"helps it hide\").\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies 8 legs and arachnid.\n- ✓ Student selects a habitat and provides at least one reason using evidence from the lesson (mentions adaptation, habitat feature, or survival need).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will accurately label legs and body color as survival adaptations.\n- Most students will correctly identify arachnid and 8 legs.\n- Most students will show at least basic reasoning about a new habitat (e.g., \"It would not survive in the Arctic because it needs to be warm\" or \"It would survive in the desert because it likes dry places\").\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Provide a labeled diagram:** Offer a pre-labeled spider diagram during the Explore phase so students can refer to body parts while building their model. Pair these students with a peer or assign a small-group discussion before the full group share.\n\n2. **Simplify vocabulary:** Use only 2–3 key vocabulary terms (arachnid, adaptation, habitat) instead of five. Focus deeply on these rather than introducing spinnerets or camouflage.\n\n3. **Scaffold the exit ticket:** \n   - Provide a word bank: *long legs, dark color, 8 legs, rocky, dry, move, hide*\n   - Simplify to: *\"One thing that helps this spider is ___. It helps because ___.\"*\n   - Allow students to draw instead of write.\n   - Offer habitat sentence frames: *\"This spider would / would not survive in ___ because it likes ___ places.\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Research extension:** Ask advanced students to research a DIFFERENT spider species (jumping spider, water spider, tarantula) and compare how ITS adaptations are different. *\"How is a jumping spider's body different? Why? Where does it live?\"* Have them present findings to the class.\n\n2. **Complex habitat design:** Challenge students to design a NEW habitat that is perfect for this spider. *\"What would you include? What would you remove? Draw and label your ideal spider habitat. Explain your choices using the word 'adaptation.'\"*\n\n3. **Deep reasoning about climate change:** Ask: *\"If this desert became wetter and had more plants (because of climate change), would this spider still survive? What would change?\"* This introduces the idea that habitat change threatens organisms—a foundational concept for later learning.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Spider Observation Walk:** Take students on a neighborhood or schoolyard walk to search for spiders (webs, on buildings, under rocks). Photograph or sketch what you find. Back in class, compare the spiders you found to the one in the lesson. Ask: *\"What adaptations does THIS spider have? What habitat is it living in? How is it the same or different from our desert spider?\"*\n\n2. **Build a Habitat Diorama:** Provide a shoebox or small container. Students create a desert habitat with soil, rocks, dried plants, and a small shelter area. Place their pipe-cleaner spider inside and write a \"care card\": *\"This habitat has ___ and ___ because my spider needs ___.\"* Display in the classroom.\n\n3. **Fact or Fiction Spider Stories:** Read picture books about spiders (e.g., *The Very Busy Spider* by Eric Carle or *Spider Boy* by Joseph Keppler). Pause and ask: *\"Is that really how spiders work? How do you know? What adaptation from our lesson does this book show?\"* Create a class chart of \"Real Spider Facts\" vs. \"Fiction About Spiders.\"\n\n4. **Design a Spider Survival Game:** In pairs, students create a simple board game where a game piece (spider) moves through different habitats and must survive challenges. *\"Oh no! You landed on a wet rainforest. Your spider loses energy because it likes dry places. Move back 2 spaces.\"* Play the game and discuss which habitats were the hardest/easiest.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety reminder:** If showing live spiders, handle with care and ensure no students have phobias. The photograph is a perfectly safe alternative and equally effective for learning.\n- **Vocabulary exposure:** Third graders are still building science vocabulary. Repeat key terms (arachnid, adaptation, habitat) throughout the lesson and post them visibly.\n- **Misconception alert:** Many students think spiders are insects. Emphasize: *\"Insects have 6 legs. Spiders have 8 legs. Spiders are arachnids—a different group!\"*\n- **Connection to Next Steps:** This lesson lays groundwork for understanding how animals adapt to their environment and why organisms are suited to specific places. Future lessons can explore food chains, more complex ecosystems, or how habitat loss affects animals.",
