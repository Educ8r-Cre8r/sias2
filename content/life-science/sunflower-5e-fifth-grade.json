Identify and label the main stages of a plant's life cycle (seed, sprout, growth, flowering, seed production).\n2. Explain how plants use water and air to grow and develop, using evidence from observations.\n3. Describe the function of different plant parts (roots, stem, leaves, flowers, seeds) in a plant's life cycle.\n4. Predict what will happen next in a plant's life cycle and justify their prediction with scientific reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the sunflower bud and seed pod (or printed copies, one per pair)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Real sunflower seeds (one per student, in a small dish to pass around)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or give pairs a printed copy. Tell students: *\"This photograph shows two important parts of a sunflower plant's story. Can you find both parts in this picture?\"* Allow 30 seconds for silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - *\"What do you see growing on this green stem? What do you think these parts are, and why might they look different from each other?\"*\n   - *\"The bottom part looks brown and bumpy, while the top part is still closed and pale. Why do you think one looks more finished than the other?\"*\n   - *\"If this is a sunflower, where do you think the seeds are hiding in this picture?\"*\n   - *\"What do you think happens between the closed bud at the top and the brown pod at the bottom? What comes next?\"*\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** *\"Right now, I want you to think like a scientist. If I told you this photograph shows a plant at two different times in its life, what do you predict will happen to the closed bud at the top? Turn and talk to a partner—where will this bud go in the next few weeks?\"* Record student predictions on chart paper without correcting them.\n\n4. **Pass around real sunflower seeds** (if available) and let students hold them for 10 seconds. Ask: *\"This tiny seed contains the instructions to make a whole plant. How do you think something so small can become something so big?\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to become plant detectives and discover exactly how plants grow from seeds into flowers, and what materials plants need to make that happen.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic cups or small jars (one per student or pair)\n- Potting soil or garden soil\n- Sunflower seeds or bean seeds (large seeds work best—5-6 per student)\n- Water (in spray bottles or small pitchers)\n- Labels and markers\n- Optional: plastic wrap or humidity tents made from clear bags\n- Observation sheets (printable template provided below)\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring growth)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Planting Seeds (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Provide each student or pair** with a clear cup, soil, and 2-3 large seeds.\n\n2. **Give step-by-step directions:**\n   - *\"Fill your cup about three-quarters full with soil. Push the soil down gently with your fingers.\"*\n   - *\"Make a small hole in the soil about one inch deep with your finger.\"*\n   - *\"Place 2-3 seeds into the hole and cover them lightly with soil.\"*\n   - *\"Water your soil until it feels damp (like a wrung-out sponge) but not soaked.\"*\n   - *\"Label your cup with your name and today's date.\"*\n\n3. **Place cups in a warm, bright location** (windowsill or under grow lights).\n\n**Part A Check:** Ask students: *\"What do you think the seeds need to start growing? What's in your cup right now?\"* Record responses.\n\n**Part B: Observing Plant Materials (10 minutes)**\n\n4. **Transition:** *\"While our seeds are starting to grow, let's look at this photograph again and think about what materials helped this sunflower get so big.\"*\n\n5. **Show the photograph again.** Point to:\n   - The **green stem** (explain this came from a seed, just like the ones they planted)\n   - The **green leaves** (if visible, or use a real sunflower plant if available)\n   - The **moisture on the leaves** (point out the water droplets)\n\n6. **Ask:** *\"What do you see in this picture that the plant might need? Where might water come from? Where might energy come from?\"* Have students point to and discuss: water (moisture), air (space around leaves), and light (the plant is growing upward toward sunlight).\n\n7. **Observation Sheet:** Distribute a simple observation sheet with:\n   - A space to draw the photograph as they see it\n   - Lines to label: stem, leaves (if visible), bud, seed pod\n   - A section asking: *\"What do you think this plant needed to grow this big?\"* (students draw or write)\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask follow-up questions: *\"Why do you think the leaves are green?\"*, *\"What do you notice about where the plant is positioned?\"*\n- Do NOT tell students the answers; instead, guide them to observe details they might miss.\n- Help students plant seeds without judgment; focus on the process, not perfection.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students plant viable seeds in a moist environment.\n- Students identify that plants might need water, sunlight, and air based on the photograph.\n- Students record observations in drawings or words on their observation sheet.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with plant life cycle diagram (prepared ahead)\n- Poster or diagram showing plant parts and their functions\n- The photograph (displayed again)\n- Vocabulary cards or anchor chart\n- Optional: A real plant in its growth stage (potted sprout or seedling) to show students what comes next\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):** Ask students to share one thing they recorded on their observation sheet. List their ideas about what plants need on the chart paper. Then, organize these into two categories:\n   - **Things from the ENVIRONMENT:** water, sunlight, air\n   - **Things the PLANT CREATES:** growth, leaves, flowers, seeds\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):** Present and define these terms using the photograph as reference:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Seed:** A small package that contains a baby plant (called an embryo) and food for it to grow. It has a hard coat to protect it. (Point to the mature seed pod in the photo.)\n   - **Seedling:** A young plant that has just started growing from a seed. It has its first leaves. (Explain: students' seeds will become seedlings soon.)\n   - **Life Cycle:** All the stages a living thing goes through, from birth to adulthood to making babies. (Explain: this photo shows different stages of a sunflower's life cycle.)\n   - **Photosynthesis:** The process plants use to turn sunlight, water, and air into food that helps them grow. Plants do this in their green leaves. (Point to the green stem and bud in the photo—explain that the green color helps it catch sunlight.)\n   - **Flower:** The part of the plant that makes seeds. It's colorful and attracts insects to help with pollination.\n   - **Pollination:** When pollen (dust) from one flower moves to another flower, helping make seeds.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (4 minutes):** \n   - *\"Look at this photo again. We see a plant that has been growing for several weeks.\"*\n   - Point to the **green stem:** *\"This came from a tiny seed, just like the ones you planted. The seed used water from soil and energy from sunlight to grow this stem.\"*\n   - Point to the **closed bud:** *\"This is a flower that hasn't opened yet. Soon, pretty petals will unfold, and bees or other insects will visit it.\"*\n   - Point to the **brown seed pod below:** *\"This is what's LEFT after the flower finished its job. Inside, there are seeds—baby plants waiting to grow!\"*\n   - *\"To make all this happen, the plant pulled water up through roots we can't see, used sunlight and air to make food, and grew bigger and bigger.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: *\"If a plant couldn't get water, what do you think would happen to it?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"Look at this stem—why do you think it's green?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"Where do you think the next generation of sunflowers will come from?\"* (Expect: from the seeds in the brown pod.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that plants need water and air to grow.\n- Students can identify and name plant life cycle stages.\n- Students understand the purpose of different plant parts.\n- Students begin to recognize photosynthesis (energy from sunlight) in simple terms.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Plant life cycle cards or a sequencing mat (printed, one per pair)\n- Images of different plants at different life cycle stages (seeds, seedlings, flowering plants, seed-producing plants)\n- Index cards for students to draw\n- Optional: Diagram template for creating a model of matter movement in a plant\n- Chart paper if making a class model\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Life Cycle Sequencing (for most learners)**\n\n1. **Distribute life cycle cards** showing a plant at four stages: seed, seedling, flowering plant, seed-producing plant.\n\n2. **Student Task:** *\"Arrange these pictures in the order they happen. Then, between each picture, write or draw what the plant needs during that stage. For example, between the seed and seedling, what does the plant need?\"*\n\n3. **Pair Share:** Have pairs compare their sequencing with another pair and explain their thinking.\n\n**Option B: Matter Movement Model (for deeper thinkers)**\n\n1. **Introduce the concept:** *\"Everything that plants are made of comes from somewhere. The water comes from the soil. The air comes from around us. The sunlight gives energy. All of this gets mixed together inside the plant to make it grow. This is called movement of matter.\"*\n\n2. **Create a simple model together on chart paper:**\n   - Draw a plant with roots, stem, leaves, and flower.\n   - Use arrows to show: Water UP from roots → Sunlight IN through leaves → Air (oxygen/carbon dioxide) IN and OUT of leaves → Nutrients UP from roots.\n   - Add labels: *\"Water enters through roots. Sunlight enters through leaves. Air exchanges through leaves. All of this helps the plant grow and make seeds.\"*\n\n3. **Student Task:** Students create their own labeled diagram on a sheet of paper, showing where water, air, and sunlight enter the plant and how it helps make flowers and seeds.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: *\"Why do you think this stage comes before that one?\"*, *\"What does the plant need most during this stage?\"*\n- For the model option, prompt: *\"Where does water enter a plant? How do you think it gets all the way up to the leaves?\"*\n- Accept all thoughtful attempts; science thinking matters more than perfect accuracy at this level.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding of plant life cycle sequence.\n- Students can articulate what plants need at different growth stages.\n- Students begin to model how water, air, and sunlight move through and help a plant grow (supporting 5-LS2-1).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- **Observation Sheets from Explore Phase:** Check that students identified at least 2-3 materials plants need (water, sunlight, air).\n- **Check-for-Understanding Questions in Explain Phase:** Note which students can answer why plants are green and where seeds come from.\n- **Life Cycle Sequencing:** Verify correct order and that students identified materials for each stage.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with an index card and ask them to respond to ONE of the following (or all three if time allows):\n\n1. **Drawing + Label:** *\"Draw a seed growing into a sunflower. Label two things the plant needs to grow.\"*\n\n2. **Written Response:** *\"Explain to a friend why a plant needs water. Use a complete sentence.\"* (Acceptable: *\"Plants need water to grow big and strong.\"* or *\"Without water, a plant will die because water helps it make food.\"*)\n\n3. **Prediction:** *\"Look at the closed bud in the photograph again. What do you predict will happen to it next, and why?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ **Developing:** Student identifies one material plants need (water OR sunlight) and can draw a plant at two life cycle stages.\n- ✓ **Proficient:** Student identifies two or more materials plants need (water, air, sunlight), explains why at least one is necessary, and can sequence plant life cycle stages.\n- ✓ **Advanced:** Student explains the life cycle in detail, describes how multiple materials work together for growth, and makes a prediction about pollination or seed dispersal.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 80% of students will identify water and sunlight as materials plants need to grow.\n- Students will be able to sequence basic plant life cycle stages correctly.\n- Students will make one accurate prediction or observation about the photograph.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Sentence Stems for Exit Ticket:** Provide frames like:\n   - *\"Plants need _____ to grow.\"*\n   - *\"In the photograph, I see a _____ and a _____.\"*\n   - *\"Water helps plants by _____.\"*\n\n2. **Vocabulary Word Wall:** Create a large, illustrated word wall with photographs or drawings for: seed, flower, water, sunlight, air, stem. Point to it frequently during Explain phase.\n\n3. **Pair Struggling Learners with Stronger Peers** during the life cycle sequencing activity (Elaborate). Assign the struggling student the role of \"illustrator\" (pointing and drawing) while the partner is \"explainer\" (talking through reasoning). Switch roles after two pictures.\n\n4. **Simplify Observation Sheet:** For students with writing difficulties, provide a sheet with:\n   - Picture of the photograph already printed\n   - Three labeled blanks with picture options to choose from:\n     - This plant needs: [sun icon] [water droplet] [air waves]\n   - Student circles or colors the correct answers.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extend to Seed Dispersal:** Ask: *\"After this sunflower makes seeds, how will those seeds move to a new place where they can grow? What animals might help? How?\"* Have them draw or write three ways seeds travel.\n\n2. **Pollination Investigation:** Provide pictures of different pollinators (bees, butterflies, hummingbirds). Ask: *\"Why might each of these animals visit a flower? What's the flower's job? What's the animal's job?\"* Have them create a labeled diagram showing how pollen moves.\n\n3. **Matter Cycling Deep Dive:** Ask: *\"If a sunflower grows in a garden and then dies, where do all the materials it collected (water, air, nutrients) go? What happens to it?\"* Introduce the idea of decomposition and nutrient cycling. Have them trace the journey of one water molecule or one nutrient atom from soil → plant → seed → new plant.\n\n4. **Design a Grow Experiment:** Have advanced students design an experiment to test: *\"Do plants need sunlight to grow, or just water and soil?\"* They would set up two cups—one in sunlight, one in darkness—and predict and measure differences over two weeks.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Observation Lab (30 minutes, next class period):**\n   - If students' planted seeds have sprouted (2-7 days), have them carefully remove one seedling from soil (keep others growing).\n   - Provide hand lenses and a diagram to label: seed coat, root, stem, first leaves.\n   - Ask: *\"How has the seed changed? Where did it grow? Why do you think the root grew DOWN?\"* (Introduction to gravitropism—growth response to gravity.)\n   - Students draw labeled diagrams comparing the original seed to the sprouted seedling.\n\n2. **Plant Needs Investigation (2-week project):**\n   - Set up three cups with identical seeds, but:\n     - Cup A: Water + Sunlight (control—keep by window, water regularly)\n     - Cup B: Water + No Sunlight (place in dark closet, water regularly)\n     - Cup C: No Water + Sunlight (place by window, do NOT water)\n   - Students measure height and observe color every 3-4 days, graphing growth.\n   - Conclusion: Which cup grew best? What does this tell us plants REALLY need?\n   - This deeply supports 5-LS1-1.\n\n3. **Sunflower Life Cycle Comic Strip (take-home activity):**\n   - Provide a blank six-panel comic strip template.\n   - Have students illustrate and caption: (1) Seed in soil, (2) Sprout emerges, (3) Seedling grows leaves, (4) Plant grows tall and creates flower bud, (5) Flower opens, (6) Seeds develop.\n   - They write one-sentence captions for each panel explaining what happens and why.\n   - Optional: Have them create a teacher-created one for a class book.\n\n4. **Real Sunflowers in the Classroom or Garden:**\n   - If your school has a garden or outdoor space, plant sunflower seeds in spring with students.\n   - Check progress weekly; take photographs at each life cycle stage.\n   - Create a classroom photo timeline comparing individual student predictions (from Engage) to what actually happened.\n   - Discuss: *\"Did any predictions come true? What surprised us?\"*\n\n5. **Guest Speaker: Local Gardener or Botanist:**\n   - Invite a local farmer, gardener, or botanist to speak about how they grow plants and what materials they provide.\n   - Students prepare 2-3 questions in advance based on their learning.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing of Seed Sprouting:** Large seeds (sunflower, bean) typically sprout in 5-7 days. Plan for the Seed Observation Lab 1-2 weeks after planting.\n- **Classroom Environment:** Keep planted cups in a consistently warm (65-75°F), bright location. Windowsills work well. Water when soil surface feels dry to the touch.\n- **Photography:** Take photos of student plants at each stage to create a class visual timeline. Use these for follow-up lessons and discussions.\n- **Real-World Connection:** Show images of sunflower farms or seed production if available. Discuss: *\"Why do farmers grow sunflowers? What do they use the seeds for?\"* (food, oil, bird seed—connects to human needs and ecosystems.)\n- **Safety Note:** Ensure students wash hands after handling soil. Some students may have allergies to plant material; check health forms.\n- **NGSS Alignment Note:** This lesson emphasizes that plants get materials (water, air) from their environment and build structures that make seeds (5-LS1-1). The Elaborate phase with matter movement models introduces how matter cycles through ecosystems (5-LS2-1). Both standards are addressed across the full 5E cycle.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is designed to be engaging, hands-on, and grounded in observable phenomena from the photograph. Students will see real growth over time if they care for their planted seeds, deepening their understanding of plant life cycles and material needs. Adjust pacing and complexity based on your students' prior knowledge and developmental readiness.**",
