  "content": "# Engineering Design Challenge: Caterpillar Shelter & Movement\n\n---\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n\n- A monarch butterfly caterpillar (Danaus plexippus larva) with distinctive black, white, and yellow bands\n- The caterpillar is positioned on a light-colored rock or stone surface\n- Green plant foliage visible in the blurred background\n- Two black antenna-like tentacles (filaments) protruding from the caterpillar's head and rear end\n- Textured, granular surface of the rock providing a natural substrate\n\n---\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n\n1. **From the rock surface + exposed caterpillar position** → The caterpillar is vulnerable to weather, predators, and falling objects while crawling in open spaces; it needs protective shelter that allows movement and feeding access to plants.\n\n2. **From the bright coloring (aposematism)** → The caterpillar's bold stripes warn predators it may be toxic; any shelter design must not obscure these warning colors or trap the caterpillar inside.\n\n3. **From the antenna-like structures** → The caterpillar uses sensory organs to navigate and locate food; a shelter must allow the creature to sense its environment and move freely toward milkweed plants.\n\n---\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n#### **K-2 Version:**\n**Design a Safe Resting Spot for a Hungry Caterpillar**\n\nMake a cozy hiding place for a caterpillar using paper, leaves, and tape. Your shelter must:\n- Be big enough for a caterpillar toy to fit inside\n- Have an opening so the caterpillar can crawl in and out\n- Keep the caterpillar safe from pretend rain (you'll test it with a spray bottle)\n\nDraw or build your design. Does your caterpillar stay dry? Can it move freely?\n\n---\n\n#### **3-5 Version:**\n**Design a Protective Shelter for a Monarch Caterpillar**\n\nA monarch caterpillar needs a shelter that protects it from wind, rain, and predators—but it must also reach milkweed plants to eat and grow. Using natural and recycled materials, design and build a shelter that meets these criteria:\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Maximum dimensions: 15 cm wide × 10 cm tall\n- Must be built from at least 3 of these materials: leaves, twigs, paper, bark, or cardboard\n- Must have at least one opening for the caterpillar to enter/exit\n- The caterpillar's bright warning stripes must remain visible from at least one side\n\n**Success Criteria (measurable):**\n- Shelter withstands a 10-second \"wind test\" (gentle fan at low speed without collapsing)\n- Shelter keeps a wet sponge (representing the caterpillar) dry during a 20-second water spray\n- A toy caterpillar can move from outside the shelter to inside and back out in under 5 seconds\n\nDocument your design with a labeled sketch before building.\n\n---\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis photo shows a real creature in a real environment without an active human intervention or prototype visible. Students need to *identify and define* the caterpillar's actual needs (protection + food access + sensory freedom) before designing. The visible vulnerability of the caterpillar on an exposed rock makes the problem authentic and obvious—perfect for the **Ask** phase, where students ask \"What problem does this creature face?\" and \"How can we help?\"\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Materials\n\n1. Fresh or dried leaves, twigs, and bark (collected outdoors or kept in a learning collection)\n2. Cardboard tubes, paper scraps, and newspaper for structural support\n3. Paper tape or low-adhesive painter's tape (doesn't harm materials or create litter)\n4. Small spray bottle (for water testing)\n5. Toy caterpillar or sponge piece (for testing movement and water resistance)\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Time\n\n- **K-2:** 45–60 minutes (design discussion + building + simple water test)\n- **3-5:** Two 45-minute sessions (first: sketching and material selection; second: building, testing, and reflection)\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions**, as students must identify trade-offs between protection and access, then test their designs against measurable criteria—grounding abstract engineering thinking in a real organism's survival needs.",
