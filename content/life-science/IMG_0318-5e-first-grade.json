Identify and name at least three external body parts of a bird and explain how each part helps the bird survive.\n2. Observe and describe how a bird's feathers, color, and body shape help it hide in its environment.\n3. Compare pictures of a baby bird (chick) and an adult bird to identify which features are the same and which are different.\n4. Use simple materials to design or create a solution that mimics how a bird uses its body parts to solve a problem (e.g., finding food or staying warm).\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about bird body parts using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Enlarged color printout or digital projection of the photograph (IMG_0318.jpg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: real bird feather (cleaned, if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and introduce:** Project the bird photograph on the board or pass around a large printed copy. Say: \"Today we're going to meet a special bird. Look carefully at this bird. What do you see?\"\n\n2. **Ask discovery questions:** Use the photograph to engage curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about the color of this bird's feathers? Why do you think the bird looks like rocks and dirt?\" (Guide students to see the camouflage/blending in.)\n   - \"Look at the bird's beak. Why do you think birds have beaks? What do you think this bird's beak is good for?\"\n   - \"Can you see the bird's feet? How do you think they help the bird?\"\n   - \"What else do you notice about this bird's body that helps it live in this rocky, dirty place?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Pass around a real feather (or show a picture of one up close). Ask: \"Why do you think birds have so many feathers? What job do feathers do?\" Record student ideas on chart paper with pictures/words.\n\n**Transition:** \"You've asked great questions about bird bodies! Now let's explore and discover how birds really use their body parts to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate bird body parts and their functions through hands-on observation and mimicking activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart showing bird body parts (beak, feathers, wings, feet, eyes) with simple labels\n- Printed pictures of different bird beaks: long and thin, short and thick, curved (hummingbird, woodpecker, eagle, parrot examples)\n- Real feather or feather samples (cleaned poultry feathers work well)\n- Craft materials: construction paper, markers, cotton balls, scissors, glue\n- Hand lens/magnifying glass (optional, 1 per pair)\n- Small basin of water for feather exploration\n- Picture cards of baby birds (chicks) and adult birds of the same species\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Beak Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show the beak picture cards.** Say: \"Birds have different kinds of beaks. Let's see what each beak is good for.\"\n\n2. **Demonstrate with materials:** Using tweezers/scissors as \"beaks,\" show students:\n   - Using a thin pencil to \"poke\" a hole in soft material (like picking seeds from a pinecone)\n   - Using scissors-action to \"snap\" crackers (like a thick-beaked bird)\n   - Using a curved tool to \"scoop\" small objects (like a curved beak)\n\n3. **Student turns:** Give each pair or small group tweezers/tongs (\"thin beak\") and ask them to pick up small items (beads, cereal, crackers). Then give them a clothespin (\"thick beak\") and repeat. Ask: \"Which beak is easier for different jobs?\"\n\n4. **Record:** Have students draw or mark on a simple chart which \"beak\" worked best for different foods.\n\n**Part B: Feather Exploration (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Give each student or pair a real feather.** Ask them to:\n   - Feel it gently. Is it soft or stiff?\n   - Look at it with a magnifying glass. What do you see?\n   - Puff gently on it. What happens?\n   - Lightly spray water on it. Does it get wet right away? (Feathers shed water!)\n\n2. **Discussion:** \"Feathers keep birds warm and dry. They help birds fly. They also help birds hide in their environment by matching the colors around them.\"\n\n3. **Mimicking activity:** Give students cotton balls or torn paper and ask them to glue feathers or feather-like materials onto a shape to make it \"fluffy\" or \"hidden\" like a real bird.\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate, ask guiding questions (\"What do you notice?\" \"How does this help the bird?\"), and listen to student thinking without directly telling answers. Use open-ended prompts to encourage observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify that different beaks do different jobs.\n- Students discover that feathers are waterproof, fluffy, and help birds survive.\n- Students understand that body parts have specific functions for survival.\n- Students produce simple drawings or models showing their observations.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to scientific concepts using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled diagram of a bird (beak, feathers, wings, feet, eyes)\n- The original photograph (back on display)\n- Picture book or video clip (2-3 minutes) showing a parent bird and baby bird\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Invite students to share what they discovered about beaks and feathers. Display their \"feather art\" projects. Ask: \"What did you learn about why birds need feathers?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with definitions (written + drawn on chart):**\n\n   - **Beak:** The hard, pointed part of a bird's mouth that it uses to catch, hold, and eat food.\n   - **Feathers:** Special fluffy coverings on a bird's body that keep it warm, dry, and help it fly. Feathers can also match the colors around the bird so it is hard to see (camouflage).\n   - **Wings:** Large body parts with feathers that birds use to fly, balance, and sometimes hide.\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and live in its home.\n   - **Camouflage:** Colors and patterns on an animal's body that help it blend in with its surroundings so predators or other animals cannot see it easily.\n\n3. **Return to the photograph:** Point to the bird in IMG_0318.jpg. Say: \"Look at this bird's feathers. Do you see how they are brown and gray, like the rocks and dirt around it? This is called camouflage. It helps the bird hide so it stays safe. This is an adaptation—a special feature that helps the bird survive.\"\n\n4. **Parent and offspring connection (5 minutes):** Show a picture of a baby bird (chick) next to an adult bird of the same species. Say: \"Baby birds and grown-up birds look similar, but not exactly the same. The baby might be smaller and have fluffier feathers. As it grows, it looks more like its parents. Parents teach baby birds how to use their beaks and wings to find food and stay safe.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Point to parts of the bird in the photo: \"What is this called? What does it do?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why does this bird have brown feathers?\"\n   - Ask: \"If you were a baby bird, what would you need to learn from your parent?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Beak:** The hard, pointed part of a bird's mouth used for eating.\n- **Feathers:** Fluffy, special coverings that keep birds warm, dry, and help them fly; colors can help them hide.\n- **Wings:** Large feathered parts used for flying and balancing.\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part that helps an animal survive.\n- **Camouflage:** Colors and patterns that help an animal blend in with its surroundings.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that body parts have specific names and purposes.\n- Students can explain how the bird's coloring helps it survive.\n- Students know that baby birds are similar to but different from adult birds.\n- Students use new vocabulary in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a solution that mimics how birds use body parts to solve a problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Craft materials: paper, markers, feathers, cotton balls, construction paper, foam, pipe cleaners, glue, scissors\n- Picture cards showing bird beaks and feet adapted to different environments (woodpecker, hummingbird, eagle, wading bird)\n- \"Bird Problem Cards\" (printed scenario cards, see below)\n- Optional: modeling clay\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the challenge:** Say: \"Now you're going to design something that works like a bird's body part!\"\n\n2. **Assign or allow student choice of one problem to solve:**\n   - **Problem 1 (Beak):** \"Create a tool that can pick up tiny seeds like a hummingbird beak does.\"\n   - **Problem 2 (Feathers):** \"Make something that stays dry when water drips on it, just like bird feathers.\"\n   - **Problem 3 (Camouflage):** \"Design a bird that will hide in a rocky, sandy place (use colors and patterns to match the ground).\"\n   - **Problem 4 (Feet):** \"Create feet that can hold onto a branch (use materials to show how bird feet grip and hold on).\"\n\n3. **Design time (10 minutes):** Students use craft materials to:\n   - Sketch or plan their design first\n   - Build or create a model that mimics the bird body part\n   - Test it if possible (e.g., spray water on the \"feather,\" try picking things up with the \"beak\")\n\n4. **Share and explain (5 minutes):** Invite 3-4 volunteers to show their design and explain: \"What bird body part does your design copy? How does it work? How does it help the bird survive?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate with guiding questions: \"What body part are you copying? How did the bird's real body part give you an idea? Does your design work? What could you change?\" Encourage testing and trying again.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a model or design that mimics a bird body part.\n- Students explain how their design solves a real problem for a bird.\n- Students practice critical thinking about form and function in nature.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that animals' bodies have special features for survival.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of bird body parts, their functions, and how animals use external structures to survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student participation during Engage and Explore phases. Listen for use of vocabulary and evidence of understanding function.\n- Review feather exploration activity: Can students explain why feathers help birds survive?\n- Examine beak investigation chart: Did students identify different beak functions?\n- Listen to student explanations during group share-out in Explain phase.\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes, end of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple picture of a bird (or display the original photograph again). Ask students to respond (verbally, with drawing, or in writing with teacher support) to these prompts:\n\n1. **Point to or name one body part of the bird. Tell me what job it does.** (Accept any accurate answer: \"The beak finds food,\" \"Feathers keep the bird warm,\" etc.)\n2. **Why do you think this bird has brown and gray feathers?** (Accept: \"To hide,\" \"To blend in,\" \"So it is hard to see,\" etc.)\n3. **How is a baby bird the same as a grown-up bird? How is it different?** (Accept: \"Baby is smaller,\" \"Baby has fluffier feathers,\" \"They both have beaks,\" etc.)\n\n**Alternative Assessment (kinesthetic):**\n- **Bird Body Part Charades:** Call out a bird body part or action (fly, peck, hide, balance on branch). Students mime the action. Assess whether they understand what the body part does.\n- **Picture Sorting:** Show pictures of baby and adult birds (mixed up). Students sort them and explain their thinking.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding when they can:\n- ✓ Name and point to at least 2-3 bird body parts.\n- ✓ Explain how at least one body part helps the bird survive (with support).\n- ✓ Recognize that color/feathers help a bird hide or blend in.\n- ✓ Observe that baby and adult birds are similar but show one difference (with teacher support).\n- ✓ Design or describe a solution that mimics a bird body part.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most first graders will successfully identify external bird parts and connect them to simple survival functions.\n- Students will understand camouflage as a survival strategy.\n- Students will recognize similarities and some differences between baby and adult birds.\n- Students will demonstrate creative thinking by mimicking bird features in their designs.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Vocabulary support with visuals:** Provide picture cards or photos paired with every new vocabulary word. Use consistent picture cues throughout the lesson. Say the word multiple times and have students repeat.\n\n2. **Simplified beak task:** Instead of tweezers/tongs, use large clothespins or salad tongs (easier to manipulate). Work in a small group with the teacher to practice. Ask yes/no questions: \"Does this beak work for hard seeds? Does it work for tiny seeds?\"\n\n3. **Scaffold the design challenge:** Offer pre-made choices instead of open-ended design. For example: \"Do you want to make feathers that don't get wet, or a beak that picks things up?\" Provide step-by-step picture directions for building. Allow students to work with a peer or teacher assistant.\n\n4. **Reduce demands in Evaluate:** Accept one-word answers or pointing. Ask yes/no questions: \"Does the beak help the bird find food?\" \"Are baby birds smaller than grown-up birds?\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Comparative beaks research:** Provide pictures of 4-5 different birds with different beak types (hummingbird, woodpecker, owl, flamingo, pelican). Ask: \"Which beak would work best for eating insects? Which for drinking nectar? Which for catching fish?\" Students sort and explain their reasoning using evidence from the images.\n\n2. **Habitat adaptation design:** \"Design a bird that would survive in a snowy place, an ocean, and a forest. What colors and body parts would it need? Draw or build your bird.\" Challenge them to explain each choice.\n\n3. **Life cycle extension:** Provide a simple diagram showing egg → chick → adult bird. Ask: \"What does a chick need to learn from its parent to survive when it grows up?\" Have them draw or write 2-3 behaviors (finding food, staying warm, flying, hiding).\n\n4. **Analyze the photograph more deeply:** Ask: \"Why do you think this bird is sitting on the ground? What is it doing? Is it safe here? How do you know?\" Encourage inference and evidence-based thinking.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bird Nesting and Camouflage Game:** Create a \"bird nest\" out of twigs and natural materials in a classroom corner. Hide small bird cutouts (some with camouflage colors, some with bright colors) around the room. Students search for hidden birds and count how many they find of each color. Discuss: \"Why were some birds easier to find?\" This reinforces camouflage and adaptation concepts.\n\n2. **Parent-Baby Bird Matching:** Gather pictures of various bird species showing both parent and baby (chick) stages. Have students match pairs and create a \"Bird Family Book\" by gluing pictures onto pages and labeling: \"Baby [bird name]\" and \"Grown-up [bird name].\" Students write or dictate one way they are the same and one way they are different for each pair. This extends 1-LS3-1.\n\n3. **Bird Feather Observation Station:** Set up a classroom science station with different types of feathers (cleaned, from craft stores or nature), a magnifying glass, water spray bottle, and observation sheet. Students visit the station over several days, explore feathers, draw what they see, and record how feathers respond to water. This provides deeper sensory learning and encourages independent observation skills.\n\n4. **\"Build a Bird Beak\" Take-Home Activity:** Send home a simple craft kit with popsicle sticks, pipe cleaners, and printed instructions for families to build different bird beaks using craft materials. Students bring their beaks back and test them on classroom \"foods\" (different textures: foam, clay, crackers, small pom-poms). Families and students discuss which beaks work best for different foods. This bridges home and school learning.\n\n5. **Story and Role Play:** Read a picture book about birds (e.g., *The Nest* by Kenneth Steven or *Owl Moon* by Jane Yolen). After reading, have students role-play as baby birds learning from a parent bird: \"Show me how to use your beak to find food.\" \"How do your feathers keep you warm?\" This combines literature, movement, and reinforces the parent-offspring learning relationship (1-LS1-2).\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
