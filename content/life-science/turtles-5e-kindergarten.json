ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital display of the turtle photograph (or project on screen)\n- Chart paper\n- Markers (various colors)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** where all students can see it clearly. Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see?\"\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause for responses after each):\n   - *\"What animals do you see? What do they look like?\"* (Students may say: turtles, shells, hard outside)\n   - *\"Where are the turtles? What's around them?\"* (Students may say: water, plants, logs, mud, green things)\n   - *\"Why do you think the turtles are here? What do they need?\"* (Accept all responses without judgment)\n   - *\"Have you ever seen a turtle? Where was it?\"* (Activate prior knowledge and personal connections)\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** Say, \"I wonder... what does a turtle need to be happy and healthy? Let's think like turtle scientists today and find out!\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper as a visual reference for the lesson. Save this chart to revisit during the Explain and Evaluate phases.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to explore turtle habitats ourselves and discover what turtles really need to survive!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small plastic tubs or shallow bins (1 per 2–3 students)\n- Water (pre-filled or students pour supervised water)\n- Rocks or small pieces of bark/wood\n- Aquatic plants (real pond plants, or artificial plants from craft stores)\n- Toy turtles or turtle pictures on cards\n- Observation sheets (simple pictures of: water, shelter, plants, food — with checkbox or smiley face stickers)\n- Pencils or crayons\n- Paper towels (for cleanup)\n- Plastic gloves (optional, for sensory-sensitive learners)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions (use simple, direct language):**\n\n1. **Assign students to small groups** (2–3 per tub).\n\n2. Say: \"You are going to make a turtle's home in your tub. First, pour some water into your tub so it's about 2 fingers deep.\" (Demonstrate with your hand.) *Teacher supervises water addition.*\n\n3. \"Now, put some rocks or wood pieces in the water. These are for your turtle to climb on and rest.\" (Students arrange materials.)\n\n4. \"Add some plants around the edges or in the water. Real turtles love plants!\" (Students place plants.)\n\n5. \"Look at your turtle home. Does it look safe and cozy?\" (Students examine their creation.)\n\n6. \"Now, use your toy turtle and gently place it in the water. What does your turtle do? Where does it go?\" (Students explore, observe, record on observation sheet.)\n\n7. **Documentation:** Students color or check boxes on simple observation sheet:\n   - ✓ Water (colored in or checked)\n   - ✓ Shelter/rocks (drawn or sticker)\n   - ✓ Plants (drawn or sticker)\n   - ✓ A place to rest (checked)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"Why did you put the rock there? What is your turtle doing? Does your turtle need the water?\"*\n- Facilitate water play without correcting; let students discover through trial and error.\n- Ask students to explain their choices: *\"Tell me about your turtle home.\"*\n- Take notes on student language and observations for formative assessment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create a small wetland habitat with water, shelter, and plants.\n- Students will observe toy turtles interacting with the habitat and make predictions about turtle behavior.\n- Students will document at least 2–3 components of a turtle's habitat on their observation sheet.\n- Students will use words like \"water,\" \"shelter,\" \"plants,\" \"safe,\" \"hide.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with student predictions from Engage phase\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- New chart paper for \"What Turtles Need\" anchor chart\n- Markers\n- Picture cards of: water, shelter, plants, food, log, wetland\n- The completed habitat tubs (from Explore)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather students on the carpet in front of the tubs and photograph.\n   - Ask: *\"What did you put in your turtle home? Why?\"*\n   - Listen to 3–4 student responses and affirm each one.\n   - Say: \"Great thinking! You all gave your turtles what they need!\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with Kindergarten-friendly definitions:**\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|\n   | **Shelter** | A safe place where animals can hide and rest (like logs or plants) |\n   | **Habitat** | A home where an animal lives with everything it needs |\n   | **Wetland** | A wet, marshy place with water, plants, and mud where many animals live |\n   | **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy by getting what you need |\n   | **Pattern** | A way things look or happen over and over |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the photograph and say: \"Look at these real turtles. Do you see water? Do you see shelter? Do you see plants?\"\n   - Have students point to each element in the photo.\n   - Say: \"This is a real turtle habitat. It has everything the turtles need to survive!\"\n\n4. **Co-create an anchor chart** titled \"What Turtles Need to Survive\":\n   - Add icons/pictures for: Water 💧, Shelter 🏠 (log/cave), Plants 🌱, Food 🍽️\n   - Write simple phrases: \"Turtles need WATER to live. Turtles need SHELTER to hide. Turtles need PLANTS in their home.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If a turtle has water and a log, is it happy?\"* (Yes! They have shelter and water.)\n   - Ask: *\"Can a turtle live without water?\"* (No—turtles need water to survive.)\n   - Ask: *\"What else is in a turtle's home?\"* (Plants, mud, food, other animals.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| **Term** | **Definition** |\n|----------|---|\n| **Shelter** | A safe place to hide and rest |\n| **Habitat** | An animal's home with everything it needs |\n| **Wetland** | A wet place with water and lots of plants where animals live |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and be healthy |\n| **Pattern** | Something that happens again and again in the same way |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the terms \"water,\" \"shelter,\" \"plants,\" and \"habitat\" in responses.\n- Students will identify at least 2–3 things turtles need to survive.\n- Students will recognize that the photograph shows a real turtle habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by exploring a new context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large paper\n- Markers, crayons, colored pencils\n- Pre-cut pictures of: water, plants, rocks, logs, mud, food (insects, algae)\n- Glue sticks\n- Picture of a different wetland or pond (optional; could show a different environment)\n- The original photograph\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: \"Design a New Turtle Home\" (recommended for most Kindergarteners)**\n\n1. Show students the original photograph again. Say: \"This is one turtle home. But there are many different wetlands! Let's create a NEW turtle home that's different but still has what turtles need.\"\n\n2. Give each student or pair a large sheet of paper.\n\n3. Say: \"Your job is to draw or glue pictures to make a turtle home. Remember: it needs WATER, SHELTER, and PLANTS. You can make it look different from the photo, but it has to have what turtles need!\"\n\n4. Students draw or glue pictures of habitat components.\n\n5. **Gallery walk:** Display completed habitats. Ask students: *\"Does this turtle home have water? Does it have shelter? Would a turtle be happy here? Why?\"*\n\n6. Students walk around and point to habitats that have all the things turtles need.\n\n**Option B: \"Turtle Home Scavenger Hunt\" (if time permits or for advanced learners)**\n\n1. Show students the photograph again and ask: \"Can you find these things in the picture?\"\n   - Water (point together)\n   - Shelter (point together)\n   - Plants (point together)\n\n2. Give students a simple scavenger hunt sheet with pictures of: 🌊 water, 🏠 shelter, 🌱 plants.\n\n3. Students check off or circle each item as you point them out in the photograph.\n\n4. Discuss: *\"Do real turtles find all these things in nature? Yes! That's why they survive there.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: *\"What does your turtle need most in this home?\"*\n- Affirm student choices: *\"You put in water AND shelter—your turtle will be so safe!\"*\n- Scaffold: For struggling learners, provide pre-drawn or pre-cut pictures to glue instead of draw.\n- Encourage: *\"Tell me about your turtle home. What makes it a good place for turtles?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create a second turtle habitat with at least 2–3 necessary components.\n- Students will verbally justify their choices: *\"I put water because turtles need to swim.\"*\n- Students will recognize that different habitats can meet turtle needs in different ways.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what turtles need to survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout the lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore: Do they place water, shelter, and plants in their habitats?\n- Listen to language during Explain: Do students use new vocabulary appropriately?\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"Why do you think the turtle is near the log?\"* (observing reasoning)\n- Review observation sheets from Explore phase: Did students identify key habitat components?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (choose one or use both):**\n\n**Option 1: Visual Exit Ticket (show picture cards)**\nDisplay three pictures:\n- Picture A: Dry box with no water or plants\n- Picture B: Tub with water, rocks, and plants\n- Picture C: Bowl with only water, no shelter\n\nAsk each student individually:\n1. *\"Which one is a good home for a turtle? Why?\"* (Correct answer: B)\n2. *\"What does the turtle need that's missing in Picture A?\"* (Water and plants/shelter)\n3. *\"If the turtle only had Picture C, would it be happy?\"* (No—it needs shelter too)\n\n**Option 2: Simple Observation Checklist (teacher records)**\n\n| Student Name | Identifies water as needed? | Identifies shelter as needed? | Identifies plants as needed? | Uses vocabulary? |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Child A | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n| Child B | ✓ | ~ | ✓ | ~ |\n\n(✓ = yes, ~ = emerging, ✗ = not yet)\n\n**Option 3: \"Tell Me About Your Turtle\" (individual interview, 1 minute each)**\n\nAsk each student:\n- *\"What does your turtle need to survive?\"*\n- *\"Look at the photo. What do YOU see?\"*\n- *\"If you were a turtle, what would you need?\"*\n\nRecord key phrases or behaviors.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✅ **Students have met the standard if they can:**\n1. Identify at least 2 things turtles need to survive (water and shelter/plants).\n2. Point to or describe these things in the photograph.\n3. Explain in simple terms: \"Turtles need water\" or \"Turtles need shelter.\"\n4. Create a habitat with at least 2–3 components.\n\n⚠️ **Students are emerging if they can:**\n- Identify one thing turtles need with prompting.\n- Point to habitat features with guidance.\n- Use 1–2 vocabulary words with reminders.\n\n🔄 **Plan for reteaching if students:**\n- Cannot identify any habitat needs.\n- Do not engage with the hands-on activity.\n- Show confusion about water/shelter/plants roles.\n→ *Small-group re-exploration with simplified habitat tub, focusing on one component at a time.*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students will correctly identify at least 2 things turtles need.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding through their habitat creations and verbalization.\n- Students will make connections between the photograph and their own explorations.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Scaffolding for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Habitat Tub:** Provide a pre-filled tub with water and 1–2 shelter items already placed. Student's job is to observe and add 1 plant. Reduces cognitive load; keeps tactile engagement.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Support Cards:** Create picture cards with single words and images (WATER, SHELTER, PLANTS) that students can point to instead of saying. Pair with gesture cues (swimming motion for water, hiding motion for shelter).\n\n3. **Buddy System:** Partner emerging learner with a strong peer during Explore. Peer can model placing items and explain choices. Provides peer scaffolding and language models.\n\n4. **Reduced Assessment:** Use only visual multiple-choice exit ticket (Picture A, B, or C) instead of open-ended questions. Lowers language demand while assessing concept understanding.\n\n### Challenge (Extensions for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **\"Design a Menu for Turtles\":** Ask: *\"What FOOD do turtles eat? Draw or find pictures of turtle food and add it to your habitat.\"* Extend learning to nutrition and food chains; research simple turtle diet (algae, plants, small insects).\n\n2. **\"Compare Two Habitats\":** Provide photos of two different wetlands (e.g., swamp vs. pond). Ask: *\"Are these both good turtle homes? What's the same? What's different? Do they both have what turtles need?\"* Develops comparative thinking and pattern recognition.\n\n3. **\"Turtle Day and Night\":** Ask: *\"What does a turtle need during the DAY? At NIGHT?\"* Students draw day and night turtle habitats. Introduces circadian rhythms and day/night patterns appropriate to Kindergarten level.\n\n4. **\"Build a Bigger Habitat\":** Challenge to create a large habitat for multiple toy turtles. Ask: *\"Do they share the water? Does each turtle need its own shelter? How do they all survive together?\"* Extends to community/ecosystem concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Outdoor Wetland Observation (if available):**\n   - Take students to a local pond, wetland, or water feature on school grounds.\n   - Provide simple observation clipboards with pictures of water, plants, shelter.\n   - Ask: *\"Do you see what turtles need here?\"* Students check boxes or point.\n   - If no turtles visible, discuss: *\"Why might turtles live here even if we don't see them?\"*\n   - *Follow-up:* Create a large class mural of the wetland they visited.\n\n2. **\"Read-Aloud & Respond\" — Turtle Stories:**\n   - Read: *\"A House for Hermit Crab\" by Eric Carle* or *\"Shelly the Turtle\" (simple picture book).*\n   - Discuss: *\"What does [Turtle] need? Where does it live?\"*\n   - Art extension: Students draw or paint a turtle's home and dictate/write: \"My turtle needs _____ to survive.\"\n   - Display artwork with student quotes on classroom wall.\n\n3. **\"Turtle Game: Match the Need\":**\n   - Create matching card pairs: (Water ↔ Swimming), (Shelter ↔ Hiding), (Plants ↔ Eating/Hiding).\n   - Students play memory/matching game to reinforce vocabulary and concepts.\n   - Say: *\"Find the picture that goes with SHELTER!\"* Student flips cards until match found.\n   - Use as center activity or brain break throughout the week.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Supervise water use closely. Use shallow water (2 fingers deep) and ensure cleanup protocols (paper towels handy, hand sanitizer after activity).\n- **Inclusion:** Offer sensory gloves for students sensitive to water/wet materials. Provide alternative activities (drawing instead of tactile exploration).\n- **Time Flexibility:** This lesson can be condensed to one 45-minute session by combining Explore and Explain, or extended over three days (Day 1: Engage + Explore; Day 2: Explain + Elaborate; Day 3: Evaluate + Extension).\n- **Real Turtles:** If your classroom or school has a pet turtle, this lesson gains significant power! Students observe the living animal in its habitat. Use this observation to reinforce learning: *\"Look—our class turtle is in the water. It needs water to survive!\"*\n- **Connection to Home:** Send home a simple letter inviting families to observe turtles (in zoos, pet stores, pictures online) and discuss habitat needs together. Include the vocabulary words and key concepts.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson aligns with K-LS1-1 by having students use observations (the photograph, their habitat explorations, the real turtle habitat) to describe patterns of what animals need to survive.**",
