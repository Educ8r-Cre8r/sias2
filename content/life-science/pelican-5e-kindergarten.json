Identify at least two things that a pelican needs to survive (food and water/home).\n2. Describe one body part of the pelican and explain how it helps the bird survive.\n3. Match animals to habitats where they can find what they need to live.\n4. Explain why the pelican lives near water using observations from the photograph.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color copy of the pelican photograph (or display on screen/projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Small pelican image printed for each student (optional, for visual reference)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen where all students can see it clearly. Give students 30 seconds of silent looking time—no talking yet—to really observe the bird.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions one at a time, pausing for student responses:**\n   - \"What do you see? Tell me about this bird.\" *(Listen for observations about size, color, beak, feathers, where it is.)*\n   - \"What is that long part sticking out from the bird's head? What do you think it does?\" *(Guide them to notice the beak.)*\n   - \"Where is this bird? What do you see around it?\" *(Water, rock, ocean environment.)*\n   - \"Why do you think this bird lives here by the water?\" *(Encourage predictions.)*\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder... what does this bird need to eat and drink? I wonder where it sleeps and rests?\" Write student wonderings on chart paper with pictures/words.\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Let's explore and find out what birds like this pelican need to stay healthy and alive!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper divided into three sections (labeled with pictures: FOOD, WATER, HOME)\n- Pictures of pelican body parts (beak, feathers, webbed feet) printed on small cards\n- Pictures of things pelicans need: fish, ocean water, rocks/beach, nests\n- Glue sticks and pre-cut construction paper\n- Student observation sheets (simple outline of pelican with blank labels)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Body Part Hunt (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display the pelican photo again.** Point to one part at a time (beak, feathers, feet, eye).\n\n2. **Give each student or pair a set of body part picture cards.** Tell them: \"When I point to a part of the pelican, you hold up the card that matches. Then we'll talk about why that part is special.\"\n\n3. **Point to the beak.** Students hold up beak cards. Ask: \"What do you think the beak does?\" *Guide them to see it could catch fish from the water.* Have students draw or color the beak on their observation sheet.\n\n4. **Point to the feathers.** Students hold up feather cards. Ask: \"Why do birds have feathers?\" *Lead them to understand feathers keep them dry and warm.* Students draw or color feathers.\n\n5. **Point to the feet.** Students hold up feet cards. Ask: \"What kind of feet does this bird have?\" *Show them they are webbed—good for swimming.* Students draw or color feet.\n\n**Part B: What Does a Pelican Need? (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show the three-section chart labeled FOOD, WATER, and HOME (with simple pictures for non-readers).**\n\n2. **Give each student or small group 3-4 picture cards** showing: fish, ocean, rocks, seaweed, nesting materials, shells.\n\n3. **Instructions:** \"Look at each picture. Does the pelican EAT this? Does the pelican DRINK this? Does the pelican LIVE in or on this? Sort your pictures into the right group.\"\n\n4. **Circulate and listen.** Ask guiding questions: \"Why does the pelican need fish?\" \"Can the pelican drink ocean water? Why or why not?\" *(Fresh water, but pelicans can drink salt water—adapt answer to student level.)*\n\n5. **Students glue pictures onto the chart or into the correct sections of their own paper.**\n\n6. **Document by taking photos of student work or collecting their sheets.**\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without telling answers—use questions to guide thinking.\n- Ask, \"Why do you think that belongs there?\" to develop reasoning.\n- Accept all initial ideas; misconceptions will be addressed in Explain phase.\n- Provide sentence starters: \"This pelican needs _____ because _____.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify at least 2 things pelicans need (food/fish and water).\n- Students recognize the pelican's body parts and can name at least one (beak, feathers, feet).\n- Students understand the connection between where the pelican lives and what it needs.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Enlarged pelican photograph\n- Chart paper with FOOD, WATER, HOME sections (from Explore)\n- Picture cards showing pelican needs\n- Vocabulary poster with 4-5 simple terms and pictures\n- Whiteboard or chart paper for drawing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):** Ask students to show their sorted pictures and explain one choice. \"Tell us what you think the pelican needs and why.\" Record their ideas on the chart, validating all thinking.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary with Pictures (5 minutes):** Display and define these terms using the pelican photo and simple drawings:\n\n   - **Beak:** The hard, pointed mouth part of a bird that catches and holds food.\n   - **Feathers:** Soft, lightweight body coverings that keep birds dry, warm, and help them fly.\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter.\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy by getting what you need (food, water, home).\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal live in its home. *(Use simpler language: \"A special thing about an animal that helps it live.\")*\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photo (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the beak: \"This pelican's beak is long and big. Perfect for catching slippery fish!\"\n   - Point to feathers: \"These feathers are waterproof—water slides right off, so the pelican stays dry.\"\n   - Point to habitat: \"This pelican lives by the ocean. The water gives it food and a place to rest.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why is living near water important for a pelican?\" *Water = food (fish) + home.*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Hold up the photo and ask: \"Point to or tell me—what part helps this pelican catch fish?\" *(Beak.)*\n   - \"What does the pelican need to survive?\" *(Food, water, shelter.)*\n   - \"Where does the pelican live?\" *(By the water/ocean.)*\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Beak:** The hard, pointed part of a bird's mouth used to catch and eat food.\n- **Feathers:** Soft coverings on a bird's body that keep it dry and warm.\n- **Habitat:** The home of an animal where it finds food, water, and shelter.\n- **Survive:** To stay alive by having food, water, and a safe place to live.\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or thing an animal does that helps it live.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least two things pelicans need to survive.\n- Students can point to or name one body part of a pelican and say what it does.\n- Students understand that pelicans live near water because that's where their food is.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images or real examples of different animal habitats (desert, forest, pond, sky, ocean) printed or on cards\n- 3-4 different animals pictured (bird, fish, squirrel, duck) on separate cards\n- Large poster paper or whiteboard divided into habitat zones\n- Colored pencils, markers, crayons\n- Optional: Cotton balls (clouds), blue paper strips (water), green tissue (grass)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Habitat Matching Game (10 minutes):**\n\n1. **Display pictures of different habitats:** ocean, forest, desert, pond.\n\n2. **Show an animal card (e.g., a duck).** Ask: \"Where does this animal live? Why?\" Students discuss and vote by pointing to or walking to the habitat picture.\n\n3. **Briefly explain:** \"A duck needs water like the pelican, so it lives by a pond or river. But a squirrel needs trees, so it lives in the forest.\"\n\n4. **Show the pelican photo again:** \"Our pelican needs the ocean because that's where the fish are!\"\n\n**Pelican Habitat Mural (10 minutes):**\n\n1. **Show a large blank paper labeled \"Pelican's Ocean Home.\"** Tell students: \"We're going to build the pelican's habitat together!\"\n\n2. **Divide students into small groups; each group adds one thing:**\n   - Group 1: Paint or color blue water at the bottom.\n   - Group 2: Glue on rock/stone shapes where the pelican can rest.\n   - Group 3: Draw and glue fish in the water.\n   - Group 4: Decorate with shells, seaweed, or sandy areas.\n\n3. **As groups work, ask:** \"Why are we adding fish?\" \"Why does the pelican need these rocks?\" \n\n4. **Display the finished mural and have students identify the parts: food (fish), shelter (rocks), and water (ocean).**\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask higher-order questions: \"What would happen if the pelican had no fish?\" \"Could a pelican live in the desert?\"\n- Support students in explaining their choices.\n- Validate creative additions while keeping focus on pelican survival needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create or contribute to a visual representation of a pelican's habitat.\n- Students can explain why each element (water, rocks, fish) is important for the pelican.\n- Students transfer understanding to recognize that different animals have different habitat needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what pelicans need to survive and how their body parts help them.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Listen to student responses during Engage questions.\n- Observe student choices during Explore sorting activity.\n- Note which students can name and explain pelican body parts during Explain phase.\n- Record comments during Elaborate habitat discussion.\n\n**Summative Assessment – Pelican Survival Card (End of Lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple card or page showing the pelican photo and three simple yes/no pictures:\n\n**\"Does a pelican need this to survive?\"**\n\n1. **Picture of fish:** Yes or No? *(Expected: Yes—food.)*\n2. **Picture of water:** Yes or No? *(Expected: Yes—drinking and habitat.)*\n3. **Picture of a tree/forest:** Yes or No? *(Expected: No—pelicans don't live in forests.)*\n\nStudents point to or circle the correct answers. For non-readers, read aloud and have them thumbs up/down or nod.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Closing Question (5 minutes):**\n\nAsk each student individually or in small groups:\n- **\"Tell me one thing this pelican needs to stay alive. How do you know?\"**\n\nRecord their responses. Accept answers like: \"Fish for food,\" \"Water to drink,\" \"Rocks to sit on.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least **one thing** the pelican needs (food, water, or home).\n- ✓ Student can **describe or point to** one body part of the pelican (beak, feathers, feet).\n- ✓ Student explains a simple **connection** between the pelican's body or habitat and survival (e.g., \"Beak catches fish\" or \"Lives by water\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 85% of students will correctly identify at least 1-2 things pelicans need.\n- Most students will recognize that the pelican's beak or location by water is important.\n- Students demonstrate understanding by explaining or showing (not just memorizing) why pelicans live near water.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support for Struggling Learners:\n\n1. **Simplified Sorting:** Instead of three categories, use just two: \"Pelican's Food\" vs. \"Pelican's Home.\" Reduce the number of picture cards to 4-5 obvious choices.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames:** Provide verbal or written sentence starters:\n   - \"The pelican needs _____ to survive.\"\n   - \"The pelican's _____ helps it _____.\"\n   - Model these sentences aloud before activities.\n\n3. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair struggling students with confident peers during Explore and Elaborate activities. Assign roles (\"You point to the water; I'll hold the card.\").\n\n### Challenge for Advanced Learners:\n\n1. **Comparison Activity:** Show images of two different water birds (e.g., pelican and penguin). Ask: \"How are they the same? How are they different? Why do they have different beaks?\" Guide them to infer that beak shape matches the food the bird eats.\n\n2. **Habitat Prediction:** Give students a picture of a new habitat (e.g., a cold Arctic ocean, a tropical lagoon). Ask: \"Could a pelican live here? Why or why not? What would it eat? Would it be the same pelican?\"\n\n3. **Adaptation Detective:** Challenge students to observe the photo closely and find **three** special body parts that help the pelican survive. Have them draw and label each one with a sentence: \"This _____ helps the pelican _____.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Pelican Life Cycle Exploration:** Read a short picture book about pelican baby growth (e.g., *Pelican's Song* or a simple nonfiction text). Ask: \"What do baby pelicans need? How is it different from what grown-up pelicans need?\" Create a simple before-and-after drawing (egg/chick vs. adult).\n\n2. **All About Water Birds:** Expand to compare pelicans with other water-loving animals (ducks, seagulls, flamingos). Create a \"Water Birds Chart\" where students draw or glue pictures of different birds and sort by \"What They Eat\" and \"Where They Live.\" Use observation and guided inference.\n\n3. **Habitat Hunt Around School:** Take students on a short outdoor walk to find a \"mini-habitat\" (a shrub, puddle, rock pile, tree). Ask: \"What animals might live here? What do they need? Is it like the pelican's ocean home?\" Sketch or photograph and discuss.\n\n---\n\n**Notes for You, the Teacher:**\n\nThis lesson keeps Kindergarten attention spans in mind with frequent activity changes and visual supports. The pelican photo is concrete and engaging—students can see why this bird lives by water and what it needs. The activities move from observation (Engage) through hands-on sorting (Explore) to vocabulary and reasoning (Explain) and finally to application (Elaborate and Evaluate). \n\nAdjust vocabulary complexity based on your class. Some groups may need picture-only labels; others can handle simple written words. The core concept—**animals need food, water, and shelter to survive, and their body parts help them get what they need**—is repeated across all five phases, building understanding through repetition and varied modalities.\n\nHave fun with this one! Pelicans are visually striking and naturally engage young learners. You'll likely field lots of questions about why that beak is so big and whether pelicans are funny-looking. Lean into that curiosity—it's the engine of great science learning.",
