ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about mushrooms and activate prior knowledge about forests and decomposition.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital display of the photograph (large enough for all students to see clearly)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: A real mushroom specimen in a clear container (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projected. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (one at a time, pausing for responses):\n   - \"What do you notice growing on the tree in this picture? What do they look like?\"\n   - \"Why do you think these mushrooms are growing right here on the dead wood instead of somewhere else in the forest?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen mushrooms growing in your neighborhood or a park? Where were they?\"\n   - \"What do you think mushrooms eat, since they're not green like plants?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Say, \"I wonder what mushrooms do for the forest. Do you think they're important? Let's find out together today!\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper. (Don't correct misconceptions yet—they'll self-correct during Explore.)\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become forest detectives and discover what these mushrooms are really doing in the forest.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what mushrooms need to survive and discover their role in breaking down dead material.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small pieces of untreated wood (dead branches or craft wood pieces—roughly 3\" long) for each pair of students\n- Small containers (yogurt cups, paper cups, or small plastic boxes with lids)\n- Water in spray bottles or small cups\n- Dark cloth or paper to cover some containers (to create shade)\n- Rulers and pencils for recording\n- Optional: Magnifying glasses\n- **Substrate options for optional extension:** crumbled leaves, soil, sawdust, bark pieces\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Observing Mushroom Habitat Conditions (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into pairs.** Display the photograph again and ask: \"What do you notice about where the mushrooms are growing? Is it wet or dry? Sunny or shady?\"\n\n2. **Explain:** \"We're going to test what mushrooms need to grow. We'll predict and observe.\"\n\n3. **Student Investigation Instructions (written or read aloud):**\n   - Each pair receives one piece of wood and two small containers.\n   - **Container 1 (Control):** Place wood piece inside, leave uncovered on the sunny windowsill.\n   - **Container 2 (Test):** Place matching wood piece inside, spray water on it lightly, and cover the container with dark cloth to keep it shady.\n   - **Predict:** Before you start, draw or write: \"Which container do you think will grow mushrooms? Why?\"\n   - **Observe daily:** Check your containers each day for 1-2 weeks. Record any changes (color, texture, moisture, visible fungi or mold). Use a ruler to measure if visible growth appears.\n   - **Question to guide observations:** \"What's different between the two containers?\"\n\n4. **Teacher Circulates:** Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you see changing?\" \"Why do you think that's happening?\" \"Is it wet or dry in this one?\" *Do not provide answers—guide thinking.*\n\n**Part B: Discussing What Mushrooms Break Down (Optional, if time allows or during follow-up)**\n\nIntroduce a small piece of dead wood. Ask: \"What was this wood before? (A tree.) Now what's happening to it? (It's breaking apart, getting softer, changing.) Who or what is helping this happen?\" Prompt students toward understanding that invisible fungi and mushrooms are eating and breaking down the wood.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without directing answers.\n- Ask students to make observations using their senses (look, feel texture, describe moisture).\n- Encourage students to compare the two containers and explain differences.\n- Validate all observations as data.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that the moist, shaded container shows more change (color shifting, softening wood, possible visible mold or fungal growth).\n- Students will record observations through drawings and writing.\n- Students will begin forming ideas that mushrooms like moisture and shade.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the concept of decomposers and their role in ecosystems using student discoveries as evidence.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary written and illustrated\n- The photograph, displayed again\n- Student observation sheets/data from Explore\n- Optional: A simple diagram showing a forest food web or decomposition cycle\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask pairs to share: \"What did you observe in your containers? Which one looked different?\"\n   - List observations on the board.\n   - Ask: \"What do both containers have in common that made the difference?\" (Guide toward: moisture and shade.)\n\n2. **Introduce and Define Key Vocabulary (7-10 minutes):**\n\n   Read each definition aloud and discuss. Use the photograph and student observations as examples.\n\n   - **Decomposer:** A living thing that breaks down dead plants and animals and turns them into soil. *\"Mushrooms are decomposers—they're like nature's cleanup crew!\"*\n   \n   - **Fungus/Fungi:** Living things that are not plants or animals. They break down food from outside their body and are often found in damp, shady places. *\"Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of fungi—the part we see above ground.\"*\n   \n   - **Habitat:** A place where an organism lives and finds food, water, and shelter. *\"The decaying wood in a shady, moist forest is the perfect habitat for mushrooms.\"*\n   \n   - **Decomposition:** The process of breaking down dead material into smaller pieces and nutrients. *\"Mushrooms help with decomposition—they make dead things disappear and help soil become rich again.\"*\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the image: \"These mushrooms are growing on dead wood. Why? Because they're decomposers eating the dead tree. The moist, shady forest is their perfect habitat.\"\n   - Ask: \"How is your moist, shaded container like the forest where these mushrooms grow?\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students: \"Turn to a partner and explain: What is a decomposer and why do mushrooms like shady, wet places?\"\n   - Listen to partner conversations; address any misconceptions.\n   - Ask 2-3 students to share aloud.\n\n**Vocabulary Reference Sheet (provide or display for reference):**\n\n| Term | Simple Definition | Example |\n|------|-------------------|---------|\n| **Decomposer** | A living thing that breaks down dead stuff into nutrients | Mushrooms breaking down wood |\n| **Fungus** | A living thing (not a plant) that eats dead material | The mushrooms in the photo |\n| **Habitat** | A home where an organism gets food, water, and shelter | The moist, shady forest floor |\n| **Decomposition** | The breaking down of dead things | Dead wood becoming soft and crumbly |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that mushrooms are decomposers.\n- Students can identify that mushrooms need moisture and shade.\n- Students recognize that decomposers help return nutrients to soil and are important in ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply and deepen understanding by constructing an argument about why mushrooms are important in forests and exploring ecosystem connections.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pictures or printouts showing: a healthy forest floor, dead wood, healthy soil, forest food web (simplified)\n- Optional: Small poster boards or paper for creating arguments\n- Sentence frames (written on board or paper):\n  - \"Mushrooms are important because ___.\"\n  - \"If there were no mushrooms, ___.\"\n  - \"Evidence: I know this because ___.\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Constructing an Argument (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the Task:** \"We've learned that mushrooms are decomposers. Now let's think bigger: Why are mushrooms important to the whole forest? You're going to build an argument—that's a statement with reasons and evidence.\"\n\n2. **Use the Sentence Frame:**\n   - \"Mushrooms are important because **they break down dead wood and return nutrients to the soil so trees can grow strong.**\"\n   - \"**Evidence:** We know this because **we saw that mushrooms need dead wood to grow, and in the forest, when mushrooms break down dead trees, that wood disappears and the soil gets rich.**\"\n\n3. **Small Group Activity:**\n   - Divide students into groups of 3-4.\n   - Give each group the sentence frames and one piece of chart paper.\n   - **Task:** \"Write or draw your own argument about why mushrooms are important to the forest. Use what you learned from your experiment and the photo.\"\n   - Provide support by asking guiding questions: \"What do decomposers do? What happens to dead wood without mushrooms?\"\n\n4. **Gallery Walk:** Students walk around and view each group's argument. Briefly discuss as a class.\n\n**Part B: Ecosystem Connection (5 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show a simple forest food web diagram** (or draw one together):\n   - Sun → Plants → Insects → Birds\n   - Dead leaves/wood → Mushrooms → Soil → Plants\n   \n2. **Discuss:** \"See how everything is connected? When mushrooms break down dead stuff, it helps soil get rich, and then plants grow using that rich soil. It's like mushrooms are helping the whole forest!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group work by asking guiding questions.\n- Ensure all students contribute their ideas.\n- Validate reasoning and evidence-based thinking.\n- Help students make connections to the photograph and their container observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students construct a simple argument with a claim and evidence about why mushrooms matter.\n- Students understand that decomposers connect to plants and the broader forest ecosystem.\n- Students recognize cause-and-effect relationships (mushrooms → decomposition → nutrient-rich soil → plant growth).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of mushrooms as decomposers, their habitat needs, and their ecological importance.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observations of student participation during partner discussions and group share-outs.\n- Quality of student predictions and observations in the container experiment.\n- Accuracy of student-constructed arguments in the Elaborate phase.\n- Listen-ins during pair-share to check understanding of vocabulary.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (End of Lesson)**\n\n**Student Task:** Provide each student with a half-sheet of paper. Students respond to ONE of the following (teacher reads aloud; students can draw, write, or verbally respond):\n\n**Option A (Recall & Understand):**\n\"In the picture, what are the mushrooms doing on the dead wood? Use the word 'decomposer' in your answer.\"\n\n**Option B (Explain & Apply):**\n\"Why do you think mushrooms grow in shady, wet forests but not in sunny deserts? Explain what mushrooms need.\"\n\n**Option C (Argue with Evidence):**\n\"Are mushrooms important to the forest? Draw and write: Claim (yes or no) and one reason why.\"\n\n**Assessment Rubric for Exit Ticket:**\n\n| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Advanced |\n|----------|------------|-----------|----------|\n| **Understanding of Role** | Student mentions mushrooms but doesn't explain decomposition | Student correctly identifies mushrooms as decomposers breaking down wood | Student explains decomposition and connects to nutrient cycling |\n| **Habitat Knowledge** | Limited mention of conditions | Student identifies moisture and shade as needed | Student explains cause-and-effect (moist/shady → fungi thrives) |\n| **Evidence Use** | Vague or no evidence | Uses one piece of evidence from lesson | Combines evidence from photo, experiment, and discussion |\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Student explains that mushrooms break down dead material (decompose).\n✓ Student identifies at least one habitat need (moisture OR shade).\n✓ Student provides one reason or piece of evidence supporting their understanding.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- All students will demonstrate understanding that mushrooms are decomposers.\n- 80%+ of students will accurately identify habitat conditions (moisture and shade).\n- 70%+ of students will construct a simple argument with evidence about mushroom importance.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Sentence Frame Anchor Chart:** Provide a permanent, visible reference chart with vocabulary and sentence starters. Example:\n   - \"Mushrooms are ___.\"\n   - \"Mushrooms need ___ to grow.\"\n   - \"Mushrooms help the forest by ___.\"\n\n2. **Paired Observation:** Pair students with stronger partners during the container experiment. Assign roles: one student observes/points, the other records with drawings (reducing writing demand).\n\n3. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Offer drawing-only option with word bank (decomposer, wood, moisture, shade, important). Student draws a picture and labels it.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Experiment:** Challenge students to design a third experimental condition. Example: \"What if we added different types of material—leaves, paper, bark—to our containers? Would mushrooms prefer one over the other?\" Students predict and test over two weeks.\n\n2. **Food Web Complexity:** Provide an advanced food web diagram showing multiple decomposers (mushrooms, bacteria, earthworms). Ask: \"Why do you think nature has multiple decomposers instead of just one? What happens if one disappears?\"\n\n3. **Real-World Problem:** Present a scenario: \"A forest gets polluted and loses its mushrooms. What might happen to the forest over time?\" Students construct a written argument with multiple pieces of evidence about consequences of losing decomposers.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Mushroom Field Guide Creation:** Students create a simple illustrated guide to local mushrooms found in your area or a nearby park (if safe and supervised). Include drawings, habitat descriptions, and whether each mushroom is a decomposer. Partner with the art teacher if possible.\n\n2. **Decomposition Time Capsule:** Students place various materials (leaf, paper, plastic, wood, cloth) in buried containers in a garden or safe outdoor space (with permission). Over 4-6 weeks, they exhume and observe decomposition rates. Graph results: \"Which materials decompose fastest? What does mushrooms' job tell us about protecting our environment?\"\n\n3. **Guest Speaker or Virtual Visit:** Invite a mycologist (fungal scientist) or local naturalist to discuss mushrooms, or show a short video about fungi in ecosystems. Students prepare questions in advance based on lesson learning.\n\n4. **Extend to Decomposition at Home:** Send home an observation sheet: \"Find three places around your home or neighborhood where you might find mushrooms or decomposing material. Draw and describe the habitat conditions (wet? shady? near dead wood?).\" Students share findings in a class discussion about decomposition everywhere.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** If using real mushrooms, emphasize that **many mushrooms are poisonous**. Students should never taste or handle wild mushrooms without adult guidance. Use commercially purchased, food-safe mushrooms for any direct handling activities.\n- **Timing:** The container experiment works best if set up mid-lesson (day 1) and observed over days 3-14 of the next week. Start observations within 3-4 days; visible mold or fungal growth typically appears by day 7-10 in moist conditions.\n- **Real Mushroom Observation:** If possible, find a local fallen log or dead wood in your schoolyard (with permission from administration). Examine it outdoors using magnifying glasses to spot mushrooms, fungi, and other decomposers. This brings the lesson to life and grounds abstract concepts in real observation.\n- **Vocabulary Spiraling:** Return to these terms throughout the year in other ecology lessons. Decomposers connect to food chains, nutrient cycles, and biomes—reinforce terminology regularly.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson honors the photograph's compelling documentation of mushrooms in their natural habitat while developing Third Grade students' understanding of ecological roles, habitat needs, and the interconnectedness of forest life.**",
