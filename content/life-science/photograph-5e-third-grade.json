Identify and describe different habitats visible in the photograph (forest, farmland, clearings).\n2. Explain how specific plant and animal traits help them survive in a forest habitat.\n3. Construct a simple argument with evidence about which organisms can survive well in a forest versus an open field.\n4. Design or describe how an organism's body or behavior helps it live successfully in its habitat.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital photograph (displayed via projector, smartboard, or printed copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper and marker for recording student observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without explanation. Invite students to look carefully for 30 seconds in silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions in order:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What's the biggest thing you notice?\" *(Accept all responses—students might mention trees, roads, green areas, or the sky.)*\n   - \"Why is the left side so dark green and thick, while the right side has more open, light green spaces? What's different about those areas?\" *(Guide toward habitat differences: dense forest vs. farmland.)*\n   - \"If you were a rabbit, where would you want to live—in the dark, thick forest or in the open field? Why?\" *(Accept reasoning; introduce the idea that different places work better for different animals.)*\n   - \"What animals or plants do you think live in the thick forest? What about in the open green fields?\" *(Activate prior knowledge about habitats.)*\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder why some animals choose to live in the forest and others live in the fields. What do you think?\" *(Record student wonderings on chart paper.)*\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore what makes a forest a good home for some animals and plants, and why other creatures might do better in open spaces.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how habitats provide what organisms need to survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards or small papers\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Pictures of forest animals and plants (provided by teacher or student drawings)\n- Two large paper bags or boxes labeled \"Forest Habitat\" and \"Open Field Habitat\"\n- Real objects representing habitat features: leaves, twigs, rocks, grass samples, or pictures of water, soil, sunlight, shelter\n- Chart paper divided into two columns (\"Forest\" and \"Open Field\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **In pairs or small groups**, students receive 4–5 cards with pictures or names of organisms: deer, squirrel, owl, grasshopper, hawk, fox, wildflower, oak tree, mouse, prairie grass.\n\n2. **Set up two habitat stations** around the room:\n   - **Station A (Forest Habitat):** A table or area decorated with actual leaves, twigs, branches arranged to show dense coverage, shade, moisture. Include labels: \"Lots of trees,\" \"Dark and shady,\" \"Soil with rotting leaves,\" \"Places to hide.\"\n   - **Station B (Open Field Habitat):** A table or area with grass samples, open space, bright paper to represent sunlight, few objects. Include labels: \"No trees,\" \"Sunny and open,\" \"Less shelter,\" \"Lots of open ground.\"\n\n3. **Students walk to each station**, observe for 1 minute, then place their organism cards in the habitat where that organism would survive best.\n\n4. **Discuss reasoning:** Ask pairs to explain why they placed each organism in that habitat. Encourage observations like: \"The squirrel needs trees to climb\" or \"The hawk needs open space to fly and see prey.\"\n\n5. **Record observations** on the two-column chart by writing or drawing which organisms belong in each habitat.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and listen without correcting immediately.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What does a squirrel need? Can it find that in the field?\" or \"Why would a grasshopper like the open field more?\"\n- Note misconceptions for the Explain phase.\n- Encourage students to look at habitat features (trees, shade, openness) and connect them to organism needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students place most organisms in logical habitats based on visual cues and prior knowledge.\n- Students can verbally explain at least one reason (e.g., \"Trees for climbing\" or \"Space to run\").\n- Chart is populated with organisms sorted by habitat type.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with the two-column list from Explore\n- Printed vocabulary cards with pictures\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Whiteboard or chart to record key terms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share out from Explore:** Invite 3–4 pairs to share one organism they placed and why. Validate correct reasoning and gently redirect misconceptions.\n   - *Example correction:* \"A mouse might live in an open field, but it would hide in tall grass or burrows. Let's add that to our thinking.\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions and visual examples:\n\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an organism lives that gives it food, water, air, and shelter.\n   - **Organism:** A living thing, like an animal, plant, or insect.\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an organism survive in its habitat.\n   - **Environment:** Everything around an organism, including weather, soil, water, plants, and other animals.\n   - **Survival:** Staying alive by getting what you need from your habitat.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the dense forest: \"Look at all these trees packed closely together. Animals that live here are adapted to low light and crowded spaces. The tree roots adapt to sharing soil. This is a forest habitat.\"\n   - Point to the open farmland: \"See the wide-open green spaces? Animals here need to be fast runners or flyers to survive without trees for shelter. This is a different habitat.\"\n   - Point to the road: \"Humans built this road through the habitat. What do you think happens to animals that lived here?\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show me thumbs up if you can tell me one thing an owl needs from a forest habitat.\" (Students respond, then call on 2–3 to answer: trees to perch, darkness, mice for food.)\n   - \"Turn and talk to a partner: Why wouldn't a prairie grasshopper be happy in this thick forest?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal or plant lives that has everything it needs (food, water, home, air). |\n| **Organism** | Any living thing—animals, plants, bugs, and even tiny things we can't see. |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or something an animal does that helps it survive in its home. |\n| **Environment** | Everything around a living thing—soil, water, weather, sun, and other living things. |\n| **Survival** | Staying alive by getting food, water, air, and shelter from your habitat. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use at least two vocabulary terms correctly in sentences.\n- Students can match simple adaptations to habitats (e.g., \"Thick fur → cold forest\").\n- Students verbally explain that different habitats have different features and support different organisms.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing or describing adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Drawing paper and colored pencils\n- Picture cards of real forest and field animals\n- Index cards for writing\n- Optional: building materials (pipe cleaners, cardboard, clay) if students design habitats\n\n**Activity:** \n\n**Choose one of these two options based on student readiness:**\n\n**Option A: Adaptation Design (Drawing-Based)**\n\n1. Each student selects one animal from the photograph area or provided pictures (e.g., squirrel, deer, owl, grasshopper).\n\n2. Students draw or label the animal and identify 2–3 body parts or behaviors that help it survive in its habitat:\n   - *Example:* \"Owl has big eyes to see in the dark forest.\"\n   - *Example:* \"Deer has long legs to run away from danger in open spaces.\"\n\n3. Students write or dictate one sentence explaining how each adaptation helps the animal survive:\n   - **Sentence frame:** \"[Animal] has [adaptation] to help it [survive action] in the [habitat].\"\n\n**Option B: Habitat Redesign (Problem-Solving)**\n\n1. Present a scenario: \"A forest fire burned down many trees. The habitat changed from a dense forest to an open area with no trees. Which animals will have trouble surviving now? Which animals might move in?\"\n\n2. Students sort provided animal pictures into two groups:\n   - \"Animals that might leave the forest\" (animals that needed trees).\n   - \"Animals that might move in\" (animals that prefer open spaces).\n\n3. Students draw or write one way the habitat changed and how that affects the animals.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"What does that adaptation do for the animal?\" or \"Why is that body part important in a forest?\"\n- Encourage detailed thinking: \"Tell me more about why a squirrel's claws help it survive.\"\n- Support students in using vocabulary (habitat, adaptation, environment, survival).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 2+ adaptations per animal with visual or written support.\n- Students write or explain how an adaptation connects to habitat survival.\n- Students apply thinking to new scenarios (habitat changes).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitats and organism survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Listen to student explanations during Engage and Explore—note who can describe habitat differences.\n- During Explain, observe thumbs-up/thumbs-down responses to check-for-understanding questions.\n- During Elaborate, examine drawings and written responses for evidence of adaptation understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket (End of Lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a slip of paper or digital form with these prompts:\n\n1. **Draw or write:** What is one thing a forest animal needs to survive in the forest?\n   - *(Success criterion: Student identifies a real need—food, water, shelter, or air.)*\n\n2. **Answer:** If a thick forest suddenly turned into an open field, why would a squirrel have trouble surviving?\n   - *(Success criterion: Student identifies loss of trees, shelter, food source, or climbing spaces.)*\n\n3. **Circle or choose:** Which animal would do BETTER if the forest became an open field?\n   - A) Squirrel    B) Hawk    C) Owl\n   - *(Success criterion: Student selects B [Hawk] and can give one reason.)*\n\n**Alternative Summative Assessment (If Time Allows):**\n\n**Short interview or written response:**\n- \"Look at this photograph again. Tell me about two different habitats you see. What animals might live in each? Why?\"\n- *(Success criterion: Student names two habitats, identifies 1+ organism per habitat, and gives at least one reason why that organism fits there.)*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- ✓ Students correctly identify habitat needs (food, water, shelter, sunlight).\n- ✓ Students explain cause-and-effect (habitat change → animal struggle/success).\n- ✓ Students match organisms to habitats with logical reasoning.\n- ✓ Students use lesson vocabulary (habitat, adaptation, organism, survival) in context.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary scaffold:** Provide students with a visual reference card showing pictures and labels of key terms. Allow them to use the card during activities.\n\n2. **Habitat station pre-teaching:** Before the Explore phase, do a mini-walk-through of each station with small groups, pointing out and naming habitat features. Ask: \"What do you see here? What animals like this?\"\n\n3. **Simplified exit ticket:** Reduce questions to yes/no or multiple-choice format. Pair each question with a picture. Example: \"Does a squirrel need trees? Yes / No\" with a picture of a squirrel and tree.\n\n4. **Partner work:** Always pair struggling learners with a peer who can verbalize thinking. Encourage the partner to explain first, then the student repeats or adds ideas.\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-habitat scenarios:** Present a more complex scenario: \"A new road was built through the forest (like in the photo). Some areas are still thick forest, some are open cleared land, and some are just the road. Draw or describe THREE different habitats now and which animals might live in each.\"\n\n2. **Predict and explain:** \"If humans continue to clear forests to build roads and houses, what do you think will happen to forest animals? Why?\" Encourage use of evidence and multiple reasons.\n\n3. **Research task:** Assign students to research one forest animal in depth: What does it eat? Where does it sleep? What would happen if its habitat changed? Have them create a simple poster or presentation.\n\n4. **Adaptation deepening:** Ask: \"Some animals have adaptations we see (like claws). Others have adaptations in their behavior (like sleeping at night). Can you think of a forest animal's behavior that helps it survive?\" Examples: owls hunting at night, deer hiding fawns.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Habitat diorama project:** Students create a shoebox or paper-cup diorama of a forest or field habitat, including plants and at least two animals with labels explaining why each organism survives there. Display around the classroom.\n\n2. **Local habitat walk:** (If possible) Take students on a nature walk around the school grounds or nearby park. Ask them to identify the habitat(s), list organisms they see or hear, and discuss how each organism is adapted to that specific place. Return to class and create a \"Our Local Habitat\" poster.\n\n3. **Before/After habitat change:** Students create two drawings—one showing a forest habitat as it is now, and one showing it after a major change (fire, flood, urban development). Write captions explaining which animals would leave and which might arrive.\n\n4. **Animal adaptation charades:** Students act out different adaptations (flying, burrowing, climbing, hiding in grass) while classmates guess the adaptation and discuss which habitats it helps animals survive in.\n\n5. **Photograph comparison:** Provide students with photos of different habitats (rainforest, desert, ocean, wetland, tundra). Sort and discuss which animals from your lesson might live in each, and what new adaptations would be needed.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Photography use:** This aerial photograph is powerful because it shows scale, habitat variation, and human impact (the road). Students can see that Earth contains many different living places all in one region.\n- **Safety reminder:** If conducting Explore stations, ensure all materials are age-appropriate. Avoid sharp twigs; supervise closely if using real soil or decomposing leaves.\n- **Pacing:** This lesson works as two 45-minute sessions (Engage + Explore on Day 1; Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2) or one extended block. Adjust based on your class discussion depth.\n- **Prior knowledge:** Students at Third Grade typically know basic animals and habitats from previous grades. This lesson builds on that by deepening cause-and-effect thinking and vocabulary precision.",
