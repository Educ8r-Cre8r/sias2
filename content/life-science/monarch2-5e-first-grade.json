Observe and describe the external body parts of a butterfly (wings, antennae, legs) and explain how each part helps the butterfly survive.\n2. Identify and sequence the stages of the monarch butterfly life cycle (egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → adult butterfly).\n3. Compare how a caterpillar and an adult butterfly look different and explain why these differences help them survive.\n4. Make and record observations using drawings and words to show what they learned about butterfly life cycles.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the monarch butterfly emerging from its chrysalis.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the monarch butterfly photograph (large, 8.5\" × 11\" or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Hook:** Project or display the photograph large enough for all students to see clearly. Say: \"Look at this amazing picture! Something wonderful is happening right now in this photo. What do you see?\"\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (calibrated for First Grade):**\n   - \"What animal is in this picture? What color is it?\"\n   - \"Do you see anything coming out of? What looks different from things we know?\" (Point to the chrysalis shell on the left.)\n   - \"Where do you think this butterfly came from? Was it always a butterfly?\"\n   - \"If you could follow this butterfly's life, what do you think happens next?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \"I'm thinking this butterfly wasn't always orange and black with wings. What do you think it looked like before? Draw or tell a partner what you imagine!\" (Allow 2-3 minutes for partner talk or quick sketches.)\n\n4. **Record Wonderings:** Create a class \"Wonder Wall\" on chart paper: \"What we want to know about butterflies.\" Write down 2-3 student questions.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to be butterfly detectives and learn the secret story of how a butterfly grows and changes!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the butterfly life cycle through hands-on sequencing and observation activities.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Life cycle diagram cards (printed and laminated, or glued to index cards): one set per pair of students showing:\n  - Egg (tiny, on a leaf)\n  - Caterpillar/larva (green with stripes)\n  - Chrysalis (green pod)\n  - Adult butterfly (monarch with wings)\n- Large timeline paper (18\" × 12\") per pair or small group\n- Colored pencils and pencils\n- Magnifying glasses (optional, 1-2 per group)\n- Picture books about butterfly life cycles (e.g., *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* or *Butterfly* by Susan L. Roth) — 1-2 copies for reference\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Life Cycle Sequencing (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Give each pair or small group a mixed-up set of 4 life cycle cards (egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly).\n2. Say: \"These pictures show a butterfly's life, but they're all mixed up! Look at the cards. Can you put them in the order you think they happen? Talk with your partner about why you put them that way.\"\n3. Teacher circulates, listens to student reasoning, and asks probing questions: \"Why did you put the egg first? What happens to the caterpillar? How does it change?\"\n4. After 5 minutes, have 2-3 groups share their sequences. Use the monarch photo from the ENGAGE phase to help confirm: \"We can see the butterfly is coming out of the chrysalis, so the chrysalis comes before the adult butterfly.\"\n\n**Step 2: Draw and Label (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. Give each student a large piece of timeline paper divided into 4 boxes.\n2. Say: \"Now you're going to draw the butterfly's life story. In each box, draw one stage. You can copy from the cards or use your imagination. Write or tell me what's happening in each stage.\"\n3. Teacher models the first box: \"In my first box, I'm drawing a tiny egg on a leaf because that's where a butterfly's life starts.\"\n4. Students draw their own life cycle sequences. Teacher (or aide) circulates, asking questions and scribing labels:\n   - \"Tell me about your drawing.\"\n   - \"What is the butterfly doing in this stage?\"\n   - \"How is this butterfly different from the one in the next box?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Act as a scribe for students who can't write yet; record their words below their drawings.\n- Ask open-ended questions to prompt thinking (\"What do you think this stage is called?\" \"How does the caterpillar change?\").\n- Validate all attempts; don't correct, but gently guide: \"I see you put the butterfly first. Look at this card—the egg. Eggs come first because that's where the butterfly starts.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will sequence the 4 life cycle stages with teacher support.\n- Students will draw and attempt to label each stage of the life cycle.\n- Students will verbally explain at least one change from one stage to the next (e.g., \"The caterpillar gets big\" or \"The butterfly has wings now\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and life science concepts using student observations and the original photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student life cycle drawings from Explore phase (kept visible on desks or posted on board)\n- The original monarch butterfly photograph\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n- Picture book excerpt (optional): A 2-3 minute read-aloud from *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* or similar book showing the sequence\n- Anchor chart with labeled butterfly body parts (prepared in advance, showing wings, antennae, legs, body)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Group Share and Celebration (5-7 minutes)**\n\n1. Invite 2-3 students to share their life cycle drawings with the class. Say: \"Tell us what's happening in your picture.\"\n2. After each student shares, ask the class: \"Does anyone else have the butterfly in the same order? Show a thumbs up!\"\n3. Affirm correct sequences: \"Yes! The egg comes first, then the caterpillar, then the chrysalis, then the butterfly emerges!\"\n\n**Part 2: Introduce Vocabulary (8-10 minutes)**\n\nDisplay the anchor chart with pictures and introduce these terms using student-friendly language:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n1. **Life cycle** — \"The stages a living thing goes through from the beginning of its life to when it grows up. A butterfly's life cycle has four stages.\"\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* \"All the different ways a butterfly grows and changes.\"\n\n2. **Metamorphosis** — \"A big change that happens when an insect like a butterfly grows. It changes its body completely!\"\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* \"When a butterfly changes SO much it looks like a totally different animal.\"\n\n3. **Caterpillar** — \"The stage of the butterfly's life when it's a long, wiggly, tiny animal with no wings. It eats leaves all day long.\"\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* \"A baby butterfly that looks like a worm and eats a lot!\"\n\n4. **Chrysalis** — \"A hard shell that the caterpillar makes around itself. Inside, the caterpillar is changing into a butterfly. We see this in our photo!\"\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* \"A butterfly's sleeping bag where it changes into a butterfly.\"\n\n5. **Adaptation** — \"A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive. Butterflies have bright wings to stay safe.\"\n   - *Student-friendly definition:* \"Special things about an animal that help it live and be safe.\"\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** Point to the original photo and say: \"Right here, we can see the chrysalis—that hard shell—and the butterfly's wings coming out. The wings are orange and black, and that helps the butterfly stay safe because some animals think those colors mean 'don't eat me!'\"\n\n**Part 3: Check for Understanding (2-3 minutes)**\n\nAsk quick yes/no or show-me-with-your-fingers questions:\n- \"If I say 'egg,' can you hold up one finger? If I say 'caterpillar,' hold up two fingers?\" (Repeat for all stages.)\n- \"Does a butterfly start as an egg or a butterfly?\" (Students respond.)\n- \"Does the caterpillar look like the butterfly?\" (Students shake heads or say \"No!\")\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least two stages of the butterfly life cycle (caterpillar and butterfly are most obvious).\n- Students understand that a butterfly changes a lot as it grows and that these changes are called metamorphosis.\n- Students recognize that the chrysalis is the stage shown in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by comparing butterfly body parts to survival and by connecting the life cycle to the original photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards or paper with pictures of butterfly body parts (wings, antennae, legs) — one set per pair or group\n- Chart paper labeled \"How do butterflies' body parts help them survive?\"\n- Colored pencils, markers, and plain paper\n- Optional: Butterfly observation video clip (30 seconds) showing a butterfly drinking nectar or flying (YouTube: \"Monarch Butterfly Drinking from Flower\" or similar)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Butterfly Body Part Detective (8-10 minutes)**\n\n1. Show the anchor chart with labeled butterfly body parts. Say: \"Butterflies have special body parts that help them survive. Let's be detectives and figure out what each part does!\"\n\n2. Give each pair an index card with a picture of one butterfly body part: wings, antennae, or legs.\n\n3. Ask: \"Look at your body part. Why do you think a butterfly needs this? How does it help the butterfly stay alive and healthy? Talk to your partner and then tell the class.\"\n\n4. Facilitate group sharing:\n   - **Wings:** \"Butterflies fly to find food and escape from animals that want to eat them. The bright colors on the wings can scare away predators!\"\n   - **Antennae:** \"These help butterflies smell flowers and find food far away.\"\n   - **Legs:** \"Butterflies use legs to stand on flowers, hold on while eating, and climb.\"\n\n5. Create a class chart together, drawing or writing:\n   - *Wings → Help butterfly fly and escape danger*\n   - *Antennae → Help butterfly smell*\n   - *Legs → Help butterfly stand and climb*\n\n**Part 2: Connect to the Original Photo (5-7 minutes)**\n\n1. Show the monarch butterfly photograph again. Say: \"Now let's look at our butterfly from the photo. What body parts can you see?\"\n\n2. Students point out and name wings, antennae, and legs.\n\n3. Ask: \"Why is this butterfly using its legs right now?\" (Guide students to notice the butterfly is holding onto the chrysalis shell as it emerges.) \"The strong legs help it climb out! And soon those wet wings will dry, and it will fly away to find flowers and food!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify at least one butterfly body part and explain how it helps the butterfly survive.\n- Students understand that the butterfly's body parts serve specific purposes (flying, smelling, climbing).\n- Students make connections between the photograph and their learning (e.g., \"That butterfly is using its legs!\").\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of the butterfly life cycle, body parts, and life science concepts (metamorphosis, stages of life).\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Do students sequence the life cycle stages correctly with support? Can they explain one transition?\n- Observation during Explain phase: Can students name the stages? Do they understand that a caterpillar and butterfly are the same animal in different forms?\n- Observation during Elaborate phase: Can students identify a butterfly body part and give one reason it's useful?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\nAdminister this assessment individually or in small groups. Present the questions and record student responses (via drawing, one-word answer, or sentence from student):\n\n**Question 1 (Life Cycle Understanding):**\nShow a scrambled picture or sequence of life cycle stages. Ask: \"Can you point to the stage where the butterfly is inside a hard shell? What do we call that?\" \n- *Success Criteria:* Student points to chrysalis and says or recalls \"chrysalis\" (or \"sleeping bag\") with teacher prompt.\n\n**Question 2 (Metamorphosis / Change):**\nAsk: \"A butterfly doesn't start as a butterfly. What does it start as? And how does it change?\"\n- *Success Criteria:* Student says \"egg\" or \"caterpillar\" and mentions \"it gets big\" or \"it changes\" or \"it gets wings.\"\n\n**Question 3 (Body Part and Survival):**\nPoint to the monarch photo and ask: \"What part of the butterfly do you see here? What does the butterfly use that for?\" (Point to wings, antennae, or legs.)\n- *Success Criteria:* Student names the body part (e.g., \"wings\") and gives a function (e.g., \"to fly,\" \"to hold on,\" \"to smell\").\n\n**Question 4 (Open-Ended Observation):**\nAsk: \"If you were a butterfly, what would be the coolest thing about being a butterfly?\" or \"Tell me one thing you learned about butterflies today.\"\n- *Success Criteria:* Student provides a response that reflects learning (e.g., \"I learned caterpillars turn into butterflies!\" or \"Butterflies have pretty wings!\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- First Grade emerging readers/writers: Can point to and name life cycle stages; verbally explain at least one change; identify a butterfly body part.\n- First Grade proficient students: Can sequence the life cycle with minimal support; use vocabulary like \"chrysalis,\" \"caterpillar,\" and \"butterfly\"; make connections between body parts and survival.\n- First Grade advanced students: Can explain the life cycle independently, use \"metamorphosis\" appropriately, and articulate multiple adaptations.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Life Cycle Card Manipulation:** Provide only 2 stages at first (e.g., caterpillar and butterfly) before expanding to 4. Use picture-heavy cards with minimal text. Allow students to manipulate and re-order as needed without time pressure.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:** Pre-teach the 4 life cycle stages the day before using repetition and a picture book (read *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* aloud during morning meeting). Show photos of each stage separately and repeat the name 3-4 times.\n\n3. **Scribed Recording:** For students who cannot yet write or draw, provide sentence frames with pictures:\n   - \"In stage 1, the butterfly is an ______.\"\n   - \"In stage 4, the butterfly has ______.\"\n   - Allow them to point to pictures or copy simple words.\n\n4. **Simplified Body Part Activity:** Focus on just 2 body parts (wings and antennae) instead of three. Use larger, clearer pictures and provide a sentence frame: \"A butterfly uses its ______ to ______.\"\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Detailed Life Cycle Drawings with Labels:** Ask students to add details to each life cycle stage (e.g., \"What does the caterpillar eat?\" \"Where is the egg laid?\" \"What does the chrysalis look like?\"). Encourage them to write simple sentences or labels independently.\n\n2. **Extended Comparative Thinking:** Pose questions like:\n   - \"A caterpillar and a butterfly are the same animal, but they look so different. Why do you think they look different? What do they do differently?\"\n   - \"The butterfly's bright orange wings are a warning. What do you think it's warning predators about?\"\n   - Have students create a Venn diagram or comparison chart: *Caterpillar vs. Butterfly*.\n\n3. **Research Question:** Ask: \"Caterpillars eat leaves all day. What do butterflies eat?\" Provide a simple picture book or image chart showing butterflies drinking nectar from flowers. Have students draw and write about what butterflies eat and why they need to eat different food than caterpillars.\n\n4. **Extension to Other Insects:** Challenge: \"Do you know any other insects that change like butterflies do?\" Introduce the idea that some bugs have life cycles that include big changes (frogs, beetles) and some don't (grasshoppers). Show a simple picture and ask students to predict: \"Would this bug change like a butterfly?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Monarch Butterfly Migration Investigation (Science + Social Studies):**\n   - Teach students that monarch butterflies fly from Canada all the way to Mexico for winter—an amazing journey!\n   - Create a large map on the floor or classroom wall showing the migration route (north to south).\n   - Have students take turns being \"migrating butterflies,\" walking or flying (arms as wings) from \"Canada\" to \"Mexico.\"\n   - Discuss: \"Why do you think butterflies have to move? What might they need in Mexico?\" (Warmth, flowers for food.)\n   - Record student ideas on chart paper.\n\n2. **Life Cycle Retelling and Dramatization:**\n   - Students work in small groups to act out the four stages of the butterfly life cycle.\n   - Assign roles: egg (curled up), caterpillar (crawling and eating), chrysalis (still and quiet), butterfly (flying and dancing).\n   - Perform for another class or parents. This reinforces sequence and allows kinesthetic learners to embody the concept.\n   - Optional: Provide simple props (green paper for leaves, brown paper for chrysalis, etc.).\n\n3. **Butterfly Garden Planning (Real-World Connection):**\n   - If possible, plan a simple flower garden or plant flowers in pots in your classroom window to attract butterflies.\n   - Read a book about butterfly host plants (plants where caterpillars lay eggs, like milkweed).\n   - Have students vote on which flowers to plant. Research with students: \"Which flowers do butterflies like?\"\n   - Create a simple graph or chart showing the class's flower choices.\n   - Throughout the school year, check the garden and record any visiting butterflies or caterpillars.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Pre-lesson Preparation:** If you have access to a butterfly garden kit or live caterpillar/chrysalis specimen, observing real metamorphosis will deepen understanding enormously. Many classroom butterfly kits ship caterpillars that emerge into butterflies over 2-3 weeks.\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** First graders need multiple exposures to new words. Repeat \"chrysalis,\" \"metamorphosis,\" and \"caterpillar\" in context throughout the two days, and reinforce in subsequent lessons.\n- **Cultural Connection:** Monarch butterflies hold cultural significance for many Indigenous peoples in Mexico and the United States. If appropriate for your classroom, learn and share a story about monarch butterflies and their cultural importance.\n- **Photography as Primary Source:** The high-quality photograph is a powerful primary source for first graders. Refer back to it frequently during Explain and Elaborate phases to ground abstract concepts in observable evidence.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson plan provides a complete, ready-to-teach 5E sequence that centers on the striking photograph of a monarch butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, making an abstract life cycle concept concrete and engaging for First Grade students.",
