You can see its four legs spread out with tiny toes gripping the wood, and its long tail helps it balance. The lizard's eye is visible, and it appears to be basking in the sun. The wood has interesting textures and cracks that the lizard uses to hold on.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates thermoregulation - how reptiles control their body temperature. Unlike mammals and birds that make their own body heat, lizards are ectothermic (cold-blooded). They must warm up by basking in sunny spots and cool down by moving to shade. Morning sunshine on a fence post is perfect for a lizard to raise its body temperature so it can move quickly to catch insects.
