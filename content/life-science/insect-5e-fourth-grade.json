Identify and describe external body structures of insects (antennae, legs, body segments, mouthparts) and explain how each structure helps the insect survive and move.\n2. Explain how an insect's senses (sight, smell, touch) help it find and interact with flowers.\n3. Describe the relationship between insects and flowers, and explain why both organisms benefit from this interaction.\n4. Create a simple model or diagram showing how an insect uses its senses and body structures to visit a flower.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring the relationship between the insect and flower in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the daisy with assassin bug\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small magnifying glasses (not required but engaging)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Initial Observation (3 minutes):** Project or hold up the photograph where all students can see it clearly. Say: \"Look carefully at this photograph. What do you notice? What's happening here?\"\n\n2. **Guided Discussion Questions (7 minutes):** Ask students these questions one at a time, allowing 1-2 minutes for discussion before moving to the next:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the insect and the flower?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this insect might be visiting this flower? What could it be looking for?\"\n   - \"What parts of the insect's body help it climb or stay on the flower? Point to them if you can.\"\n   - \"How do you think the insect knows the flower is there? What senses might it use—eyes, nose, or something else?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt (3-4 minutes):** Display this statement: \"This insect and this flower need each other to survive. I wonder how...\" Invite students to complete the thought with a partner. Record 3-4 student wonderings on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n4. **Transition:** Say: \"Today, we're going to become insect detectives and discover how insects and flowers work together to stay alive.\"\n\n**Transition to Explore:**\n\"Let's explore what body parts insects have and how they use them to interact with plants.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate insect body structures and discover how these structures function in survival through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Large printed image of an insect (can be the assassin bug from the lesson photo or a different insect like a bee, butterfly, or ladybug) OR a real insect in a clear container (optional: classroom observation)\n- Printable insect diagram with unlabeled body parts (antennae, legs, eyes, body segments, mouth)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Magnifying glasses (if available)\n- Chart: \"What Does This Body Part Do?\" with columns for body part, description, and function\n- Optional: video clip (2-3 minutes) showing an insect visiting a flower in slow motion\n\n**Activity – \"Insect Detective Investigation\":**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Observe Closely (5 minutes):** In pairs, examine the printed insect image or real insect carefully. If using magnifying glasses, spend 2-3 minutes observing different body parts. Record or draw what you see.\n\n2. **Identify Body Parts (5 minutes):** On your insect diagram, label as many body parts as you can find. Look for:\n   - How many legs does it have?\n   - Where are the eyes?\n   - What are those long, thin things sticking out of its head? (antennae)\n   - What does its mouth look like?\n\n3. **Predict Function (7 minutes):** For each body part you identified, talk with your partner: \"What do you think this part does? How does it help the insect survive or move?\" Write your predictions in the chart. Example: \"The legs help it... walk, climb, grab things.\"\n\n4. **Connect to the Flower Photo (3 minutes):** Look back at the original photograph. Point out which body parts the bug is using to interact with the flower. Discuss: \"Could the bug do this without these body parts?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Why do you think it needs long legs?\" \"What would happen if it didn't have antennae?\"\n- Do NOT correct predictions; validate curiosity and reasoning.\n- Redirect observations back to the photograph frequently.\n- Manage timing so all groups finish labeling before the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Accurately identify 4-6 external body parts of an insect.\n- Make logical predictions about function (even if not scientifically precise).\n- Record observations in words and/or drawings.\n- Begin to see connections between body structures and survival behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific explanations for insect structures and insect-plant relationships.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Completed student charts from Explore phase\n- Printed vocabulary cards (see list below)\n- Photograph of the daisy and assassin bug (displayed prominently)\n- Optional: short video (1-2 minutes) of a bee or butterfly visiting a flower\n\n**Activity – \"Sharing and Naming\":**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):** Invite 2-3 pairs to share one body part they observed and what they think it does. Write their ideas on chart paper. Affirm accurate observations and predictions.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (7 minutes):** Using the photograph as reference, introduce and explain each term in Fourth Grade language:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **External structures:** The body parts we can see on the outside of an animal (antennae, legs, eyes, mouth). These help the animal survive, move, find food, and make babies.\n   - **Antennae:** Long, thin feelers on an insect's head that help it smell, taste, and feel things in the air. They help the insect find flowers!\n   - **Senses:** The ways an insect gets information from the world around it (seeing with eyes, smelling with antennae, feeling with legs and body).\n   - **Pollination:** When pollen from a flower sticks to an insect's body and the insect carries it to another flower. This helps flowers make seeds.\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. An insect's long legs and antennae are adaptations for visiting flowers.\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph (4 minutes):** Point to the bug on the flower and say: \"This insect's antennae are touching the flower—it's using its senses to find food. Its legs grip the flower so it doesn't fall off. While it's eating nectar, pollen sticks to its body. When it visits another flower, that pollen comes with it—and that helps the flower make new seeds! Both the insect and flower benefit.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):** Ask:\n   - \"If an insect didn't have antennae, how would it find flowers?\"\n   - \"Why is it helpful for a flower to have insects visit it?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use vocabulary terms in simple sentences.\n- Students understand that external structures have specific functions.\n- Students can explain in basic terms why insects visit flowers and how both benefit.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a model showing how insect senses and structures work together.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper (11x14\" or poster board)\n- Colored pencils, markers, crayons\n- Pre-drawn insect and flower outlines OR blank paper for student drawings\n- Arrows, labels, and sticky notes\n- Optional: craft materials (pipe cleaners for antennae, yarn for legs) for a 3D model\n\n**Activity – \"Build an Insect-Flower Connection Model\":**\n\n**Student Task:**\n\nIn small groups or individually, create a labeled diagram or model showing:\n\n1. **The insect** with labels for: antennae, eyes, legs, and mouth\n2. **The flower** with a label showing where pollen is\n3. **Arrows showing:** \n   - How the insect's antennae SENSE the flower (arrow from flower to antennae labeled \"Smell\")\n   - How the insect's LEGS help it reach the flower\n   - How POLLEN sticks to the insect's body\n   - How the insect carries pollen to another flower\n\n**Guidance for Students:**\n- \"Draw or build your insect and flower.\"\n- \"Use arrows and words to show how the insect's body parts help it visit the flower.\"\n- \"Label: What does the insect sense? What does it do with that information? What happens next?\"\n- \"Remember: The insect gets food. The flower gets help making seeds. They both benefit!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide sentence starters if students struggle: \"The antennae help the insect... The flower needs the insect to... The insect's legs...\"\n- Ask: \"How would this process be different if the insect didn't have antennae?\" to deepen thinking.\n- Circulate to assess understanding informally through questioning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- A labeled diagram or model showing insect structures and flower interaction.\n- Evidence that students understand cause-and-effect (insect senses flower → insect goes to flower → pollination happens).\n- Ability to explain their model in 2-3 sentences.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students have met the learning objectives through formative and summative assessment.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Are students accurately identifying and describing body parts? Can they make functional predictions?\n- **Listen during Explain:** Do students use vocabulary correctly when discussing structures and senses?\n- **Circulate during Elaborate:** Are students explaining cause-and-effect relationships between structures and behaviors?\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper. Students can respond through drawing and/or writing:\n\n**Question Set A (Choose based on student ability):**\n\n*For all students:*\n1. \"Draw an insect and label two body parts that help it visit flowers.\"\n2. \"Why do insects visit flowers?\" (Answer in 1-2 sentences or draw a picture.)\n\n*Challenge question for advanced learners:*\n3. \"How does the insect's visit help the flower? How does the flower help the insect?\"\n\n**Alternative Exit Ticket Format (Verbal/Teacher-Administered for emerging readers):**\n- Hold up the photograph. Ask individually: \"Point to the insect's antennae. Why are they important?\"\n- \"Tell me one way the insect's body helps it stay on the flower.\"\n- \"What does the insect get from the flower?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery when they:\n- ✓ Identify at least 2 external insect structures correctly\n- ✓ Describe or show how at least one structure helps the insect survive or interact with the flower\n- ✓ Explain in simple terms that insects and flowers help each other\n- ✓ Use lesson vocabulary (antennae, senses, pollen, adaptation) appropriately in at least one response\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- **LO1 (Structures):** Correct identification and labeling in Explore and Elaborate tasks; accuracy in exit ticket drawings/descriptions.\n- **LO2 (Senses):** Student explanations in group discussion and models should reference antennae, eyes, or smell.\n- **LO3 (Relationship):** Exit ticket and Elaborate models should show mutual benefit (insect gets food; flower gets pollen).\n- **LO4 (Model creation):** Elaborate task demonstrates ability to show structures and relationships visually.\n\n**Data Collection:**\n- Save exit tickets to assess individual understanding.\n- Photograph or collect Elaborate models as evidence of learning.\n- Note informal observations in a checklist: Does student understand external structures? Does student understand senses and response? Does student understand plant-insect relationships?\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Diagram:** Provide a pre-labeled insect diagram so students only need to identify 3-4 key structures (antennae, legs, eyes, mouth) rather than all structures. Use this as reference during discussions.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames for Explanation:** Provide sentence starters during Explain and Elaborate:\n   - \"The antennae help the insect _____.\"\n   - \"The insect visits the flower to _____.\"\n   - \"When the insect touches the flower, _____ sticks to its body.\"\n\n3. **Verbal Responses:** Allow students to explain their thinking orally rather than in writing. Pair with a supportive peer or adult for discussions.\n\n4. **Real Insect Observation:** If available, let struggling students observe a real (safe) insect in a clear container during Explore with teacher guidance, rather than relying solely on printed images. This makes structures more concrete.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research Extension:** Assign advanced students to research and present one fact about a different type of pollinating insect (honeybee, butterfly, moth). Have them compare body structures: \"How is a butterfly's mouth different from an assassin bug's? Why?\"\n\n2. **Systems Thinking:** Ask: \"What would happen to flowers if all the insects disappeared? What would happen to insects if flowers disappeared?\" Have students create a cause-and-effect chain or food web diagram showing the consequences.\n\n3. **Detailed Model:** Challenge students to create a more sophisticated model showing the complete lifecycle: Insect visits flower → pollen transferred → flower makes seeds → seeds grow into new plants → new plants provide food for insects. Use arrows to show the cycle.\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis:** Provide images of 2-3 different insects (bee, butterfly, ladybug). Have students create a comparison chart: \"Which adaptations does each insect have for visiting flowers? Which adaptations are the same? Which are different? Why?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Outdoor Flower Hunt:** Take students outside (weather permitting) to observe real flowers and insects. Students sketch insects they see and record: What body parts can you see? What is the insect doing? Students can photograph or sketch insects on flowers to bring back and share with the class.\n\n2. **Pollinator Simulation Game:** Play an interactive game where student \"insects\" move around the room, \"landing\" on flower stations (marked with paper flowers). At each flower, students stick a sticker (representing pollen) to a sticky vest or paper. As they move to the next flower, they \"transfer\" the pollen. Debrief: \"How did you help the flowers reproduce?\"\n\n3. **Life Cycle Poster Project:** Assign students to create a poster showing the lifecycle of a pollinating insect (e.g., bee: egg → larva → adult → visits flowers) with labels and illustrations. Display in hallway or classroom to share learning with other grades.\n\n4. **Letter from an Insect:** Have students write a creative letter from the perspective of the assassin bug (or another insect) describing its day: \"Dear Flower, Today I visited you because... I used my antennae to... Thank you for the nectar!\" This reinforces understanding while building writing skills.\n\n5. **Sensory Observation Journal:** Students keep a 3-5 day observation journal watching for insects in the schoolyard or classroom plants. They sketch and record: What senses did the insect use? What body parts did you see? What was it doing? This extends observation skills and deepens connection to real-world organisms.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- This lesson works best in spring or early fall when insects are actively visiting flowers, allowing for real-world observation opportunities.\n- The assassination bug shown in the photo is a beneficial insect (predator of pest insects), but some students may find its appearance unusual or slightly intimidating. Frame it positively: \"This bug eats other bugs that might harm plants, so it's helpful!\"\n- If live insect observation is not possible, quality video clips (YouTube, PBS Learning Media) of insects visiting flowers are excellent substitutes and maintain engagement.\n- Consider inviting a local beekeeper or naturalist to visit the classroom for an interactive discussion about pollinators—this adds real-world relevance.\n- This lesson pairs well with plant unit studies; consider following up with lessons on flower parts, seed dispersal, or plant life cycles.",
