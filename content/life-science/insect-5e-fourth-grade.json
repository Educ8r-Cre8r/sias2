ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about insects and their interactions with plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image or printed copies of the photograph (bug on daisy)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: live insects in clear containers (pill bugs, ants) for observation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or distribute printed copies so all students can see the bug clearly on the white flower.\n\n2. **Ask engagement questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about this tiny creature on the flower? What is it doing there?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this bug might have chosen this flower? What could it be looking for?\"\n   - \"Look closely at the bug's body. What parts do you see? What might those parts be used for?\"\n   - \"How do you think the bug found this flower in the first place?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge** by asking:\n   - \"Has anyone ever seen an insect on a plant or flower? What was it doing?\"\n   - \"What senses do you think insects might use? Can they see? Can they smell?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what body parts help this bug survive and find food. Let's investigate!\"\n\n5. **Record student predictions** on chart paper under the heading \"What do insects need to survive?\" Keep this visible throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become bug detectives. We'll look at how insects use their special body parts and senses to find food and survive in the world around them.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate insect structures and behaviors through hands-on observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials (per pair of students):**\n- Magnifying glasses (one per pair)\n- Images or diagrams of different insects (ant, grasshopper, butterfly, beetle) printed on cards\n- Body structure chart template (prepared handout with labeled diagram outline of generic insect)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: live insects in clear containers (pill bugs, ants, or beetles if available and appropriate)\n- Tape and string\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute insect images** to pairs of students. Each pair receives 2-3 different insect pictures and the photograph of the bug on the daisy.\n\n2. **Direct students to observe closely:**\n   - \"Using your magnifying glass (if observing live insects) or looking carefully at your pictures, find these body parts on your insects:\n     - Antennae (long, thin structures on the head)\n     - Legs (how many? are they long or short?)\n     - Eyes (how many can you find?)\n     - Mouthparts (what shape are they?)\n     - Body segments (is the body divided into sections?)\"\n\n3. **Have students record observations** on the body structure chart by:\n   - Drawing the insect in the center\n   - Labeling at least 4 external structures\n   - Writing or drawing next to each structure what they think it might be used for (example: \"Antennae—for smelling or touching\")\n\n4. **Ask students to make connections back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Compare your insects to the bug on the daisy. What structures does it have? How might those structures help it find and eat the flower?\"\n\n5. **Conduct a sensory simulation (if live insects unavailable):**\n   - Set up three stations around the room\n   - **Station 1 (Sight):** Display the daisy image and ask, \"How does the flower's color and shape help the bug find it?\"\n   - **Station 2 (Smell):** Place a small dish with a sweet smell (honey, vanilla extract on cotton) and have students predict: \"Could a bug smell this from far away?\"\n   - **Station 3 (Touch):** Provide a textured surface (flower petal replica, smooth leaf) and have students feel: \"What would an insect's antennae tell it about this?\"\n\n6. **Document observations** by having students sketch or write what they discovered at each station.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between pairs and ask guiding questions: \"What do you think this antenna does?\" or \"Where on the flower do you see the bug? Why might it choose that spot?\"\n- Provide magnifying glasses and assist with observation without revealing answers.\n- Prompt students to compare structures: \"Is this antenna the same as the one you see in your other insect picture?\"\n- Record student language and observations for the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will identify 3-4 external structures on insects.\n- Students will make initial predictions about the function of each structure.\n- Students will recognize that the bug on the daisy has adaptations that help it interact with the flower.\n- Students will begin to connect sensory structures (antennae, eyes) to how the insect finds food.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and reinforce concepts with teacher-led discussion connecting exploration to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large diagram of an insect with labels (poster or projected image)\n- Vocabulary cards (for display)\n- Original photograph (displayed again)\n- Student exploration charts from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students** for a whole-group discussion. Display the bug-on-daisy photograph prominently.\n\n2. **Facilitate a share-out:**\n   - Ask pairs: \"What structures did you find on your insects? What did you think they were for?\"\n   - Record responses on a class \"Insect Body Structures\" chart as students share.\n   - Affirm accurate observations: \"Yes! Those long antennae help the bug sense its environment.\"\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions:\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **External structures** | Body parts on the outside of an animal that you can see. |\n| **Antennae** | Long, thin feelers on an insect's head used for sensing smell, touch, and vibrations in the air. |\n| **Sensory information** | Details about the world that an animal's senses (sight, smell, touch, hearing) collect. |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment. |\n| **Survival** | Staying alive and healthy by finding food, water, and shelter. |\n\n4. **Connect vocabulary back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the bug's antennae: \"These antennae are picking up sensory information about the flower—maybe its smell or the texture of the petals. The bug's brain processes this information and tells the bug to move toward the flower to eat.\"\n   - Point to the flower center: \"See all those yellow structures in the middle of the flower? That's pollen and nectar—food for the insect. The bug's special mouth structure (called a rostrum in this case) is designed to extract that food.\"\n   - Trace the bug's legs: \"Strong legs help the bug grip the flower petals so it doesn't fall while eating.\"\n\n5. **Model the sensory-behavior connection:**\n   - Use a simple diagram or animation: \"The bug sees the flower (sight) → The bug smells the sweet nectar (smell) → The bug feels the petals with its antennae (touch) → The bug's brain receives this information → The bug walks toward the flower and feeds.\"\n   - Have students trace this pathway on a printed diagram.\n\n6. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think this bug has long antennae instead of no antennae? What would be different?\"\n   - Ask: \"If a bug couldn't see colors, how might it find flowers to eat?\"\n   - Have students show thumbs up/sideways/down in response: \"External structures help insects survive. True or false?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **External structures:** Body parts on the outside of an animal that you can see.\n- **Antennae:** Long, thin feelers on an insect's head used for sensing smell, touch, and vibrations.\n- **Sensory information:** Details the senses (sight, smell, touch, hearing) collect about the world.\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive.\n- **Survival:** Staying alive by finding food, water, and shelter.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will understand that insects have specialized external structures.\n- Students will recognize that sensory structures (antennae, eyes) collect information from the environment.\n- Students will explain that an insect's brain processes sensory information and causes the insect to behave in certain ways (move, feed, etc.).\n- Students will see the direct connection between the structures they observed and the behavior visible in the photograph (bug feeding on flower).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by designing and testing a model of how insect senses guide behavior.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Blindfolds (scarves or cloth strips)\n- Scent materials in small cups (honey, vanilla, peppermint, lemon—each labeled)\n- Textured materials (sandpaper, silk, cotton, plastic wrap)\n- Diagram showing the sensory-response pathway\n- Recording sheet titled \"What Does the Bug Learn?\"\n- Optional: string or yarn to create a \"path\" to a \"flower\" (paper cutout)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the elaborate challenge:**\n   - \"Now that we understand how insects use their senses, we're going to simulate what it's like to be a bug searching for food using only certain senses. Can we find the 'flower' using only smell? Only touch? Only sight?\"\n\n2. **Conduct a sensory simulation activity** with the whole class or small groups:\n\n   **Round 1: Finding Food by Smell**\n   - One student wears a blindfold and is guided by a partner who describes scents.\n   - Partner holds up scent cups one at a time: \"Can you identify which smell might come from a sweet flower?\"\n   - Student predicts which scent a bug would follow.\n   - Record: \"Which scent did the bug 'choose'? Why?\"\n\n   **Round 2: Finding Food by Touch**\n   - Blindfolded student feels textured materials.\n   - Partner asks: \"Which texture feels most like a soft flower petal? Which texture would help the bug grip the flower?\"\n   - Record observations about texture preferences.\n\n   **Round 3: Finding Food by Sight (Control)**\n   - All students observe the daisy photograph.\n   - Ask: \"Which part of the flower does your eye go to first? Why? (The bright yellow center!) How would color and brightness help the bug find food?\"\n\n3. **Create a sensory pathway model:**\n   - On a large sheet or whiteboard, draw or trace this pathway together:\n     - **Sensory input** (antennae sense smell) → \n     - **Brain processes** (decides to investigate) → \n     - **Behavior/action** (bug walks toward flower) →\n     - **Result** (bug finds food and survives)\n   - Have students label each step and add drawings.\n\n4. **Discuss and record insights:**\n   - \"Which senses were most useful for finding 'food'? Why?\"\n   - \"How would an insect be helpless if it lost its antennae? Its eyes?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the bug in our photograph has such long antennae?\"\n\n5. **Extend the thinking:**\n   - Ask: \"Different insects have different structures. Why might a butterfly have different antenna shapes than a beetle? (Hint: Different insects eat different foods or live in different places.)\"\n   - Show images of insects with varied structures (water striders, dragonflies, ants) and have students predict: \"What might these structures help this insect do?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the sensory simulations with enthusiasm and careful guidance.\n- Ask probing questions: \"What information did your senses give you? How did your brain respond?\"\n- Help students connect the simulation to the real bug on the daisy.\n- Challenge advanced students with comparative questions about insect diversity.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will recognize that multiple senses work together to guide an insect's behavior.\n- Students will understand that sensory information leads to specific responses (behavior).\n- Students will appreciate why insects need all their external structures to survive.\n- Students will apply their learning to other insects and contexts.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of insect structures, sensory abilities, and their relationship to survival and behavior.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore: Can they identify 3+ external structures and propose reasonable functions?\n- Listen during group discussions: Are students using vocabulary correctly? Are they making sensory-behavior connections?\n- Review completed body structure charts from Explore phase for accuracy and reasoning.\n- Check sensory simulation activity: Do students predict accurately about insect behavior based on senses?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket or Written Response**\n\nDistribute index cards or a printed sheet with the following prompt. Students respond individually in writing or drawing:\n\n**Prompt 1 (Structure & Function):**\n\"The bug in the photograph has long antennae and strong legs. Using what you learned, explain why these body parts are important for the bug's survival. (Hint: Think about finding food and staying safe.)\"\n\n**Prompt 2 (Sensory Information & Response):**\n\"Imagine the bug's antennae sense that a delicious flower is nearby. What does the bug's brain tell the bug to do? Draw or write the steps the bug would take to reach the flower and eat.\"\n\n**Prompt 3 (Argument Construction):**\n\"Construct an argument: 'Insects have special external structures that help them survive.' Use evidence from the bug on the daisy to support your argument. (What structures does it have? How do they help?)\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery if they:\n- ✓ Identify at least 3 external structures (antennae, legs, eyes, mouthparts)\n- ✓ Explain that each structure has a survival function (sensing, moving, eating, protecting)\n- ✓ Describe how sensory information (from antennae, eyes) guides the insect's behavior\n- ✓ Make a logical connection: Structures + Senses → Information → Behavior → Survival\n- ✓ Use accurate vocabulary (external structures, senses, adaptation, sensory information)\n- ✓ Support their explanation with evidence from the photograph or observations\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will produce written or drawn responses showing understanding of insect structures and functions.\n- Students will demonstrate the ability to connect sensory input to animal behavior.\n- Students will construct a simple scientific argument using evidence.\n- Teachers will identify which students need re-teaching or enrichment based on response quality.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide a labeled insect diagram:** Before exploration, give students a pre-labeled diagram of an insect so they know which structures to look for. Reduce the number of structures to identify from 4 to 2-3.\n\n2. **Use a sentence frame for argument construction:** Provide a template such as:\n   - \"The bug has ________ [structure]. This helps the bug ________ [function] so it can survive.\"\n   - Students fill in the blanks rather than writing from scratch.\n\n3. **Offer hand-over-hand sensory exploration:** During the Explore phase, pair struggling students with a peer or aide who guides them in feeling textures or smelling scents, and provides descriptive language: \"This antenna is long and thin. It helps the bug sense the air around it.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Comparative insect analysis:** Provide images of 4-5 different insects (dragonfly, ant, butterfly, grasshopper, beetle) and ask: \"How are their external structures different? Why do you think each insect has those structures? What does each insect eat or do?\" Have students create a comparison chart.\n\n2. **Design an insect adaptation:** Present a hypothetical scenario: \"If a new flower grew that smelled like rotten fruit instead of sweet nectar, what changes to an insect's structures or senses would help it find this flower?\" Students sketch and label their adapted insect.\n\n3. **Research and present:** Assign students to research a specific insect-plant interaction (bees and flowers, hummingbird hawk-moths and trumpet vines, etc.). Have them explain how the insect's structures and senses match the plant's features.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Build an Insect Model (Hands-On Craft):**\n   - Provide craft materials: pipe cleaners, foam balls, googly eyes, yarn, cardboard cutouts.\n   - Students create a 3D model of an insect that includes at least 6 external structures (antennae, legs, eyes, mouthparts, wings, body segments).\n   - Students label each part and write one sentence explaining its function.\n   - Display models and have students conduct a \"gallery walk\" where they identify structures on peers' models.\n\n2. **Insect Observation Journal (Field Study):**\n   - Over one week, have students observe insects in the school garden, park, or yard.\n   - Each day, they sketch an insect and note:\n     - What is it doing? (behavior)\n     - What does it interact with? (flower, leaf, animal?)\n     - What structures do you see? (use binoculars if available)\n     - What senses might it be using right now?\n   - Compile observations into a class journal with entries from multiple students.\n\n3. **Sensory Journey Board Game (Collaborative Activity):**\n   - In small groups, students design a board game where players move along a path by answering questions about insect senses and structures.\n   - Example: \"Roll the die. Land on a square that says, 'Your antennae sense a flower! Move 2 spaces forward.'\"\n   - Include challenge cards: \"You lost your legs! How do you move now?\" or \"Your eyes are closed! How do you find food?\"\n   - Play with another group to assess understanding through game-based learning.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety reminder:** If using live insects, ensure students handle them gently and that all insects are returned to their containers immediately. Use hand sanitizer after handling.\n- **Photography tip:** During the Engage phase, having a high-quality projected image of the daisy-and-bug photograph makes observations much easier and more engaging.\n- **Cross-curricular connection:** This lesson pairs well with writing activities (descriptive paragraphs about insects), math (measuring antennae lengths, graphing sensory preferences), and art (detailed nature illustrations).\n- **Real-world relevance:** Explain to students that understanding how insects sense and behave helps scientists create pesticides that target specific pests, design pollinator-friendly gardens, and protect endangered insect species.",
