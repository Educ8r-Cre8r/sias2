ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of frogs on a wall.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, printed color photograph of the frogs on the wall (or display on interactive board)\n- Chart paper and marker\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Allow students 30 seconds of quiet observation.\n\n2. **Introduce with wonder:** \"Look at this amazing picture! What do you notice about these animals? Where are they? Why do you think they're stuck to that wall?\"\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (allow 1-2 minutes of turn-and-talk before each):\n   - \"What body parts do you see on this frog? Can you point to them?\" (Students identify: legs, feet, eyes, mouth, body)\n   - \"How do you think the frog got way up there on that wall? Did it jump, climb, or stick?\" (Activate prior knowledge about frog movement)\n   - \"If you tried to walk on a wall like that frog, what would happen to you? Why is the frog different?\" (Connect to their own bodies and limitations)\n   - \"Look carefully—do you see more than one frog? Are they the same size? Why might they be different sizes?\" (Plant seed for comparing young and adult frogs)\n\n4. **Make a prediction:** \"Today we're going to figure out exactly HOW frogs can stick to walls and climb. We'll also discover why some frogs are bigger than others. What do you think helps the frog stick?\"\n\n5. **Record student ideas** on chart paper (even if incorrect—you'll revisit these in Explain phase).\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become frog scientists and investigate how frogs really use their special feet!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate frog body structures through hands-on observation and model-building.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Printed diagram of a frog with labeled external parts (body, head, legs, feet, eyes, mouth)\n- Real frog figurines (2 sizes, if available) OR printed pictures of an adult and baby frog\n- Sticky tape (painter's tape or masking tape)\n- Smooth white paper or poster board (like the wall in the photo)\n- Small toy animals or objects (cars, blocks) to test sticking\n- Hand lenses (optional, for magnification)\n- Recording sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station 1: Frog Body Structure Exploration (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials.** Pair students and give each pair a frog diagram and either real figurines or pictures.\n\n2. **Guided observation:** \"Use your hand lens to look very carefully at the frog's feet. What do you notice? Are the toes special in any way? Feel the feet—are they smooth or bumpy?\" (Guide them to notice the adhesive toe pads if using real figurines.)\n\n3. **Body part naming:** Have students point to and name each external part on their diagram: head, body, four legs, feet with special toes, eyes, mouth.\n\n4. **Record observations:** Students draw and label a frog, marking which body parts help it stick, jump, and move. They write or dictate one sentence: \"The frog's ________ help it ________.\"\n\n**Station 2: Testing Sticky Feet (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up the model:** Give each pair a piece of smooth poster board (representing the wall). Show them the sticky tape.\n\n2. **Explain the challenge:** \"We're going to test how frogs stick to walls. We have sticky tape that works like a frog's sticky feet. Your job is to use the tape to make a toy or object stick to our paper 'wall.'\"\n\n3. **Student investigation:**\n   - Students tear small pieces of sticky tape.\n   - They attach tape to the bottom of a small toy (car, block, figurine).\n   - They place the toy on the poster board and try to make it \"climb\" the wall without falling.\n   - They test: Does it stick? Can it stay on even when tilted?\n\n4. **Observe differences:** \"Let's try with tape on different amounts of the toy's 'feet.' Does more tape work better? Does less tape work?\"\n\n5. **Record results:** Students document on their sheet: \"The tape helped the toy stick: YES / NO. How many pieces of tape did we use? Did the toy stay on when we tilted the wall?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between stations, asking guiding questions: \"Why do you think the toy is slipping?\" \"What if we added more sticky tape to the feet?\" \"How is this like the frog's feet?\"\n- Avoid telling students the answer; let them discover through trial and error.\n- Note which students understand the connection and which need clarification in Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe frog body parts and can name at least 4-5 external structures.\n- Students discover that sticky tape (like sticky frog feet) helps objects stick to smooth surfaces.\n- Students produce drawings and simple written/dictated observations.\n- Students notice that more sticky surface area = better sticking ability.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to frog biology.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary\n- Pictures of adult and baby frogs (side-by-side comparison)\n- Student observations from Explore phase\n- Interactive whiteboard or poster with diagram of frog body parts\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes)**\n\n1. Ask volunteer pairs to share one thing they discovered: \"What did you notice about the frog's feet?\" or \"What made the tape stick to the wall?\"\n\n2. Affirm all observations and connect to frog biology: \"Yes! Just like the tape stuck, a real frog's feet have special sticky pads that help it climb. Great scientists!\"\n\n**Key Vocabulary Introduction (7 minutes)**\n\nIntroduce each term with a definition and visual reference:\n\n1. **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive. \"A frog's sticky feet are an adaptation because they help the frog stick to walls and climb to find food and stay safe.\"\n\n2. **External Parts:** Parts of an animal's body on the outside that we can see. Point to the diagram: \"A frog's legs, feet, eyes, and mouth are external parts.\"\n\n3. **Sticky Pads (or toe pads):** Special bumpy skin on a frog's feet that makes them sticky, like tape. \"Real frogs have millions of tiny bumps on their feet that act like natural glue.\"\n\n4. **Young/Adult:** \"Young\" means a baby animal; \"Adult\" means a grown-up animal. Show side-by-side pictures: \"This is a young frog, and this is an adult frog. The adult is bigger, but they look alike.\"\n\n5. **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy. \"Frogs survive by using their strong legs to jump away from danger and their sticky feet to climb to safe places.\"\n\n**Vocabulary Chart:** Display visuals with each term where students can reference throughout the lesson and beyond.\n\n**Connection to Photograph (4 minutes)**\n\n1. Return to the original photograph. \"Now we know what we're looking at! The big frog is probably the parent, and the smaller ones are younger frogs. The frogs on the wall are using their sticky feet to stay safe and hunt for food.\"\n\n2. Ask: \"Why would a frog want to climb a wall? What might it find there?\" (Answer: insects, safety from predators)\n\n3. Reinforce: \"The frog's sticky feet are an adaptation. Without them, the frog couldn't climb. Our sticky tape worked like the frog's feet!\"\n\n**Check for Understanding (2 minutes)**\n\nUse quick responses:\n- \"Show me with your fingers—how many legs does a frog have?\" (Students hold up 4 fingers)\n- \"Thumbs up if sticky feet help a frog survive. Thumbs down if they don't.\" (All should be thumbs up)\n- \"Say this with me: 'Frogs have STICKY PADS on their feet!'\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students learn and can name or point to 3-4 key vocabulary terms.\n- Students understand that frog feet are an adaptation for survival.\n- Students recognize adult and young frogs in the photograph.\n- Students can explain (in simple terms) how sticky feet help frogs.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by designing a solution to a real-world problem using frog-inspired ideas.\n\n**Materials (per group):**\n- Small objects that need to \"climb\" (toy figurines, craft foam pieces)\n- Various materials: sticky tape, velcro, rubber bands, sandpaper, fabric scraps, cork pieces\n- Smooth vertical surface (poster board propped at an angle or taped to wall)\n- Design worksheet (see below)\n- Markers and crayons\n\n**Activity: \"Design a Sticky Suit\"**\n\n**Scenario:** \"Imagine a toy animal that needs to climb a wall like a frog, but it doesn't have sticky feet. Your job is to design sticky 'feet' for this toy using materials like tape, velcro, and fabric. Can you make it stick to the wall like a real frog?\"\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge (2 minutes):** Show students a toy without any sticky materials. \"This toy can't stick to walls. What materials do you think would work like frog feet?\"\n\n2. **Brainstorm solutions (3 minutes):** Display various materials (sticky tape, velcro, sandpaper, rubber, fabric). Ask: \"Which of these do you think would make something stick? Why?\"\n\n3. **Design and test (10 minutes):**\n   - Students sketch on a worksheet: \"Draw what sticky feet you will make for your toy.\"\n   - Students choose one material and attach it to their toy's \"feet.\"\n   - Students test their design by placing the toy on the angled poster board. Does it stick? Does it slide?\n   - Students try a different material if the first doesn't work.\n   - Record results: \"Our material was ________. It worked: YES / NO. Why?\"\n\n4. **Compare solutions (3 minutes):** Bring groups together. \"Who made their toy stick? Which material worked best? How is your sticky material like a real frog's feet?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate material selection without judgment.\n- Ask: \"What happens if you use more material?\" \"Can your toy stick when the wall is very steep?\"\n- Help students recognize that their successful material is an adaptation, just like real frogs have.\n- Encourage risk-taking: \"It's okay if it doesn't stick the first time. Real scientists test many ideas!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design and build a model of sticky feet using frog-inspired ideas.\n- Students test multiple materials and evaluate which works best.\n- Students understand that different materials have different properties (some sticky, some rough, some smooth).\n- Students can explain why their choice mimics how frogs use their feet.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of frog body structures, adaptations, and design solutions.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation of student drawings and labels during Explore phase\n- Listen to student explanations during Share-Out in Explain phase\n- Monitor student material choices and reasoning during Elaborate phase\n- Ask quick verbal checks: \"Why do frogs have sticky feet?\" \"Show me a frog's external parts.\"\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket**\n\n**Provide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal for struggling readers):**\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Draw and Label:** \"Draw a frog and label its sticky feet, legs, and head.\"\n\n2. **One Word Answer:** \"What helps a frog stick to a wall?\" (Answer: Sticky feet / toe pads / adaptations)\n\n3. **Yes or No:** \"Do both big frogs and little frogs have sticky feet?\" (Answer: Yes)\n\n4. **Sentence Completion (dictate or write):** \"A frog's sticky feet help it ____________.\" (Possible answers: climb, stick to walls, stay safe, find food, survive)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents have met learning objectives if they:\n- ✓ Can identify and name at least 3 external body parts of a frog (legs, feet, eyes, mouth, body)\n- ✓ Explain that sticky feet are an adaptation that helps frogs survive (with teacher prompting if needed)\n- ✓ Recognize that adult and young frogs are similar but different in size (from photograph observation)\n- ✓ Can apply this knowledge by designing a sticky solution for a toy (Elaborate phase)\n- ✓ Use vocabulary (sticky pads, adaptation, external parts) in at least one response\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students should correctly identify frog body parts.\n- 75% of students should explain that sticky feet help frogs stick or climb.\n- 70% of students should successfully test and evaluate a sticky-foot design.\n- All students should engage in hands-on exploration and show curiosity about frogs.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce observational complexity:** Provide a simplified frog diagram with only 4 labeled parts (body, legs, feet, head) instead of detailed anatomy. Allow these students to focus on just the feet as the \"special\" adaptation.\n\n2. **Scaffold vocabulary:** Use only 2-3 key terms (sticky feet, adaptation, survive) instead of all five. Pair new terms with consistent pictures and repetitive use throughout the lesson.\n\n3. **Hands-on guidance during design:** Pair these students with a peer or provide direct teacher support during the Elaborate phase. Offer pre-cut sticky tape pieces and limit material choices to 2-3 options (tape, velcro, sandpaper) rather than many options.\n\n4. **Simplify exit ticket:** Use picture-based questions: \"Point to the sticky feet.\" \"Does this help the frog?\" instead of written sentence completion.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Deepen comparison:** Provide pictures of multiple frog species (tree frogs, bullfrogs, poison dart frogs). Ask: \"Do all frogs have the same sticky feet? How are their feet different? Why might they be different?\" (Intro to environmental adaptation and species diversity)\n\n2. **Expand design challenge:** Ask advanced students to design sticky feet for multiple animals (lizard, bug, bird). \"Would the same sticky material work for all animals? Why or why not?\" (Apply principles to new contexts)\n\n3. **Investigate young vs. adult:** Provide data or pictures showing a tadpole, young froglet, and adult frog. Ask: \"What changes from a tadpole to an adult frog? When do sticky feet develop?\" (Deepen understanding of life cycles—connects to 1-LS3-1)\n\n4. **Research real applications:** Show pictures of climbing robots or sticky tape innovations inspired by nature. Ask: \"How have humans copied frog feet to solve problems?\" (Real-world STEM connection)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frog Life Cycle Investigation (Follow-up Lesson)**\n   - Provide images or videos showing tadpoles, froglets, and adult frogs in sequence.\n   - Students observe and compare: \"Which stage has sticky feet? When do legs appear? How is a tadpole like its parent frog? How is it different?\"\n   - Connect to 1-LS3-1: Students construct an evidence-based account comparing young and adult frogs.\n   - Activity: Students arrange frog life cycle stages in order and draw what's the same and different at each stage.\n\n2. **Gecko Feet Exploration (Cross-Species Adaptation)**\n   - Show students pictures of geckos (another animal with sticky feet) and compare to frogs.\n   - Ask: \"Do both frogs and geckos have sticky feet? How do you know? Are their feet exactly the same or a little different?\"\n   - Activity: Students create a Venn diagram or two-circle comparison showing similarities and differences between frog and gecko feet.\n   - Resource: Brief video clip of geckos climbing (YouTube has many age-appropriate options).\n\n3. **Design a Frog Habitat (Real-World Problem)**\n   - Present a scenario: \"A frog needs a safe home. It needs to climb, hide, and find food. Design a habitat that has places for the frog to use its sticky feet. What materials would you use?\"\n   - Students sketch or build a diorama including: climbing surfaces (branches, rocks, walls), hiding spots, and food sources.\n   - Activity connects to ecosystems and animal needs (K-ESS3-1 level thinking for 1st graders).\n   - Students explain: \"Why did you choose these things? How does the frog use its sticky feet in this habitat?\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Tip:** This lesson is designed to be tactile, visual, and engaging for 1st graders. Frogs are relatable animals, and the physical act of testing sticky materials bridges abstract concepts (adaptation, survival) to concrete experience. Use the photograph throughout the lesson as an anchor point—return to it in each phase to reinforce what students are learning.",
