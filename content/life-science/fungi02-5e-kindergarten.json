ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about mushrooms using the photograph and activate prior knowledge about living things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout of the photograph (at least 11\" x 14\") OR projected image on screen\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: toy mushrooms or plastic mushroom models for students to touch\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently and allow 30 seconds of silent observation time. Students sit on the carpet facing the image.\n\n2. **Ask discovery questions** (one at a time, pausing for responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe it?\" *(Listen for color, shape, size words.)*\n   - \"What do you think these yellow and tan bumpy things are? Have you ever seen something like this?\" *(Accept all ideas; don't correct yet.)*\n   - \"Where do you think this picture was taken? What is it sitting on?\" *(Guide them to notice the dark wood and soil.)*\n   - \"Do you think these things are alive, like you? Why or why not?\" *(Accept reasoning; build curiosity.)*\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today, we're going to learn about something called mushrooms. I wonder... what do mushrooms need to grow? What would happen if we tried to grow one in our classroom? Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Write student predictions** on chart paper. Display prominently for the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great wondering! Now let's be scientists and do an experiment to see what mushrooms really need to survive, just like we need food and water.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what conditions mushrooms need to grow through a hands-on simulation activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4 clear containers (plastic cups or small storage boxes) per group, labeled A–D\n- Potting soil or dark mulch\n- Spray bottles filled with water\n- Paper towels\n- Mushroom growing kit (optional: or images of mushrooms at different stages printed on cards)\n- Observation sheets (see below) or clipboard for teacher to record\n- Optional: magnifying glasses (one per student or per pair)\n\n**Setup (Teacher preparation):**\n- Pre-fill containers A and B with moist soil/mulch\n- Pre-fill container C with moist soil/mulch\n- Pre-fill container D with dry soil/mulch\n- Place a printed mushroom image card or small model mushroom on the soil in each container\n- Label conditions:\n  - Container A: Kept in a DARK, MOIST place (in a cabinet or covered box)\n  - Container B: Kept in LIGHT, MOIST place (on a sunny windowsill)\n  - Container C: Kept in DARK, DRY place (in a cabinet, no watering)\n  - Container D: Kept in LIGHT, DRY place (sunny windowsill, no watering)\n\n**Student Directions (demonstrate as you speak):**\n\n1. \"We are going to set up four science experiments. Each one will be different. We want to find out: **What do mushrooms need to grow?**\"\n\n2. \"Look at Container A. What do you notice?\" *(Elicit: dark, wet soil.)*\n   - \"We're going to put this container in a dark, quiet place. We'll spray it with water every 2 days. Watch to see if mushrooms grow.\"\n\n3. \"Look at Container B. How is it different from A?\" *(Elicit: it will be in light, wet.)*\n   - \"This one goes by the sunny window. We'll spray it with water every 2 days. Does light help mushrooms grow?\"\n\n4. \"Container C — what's different?\" *(Dark but dry.)*\n   - \"Dark place, NO water. Let's see what happens.\"\n\n5. \"Container D — sunny AND dry.\"\n   - \"No water, lots of light. We'll observe this one too.\"\n\n6. **Student task:** In small groups or as a whole class, students help **place containers in their designated spots** and **spray the moist ones** with water (under supervision). Use spray bottles with trigger control for safety.\n\n7. **Observation routine:** Each day for one week, students:\n   - Look at each container\n   - Point to any changes they see\n   - Teacher or aide records observations on a simple chart (or students draw pictures on a class observation sheet)\n   - Example chart:\n     ```\n     Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 | Day 4 | Day 5\n     ------|-------|-------|-------|------\n     A: ?  |  ?    |  ?    |  ?    |  ?\n     B: ?  |  ?    |  ?    |  ?    |  ?\n     C: ?  |  ?    |  ?    |  ?    |  ?\n     D: ?  |  ?    |  ?    |  ?    |  ?\n     ```\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without revealing answers. Use questions:\n  - \"What do you notice about Container A today?\"\n  - \"Is it different from yesterday? How?\"\n  - \"Which containers look most like mushrooms are growing there?\"\n  - \"What is the same about the containers where you see growth?\"\n  - Resist saying \"mushrooms need darkness and moisture\" — guide students to **discover** this pattern.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that mushrooms grow best in **dark, moist** conditions (Container A).\n- Students notice little to no growth in dry containers or overly bright containers.\n- Students develop a **mental model** of what living things need (based on this simulation).\n- Students record observations through drawings or verbal descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to life science concepts about what living things need to survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n- The original photograph (large print or projected)\n- Simple diagram showing mushroom parts (cap, stem, gills — if using real or model mushrooms)\n- Real mushroom (if available and safe) or high-quality image to handle/observe\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Gather students on the carpet with a view of the observation data.\n   - \"What did we find out? Which containers had mushrooms growing?\" *(Elicit: A — dark and wet.)*\n   - \"Why do you think mushrooms liked that container?\"\n   - \"Did any grow in the sunny containers? No! What does that tell us about mushrooms?\"\n   - Build the idea: **\"Mushrooms are living things, but they are different from plants. They DON'T need sunlight.\"**\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (8 minutes)** — Display pictures with each term:\n\n   | **Vocabulary** | **Child-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Mushroom** | A living thing that grows from the ground or on dead wood. It has a round or umbrella-shaped top (cap) and a stem. |\n   | **Living thing** | Something that grows, needs food and water, and can make babies. Mushrooms are alive! |\n   | **Decompose** | To break down or rot. Mushrooms help dead wood and leaves break down into soil. |\n   | **Moisture** | Water or wetness. Mushrooms need moisture to grow. |\n   | **Habitat** | A place where a living thing lives and finds what it needs to survive. |\n\n3. **Connect to photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at the photograph again. See all that dark, broken wood? That's the mushroom's habitat. It's dark under the forest floor. The wood is wet from rain. The mushroom is breaking down the dead wood — that's what they do! It's their job in nature.\"\n   - Point out: mushroom caps (the umbrella parts), stems, different sizes showing growth.\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Do mushrooms need sunlight? (No.) Do they need to be wet? (Yes.) Are mushrooms alive? (Yes!) What do mushrooms eat?\" *(Dead wood and soil.)*\n   - Use thumbs up/sideways/down to gauge understanding. Repeat any concepts where students show uncertainty.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word \"mushroom\" correctly.\n- Students can explain that mushrooms need **moisture and darkness** to grow.\n- Students understand that mushrooms **are alive** but different from plants.\n- Students recognize that mushrooms **help break down dead things** in nature.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new context and deepen learning about how mushrooms fit into forest ecosystems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of forest habitats (forest floor, under logs, in soil, on bark)\n- Chart paper\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Paper (8.5\" x 11\")\n- Picture of a forest decomposition cycle or simple habitat poster\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Forest Habitat Hunt (Classroom & Outdoor)**\n\n1. Show students pictures of places in a forest where mushrooms might grow:\n   - Under a fallen log\n   - In wet leaves\n   - On rotting bark\n   - In dark, moist soil\n\n2. **In the classroom or on a school nature walk:**\n   - Assign small groups one \"habitat\" to look for.\n   - Students search for places where they **think** mushrooms would grow (without picking anything).\n   - Teacher asks: \"Why would mushrooms like this spot? Is it dark? Is it wet? What dead things do you see?\"\n\n3. **Back in class, students draw:**\n   - The place they found where mushrooms grow\n   - Label it with a sentence: \"Mushrooms like this place because ___.\" (Teacher scribes if needed.)\n\n**Option B: Mushroom Detective Cards (Classroom Activity)**\n\n1. Show picture cards of different forest scenarios:\n   - Card 1: A bright, dry sunny spot\n   - Card 2: Under a wet, rotting log\n   - Card 3: A dark, moist area\n   - Card 4: Inside a forest that burned (dark ash, dry)\n\n2. **Students predict:** \"Will mushrooms grow here? Yes or no? Why?\"\n   - Discuss as a group. Students point to cards that are the BEST homes for mushrooms.\n   - Build the understanding: **\"Mushrooms need dark + wet + dead stuff.\"**\n\n3. **Make a class chart:**\n   - Draw a mushroom in the center\n   - Around it, write/draw: \"What mushrooms need\"\n     - Dark (draw a dark circle)\n     - Moist/wet (draw raindrops)\n     - Dead wood or soil (draw decaying matter)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask probing questions: \"Does this place have moisture? Is it dark? Do you see dead wood here?\" \n- Guide students to the pattern without telling them the answer.\n- Celebrate discoveries: \"Yes! You noticed that mushrooms need all three things!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify appropriate habitats for mushrooms based on their observations.\n- Students explain why a place is or isn't good for mushrooms (using the conditions they discovered).\n- Students recognize that mushrooms play a role in the forest by breaking down dead things.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what mushrooms need to survive and their role as living things.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing):**\n- During the Explore phase, observe whether students are:\n  - Predicting and checking their predictions\n  - Noticing patterns (dark/moist = growth)\n  - Using descriptive language\n\n- During group discussions, listen for:\n  - Use of vocabulary (mushroom, living, moisture, habitat)\n  - Ability to explain why mushrooms grow in certain places\n  - Understanding that mushrooms are alive\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nShow each student the original photograph. Ask **one or more** of these questions (adjust based on class response):\n\n1. **\"Can you point to the mushrooms in this picture? What do they need to grow?\"** \n   - Success: Student points to mushrooms and mentions dark/wet/wood.\n\n2. **\"Is a mushroom a living thing? How do you know?\"**\n   - Success: Student says \"yes\" and gives a reason (it grows, it needs things, etc.).\n\n3. **\"If you want to grow mushrooms at home, what would you do?\"**\n   - Success: Student describes dark + moist conditions (doesn't need to be perfect phrasing).\n\n4. **Show a picture of a sunny, dry windowsill. \"Would mushrooms grow here? Why or why not?\"**\n   - Success: Student explains it's too dry and bright; mushrooms need moisture and dark.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies what mushrooms need (moisture + darkness + decaying material)\n- ✓ Student understands mushrooms are living things\n- ✓ Student can predict where mushrooms would grow based on conditions\n- ✓ Student uses at least one new vocabulary word (mushroom, habitat, moisture, living thing, decompose)\n\n**Recording Method:**\n- Teacher checks off a simple rubric for each student (yes/no for each criteria)\n- Alternatively, take photos of student drawings from Elaborate phase as evidence\n- Keep anecdotal notes on class observation sheet\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:**\n   - Use only: mushroom, alive, water, dark, place\n   - Defer moisture/decompose/habitat until later lessons\n\n2. **Simplify observation task:**\n   - Instead of tracking all four containers, assign each small group ONE container to observe daily\n   - Use a picture chart (✓ grew, ✗ no growth) instead of written descriptions\n\n3. **Use concrete models:**\n   - Provide real mushrooms (store-bought) or high-quality plastic models for hands-on handling\n   - Let students feel the cap, stem, and dampness\n   - This builds tactile understanding before abstract thinking\n\n4. **Pre-teach vocabulary:**\n   - Show pictures of mushrooms and non-mushrooms the day before; discuss: \"What do you see?\"\n   - Build familiarity so the lesson vocabulary is less overwhelming\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Investigate spore dispersal:**\n   - Provide pictures or videos of spores being released (mushroom \"babies\")\n   - Ask: \"How do you think mushrooms make baby mushrooms?\" \n   - Challenge: Make a simple diagram showing spores spreading in a forest\n\n2. **Explore other decomposers:**\n   - Extend to: What else breaks down dead wood? (bacteria, insects, worms)\n   - Create a decomposer food chain: dead wood → mushroom → slug → bird\n   - Read a picture book about forest decomposition (e.g., *Hello, Harvest Moon* or *The Flower*)\n\n3. **Test additional variables:**\n   - \"What if we added CO₂? What if we changed temperature?\"\n   - Challenge students to design their own mushroom-growing experiment\n   - Discuss: \"Why do mushrooms grow in fall and spring but not summer?\"\n\n4. **Connect to real-world science:**\n   - Research edible vs. poisonous mushrooms (visual ID only — no tasting!)\n   - Learn that humans use mushrooms for food and medicine\n   - Discuss fungi in pizza (yeast is a fungus) or kombucha\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### 1. **Mushroom Life Cycle Sequencing**\n   - Provide picture cards showing mushroom growth stages: spore → tiny button → small mushroom → full-grown mushroom → spore release\n   - Students arrange in order on a timeline\n   - Discuss: \"How is this like a plant's life cycle? How is it different?\"\n   - **Time:** 15 minutes | **Materials:** Picture cards, string or chart paper\n\n### 2. **Create a Forest Floor Diorama**\n   - Students build a small shoebox diorama showing a forest floor habitat with:\n     - Mulch/soil base\n     - Decaying log (cardboard tube or stick)\n     - Mushroom models or drawings\n     - Other forest floor creatures (drawn or cut from magazines)\n   - Label: \"What mushrooms need to grow\" (dark, moist, dead wood)\n   - Display as a class gallery walk\n   - **Time:** 30–40 minutes (across 2 sessions) | **Materials:** Shoeboxes, soil, craft supplies, colored paper, magazines, glue\n\n### 3. **Mushroom Walk & Observation Journal**\n   - Take a guided nature walk around school grounds in a moist, shady area (after rain is ideal)\n   - Students sketch or photograph mushrooms found in nature (do NOT pick)\n   - Back in class, compare to the photograph and containers:\n     - \"Where did we find these? Was it dark? Was it wet? Did they grow on dead wood?\"\n   - Create a \"Mushroom Spotting Guide\" for the school grounds\n   - **Time:** 20–30 minutes outdoors + 15 min classroom | **Materials:** Clipboards, paper, crayons, camera or sketch pads\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Summary\n\nThis lesson directly addresses **K-LS1-1** by having students:\n- **Observe** the photograph and their experimental containers to identify patterns\n- **Describe** what mushrooms need to survive (moisture, darkness, dead organic matter)\n- **Connect** to the broader idea that all living things need specific things to survive\n\nThe 5E model scaffolds from concrete observation (the photograph, hands-on containers) to abstract understanding (vocabulary, ecosystem role), ensuring Kindergarten learners can grasp a concept that is initially unfamiliar—that fungi are living things fundamentally different from plants, yet essential to forest survival.",
