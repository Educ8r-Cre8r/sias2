Identify and describe the body parts of a bee and explain how each part helps the bee collect food from flowers.\n2. Explain that bees and flowers need each other to survive and reproduce (mutualistic relationship).\n3. Use evidence from the photograph to support why a bee is well-suited to living in a habitat with flowering plants.\n4. Describe how a bee's special features give it an advantage in finding food and surviving.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the bee on the flower (or printed large copy, 11\" × 14\")\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"Wonder Wall\" (designated bulletin board area)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Display and Hook (2 minutes):**\nDisplay the photograph on the screen or as a large print. Say: \"Today we're going to look at something amazing happening in nature. This is a real photograph taken outdoors. What do you notice?\"\n\nAllow 30 seconds of silent observation. Then say: \"Turn and talk to your neighbor—what are you seeing in this picture?\"\n\n**Discussion Questions (8 minutes):**\nPose these questions one at a time, allowing 60 seconds of thinking/discussion time for each:\n\n1. \"What do you see happening in this photograph? Can you describe both the plant and the animal?\"\n2. \"Why do you think this bee is visiting the flower? What might it be doing up there?\"\n3. \"Look carefully at the bee's body. What body parts can you spot? What look different from other animals you know?\" (Guide students to notice: hairy body, long thin tongue, legs, wings)\n4. \"If the bee is collecting something from the flower, how might that help the bee survive?\"\n\n**Wonder Prompt (3 minutes):**\nSay: \"I'm going to write down your wonderings on our Wonder Wall. What do you still want to know about bees and flowers working together?\" Capture 3-4 student questions on chart paper. Examples: *\"Do bees eat flowers?\" \"Does the flower help the bee?\" \"Why is the bee so fuzzy?\"*\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Let's explore what bees and flowers really do for each other by becoming scientists.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover the relationship between bees and flowers, and how bee body parts help them survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real flowers (or high-quality pictures of flowers) – 1 per small group (daisies, sunflowers, or cosmos work well; avoid flowers with tough petals)\n- Beeswax or modeling clay (to represent the bee's body)\n- Pipe cleaners or thin craft straw (to represent the bee's tongue)\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per pair or group)\n- Observation recording sheet (see below)\n- Small paintbrushes (soft bristles)\n- Shallow dish with yellow tempera paint or flour (to represent pollen)\n- Paper towels\n\n**Preparation:** If using real flowers, gently separate petals the day before to reveal the center. Alternatively, use large printed flower images or botanical diagrams.\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud, then post on chart):**\n\n1. **Observe the Flower (5 minutes):**\n   - Look at your flower using the magnifying glass.\n   - Find the center part where the pollen is (the powdery middle).\n   - Draw or describe what you see in the flower's center on your recording sheet.\n   - Use your paintbrush to gently brush the pollen—what happens? Does it stick to the brush? (The brush is acting like the bee's hairy body.)\n\n2. **Design a Bee Model (10 minutes):**\n   - Use the modeling clay to shape a small oval body.\n   - Stick the pipe cleaner or straw into one end—this is the bee's tongue/proboscis (the long feeding tube).\n   - Design: Make the outside of your clay bee hairy by poking it with your fingernails or pressing it gently into the yellow pollen/flour.\n   - Predict: What happens when you bring your hairy bee model close to the flower's center?\n\n3. **Test Your Model (5 minutes):**\n   - Gently touch your bee model's hairy body and tongue to the flower's center (or the painted/flour-covered area).\n   - What sticks to your model? Record your observations with drawings or words.\n   - Try it several times. Do different parts of the bee pick up different amounts of pollen?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and observe without immediately providing answers.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice sticking to the hairy parts?\" \"Did the pollen stick better to the fuzzy parts or the smooth parts?\" \"Why might that be helpful for the bee?\"*\n- Redirect students focused on play to the task: *\"Let's think like scientists—what could we discover about how the bee's body helps it?\"*\n- Ensure students handle real flowers gently.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that pollen sticks to hairy surfaces better than smooth ones.\n- Students recognize that the bee's long tongue helps it reach into the flower.\n- Students understand that the bee picks up pollen by touching the flower.\n- Students produce a recording sheet with drawings and simple descriptions of what stuck to their bee model.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and core concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Labeled diagram of a bee (printed large or projected) showing: head, thorax, abdomen, wings, legs, proboscis/tongue, and hair/setae\n- Original photograph of the bee on the flower\n- Student recording sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Share-Out (5 minutes):**\nAsk volunteers to share their discoveries:\n- *\"What did you notice sticking to your bee model?\"*\n- *\"Which parts of the bee picked up the most pollen?\"*\n- *\"How did the bee's long tongue help it?\"*\n\nRecord key phrases on chart paper: *\"Pollen stuck to fuzzy,\" \"Tongue reaches deep,\" \"Bee covered in yellow powder.\"*\n\n**Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\nDefine each term using simple language and reference the photograph and/or bee diagram:\n\n1. **Pollen:** The yellow powder inside flowers. It's like the flower's food for making new flowers. Bees carry pollen from flower to flower.\n\n2. **Pollination:** When a bee (or other animal) carries pollen from one flower to another flower. This helps flowers make seeds and new plants grow.\n\n3. **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive. A bee's hairy body and long tongue are adaptations.\n\n4. **Proboscis (or \"bee tongue\"):** The long, thin tube-like mouth part that the bee uses to drink sweet juice (nectar) from deep inside the flower.\n\n5. **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. Bees live in habitats with lots of flowers to visit.\n\n**Connection to Photograph and Activity (5 minutes):**\nPoint back to the original photograph. Say:\n- *\"The bee in this photo is doing exactly what we just discovered. See how its hairy body is covered in yellow pollen? That's because its fuzzy body is an adaptation—it was made (by nature) to collect pollen.\"*\n- *\"And look at that long tongue—it's reaching into the flower's center to collect nectar, the sweet juice that feeds the bee and gives it energy to fly and work.\"*\n- *\"When this bee flies to the next flower, it will leave some pollen behind. That's pollination! It helps new flowers grow.\"*\n\n**Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\nAsk: *\"Thumbs up if you can explain why a bee's hairy body helps it survive. Thumbs sideways if you're still wondering.\"*\nCall on 2-3 students to explain in their own words.\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart:**\nPost and leave visible for the rest of the unit:\n- **Pollen** = yellow powder in flowers\n- **Pollination** = carrying pollen from flower to flower\n- **Adaptation** = special body part that helps animals survive\n- **Proboscis** = bee's long tongue for drinking nectar\n- **Habitat** = where an animal lives\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents can name at least 3 bee body parts, explain what pollen is, and describe one way a bee's body helps it collect food.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by exploring the bee-flower relationship in new ways.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of different flowers (or real flower samples if available): roses, tulips, sunflowers, daisies, clover, violets\n- Picture cards of different pollinators (not just bees): butterflies, hummingbirds, beetles, moths\n- Sorting mat or large paper divided into sections\n- Optional: \"Bee and Flower Matching\" worksheet\n- Chart paper for recording observations\n\n**Activity Option A: Pollinator Habitat Matching (15-20 minutes)**\n\n**Teacher Set-Up:**\nCreate a visual display with two columns: one labeled \"Flowers Bees Love\" and one labeled \"Other Pollinators.\" Display flower and pollinator picture cards.\n\n**Student Activity:**\n1. Show students different flower types (in pictures or real).\n2. Ask: *\"Do you think all pollinators visit all flowers? Let's investigate!\"*\n3. Guide students to think: *\"What parts of a bee work best with certain flowers?\"*\n4. Demonstrate with flower pictures: *\"A bee with a long tongue can drink from flowers with deep centers. Which flowers have deep centers?\"*\n5. Students sort flower cards into categories:\n   - Flowers good for bees (with accessible centers for the proboscis)\n   - Flowers good for butterflies (with landing pads)\n   - Flowers good for hummingbirds (tube-shaped flowers)\n\n6. Record observations: *\"Bees like flowers that have [deep centers / lots of pollen / landing spots], because their adaptations are perfect for these flowers.\"*\n\n**Application to Real World:**\nAsk: *\"If someone planted a garden and wanted to help bees, what kind of flowers should they plant? Why?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\nGuide thinking without telling answers. Use questions like:\n- *\"Remember how the bee's tongue worked? What shape flower would work best with that?\"*\n- *\"Think about the bee's hairy body—which flowers would let the pollen stick best?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that different animals have different body parts and visit different flowers.\n- Students can explain that adaptations match animals to their habitats.\n- Students recognize that a bee is well-suited to certain flowers because of its special body parts.\n\n**Activity Option B: Building a Bee-Flower Ecosystem (alternative or extension)**\n\nIf you have more time or want a deeper investigation:\n\n**Materials:** Large poster board, pictures/drawings of bees and flowers, scissors, glue, markers\n\n**Student Activity:**\n1. Students create a poster showing a \"Bee's Garden\" with multiple flowers and bees.\n2. They draw or paste flowers that bees like to visit.\n3. They label bee body parts and flower parts.\n4. They write or dictate: \"This garden helps bees because...\" and \"Bees help these flowers because...\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of bee adaptations, pollination, and bee-flower relationships.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- During Explore: Observe students' bee models and listen to their predictions. Do they notice pollen sticking to hairy parts?\n- During Explain: Listen to share-outs. Can students describe what they discovered?\n- Check for Understanding: Thumbs-up/sideways observation and quick verbal explanations.\n- Elaboration: As students sort flowers or build ecosystems, ask: *\"Why did you put that flower with bees?\" Listen for explanations about adaptations.*\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes):**\n\nChoose ONE format based on student needs:\n\n**Option A: Drawing + Label (best for emergent writers)**\n- Students draw: A bee visiting a flower\n- They label: the bee's body parts and what the bee is collecting\n- Teacher or peer reads back the labels to confirm understanding\n\n**Option B: Three-Question Exit Slip**\nProvide a simple handout or display on screen:\n\n1. **Draw or write:** What does a bee use to drink juice from a flower?\n   - *Success: Student identifies the proboscis/long tongue*\n\n2. **True or False:** The bee's hairy body helps it collect pollen.\n   - *Success: Student answers \"True\" and can explain why*\n\n3. **Fill in the blank:** When a bee carries pollen from flower to flower, it is __________.\n   - *Success: Student writes or says \"pollinating\"*\n\n**Option C: Quick Oral Interview (1:1, takes 2-3 minutes per student)**\nAsk one student at a time:\n- *\"Show me in the picture—what is the bee doing?\"*\n- *\"Why do you think the bee's body is so hairy?\"*\n- *\"What happens to the flower when the bee visits?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n✓ Identify at least 2 bee body parts and explain one way it helps the bee\n✓ Use the word \"pollen\" or \"pollination\" correctly in context\n✓ Explain that bees and flowers depend on each other (the bee gets food, the flower gets help making new plants)\n✓ Describe why a bee is well-suited to its habitat with flowers\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nMost students will be able to:\n- Name the bee's hairy body and long tongue as adaptations\n- Explain that pollen sticks to the bee and travels to other flowers\n- Use the term \"pollination\" with support\n\nSome students will additionally:\n- Explain the concept of mutualism (both bee and flower benefit)\n- Connect this to why planting flowers helps bees\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners or those needing scaffolding)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Focus:**\n   - Pre-teach \"pollen,\" \"bee,\" and \"flower\" with picture cards and real objects before the lesson.\n   - Use only 2-3 key vocabulary words instead of all 5. Focus on: pollen, bee, flower.\n   - Keep definitions to one simple sentence: *\"Pollen is yellow powder in flowers.\"*\n\n2. **Hands-On Scaffolds during Explore:**\n   - Pair struggling students with a strong partner for the flower exploration.\n   - Provide a pre-made clay bee model if fine-motor skills are a concern; let student focus on exploring how it interacts with the flower.\n   - Use a thicker paintbrush (easier to control) and more paint/flour (more visible pollen transfer).\n   - Provide a simplified recording sheet with drawings already started; student only needs to add labels or checkmarks.\n\n3. **Guided Questions during Explain:**\n   - Use yes/no or this/that questions instead of open-ended: *\"Does pollen stick to smooth things or fuzzy things?\"* instead of *\"Why does pollen stick?\"*\n   - Repeat key phrases and have student repeat them back.\n   - Provide sentence frames for exit ticket: *\"The bee's hairy body helps it ___.\" \"Pollen is ___.\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Research Extension:**\n   - Provide resource books or images showing different bee types (honeybee, bumblebee, carpenter bee).\n   - Ask: *\"Do you think all bees have the same adaptations? What might be different about a bumblebee versus a small bee? Why?\"*\n   - Have student hypothesize how different bee sizes might visit different flowers.\n\n2. **Ecosystem Complexity:**\n   - Introduce the concept of \"food chain\" or \"food web\": Bees eat nectar → bees pollinate flowers → flowers make seeds → birds eat seeds. Can student create a simple chain?\n   - Ask: *\"What would happen to the flowers if all the bees disappeared?\"* (prediction + reasoning)\n   - Have student design a \"perfect bee habitat\" including multiple flower types, water source, and shelter. Explain why each element is important.\n\n3. **Adaptations Across Species:**\n   - Compare bee adaptations to other pollinators using pictures: butterfly (long, coiled tongue; colorful wings), hummingbird (long beak; fast flight).\n   - Ask: *\"Why do you think butterflies have different body parts than bees? How do their adaptations match their way of finding food?\"*\n   - Student creates a comparison chart: Bee vs. Butterfly vs. Hummingbird — adaptations and flowers they visit.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Create a \"Bee Garden\" Poster or Model**\n   - Students design a garden with flowers that attract bees.\n   - They label bee body parts and explain why each flower would help bees.\n   - Incorporate real pressed flowers, seed catalogs, or drawings.\n   - Display in hallway with caption: *\"This garden helps bees because...\"*\n\n2. **Bee and Flower Movement Activity (Action-Based Learning)**\n   - Half the class becomes \"bees,\" half become \"flowers\" (students stand in space).\n   - On \"go,\" bees move to flowers and make a gentle buzzing motion around them (mime collecting pollen).\n   - Switch roles.\n   - Follow with discussion: *\"What did the flowers do when bees visited? Did anything change between the flowers?\"* (introduction to pollination without the word \"magic\")\n\n3. **Citizen Science: Observe Real Bees or Pollinators**\n   - If weather permits, take class outside or place a camera/iPad by a flower garden to observe real bees or butterflies.\n   - Students tally what they see and record: How many bees? How long did each stay? Did they visit multiple flowers?\n   - Create a class tally chart: *\"Evidence that bees visit flowers many times = ✓✓✓\"*\n   - Discuss: *\"Why do you think the bee visited 5 flowers in 10 minutes?\"* (looking for food, pollinating)\n\n4. **\"Bee Adaptations\" Craft: Pipe Cleaner Bees**\n   - Students create a 3D bee from pipe cleaners.\n   - They research and add specific body parts: 6 legs (bent at angles), wings, antenna, fuzzy body (wrapped in yarn).\n   - Label each adaptation: *\"This leg helps the bee... This fuzz helps the bee...\"*\n   - Use as a kinesthetic way to remember adaptations.\n\n5. **Read-Aloud Extension: Picture Books on Bees**\n   - *\"The Bee Tree\" by Patricia Polacco* (interdependence, community)\n   - *\"Bee Dance\" by Janeen Brian* (communication, behavior)\n   - *\"From Flower to Fruit\" by Amy Fruit* (lifecycle of flowering plants connected to pollinators)\n   - Follow-up: *\"What did we learn from this book that connects to the bee we studied?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure no students have bee or flower allergies before beginning. Keep real flowers away from allergic students.\n- **Live Bees:** Do NOT attempt to observe live bees indoors unless absolutely safe. Outdoor observation (from a distance) is better.\n- **Pollen Substitute:** If using real flowers is difficult, yellow tempera paint or flour works as a safe pollen model for young students.\n- **Timing:** This lesson can be split into two 45-minute sessions: Session 1 (Engage + Explore), Session 2 (Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate).\n- **Photo Reference:** Keep the original photograph visible throughout the lesson—refer back to it often so students make connections between their discoveries and the real world.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson firmly anchors in the photographed bee-flower interaction and builds scientific understanding of adaptation, pollination, and ecosystem interdependence through the 5E model. All activities are classroom-safe and use accessible materials. Students leave understanding not just *what* a bee does, but *why* its special body parts make it perfectly suited to that role.",
