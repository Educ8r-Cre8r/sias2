ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest in what plants need to grow by exploring a real garden photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the backyard garden (displayed via projector, whiteboard, or large printout)\n- Chart paper or digital board for recording student observations\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the projector or board. Ask students to simply observe quietly for 30 seconds without talking. This builds curiosity.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (allow 1–2 minutes per question):\n   - \"What do you notice about all these plants? What do they all have in common?\" *(Expected: They're all green, they have flowers, they're growing in dirt, etc.)*\n   - \"Look closely at the ground where the plants are growing. What do you see that might be helping these plants grow?\" *(Expected: Soil, mulch, dark material, water from sprinklers, etc.)*\n   - \"If I dug up one of these plants and moved it to a dark closet with no water, what do you think would happen?\" *(Expected: It would die, turn brown, stop growing, wilt, etc.)*\n   - \"What do you think these plants *need* to stay alive and grow bigger?\" *(Expected: Water, sunlight, food, good soil, air, etc.)*\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if a plant could only get one thing — either water OR sunshine — which one do you think it really *needs* more to survive? Why?\" Have students turn to a partner and discuss for 1 minute.\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper: \"What Do Plants Need to Grow?\" Write down their ideas without correcting them.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become plant scientists and investigate which materials plants *really* need to grow, just like the plants in this garden.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (24 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what plants need to grow through hands-on observation and a simple controlled experiment.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3–4 students):**\n- 4 small potted bean plants (or fast-growing seedlings like marigolds), all similar size and health\n- 4 clear plastic cups or small containers (labeled A, B, C, D)\n- Soil (potting mix)\n- Water in a spray bottle or small watering can\n- Dark cloth or box (to block light)\n- Aluminum foil or plastic bags\n- Ruler (in centimeters)\n- Data recording sheet (template provided below)\n- Labels and markers\n- Optional: hand lens or magnifying glass\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Setup (First 10 minutes):**\n\n1. **Assign each student group a scenario.** They will set up four plant containers that test ONE variable at a time:\n   - **Plant A (Control):** Gets normal light, water, and air. Place in a sunny windowsill or under grow lights.\n   - **Plant B (No Water):** Gets light and air but NO water. Place in a sunny spot. Students will not water this plant.\n   - **Plant C (No Light):** Gets water and air but NO direct light. Cover with a dark cloth or place in a dark closet, but still water regularly.\n   - **Plant D (No Air):** Gets light and water but limited air. Seal in an airtight plastic bag (small openings only).\n\n2. **Students plant each scenario** by placing seedlings in soil and labeling containers clearly. *Teacher checks setup before students proceed.*\n\n3. **Establish a baseline:** Students measure the height of each plant in centimeters and record on their data sheet. They also sketch or describe what each plant looks like at the start (color, leaf condition, stem thickness).\n\n**Investigation (Next 14 minutes):**\n\n4. **Over the next 5–7 school days** (this spans into the next session or happens in the background), students:\n   - **Water Plants A, B, and D** every other day (Plant B gets NO water by design; this is the control for testing water's importance).\n   - **Maintain Plant C in darkness** but water it regularly.\n   - **Measure and record** plant height every 2 days.\n   - **Sketch or describe observations** about color, wilting, new growth, or damage.\n   - **Answer guiding questions** on their data sheet:\n     - Which plant looks healthiest so far? Why?\n     - Which plant looks different from the others? How?\n     - What do you think is causing these changes?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What are you noticing about Plant B? What is different from Plant A?\" (Do NOT tell them the answer.)\n- Ensure consistent care and measurements.\n- Troubleshoot setup issues (e.g., is the dark cloth truly blocking light?).\n- Encourage students to make predictions about what will happen next.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students record observable data showing:\n  - Plant A (control) remains healthy, grows steadily.\n  - Plant B (no water) wilts, discolors, stops growing or dies.\n  - Plant C (no light) becomes pale/yellow, grows thin and weak.\n  - Plant D (limited air) may show delayed growth or stress.\n- Students develop a working hypothesis about which materials are most important for plant growth.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize understanding of what plants need using evidence from the Explore activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student data sheets and plant observations\n- Chart paper or digital presentation\n- Diagram of plant structure (roots, stem, leaves) with labels\n- Vocabulary cards (printed or written)\n- Photograph of the garden (reference)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Facilitate a Group Share-Out (6 minutes):**\n   - Call on 2–3 groups to present their observations. Ask:\n     - \"What did Plant A look like compared to Plant B? What was different?\"\n     - \"Plant C didn't get light. What happened to its leaves and color?\"\n     - \"Which plant do you think showed what plants NEED most?\"\n   - Chart their responses on the board: \"What Happened to Our Plants?\"\n\n2. **Introduce and Define Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   Use student-friendly language and reference the garden photo and their plant observations:\n\n   - **Water:** Liquid that plants take in through their roots to stay firm and healthy. Water helps plants grow and make food. *Point to wilting Plant B: \"This plant didn't get water, so its leaves drooped.\"*\n   \n   - **Sunlight:** Energy from the sun that plants use to make their own food in their leaves. Without sunlight, plants can't grow strong. *Point to pale Plant C: \"This plant didn't get light, so its leaves turned yellow instead of staying green.\"*\n   \n   - **Nutrients (or Soil Nutrients):** Tiny pieces of food in soil that roots soak up to help plants grow bigger and stronger. *Show mulch in the garden photo: \"This dark stuff in the garden gives plants the nutrients they need.\"*\n   \n   - **Air (Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide):** Gases around us that plants need. Roots need oxygen from air in the soil, and leaves use carbon dioxide from the air to make food. *Explain: \"Plant D was sealed in plastic, and even though it got water and light, the limited air made it struggle.\"*\n\n3. **Connect to the Garden Photo (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to different parts of the garden: \"These plants are thriving because they have soil with nutrients, water (maybe from rain or a sprinkler), plenty of sunlight, and fresh air. All four things are working together!\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the gardener put the dark, tall grasses in this spot and the yellow flowers over there?\" *(Guide students to see that plants with different water or light needs are positioned differently in the garden.)*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students to give a \"thumbs up, thumbs middle, or thumbs down\" to: \"Can a plant grow with just water but no sunlight?\" (thumbs down)\n   - Call on 1–2 students to explain why in their own words.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (Display or Provide as a Reference):**\n- **Water:** Liquid that plants absorb through roots; needed for growth and firmness.\n- **Sunlight:** Energy from the sun used by leaves to make food.\n- **Nutrients:** Food particles in soil that roots absorb.\n- **Air:** Oxygen and carbon dioxide gases that plants need to survive.\n- **Habitat:** A place where plants and animals live that gives them what they need to survive.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and explain the four main materials plants need.\n- Students connect their plant experiment data to the definitions.\n- Students understand that *all four materials work together* — plants can't survive with just one.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing and analyzing a garden scenario and making arguments supported by evidence.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large garden design template (poster board or digital template) showing a blank 3×3-foot garden plot\n- Plant cards or images (sun-loving flowers, shade plants, water-loving plants, drought-tolerant plants like succulents)\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- \"Garden Planner\" worksheet (see below)\n- Photograph of the original garden (reference)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Design a New Garden (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the scenario:** \"The photograph shows one beautiful garden. Now YOU are a garden designer, and you have to plan a NEW garden. But here's the challenge: one corner of your garden gets **full sun all day**, another corner is **shady** (under a tree), and one area has a **water fountain** that keeps it very wet.\"\n\n2. **Distribute the \"Garden Planner\" worksheet** with three garden zones marked (sunny, shady, wet).\n\n3. **Provide plant cards** showing images and brief descriptions of plants:\n   - Sunflowers (need lots of light and water)\n   - Hostas (love shade, need regular water)\n   - Cacti (love sun, need little water)\n   - Ferns (need shade and moisture)\n   - Marigolds (love sun, moderate water)\n   - Iris (wet-loving plants)\n\n4. **Students place or draw plants** in the correct zones based on what those plants need to thrive. They label each plant and zone.\n\n**Part 2: Argue Your Design (8 minutes)**\n\n5. **Students complete the argument frame** on their worksheet:\n   - \"I put the **[plant name]** in the **[sunny/shady/wet]** zone because...\"\n   - \"This plant needs **[water/sunlight/nutrients]** to grow, and this zone provides that because...\"\n   - *Provide 2–3 examples.*\n\n6. **Pair-and-Share:** Students work in pairs, presenting their garden designs to each other. The partner asks: \"Why did you choose that plant for that spot? Will it get what it needs?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and listen to student reasoning.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"How do you know that hostas like shade? What did we learn in our plant experiment that tells you this?\"\n- Prompt students to use vocabulary: \"Remember, plants need water, sunlight, nutrients, and air. Which of these does your plant need most in this zone?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding by placing plants appropriately.\n- Students articulate why plants belong in specific zones based on their needs.\n- Students use evidence from their experiment to support their design choices.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what plants need and ability to apply this knowledge.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing During Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore phase:** Did students set up their experimental plants correctly? Did they measure and record data consistently?\n- **Listen during Explain phase:** Did students correctly define the four plant materials? Could they connect vocabulary to their observations?\n- **Observe during Elaborate phase:** Did students place plants in appropriate zones? Did their reasoning show understanding of plant needs?\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (5 minutes at end of Lesson 2):**\n\nDistribute an index card or digital form with these questions:\n\n1. **True or False:** A plant can grow with sunlight and air but no water or soil.\n   - *Correct answer: False. Why?* (Students should explain that plants need water to stay healthy and soil for nutrients.)\n\n2. **Short Answer:** Look at the garden photograph again. Why do you think the gardener planted the yellow and purple flowers in the sunny, open area instead of under the dark, leafy plants in the background?\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student mentions that these flowering plants need sunlight to grow and bloom. Accept answers such as: \"Flowers need more light,\" \"The dark plants would block sunlight,\" \"These flowers love sun.\"\n\n3. **Argument Practice:** \"A student says, 'I don't need to water my houseplant because it sits on a sunny windowsill and gets lots of light.' Do you agree or disagree? Why?\"\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student disagrees and explains that even though the plant gets sunlight, it also needs water to survive. Plants need *both* light and water, not just one.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery if they:\n- ✓ Correctly identify all four materials plants need (water, sunlight, nutrients, air).\n- ✓ Explain that plants require *multiple* materials, not just one.\n- ✓ Apply their knowledge to a new scenario (the garden design or exit ticket).\n- ✓ Support claims with evidence from their observations or the lesson activities.\n\n**Scoring Guide:**\n- **Proficient:** Student answers 2 of 3 exit ticket questions correctly AND can explain reasoning.\n- **Developing:** Student answers 1–2 questions correctly but reasoning is vague.\n- **Beginning:** Student answers fewer than 1 question correctly or shows confusion about plant needs.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Data Recording:** Provide a picture-based observation sheet where students circle or point to images of plant conditions (healthy, wilting, pale, etc.) instead of writing descriptions. Include sentence frames:\n   - \"Plant A is _______ because it got _______.\"\n   - \"Plant B looks _______ because it didn't get _______.\"\n\n2. **Pre-Teach Vocabulary with Visuals:** Before the Explain phase, show students actual images or physical examples:\n   - Pass around a spray bottle labeled \"water.\"\n   - Point to sunlight streaming through a window and say \"sunlight.\"\n   - Let students feel potting soil and say \"nutrients in soil.\"\n   - Use a hand fan to represent \"air.\"\n   This reduces cognitive load during formal vocabulary instruction.\n\n3. **Guided Garden Design:** During Elaborate, provide a partially filled-in garden template where 2–3 plants are already placed correctly. Students only need to place the remaining plants and write about their choices.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Investigate a Fourth Variable:** Advanced groups can design a fifth plant condition:\n   - **Plant E (Nutrient-Deficient):** Gets water, light, and air but is planted in sand with no soil nutrients. This tests whether plants specifically need soil nutrients to thrive.\n   - Students predict and observe what will happen, then explain why nutrients matter differently than the other three materials.\n\n2. **Research and Presentation:** Students research why each material is scientifically important:\n   - \"Why does photosynthesis need sunlight?\" (Make the connection that plants use light energy to combine water and carbon dioxide into sugar.)\n   - \"Why do roots need oxygen?\" (Cellular respiration in roots requires oxygen.)\n   - Have them create a mini-poster or 2-minute presentation explaining the *science behind the need*, not just that the need exists.\n\n3. **Design a Garden for an Extreme Environment:** Challenge students to design a garden for a real location with unusual conditions:\n   - A rooftop garden in a dry, windy city (minimal water, intense sun).\n   - A shaded urban courtyard with limited soil depth.\n   - A wetland habitat.\n   - Students must research plants suited to these conditions and explain how their chosen plants' structures help them survive in that specific environment.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Germination Lab:** Give students bean seeds and have them plant seeds in clear cups with paper towels instead of soil. They can see roots growing and observe how water moves into seeds and growing plants. Track germination over 2 weeks and discuss: \"Where are the roots getting water? What does water do inside the seed?\"\n\n2. **Build a Mini Terrarium:** Students create a closed ecosystem in a jar (soil, small plants, water). Seal it and observe for 2 weeks. Ask: \"Where does the water in the jar come from if we don't open it? How are the plants getting water?\" This demonstrates the water cycle and shows that air and water cycle within a closed system—plants need air and water that's already there.\n\n3. **Interview a Gardener:** Have students prepare 5–6 questions about what the school or community garden needs, then interview the gardener or groundskeeper. Questions might include: \"Why do you water plants in the morning?\" \"How do you know which plants go in shady areas?\" \"What do you put in the soil?\" Students report back and connect the expert's answers to the lesson concepts.\n\n4. **Grow Fast-Growing Plants from Seeds:** Plant sunflowers, beans, or marigolds in the classroom and have students track growth weekly for 4–6 weeks. Create a height graph showing growth over time. Discuss: \"What is the plant using to get bigger? Where do you think that new material comes from?\" (This prepares students for the idea that plants use water, air, and soil nutrients to literally build new leaves, stems, and roots.)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Tips & Notes\n\n- **Timing:** The Explore phase works best if you start the plant experiment 5–7 school days *before* the Explain and Elaborate phases. This allows Plant B (no water) and Plant C (no light) to show clear differences. You may run the Engage phase on Day 1, set up Explore, then return to Explain/Elaborate on Day 6 or 7 when results are visible.\n\n- **Alternative if you have limited time:** Use pre-grown plants that have already been subjected to these conditions (kept in the dark for a week, left unwatered, etc.). Display them to students and ask: \"Which plant got water? Which got light?\" Students analyze the results without waiting for growth.\n\n- **Connection to Photograph:** Repeatedly return to the backyard garden photo throughout the lesson. Ask: \"Why is this garden thriving? What is it getting that our Plant B isn't?\" This reinforces the real-world relevance.\n\n- **Vocabulary Scaffolding:** For younger or struggling fifth graders, consolidate vocabulary into simpler terms:\n  - \"Water\" and \"Light\" and \"Good Soil\" and \"Air\" (avoid \"nutrients,\" \"photosynthesis,\" \"oxygen\")\n  - Use the photographs and actual plants as the primary meaning source, not definitions.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson fulfills NGSS 5-LS1-1 by having students observe, measure, and argue that plants need water and air (chiefly) to grow, supported by experimental evidence. It touches 5-LS2-1 by modeling how matter (water, nutrients) moves from soil into plants and supports their growth.**",
