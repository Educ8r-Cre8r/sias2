ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the grasshopper on the flower bud\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Picture of a grasshopper (simple drawing if needed as backup)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or printed on large poster board where all students can see clearly. Do NOT explain it yet.\n\n2. **Show and wonder together** using these guiding questions, one at a time, allowing 15-20 seconds of think time after each:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What animal is this?\" (First Grade students may recognize it as a bug or grasshopper; accept \"jumping bug\" or \"green bug.\")\n   - \"What is the grasshopper doing? Is it playing? Running? Sleeping?\" (Listen for eating, biting, eating a flower.)\n   - \"Do you see the red flower bud? Why might the grasshopper be near it?\" (Accept predictions like \"smelling it,\" \"eating it,\" \"playing with it.\")\n   - \"What do you think grasshoppers like to eat? Do they eat pizza like we do?\" (This will likely generate excited guesses and laughter — wonderful engagement!)\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"Let's find out what grasshoppers really eat and how their body helps them eat. I wonder if we can find plants in our classroom or outside that grasshoppers might like to munch!\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper: \"What do grasshoppers eat?\" Save this to review in the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an activity to discover what plants a grasshopper might want to eat!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover what grasshoppers eat through a plant-sampling activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4-5 different types of plant leaves/stems (gathered before the lesson):\n  - Dandelion leaf (or similar common plant)\n  - Grass blade\n  - Clover or bean plant leaf\n  - Rose leaf or thorny plant stem\n  - Soft flower petal (if available, such as from a hibiscus, rose, or wildflower)\n- Small paper plates or trays (one per pair/group of students)\n- Magnifying glasses (1-2 per pair)\n- Picture cards of a grasshopper eating each plant type (optional, for non-readers)\n- Clipboards and paper for recording observations\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs or small groups** (3-4 per group).\n\n2. **Give each group a tray with samples** of the 4-5 different plant parts arranged on a plate.\n\n3. **Provide these student-friendly directions** (demonstrate as you speak):\n   - \"Look at each plant with your magnifying glass. How does it feel? Is it soft or hard? Bumpy or smooth?\"\n   - \"Touch it gently (but do not eat!). Which plants are easy to chew? Which are hard?\"\n   - \"Think about the grasshopper's mouth and teeth. Which plant do you think a grasshopper would want to eat?\"\n   - \"Draw or color the plant you think the grasshopper would eat BEST.\"\n\n4. **Circulate and ask guiding questions** without giving answers:\n   - \"Why do you think the grasshopper would like that one?\"\n   - \"How does it feel different from this one?\"\n   - \"Would it be easy or hard for a grasshopper to chew?\"\n\n5. **Have students record** by:\n   - Drawing their favorite \"grasshopper food\" plant\n   - Pointing to or circling the plant they chose\n   - Coloring a plant picture provided by you\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Observe without leading; ask open-ended questions.\n- Prompt students to use their senses: \"What does it feel like?\"\n- Note which plants students gravitate toward — they are often correct in identifying soft, leafy foods!\n- Keep the activity exploratory and playful; there are no \"wrong\" answers here.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will likely identify soft leaves (grass, clover, dandelion) as more \"eatable\" than hard or spiky plants.\n- Students will handle plants and use descriptive language: \"This one is soft,\" \"This one is scratchy.\"\n- Students will create drawings showing which plant they think the grasshopper eats.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration; connect back to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with the original predictions from Engage\n- The grasshopper photograph (displayed again)\n- Picture or diagram of a grasshopper's head/mouth parts (simple is fine)\n- \"Grasshopper Food\" word cards with pictures\n- Whiteboard or chart for vocabulary\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a circle** for group share-out.\n\n2. **Ask for volunteers to share:** \"What plant did your group think the grasshopper likes best? Why?\" Listen for sensory language and reasoning.\n\n3. **Reveal the real answer** using the photograph:\n   - Point to the flower bud. \"Look! This grasshopper is eating a flower bud. Flower buds are soft and tasty. Grasshoppers love to eat leaves and flowers!\"\n   - Refer back to predictions: \"You were right that grasshoppers eat plants! They do NOT eat pizza like us!\"\n\n4. **Introduce vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions, using visuals and gestures:\n\n   - **Herbivore** (or \"Plant Eater\"): \"An animal that eats ONLY plants. 'Herb' means plants. Grasshoppers are plant eaters.\"\n   - **Mouth Parts**: \"Special body parts on the grasshopper's head that help it bite and chew. See the grasshopper's mouth in the picture? It has strong parts that can chew tough leaves.\"\n   - **Food**: \"Things animals eat to get energy to run, jump, and grow big and strong.\"\n   - **Habitat**: \"The place where an animal lives. Grasshoppers live on plants in gardens and grass.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show the photograph and ask: \"Is this grasshopper eating a plant or meat? How do you know?\"\n   - \"What do we call an animal that eats plants?\" (Repeat: \"A plant eater!\" or use the word herbivore if students are ready.)\n   - \"Why does the grasshopper need to eat? Does it need food to grow and stay healthy like you do?\" (Yes!)\n\n6. **Connect to their exploration:**\n   - \"You found soft plants in your activity. Grasshoppers can eat those easily with their mouth parts!\"\n   - \"The flower bud in the picture is soft, just like the plants you touched.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Herbivore / Plant Eater** | An animal that eats only plants to get energy and stay healthy. |\n| **Mouth Parts** | Special body pieces on an animal's head that help it bite, chew, and eat food. |\n| **Food** | Something an animal eats that gives it energy to move, play, and grow. |\n| **Habitat** | The home of an animal — the place where it lives and finds food. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can say: \"Grasshoppers eat plants.\"\n- Students can identify a grasshopper as a \"plant eater\" or herbivore.\n- Students understand that animals need to eat to survive and grow.\n- Students can point to the mouth parts of the grasshopper in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing a grasshopper mouth or mimicking how a grasshopper eats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Construction paper (green, brown, red)\n- Craft supplies: clothespins, popsicle sticks, pipe cleaners, tape, glue\n- Pictures of grasshopper parts (head and mouth close-up, if possible)\n- Pictures of different plants\n- Worksheet with a \"grasshopper mouth design\" template (simple outline of a circular mouth)\n- Scissors (safety scissors for First Grade)\n- Real grass or leaf samples (optional, if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Build a Grasshopper Mouth (Recommended for most First Grade classes)**\n\n1. **Show students** a close-up picture or diagram of a grasshopper's mouth. Point out the strong \"jaws\" that help it bite and chew.\n\n2. **Explain the challenge:** \"Grasshoppers have special mouth parts that help them eat tough plants. Can you design a mouth that could bite and eat a leaf or grass?\"\n\n3. **Demonstrate** how to use a clothespin or popsicle stick \"jaws\":\n   - \"If I pinch this clothespin, it's like the grasshopper biting a leaf. The jaws come together to chew!\"\n   - Show how the pinching motion works on a real leaf or piece of paper.\n\n4. **Student task:**\n   - Build a simple \"grasshopper mouth\" using clothespins, popsicle sticks, or paper strips taped to form a hinge.\n   - Test it on real grass or a leaf by \"pinching\" or \"biting\" the plant.\n   - Draw or color the mouth they created.\n\n5. **Students test their designs:**\n   - \"Can your grasshopper mouth pinch the grass?\"\n   - \"Does it work like a real grasshopper's mouth?\"\n\n**Option B: Mime and Movement Activity (If time is short or for kinesthetic learners)**\n\n1. **Model for students** how a grasshopper uses its mouth by:\n   - Making a \"munching\" motion with your hand at your mouth.\n   - Pretending to hold a leaf and take bites.\n\n2. **Students mime** eating like a grasshopper:\n   - \"Pretend you are a grasshopper. How would you grab a leaf with your legs? How would you bite it?\"\n   - Encourage exaggerated chewing motions.\n\n3. **Discuss:**\n   - \"What makes a grasshopper's mouth different from your mouth?\"\n   - \"Why do you think a grasshopper needs a strong bite?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the building process; help students tape or glue if needed.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Does it pinch? Can it bite the grass? How is it like a real grasshopper?\"\n- Celebrate creative designs, even if they don't work perfectly.\n- Connect each student's work back to the photograph: \"The grasshopper in our picture uses its mouth just like you designed!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a simple model showing how a grasshopper's mouth helps it eat.\n- Students can explain one way their mouth design is like a real grasshopper's mouth.\n- Students understand that an animal's body parts help it survive and get food.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of grasshopper feeding and body parts.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore: Are they identifying soft plants? Using sensory language?\n- Listen during Explain: Can they repeat that grasshoppers eat plants? Can they name a body part?\n- Watch during Elaborate: Are they connecting their design to how a real grasshopper eats?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nChoose one format based on your students' abilities:\n\n**Option 1: Picture-Based Exit Ticket** (for emerging readers/writers)\n- Show students four pictures: grasshopper eating grass, bird eating a worm, cow eating grass, butterfly on a flower.\n- Ask: \"Which animals eat plants like the grasshopper?\" Students point to or circle the correct pictures.\n- Ask: \"What does the grasshopper use to eat? Can you point to its mouth?\" (on the photograph)\n\n**Option 2: Oral Exit Ticket** (best for First Grade)\nGather students and ask these questions individually or in small groups:\n\n1. **\"What does a grasshopper eat?\"** \n   - Success: Student says \"plants\" or names a specific plant (leaves, grass, flowers, buds).\n\n2. **\"Why does the grasshopper need to eat?\"**\n   - Success: Student says \"to grow,\" \"to get energy,\" \"to stay alive/healthy,\" or \"because all animals need food.\"\n\n3. **\"Show me the grasshopper's mouth in this picture. How does it help the grasshopper?\"**\n   - Success: Student points to the head/mouth area and says \"it bites\" or \"it chews\" or \"it eats the flower.\"\n\n**Option 3: Drawing-Based Exit Ticket** (combined formative/summative)\n- Give each student a sheet with a simple grasshopper outline and a blank space.\n- Prompt: \"Draw a plant you think the grasshopper would like to eat.\"\n- Assess: Does the plant drawn show soft leaves or flowers (vs. inedible objects)? Can the student explain why the grasshopper would eat it?\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Success Indicator |\n|-------------------|------------------|\n| Observe and describe how animals use body parts to find and eat food | Student can point to the grasshopper's mouth or legs in the photograph and explain one way it helps the grasshopper eat. |\n| Identify that different animals eat different kinds of food | Student can name at least one plant a grasshopper eats and explain that grasshoppers eat plants (not meat or other foods). |\n| Explain why animals need to eat | Student can say \"to grow,\" \"to get strong,\" \"to have energy,\" or \"to stay alive.\" |\n| Compare how a grasshopper's body helps it eat plants | Student's designed mouth or mime demonstrates understanding that strong mouth parts help the grasshopper bite/chew plants. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nBy the end of this lesson, students should:\n- Know that grasshoppers are herbivores (plant eaters).\n- Understand that grasshoppers eat soft plants like leaves, grass, and flowers.\n- Recognize that the grasshopper's mouth parts and legs help it survive.\n- Understand that all animals need food to grow and stay healthy.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:**\n   - Use \"plant eater\" instead of \"herbivore\" consistently; introduce herbivore only if students master the concept.\n   - Stick to one or two key vocabulary words per lesson rather than four or five.\n\n2. **Tactile and Visual Supports:**\n   - Provide real plants (not just pictures) during Explore so students can touch and feel the difference between soft and hard plants.\n   - Use a large, clear photograph of the grasshopper and point to body parts as you name them.\n   - Provide picture cards showing \"grasshopper eats\" vs. \"grasshopper does not eat\" for sorting activities.\n\n3. **Guided Questioning:**\n   - Ask yes/no or either/or questions instead of open-ended ones: \"Does the grasshopper eat plants OR meat?\" \"Is grass soft OR hard?\"\n   - Use \"think-pair-share\": Students discuss with a partner before sharing with the whole group.\n   - Pair struggling students with a peer buddy during Explore and Elaborate.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper Inquiry:**\n   - \"What would happen if all the plants disappeared? How would the grasshopper survive?\"\n   - \"Are there other insects that eat plants like grasshoppers do? Let's research!\"\n   - \"Draw a diagram showing the grasshopper's life: egg → baby → adult. What does each stage eat?\"\n\n2. **Extended Research:**\n   - Provide books or digital resources about what other herbivores eat (rabbits, deer, caterpillars).\n   - Ask: \"Can you find three different plants that a grasshopper might eat?\" Have students sketch or photograph them.\n   - Create a \"Grasshopper Menu\" with pictures of different plants and ask students to rank them by how much they think grasshoppers like them.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis:**\n   - Compare herbivores (grasshopper, rabbit, cow) with other animals. \"What do YOU eat that the grasshopper does NOT eat?\"\n   - Design a poster or book page: \"What Do Different Animals Eat?\" with drawings of 3-4 animals and their foods.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grasshopper Observation Garden:**\n   - Plant a small container with grass and clover indoors or set up an outdoor window box observation area.\n   - If possible, observe a real grasshopper or cricket eating over several days (or show a time-lapse video).\n   - Students sketch or photograph changes to the plants and record observations on a chart: \"How much did the grasshopper eat each day?\"\n   - *Connects to:* 1-LS1-2 (patterns in animal behavior)\n\n2. **Read-Aloud and Role-Play:**\n   - Read a First Grade-appropriate book about grasshoppers (e.g., *The Very Busy Grasshopper* by Melinda Melton, *Grasshopper* by Isabel Thomas, or *Jump, Frog, Jump!* by Robert Kalan for the connection to habitats).\n   - After reading, act out the grasshopper's day: finding food, eating plants, jumping away from predators.\n   - Discuss: \"How does the grasshopper use its body to survive?\"\n   - *Connects to:* 1-LS1-2 (behaviors that help offspring survive)\n\n3. **Food Chain / Ecosystem Mobile:**\n   - Create a simple food chain mobile showing: Sun → Plants → Grasshopper → Bird.\n   - Discuss: \"The grasshopper eats plants. What eats the grasshopper?\"\n   - Students draw or color each part and hang them to show the chain.\n   - *Connects to:* Understanding that animals depend on plants and each other.\n\n4. **Sensory Writing / Drawing Journal:**\n   - Students continue to observe plants around the school or home.\n   - Prompt: \"If you were a grasshopper, which plant would you eat and why? Draw and describe it.\"\n   - Collect responses in a class book: \"Grasshopper's Favorite Foods.\"\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Tips for Success\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson works best if spread across two sessions (Session 1: Engage + Explore; Session 2: Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate), but can be done in one 90-minute block if you shorten the sharing and discussion time.\n\n- **Safety Note:** If using real grasshoppers or insects, handle with care and follow your school's live animal protocol. If not available, the photograph and plant samples are sufficient.\n\n- **Vocabulary Support:** Create a simple \"Word Wall\" with pictures of grasshopper, plant, eat, and mouth. Reference it daily for a few weeks after the lesson.\n\n- **Engagement Booster:** Many First Graders are fascinated by bugs. Lean into this! Use excited language and encourage \"bug watching\" at recess.\n\n- **Inclusive Design:** Ensure students with visual impairments have access to tactile plant samples during Explore. Pair with peer buddies for large-group discussions.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly responds to the photograph by using the grasshopper eating the flower bud as the anchoring phenomenon, and it develops First Grade students' understanding of how animals' body parts help them meet their survival needs — a foundational concept for lifelong science learning.**",
