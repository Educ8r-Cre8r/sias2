Identify the role of a spider (predator/consumer) in an ecosystem and explain how it obtains energy and matter from other organisms.\n2. Construct a simple food web or food chain showing how energy and matter move from one organism to another, including the spider and its habitat.\n3. Support an argument about why spiders are important to maintaining balance in their ecosystems by controlling insect populations.\n4. Use evidence from the photograph and their own observations to describe how the spider's structures (legs, body, coloration) help it survive and move matter/energy through its environment.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about predators, food chains, and how organisms interact with their environment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the desert spider (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Index cards with images of various desert organisms (insect, plant, snake, lizard, spider, beetle)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Hook with the Image:** Display the photograph of the spider on sandy soil. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds without talking. Then ask:\n   - \"What do you notice about this creature? Describe what you see.\"\n   - \"Where do you think this animal lives? What clues does the photograph give you?\"\n   - \"What do you think this spider eats? Why?\"\n   - \"What animals or organisms might eat this spider?\"\n\n2. **Prediction Prompt:** Say: *\"This spider is about to catch an insect for dinner. Before we explore further, what do you predict will happen to the energy and materials from that insect? Where does that energy go?\"* Collect 3-4 student predictions on the chart.\n\n3. **Wonder Connection:** Ask: *\"I wonder... if all the spiders disappeared from the desert, what would happen to the insects? To the plants? To the whole desert community?\"* Write this wonder on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become ecosystem detectives. We'll explore how this spider fits into a larger web of life and discover how matter—the 'stuff' that makes up living things—moves from one organism to another.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate energy and matter movement through a hands-on ecosystem modeling activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- String or yarn (one ball per small group)\n- Index cards with organism names/pictures (spider, ant, beetle, fly, grasshopper, desert plant, lizard, hawk, decomposer)\n- Tape\n- Large open floor space or table\n- Student recording sheets (provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup:** Divide the class into groups of 6-8 students. Give each student one index card with an organism name (e.g., \"Desert Plant,\" \"Grasshopper,\" \"Spider,\" \"Beetle,\" \"Lizard,\" \"Hawk,\" \"Decomposer\").\n\n2. **Food Web Construction:**\n   - Explain: \"You are each an organism in a desert ecosystem. When one organism eats another, energy and matter pass between you. We'll use this string to show those connections.\"\n   - One student holds the string and passes it to another student while saying: \"I eat [organism name],\" creating a web on the floor.\n   - The spider student will connect to multiple organisms (insects), showing that the spider eats many things.\n   - Continue until all organisms are connected, showing a visible food web.\n\n3. **Matter Tracing Activity:**\n   - Hold up a small object (ball or marker) as \"energy and matter.\"\n   - Say: \"Let's trace where energy goes. Starting with the Sun and the plant...\"\n   - Pass the object along the food web: Plant → Grasshopper → Spider → Lizard → Hawk, explaining at each step.\n   - Pass the object multiple times using different pathways (e.g., Plant → Ant → Spider; Plant → Beetle → Spider).\n   - When passing, students say what they receive (energy and matter from food).\n\n4. **Student Recording:**\n   - Provide each student with a **Food Web Recording Sheet** with the following prompts:\n     - *Draw one food chain that includes the spider. Label each organism and use arrows to show the movement of energy.*\n     - *What would happen to the spider if all the insects disappeared? Explain using what you learned.*\n     - *Trace the path of energy: Where does all energy in this ecosystem originally come from?*\n\n5. **Group Reflection:** Ask students standing in their web: *\"How did you feel when your food source was cut off? What happened to the energy flow?\"* (If applicable, remove one organism and have students describe the collapse.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and listen to student explanations.\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why did you connect to that organism?\" \"Show me where the energy came from.\"\n- Guide without correcting—let students discover connections.\n- Encourage students to use the words \"energy\" and \"matter\" when describing transfers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visible food web showing the spider as a consumer/predator.\n- Students understand that energy flows from plants through herbivores to carnivores.\n- Students recognize that removing one organism affects many others.\n- Recorded food chains and explanations reflect understanding of energy transfer.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize concepts and vocabulary; connect exploration to the photograph and ecosystem principles.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected photograph of the spider\n- Anchor chart paper (pre-prepared or co-created)\n- Vocabulary cards (printed or handwritten)\n- Real or model images of the spider and common desert prey\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out from Explore Phase (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to briefly show their food webs and explain one connection.\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover about how energy moves?\"\n   - Record key student observations on the anchor chart.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Use the photograph and student models to teach these terms:\n\n     **Vocabulary:**\n     - **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals. *Example: The spider in the photo hunts insects.*\n     - **Prey:** An animal that is hunted and eaten by another animal. *Example: Insects are prey for the spider.*\n     - **Consumer:** A living thing that eats other living things to get energy and matter. *Example: The spider is a consumer because it eats insects.*\n     - **Food Web:** A diagram showing all the connected food chains in an ecosystem; shows how energy and matter move from organism to organism. *Example: The web we created together.*\n     - **Matter:** The \"stuff\" that makes up all living and nonliving things; it moves through ecosystems when organisms eat each other and decompose.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the spider: \"This is a **predator**. It hunts smaller organisms for food. When it catches an **insect prey**, it takes in energy and matter from that insect.\"\n   - Ask: \"Is the spider only a predator, or could it also be prey?\" (Yes—a lizard or bird might eat it.) Point out the spider's coloration: \"Its dark color helps it blend in with the sand—**adaptation** for survival.\"\n   - Draw a simple food chain on the board: Desert Plant → Insect → Spider → Lizard. Label each organism's role.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I point to an organism in our food web, can you tell me: Is it a predator, prey, or both? Is it a consumer?\"\n   - Use think-pair-share: \"Turn to a partner and explain: How does energy get from the desert sun into the spider?\"\n   - Listen to 2-3 pairs share.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define and use vocabulary correctly in context.\n- Students recognize the spider's role as both predator (eats insects) and prey (eaten by larger animals).\n- Students understand that matter moves through food webs and that the spider is part of this movement.\n- Students can trace energy from the sun through the food chain.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply ecosystem concepts to a new scenario and deepen understanding of matter and energy movement.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Scenario cards (see below)\n- Poster paper or large index cards\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- Optional: Images of various desert organisms\n- Model organisms (toy figures or pictures) for students to manipulate\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Choose One of Two Options:**\n\n**Option A: Ecosystem Change Scenario (Recommended for whole class)**\n\n1. Present this scenario: *\"Scientists recently discovered that a new disease is killing off many desert beetles. The beetles are a major food source for spiders. Using what you learned about food webs and matter movement, what do you predict will happen?\"*\n\n2. In small groups (3-4 students), students create a **Prediction and Evidence Poster** that includes:\n   - A prediction: What will happen to the spider population?\n   - Evidence: Which food chains or food webs will be affected?\n   - Reasoning: Explain using the vocabulary you learned (predator, prey, consumer, matter, energy).\n   - A diagram showing how matter/energy movement changes.\n\n3. Groups present posters (2 minutes each). Class votes on which prediction is most logical based on evidence.\n\n4. Discussion: *\"Why can't spiders just eat something else instead of beetles?\"* (Discuss food preferences, adaptation, availability.)\n\n**Option B: Personal Ecosystem Connection (For advanced learners or differentiation)**\n\n1. Ask: *\"Every time you eat food, you're part of a food web. If you eat an apple from a tree, then you eat chicken that ate grain, what food chains are connecting you to the sun's energy?\"*\n\n2. Students create their own **\"My Food Web\"** diagram showing:\n   - Three meals or snacks they ate recently\n   - The food chains that led to that food (including plants and animals)\n   - Arrows showing energy and matter flowing to them\n   - A connection to the desert spider ecosystem if possible (e.g., \"We both eat insects\" or \"We both depend on plants\").\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group discussions without providing answers.\n- Ask: \"How would the spider respond to this change?\" \"Which organisms would feel the impact first?\"\n- Encourage evidence-based reasoning.\n- Push thinking: \"What about the animals that eat spiders? How would they be affected?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply food web knowledge to predict ecosystem changes.\n- Students provide evidence-based reasoning using vocabulary.\n- Students recognize that ecosystems are interconnected and that removing one organism has ripple effects.\n- Posters/diagrams reflect understanding of matter and energy movement through food webs.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of energy and matter movement in ecosystems and the spider's role.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n- **Observe:** Listen to student explanations during the food web activity. Do they use directional language (\"energy flows from plant to insect to spider\")? Do they recognize the spider's dual role?\n- **Check Responses:** During the Explain phase, note which students can correctly identify predators, prey, and consumers.\n- **Review Recordings:** Examine the Food Web Recording Sheets from the Explore phase for accuracy and reasoning.\n\n**Exit Ticket Assessment (Summative):**\n\nProvide each student with an **Exit Ticket** containing these three questions (adjust wording for your grade level):\n\n1. **Label the Food Chain:** Draw and label a food chain that shows how energy moves from the sun to the spider. (Use arrows. Label each organism and show where the sun's energy enters.)\n\n2. **Explain the Spider's Role:** Write or draw: Is the spider a predator, prey, or consumer? Explain your answer using one example from the desert ecosystem.\n\n3. **Make a Prediction:** If all the spiders disappeared from the desert, what would happen to the insect population? Use the words \"predator,\" \"prey,\" or \"consumer\" in your explanation.\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n\n- ✓ **Food Chain (Q1):** Student draws a clear chain with arrows pointing in the correct direction (Sun → Plant → Insect → Spider). All organisms are labeled.\n- ✓ **Role Explanation (Q2):** Student correctly identifies the spider as both a predator (eats insects) and consumer, or as prey (eaten by larger animals). Answer includes a specific example.\n- ✓ **Prediction (Q3):** Student predicts that insect populations would increase without spiders and explains using the term \"predator\" or similar reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show that 80%+ of students can trace energy through a food chain correctly.\n- Students can identify the spider's role in the ecosystem using appropriate vocabulary.\n- Students understand that removing a predator affects prey populations (food web balance).\n\n**Interpretation:**\n- Students meeting 2-3 criteria: Ready for elaboration/extensions.\n- Students meeting 1 criterion: Provide re-teaching in small groups; focus on the direction of energy flow and the spider's role.\n- Students struggling with all: Provide additional scaffolding (see Differentiation section).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Food Chain:** Provide a pre-made food chain card (Sun → Plant → Insect → Spider) for students to trace with their finger and copy onto their own paper. Ask: \"Where does the energy start? Where does it go next?\" Guide left-to-right arrow placement.\n\n2. **Picture-Based Vocabulary:** Create a vocabulary anchor chart with clear images for each term (predator, prey, consumer, food web). Point to the picture while saying the word. Have students repeat and point to the image when the word is used.\n\n3. **Pair with a Buddy:** During the Explore phase, pair struggling students with a peer or assign them the role of \"string holder\" (central organism) so they're part of the activity without managing multiple connections. Provide sentence frames: \"I am the [organism]. I eat ___. I am eaten by ___.\"\n\n4. **Alternative Exit Ticket:** Offer multiple-choice or matching for Question 3. Example: \"If all spiders disappeared: (a) insects would increase, (b) insects would decrease, (c) nothing would change.\"\n\n---\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Complex Food Web:** Instead of a simple chain, have advanced students create a food web showing multiple connections (one organism has 2-3 food sources; one organism is prey for 2-3 predators). Ask them to trace energy along three different pathways and explain why some pathways are stronger than others.\n\n2. **Decomposer and Nutrient Cycling:** Introduce the role of decomposers in returning matter to the soil and plants. Ask: \"When the spider dies, where does its matter go? Draw a diagram showing how the spider's body matter cycles back into the ecosystem.\"\n\n3. **Food Web Stability:** Present a more complex scenario: \"A drought kills 50% of the plants. What happens to the insects? The spiders? The lizards?\" Have students create a revised food web showing the new balance and write a brief explanation of cascade effects.\n\n4. **Research Extension:** Have advanced students research a specific desert predator-prey relationship (e.g., tarantula and wasp, scorpion and centipede) and present findings to the class, explaining energy flow and adaptations.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Backyard Ecosystem Scavenger Hunt:** Take students outside to observe organisms in a local habitat (garden, schoolyard, or park). Using clipboards and simple sketches, students identify 3-5 organisms, predict food web connections, and report findings to the class. Ask: \"How is the food web in our yard similar to the desert food web? How is it different?\"\n\n2. **Design a Balanced Ecosystem:** Provide students with a list of organisms (plants, herbivores, carnivores, decomposers) and challenge them to create a balanced ecosystem by choosing the right numbers of each. Example: \"If you have 100 plants, how many grasshoppers? How many spiders?\" Have them justify their choices using food web logic and explain what happens if the numbers become unbalanced.\n\n3. **Create a Food Web Trading Card Game:** Students design \"organism cards\" for desert animals (spider, ant, beetle, lizard, plant, sun, decomposer). Each card lists what it eats and what eats it. Students play a game where they lay cards and create valid food chains/webs. Optional: Turn it into a memory or matching game where students must correctly connect predators to prey.\n\n4. **Desert Habitat Diorama:** Working individually or in pairs, students create a small diorama of the desert ecosystem showing the spider and at least 4 other organisms. They label each organism's role (predator, prey, producer, consumer) and add written food chains on the side. Display in the classroom and use for peer teaching.\n\n5. **Imagine and Investigate:** Present a hypothetical: \"What if there were no spiders in the desert?\" Students write or illustrate a short story about how the ecosystem changes over time (insects explode, plants are eaten bare, etc.). Alternatively, have students predict what would happen if a new organism was introduced (e.g., an invasive beetle) and explain using food web concepts.\n\n---",
