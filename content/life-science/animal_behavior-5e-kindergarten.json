ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animals and their environments using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, printed color photograph of the green lizard on rock/bark (or projected image)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph prominently** where all students can see it clearly. Ask them to sit in a circle facing the image.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (pause after each for responses):\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? What color is it?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this animal lives? What makes you think that?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the lizard is green? Is that helpful to the lizard?\"\n   - \"What body parts can you see? What might the lizard use those for?\" (Point to the eye, skin, tail.)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder why this lizard is so green when it sits on brown rocks. Can you hide this lizard by coloring something green to match it?\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper. Accept all answers without judgment.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore how animals use their special features and colors to stay safe and find what they need to live.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate camouflage and animal survival needs through hands-on discovery.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Colored construction paper (green, brown, gray, tan) cut into 8\" × 10\" sheets\n- Small green and brown paper lizard cutouts (pre-cut, about 2\" long)\n- Crayons, colored pencils, or markers\n- Glue sticks\n- Small paper bags or envelopes (one per student)\n- Picture cards showing animal habitats (forest, desert, water, grass)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: The Hiding Lizard Game (15 minutes)**\n\n1. Give each student one sheet of colored construction paper (mix the colors throughout the class).\n\n2. Say: \"Your paper is the lizard's home. You need to hide your lizard on your paper so a bird (predator) can't find it!\"\n\n3. Hand each student a paper lizard cutout. Students must glue their lizard onto their colored paper in a way that makes it hard to see.\n\n4. **Facilitate without giving answers.** Walk around and ask:\n   - \"Where did you put your lizard?\"\n   - \"Will a bird be able to find it there? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What color is your home paper? Does your lizard match?\"\n\n5. Once complete, hold up each paper and ask the class: \"Can you find the lizard? Is it hiding well?\"\n\n6. **Observation:** Students will notice that green lizards hide better on green or brown papers than on gray or tan papers.\n\n**Part 2: What Do Lizards Need? (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Show the original photograph again. Point to:\n   - The rock/bark (shelter and hiding place)\n   - The crevices and shadows (safe spaces)\n   - Mention insects or small creatures that might live in this area (food)\n\n2. Give each student a small paper bag. Say: \"Collect pictures or draw things a lizard needs to survive. You can find a place to hide, something to eat, or water.\"\n\n3. Students draw or cut/paste items into their bags (or simply list them with your help).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions, not leading questions.\n- Listen to student reasoning about color matching and safety.\n- Help students connect their observations back to the photograph.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will recognize that animals match their environment colors to hide from danger.\n- Students will identify basic survival needs: shelter (rocks, bark), food (insects), and safety (hiding places).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts using student discoveries.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n- The original photograph (enlarged or projected)\n- Picture cards of different animals in different habitats\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather students in a circle. Ask volunteers to show their hiding lizard papers.\n   - \"Why does your lizard blend in?\"\n   - \"What color is the paper? What color is the lizard?\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** using pictures and simple definitions:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Camouflage (KAM-uh-flaj):** Colors or patterns on an animal's body that help it hide from other animals.\n   - **Habitat (HAB-i-tat):** The place where an animal lives and finds food and shelter.\n   - **Shelter:** A safe place where an animal can hide and rest.\n   - **Survival:** Staying alive by getting what you need (food, water, safety, shelter).\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the lizard's green color: \"This green helps the lizard blend in with the leaves and trees. That's camouflage!\"\n   - Point to the rocks and bark: \"This is the lizard's habitat. It has everything the lizard needs.\"\n   - Say: \"The lizard's green skin helps it survive because predators have a harder time seeing it.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your hands: How big is a lizard?\" (Small.)\n   - \"What color is our lizard?\" (Green.)\n   - \"What does camouflage mean?\" (Help hide.)\n   - \"Where do lizards live?\" (In rocky, warm places with plants.)\n\n5. **Display a small anchor chart** with the lizard photo, the word \"Camouflage,\" and a simple illustration showing a green lizard blending in.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the words \"camouflage,\" \"habitat,\" and \"shelter\" appropriately.\n- Students will understand that animals have features that help them survive.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply camouflage and survival concepts to a new context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or printed images of 4-5 different animals (frog, butterfly, tiger, penguin, rabbit)\n- Pictures of their habitats (forest, flower, grassland, ice, burrow)\n- Colored paper and crayons\n- Picture sorting cards (laminated or digital)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Matching game:** Show students an animal picture and its habitat. Ask:\n   - \"Does this animal's color match its home?\"\n   - \"How does the animal's color help it survive?\"\n\n   Examples:\n   - Green frog on a green lily pad ✓ Good camouflage\n   - Yellow and black butterfly on a flower ✓ Blends in\n   - White penguin on ice ✓ Camouflage\n   - Orange tiger in a grassland — discuss whether stripes help break up its shape\n\n2. **Design your own animal:** \n   - Give students a blank body outline (provided shape: simple circle with four bumps for legs).\n   - Say: \"Imagine you are an animal designer. What habitat will your animal live in? What color should it be so it can hide and be safe?\"\n   - Students color their animal to match a habitat they choose (you provide habitat pictures: forest, desert, water, grass).\n   - Students glue their colored animal onto a habitat paper.\n\n3. **Gallery walk:** Students display their designs. Peers identify:\n   - \"What habitat is this animal in?\"\n   - \"Is the animal hiding well? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the discussion. Ask: \"Why did you choose that color?\"\n- Validate all thoughtful responses.\n- Help students explain their choices using words like \"camouflage,\" \"habitat,\" and \"safe.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will apply the concept of camouflage to new animals and environments.\n- Students will explain a simple reason for their color choices (e.g., \"My animal is brown because it lives in dirt\").\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal survival needs and camouflage.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Listen to student responses to questions during Engage and Explain phases.\n- Observe how students place and describe their lizards in the Explore phase.\n- Ask: \"How does the green color help the lizard?\" Listen for evidence of understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket (end of Lesson 2):**\nShow students the original lizard photograph one more time and ask them to respond to these prompts (you may read aloud and record responses):\n\n1. **\"Point to the lizard in the picture. What color is it?\"** *(Success: Student identifies the lizard and says \"green\" or \"bright green.\")*\n\n2. **\"Why is the lizard green?\"** *(Success: Student says something like \"to hide,\" \"so birds can't see it,\" \"to blend in,\" or \"to be safe.\")*\n\n3. **\"Name one thing the lizard needs to live.\"** *(Success: Student says \"food,\" \"water,\" \"a safe place,\" \"rocks to hide in,\" or \"shelter.\")*\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student can point to and identify the lizard.\n- ✓ Student understands that the green color helps the lizard hide or be safe.\n- ✓ Student can name at least one survival need (shelter, food, or safety).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most kindergarteners will understand that color helps animals hide.\n- All students will identify at least one survival need.\n- Students will use vocabulary words (\"camouflage,\" \"habitat,\" \"shelter\") in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce language complexity:** Use only 2-3 vocabulary words consistently (e.g., \"hide,\" \"green,\" \"safe\"). Repeat them throughout the lesson.\n\n2. **Guided observation:** Pair students with a peer or provide hand-over-hand support during the hiding game. Ask simpler questions: \"Is the lizard easy to see? Yes or no?\"\n\n3. **Concrete examples:** Use real or toy lizards and rocks. Let students physically place the lizard on different colored papers to see which hides best. Make the concept tangible.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper camouflage exploration:** Ask: \"Some animals are brown, some are green, some have stripes. Why? What different habitats do they live in?\" Introduce the idea that different animals have different colors because they live in different places.\n\n2. **Design multiple animals:** Challenge students to design three animals, each for a different habitat (forest, desert, water). Explain why each color works.\n\n3. **Predict and test:** Ask: \"If we moved this green lizard to a snowy place, would it be safe? Why not? What color should it be?\" Encourage reasoning about mismatch between animal and environment.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Nature hunt:** Take students outside or show photos of outdoor areas. Ask: \"Can you find animals hiding in pictures?\" Look for insects, birds, or other creatures in their natural habitats. Discuss how their colors help them hide.\n\n2. **Camouflage art project:** Students create a scene (jungle, forest, desert) using collage materials and then hide a paper animal in it. Classmates try to find the hidden animal. This reinforces that color and pattern help animals survive.\n\n3. **Book connection:** Read *The Mixed-Up Chameleon* by Eric Carle or *Animals in Camouflage* by Bobbie Kalman. Discuss how different animals change or use colors to hide. Students draw their favorite camouflaged animal from the book.\n\n4. **Home connection:** Send home a simple activity sheet showing different habitat pictures. Families color or draw an animal that would be safe (camouflaged) in each habitat and return it to school. Create a class book of \"Our Camouflaged Animals.\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- Kindergarteners are concrete thinkers. Provide lots of visual examples and hands-on activities.\n- Repeat key vocabulary throughout both lessons.\n- Use the photograph as an anchor point—return to it often to reinforce concepts.\n- Keep explanations short and simple; use lots of repetition.\n- Celebrate all student attempts to identify and explain animal survival features.",
