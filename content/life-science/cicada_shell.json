The shell looks like a hollow bug case that has split open down the middle. Around it, you can see colorful green and gray lichen growing on the bark, which are special living things that grow on trees.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** This is a **cicada exoskeleton** (or molt/shed skin)—the empty shell left behind when a cicada grows too big for its outer skin.\n\n**Why This Happens:** Cicadas are insects that grow by shedding their hard outer skin several times during their life. When a cicada gets too large for its exoskeleton, it splits the shell open and crawls out, leaving behind the empty case. This process is called **ecdysis** or **molting**. The cicada grows new, larger skin underneath before crawling out. This is a form of **incomplete metamorphosis** and is part of the cicada's natural life cycle. Young cicadas spend years underground before emerging as adults, and this shell-shedding happens multiple times during their development.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Growth and Life Cycles:** Living things grow and change over time. Insects like cicadas grow by shedding their outer skin when it becomes too small.\n\n2. **Structures and Functions:** The exoskeleton protects the soft body inside and gives the insect its shape. Once the insect outgrows it, a new skeleton forms underneath.\n\n3. **Habitats and Ecosystems:** Trees provide homes and places for insects to go through their life changes. Lichen also grows on trees, showing multiple living things sharing the same space.\n\n4. **Observable Evidence of Life:** Finding shed shells helps us see that insects are living in our environment, even if we don't always see the insects themselves.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\n**Kinesthetic Connection:** Let students act out the molting process by having them crouch inside a \"shell\" (a hula hoop or circle on the floor) and then \"grow\" by slowly stepping out and standing tall.

    "firstgrade": "# Cicada Shell: Life Science Lesson Plan\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a brown, papery shell that a cicada left behind on tree bark surrounded by green lichen. The shell looks like the outside covering of an insect's body. The cicada crawled out of this shell when it was ready to become a grown-up and fly away.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Exuviae (insect molting/shedding)\n\nThis image captures **ecdysis**—the process where insects shed their old exoskeletons to grow larger. Cicadas spend years underground as nymphs, then climb to trees and emerge from their hard outer shells. The shell splits open, and the adult cicada pulls itself out, leaving behind this perfect cast. This happens because insects have rigid exoskeletons that cannot stretch; they must shed them periodically to increase in size. For cicadas, this final molt is transformative—the nymph becomes a winged adult capable of flight and reproduction.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Life Cycles and Growth:** All living things grow and change. Cicadas go through different stages: egg → nymph (underground) → adult (above ground). Shedding helps them grow bigger.\n\n* **Adaptation and Survival:** The hard shell protects the cicada while it's underground. When the cicada is ready to be an adult, it finds a safe tree to shed its shell.\n\n* **Evidence of Life:** Empty shells are **evidence** that an animal once lived there. Scientists use these clues to learn about creatures we don't always see.\n\n* **Structures and Functions:** The cicada's shell (exoskeleton) protects its soft body inside, just like our skin protects us. When the cicada grows, it needs a bigger shell.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFirst graders are concrete learners who benefit from handling real objects. If possible, collect actual shed cicada shells (or high-quality replicas) for students to observe with magnifying glasses during independent exploration time. This tactile experience deepens understanding far more than images alone. Allow at least 5–10 minutes of unstructured observation before introducing vocabulary.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Representation:** Offer multiple ways to \"see\" the phenomenon—the photo, real shells (if available), videos of cicadas emerging, and labeled diagrams. **Action & Expression:** Let students draw the shell, act out the molting process, or build a model with craft materials. **Engagement:** Connect to student experience: \"Your clothes get too small as you grow. Cicadas' shells get too small too—but they can't just buy new clothes! They have to shed their old shell.\"\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Grade 1 Performance Expectations:**\n\n- **1-LS1-1:** Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n  - *Connection:* Students can explore how the hard shell helps the cicada survive underground.\n\n- **1-LS1-2:** Read texts and use evidence to describe that animals have predictable life cycles.\n  - *Connection:* The shed shell is direct evidence of the cicada's life cycle transformation.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-LS1.A]] Structure and Function\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-LS1.B]] Growth and Development of Organisms\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] (The life cycle is a pattern; molting is a repeating behavior)\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] (The shell's structure allows growth through shedding)\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think was inside this shell before the cicada left it?** (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why did the cicada need to leave its shell?

Some students are nymphs crawling underground (moving slowly on hands and knees), then \"climb\" up a pretend tree, and finally \"shed\" a blanket or fabric to emerge as adults (standing tall and \"flying\"). Repeat several times so all students experience each role. This kinesthetic activity solidifies understanding of the transformation.\n\n2. **Shell Hunt & Observation:** Take the class outside to search for shed insect shells, cicada exoskeletons, or other natural evidence on trees and plants. Use magnifying glasses to observe details. Students can sketch what they find and create a class chart titled \"What We Found\" with pictures and descriptions. (Safety note: Ensure students do not pick at live insects or damage tree bark.)\n\n3. **Model Molting with Art:** Provide each student with a paper cicada outline, markers, and tissue paper or colored cellophane. Students color the \"adult\" cicada inside and wrap it loosely with the tissue to represent the \"shell.\" They can then carefully unwrap their model to see the adult emerging. Display models as a visual reminder of the molting process.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* by Eric Carle (Addresses metamorphosis and growth cycles; accessible for First Grade)\n- *Cicada!

    "secondgrade": "# Second Grade Science Lesson: Cicada Shells\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a brown, empty shell of a cicada stuck to tree bark surrounded by green and white lichen. The shell looks like a hollow bug that has been left behind. The cicada crawled out of this shell and flew away as a grown-up insect!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** *Exoskeleton Shedding (Ecdysis)*\n\nCicadas experience **incomplete metamorphosis**. Young cicadas, called nymphs, live underground for several years drinking juice from plant roots. When they are ready to become adults, they crawl up a tree and their hard outer skin (exoskeleton) splits open. The adult cicada wriggles out, leaving behind this papery brown shell. This shell-shedding is called **molting** or **ecdysis**. The cicada must shed its exoskeleton to grow because the hard shell doesn't stretch like skin does—it's like outgrowing a suit of armor and needing a bigger one!\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Life Cycles:** All living things go through different stages of life. Cicadas change from underground nymphs into flying insects. This big change is part of their life cycle.\n\n* **Growth and Change:** Insects have hard outer shells called exoskeletons that don't grow with them. When an insect gets too big, it must shed its old shell to grow into a larger one.\n\n* **Adaptation and Survival:** Cicadas hide underground as nymphs to stay safe from predators and find food. When they become adults, they move above ground and can fly to find mates and lay eggs.\n\n* **Habitats and Organisms:** Cicadas live in trees where they find shelter and food. The lichen and bark in this photo show that the tree supports many different living things.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nTo build schema before this lesson, bring in photos of other exoskeletons (butterfly chrysalis, snake shed skin, hermit crab shells). Ask: \"What do these have in common?\" This primes students to recognize that many creatures shed or outgrow their coverings—it's not just cicadas! This connects to their prior knowledge about growth.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Provide three ways to experience this content: (1) Visual—show this image and video of cicadas emerging; (2) Tactile—let students carefully handle a real shed cicada shell (if available) or a cast-off toy exoskeleton model; (3) Kinesthetic—have students physically act out the molting process by \"wriggling out\" of a paper bag or tube. This supports diverse learners and multiple intelligences.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 2-LS2-1 *Plan and conduct investigations to provide evidence that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water*\n\n**Relevant DCIs:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS1.B]] *Growth and development of organisms*\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS2.A]] *Interdependent relationships in ecosystems*\n\n**Relevant CCCs:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] (Patterns of change in life cycles)\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Scale, Proportion, and Quantity]] (How big things start small and grow)\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why do you think the cicada had to leave its shell behind?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **What do you think happened to the cicada after it crawled out of this shell?** (Bloom's: Synthesize | DOK: 3)\n\n3. **Look at the lichen on the bark.

Have them draw and label the cicada's life cycle: (1) Egg underground, (2) Nymph drinking from roots, (3) Nymph crawling up tree, (4) Adult cicada flying. Students can color, add labels with your help, and dictate or write one sentence per stage.\n\n2. **Shell Hunt Scavenger Hunt:** Take students outside (weather permitting) to look for other shed skins or shells: snake skins, spider webs, bird feathers, or insect shells. Create a classroom display labeled \"Things Animals Leave Behind\" and discuss why creatures shed or outgrow their coverings.\n\n3. **Sound Investigation:** Play a 10-15 second audio clip of cicada sounds (see resources below). Ask: \"What do you hear? Why do you think cicadas make this sound?\" Discuss that adult cicadas use sound to find mates. This connects the visible shell to the adult cicada's behavior and function.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* by Eric Carle (Great for understanding metamorphosis and life cycles—use this as a comparison to cicadas)\n* *Insects* by Gail Gibbons (Clear illustrations of insect life cycles, including cicadas)\n* *From Tadpole to Frog* by Wendy Pfeffer (Life cycles of other animals; compare to cicadas)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n* **\"Cicada Emerging From Shell\"** (National Geographic Kids)  \n  A 2-3 minute clip showing a real cicada crawling out of its exoskeleton in real-time.

    "thirdgrade": "# Cicada Shell: Life Cycle & Metamorphosis Lesson Guide\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a cicada's shed exoskeleton (outer skin) clinging to tree bark surrounded by lichen. The brown, paper-like shell is hollow and includes the insect's former head, legs, and body covering. The cicada has already left this shell behind and moved on to live as an adult insect in the tree.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** A cicada shedding its exoskeleton during metamorphosis\n\n**Why This Happens (Scientific Explanation):**\nCicadas spend years underground as nymphs (young insects), where they grow larger but stay inside their hard outer skin. Once the nymph is ready to become an adult, it crawls up a tree and molts—splitting its old skin and wiggling out. This process is called **ecdysis**. The insect leaves behind the hollow shell (called an exuviae) and emerges with a soft, new skin underneath that hardens and darkens. This is a form of **incomplete metamorphosis**, where the insect gradually transforms from nymph to adult without a dramatic pupal stage like butterflies experience.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Life Cycles & Growth:** Insects like cicadas go through distinct stages of life. Unlike humans, they must shed their skin to grow because their outer skeleton (exoskeleton) doesn't stretch.\n\n2. **Metamorphosis:** Cicadas undergo incomplete metamorphosis, changing from a smaller, underground-dwelling nymph into a larger adult with wings and the ability to sing and reproduce.\n\n3. **Structural Adaptations:** The hard exoskeleton protects the insect's body, but eventually it becomes too small, requiring the insect to shed it and grow a new one.\n\n4. **Ecosystem Interactions:** The shed shell remains on the tree as evidence of an insect's development and becomes part of the forest ecosystem where it may be used by small creatures or decomposed by microorganisms.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching this concept, consider bringing a live cicada shell (exuviae) to class in a sealed container so students can observe the detailed structure with magnifying glasses. This tangible experience is far more memorable than pictures alone. Have students sketch what they observe, labeling the head, legs, and body segments. This builds observational drawing skills while deepening understanding of insect anatomy.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Provide the lesson in visual (images like this), kinesthetic (students act out molting), and verbal (teacher explanation) formats. Use a life cycle diagram with arrows showing the progression from egg → nymph (underground years) → nymph climbing tree → molting → adult.\n\n**Multiple Means of Engagement:** Allow students to choose how they demonstrate learning—drawing the life cycle, building a model with craft materials, or recording a short video explanation. This honors diverse learning preferences and interests.\n\n**Multiple Means of Expression:** Offer sentence frames for written responses (e.g., \"The cicada shed its skin because ____.\") and allow verbal responses for students who struggle with writing.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n3-LS1-1: Develop models to describe that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but all animals have in common birth, growth, reproduction, and death.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS1.B]]: Growth and Development of Organisms\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS2.A]]: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems (shed shells as part of ecosystem)\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]: Life cycles follow recognizable patterns across different animal species\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]]: The exoskeleton's structure allows it to protect but must be shed to allow growth\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why do you think the cicada had to leave its old skin behind? What would happen if it tried to stay in the same shell?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **Compare the cicada's life cycle to your own growth. How are they the same? How are they different?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **What do you think happens to this empty shell after the cicada leaves? Where does it go?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **If you found ten of these shells on different trees during the summer, what could you infer about how many cicadas live in that area?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Exoskeleton:** A hard, protective outer covering that insects wear on the outside of their bodies instead of bones inside like humans have.\n\n* **Molt (or Molting):** When an animal sheds or gets rid of its old outer skin or shell so it can grow bigger.\n\n* **Nymph:** A young insect that looks a little like the adult but is smaller and sometimes lives in a different place (like underground for cicadas).\n\n* **Metamorphosis:** A big change in how an animal looks and where it lives as it grows from baby to adult.\n\n* **Exuviae:** The name for the empty shell or skin that an insect leaves behind after it molts (you can say \"exu-VY-ee\").\n\n* **Lichen:** Tiny living things that grow on rocks and tree bark; they look fuzzy or crusty and often have green, gray, or orange colors.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cicada Life Cycle Model:** Provide students with clay, craft supplies, or a paper-folding template to create a 4-stage life cycle model (egg, nymph in soil, nymph on tree, adult). Students can photograph or draw each stage and arrange them in order, then present to a partner.\n\n2. **Molting Simulation:** Have students create a \"body outline\" on craft paper and cover it with tape (exoskeleton). Challenge them to carefully remove the tape without tearing it, representing the molting process. Discuss why it needs to be gentle and what happens to the insect's skin during this time.\n\n3. **Shed Shell Investigation:** If available, take students on a short nature walk around the school to search for cicada shells on trees, logs, or buildings. Collect shells carefully and observe them with magnifying glasses, recording observations in a science journal. Create a class chart showing where shells were found and why cicadas might choose those locations.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Cicadas* by Jody Jensen Shaffer (Learn About Animals series)\n- *The Cicada: Insect Born in the Sun* by Gianna Marino (informational picture book)\n- *Life Cycles* by Darlene R.

Pair this lesson with actual cicada listening if your region has cicadas—the connection between the visual evidence (shed skin) and the auditory experience (cicada songs) creates a multi-sensory learning moment that Third Graders find deeply engaging.",
    "fourthgrade": "# Fourth Grade Life Science Lesson: Cicada Exoskeletons\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a brown, papery shell clinging to tree bark surrounded by light-colored lichen. The shell is hollow and looks like the outline of an insect with visible legs, wings, and head. This empty shell was left behind when a cicada grew too big for its outer skin and shed it to become an adult.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Exoskeleton shedding (ecdysis) during insect metamorphosis\n\nThis image captures evidence of **incomplete metamorphosis**, where cicadas must shed their rigid exoskeletons multiple times as they grow. Unlike human skin that stretches, insect exoskeletons are hard and cannot expand. When a cicada nymph grows too large for its exoskeleton, it splits the shell open and crawls out, leaving behind this papery \"ghost skin.\" The cicada may do this 4-5 times before becoming a winged adult. This is a visible, tangible example of how organisms change and grow over time—a fundamental life science concept.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Life Cycles:** Insects go through predictable stages of growth and change called metamorphosis. Cicadas have an incomplete life cycle with egg, nymph, and adult stages.\n\n* **Adaptations:** The exoskeleton is a protective outer covering that helps insects survive, but it must be shed periodically to allow growth.\n\n* **Observable Evidence of Change:** Shed exoskeletons are physical proof that organisms grow and transform—students can find and study these remains to understand life processes.\n\n* **Interaction with Environment:** Cicadas live in trees and use them as habitat. The lichen visible here shows how multiple organisms share the same living space.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nConsider taking students on a \"nature walk exoskeleton hunt\" in late spring/early summer near trees or shrubs. When students discover shells themselves, ownership and engagement increase dramatically. Take photos and create a class display to revisit throughout the year. This makes the abstract concept of \"growth\" concrete and observable.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Representation:** Provide labeled diagrams showing what the inside of a cicada looks like so students can compare the empty shell to the living insect. Include videos of the actual shedding process for students who benefit from motion and sequential visual learning.\n\n**Action & Expression:** Allow students to choose how they demonstrate learning—through drawing, building a model with craft materials, creating a comic strip sequence, or verbal explanation to a peer.\n\n**Engagement:** Connect to student curiosity by asking \"What animal skin can you shed?\" (snakes, hermit crabs) to broaden the concept beyond insects.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n4-LS1-1: Use evidence to construct an explanation that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water. *(Note: Also connects to general growth/life cycle understanding)*\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n* [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS1.B]] Growth and Development of Organisms\n* [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS2.C]] Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience (organisms and habitats)\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] (The pattern of shedding occurs repeatedly)\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Change and Stability]] (Physical structures change as organisms grow)\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] (The exoskeleton provides protection but limits growth)\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why do you think the cicada left this shell behind instead of keeping it on its body?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **If you could compare this empty shell to a living cicada, what differences would you notice?

Create a labeled display with hand-drawn diagrams showing which insect left each shell and why. Students can measure shells and estimate how much bigger the insect grew.\n\n2. **Model the Molt:** Provide each student with a small paper bag, markers, and craft materials to create a \"before and after\" model. Have them draw an insect on the outside of the bag, then decorate the inside to show what the insect looks like after molting. Students can present their models and explain why insects must molt to grow.\n\n3. **Life Cycle Sequencing Timeline:** Display large pictures or have students draw the cicada life cycle stages (egg → nymph → more nymphs → adult). Include the exoskeleton shedding at each stage. Create a classroom timeline on a hallway wall showing that cicadas can spend 2-17 years underground as nymphs before emerging as adults.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *Cicadas: The Largest Bugs on Earth* by Lorijo Metz (Illustrated nonfiction, Grade 2-4 level)\n* *The Life Cycle of a Cicada* by Rebecca Stefoff (Clear diagrams and accessible text)\n* *Are You a Butterfly?* by Judy Allen and Tudor Humphries (Metamorphosis concept for younger learners)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n* **\"Cicada Molt Time-Lapse\"** - National Geographic Kids (~3 minutes, shows actual shedding process)  \n  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cicada+molt+timelapse+national+geographic\n\n* **\"The Life Cycle of a Cicada\"** - Crash Course Kids (~5 minutes, age-appropriate explanation of stages)  \n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6Uz3Hwyv0A\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Note:** This lesson bridges observational learning with life science standards by making an abstract concept—growth and metamorphosis—visible and tangible.

    "fifthgrade": "# 🦗 Fifth Grade Science Lesson: Cicada Life Cycles\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\nThis image shows an empty brown shell, called an exoskeleton, that a cicada left behind on tree bark covered with colorful lichen. The shell still has the same shape as the cicada's body, including its legs and wings, but the cicada itself has crawled out and moved on. Around the shell, you can see patches of green and gray lichen growing on the bark.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\nThis photograph captures **exoskeleton shedding (ecdysis)**, a critical stage in the cicada's metamorphic life cycle. Cicadas spend most of their lives (2-17 years, depending on species) underground as nymphs. When conditions are right, they emerge, climb to vegetation, and their exoskeleton splits open along the back. The adult cicada pulls itself out and leaves behind this hollow shell. This happens because cicadas have hard, rigid outer skeletons that don't grow—they must shed these shells multiple times to reach adult size, and finally, to reveal their adult wings and body.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Incomplete Metamorphosis & Life Cycles**\n   - Cicadas undergo incomplete metamorphosis with distinct life stages: egg, nymph, and adult\n   - Each stage has different appearances, habitats, and behaviors\n   - The nymph stage is the longest phase of the cicada's life\n\n2. **Adaptation & Structure Function**\n   - Exoskeletons are rigid outer coverings that protect soft body parts inside\n   - As cicadas grow, they must shed their exoskeletons periodically to allow growth\n   - The shedding process reveals wings and body structures adapted for adult survival (flight, reproduction, feeding)\n\n3. **Organism & Environment Interactions**\n   - Cicadas spend years underground in soil, feeding on plant roots\n   - Environmental triggers (temperature, moisture, seasonal changes) signal when it's time to emerge\n   - They must find safe places on trees to complete their transformation\n\n4. **Observable Evidence of Living Processes**\n   - Empty exoskeletons are evidence that an organism has grown and changed\n   - Finding these shells helps scientists study cicada populations and timing\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nRather than lecturing about cicada metamorphosis, bring in actual cicada shells (if available) or high-quality photos and ask students to observe first. Let them describe what they see—Is it empty? Does it have legs? Where would the insect's body have been?—before introducing the vocabulary. This observation-first approach builds genuine curiosity and makes the science stick.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Representation:** Provide visual models showing the stages of cicada life (diagrams, animations, or physical models). Include written descriptions alongside images. Consider showing a time-lapse video of a cicada actually shedding its skin to make the process concrete.\n\n**Multiple Means of Action & Expression:** Allow students to demonstrate understanding by drawing the life cycle, creating a physical model with craft materials, or building a life cycle wheel they can manipulate. Some students may prefer verbal explanations or writing, while others benefit from hands-on creation.\n\n**Multiple Means of Engagement:** Connect to student interests by asking, \"Have you ever heard cicadas buzzing in summer?\" or \"Why might an animal need to shed its skin?\" This makes the science personally relevant.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n5-LS1-1: Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.\n(Note: While this PE focuses on plants, cicada life cycles integrate with ecosystems and organism growth—see DCIs below)\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS1.A]] *Structures and Functions:* Exoskeletons and body parts have specific functions for survival\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS1.B]] *Growth and Development of Organisms:* Cicadas undergo metamorphosis in distinct life stages\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS2.A]] *Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems:* Cicadas interact with soil, plants, and trees throughout their life cycle\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] *Life Cycle Patterns:* Cicadas follow predictable patterns of growth, emergence, and reproduction\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] *The exoskeleton's rigid structure protects the insect, but must be shed for growth*\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] *Shedding occurs because the rigid exoskeleton cannot expand; environmental signals trigger emergence*\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **\"Why do you think the cicada had to leave its old shell behind instead of growing bigger while still wearing it?\"** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **\"If we found 100 of these empty shells at the base of one tree in July, what might that tell us about what happened there?\"** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n3. **\"How is a cicada shedding its exoskeleton similar to you outgrowing your clothes? How is it different?\"** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **\"Underground, cicada nymphs look very different from adults. Why might it be helpful for cicadas to look so different at each stage of their life?\"** (Bloom's: Synthesize | DOK: 4)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Exoskeleton:** A hard, stiff outer shell that covers and protects an insect's soft body (like armor made of chitin).\n* **Ecdysis (or molting/shedding):** The process when an insect splits open its old exoskeleton and crawls out to reveal a new, bigger one underneath.\n* **Nymph:** The young form of an insect that looks somewhat like the adult but is smaller and doesn't have wings yet.\n* **Metamorphosis:** A big change in an organism's body shape and form as it grows from a baby to an adult.\n* **Lichen:** A living thing made of a fungus and algae growing together; often seen as colorful patches on rocks and tree bark.\n* **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an organism survive and thrive in its environment.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cicada Life Cycle Model Creation**\n   - Provide students with craft materials (paper, clay, yarn, markers) and ask them to create a 3D or 2D model showing all stages of the cicada life cycle: egg, underground nymph (multiple instars), emerging nymph, and winged adult. Display models and have students explain each stage to peers. This builds understanding through tactile, visual, and verbal modalities.\n\n2. **\"Detective Investigation: What Can We Learn From an Empty Shell?\"**\n   - If you can obtain cicada shells, give students hand lenses and observation sheets. Ask them to examine the shell's structure carefully: How many legs does it have? Can you see where the wings were? Is there an opening where the insect crawled out? Students can sketch their observations and record 3-5 facts they discover. Connect findings to adaptations and structure-function relationships.\n\n3. **Emergence Timeline & Local Research**\n   - Partner with your school librarian or use online resources (Project Cicada, University extension databases) to research when cicadas emerge in your region. Create a classroom timeline showing cicada emergence dates over several years. Discuss: Why do you think the dates vary? What environmental factors might affect timing? Students can track local cicadas during actual emergence season and report findings (with adult supervision and safety protocols).\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Cicadas: Mysterious Life Cycles* by Joan Marie Galat (National Geographic Little Kids) – Picture book explaining cicada life stages with vibrant illustrations\n- *The Insect That Hides Inside a Tree* by Monica Wellington – Narrative picture book following one cicada's journey\n- *Insects* by Gail Gibbons – Comprehensive guide including detailed cicada information and diagrams\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"Cicada Emerging from Its Shell\" (National Geographic Kids)** – A 3-4 minute time-lapse showing a real cicada shedding its exoskeleton; visually stunning and age-appropriate  \n  URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcDpLLpCKYo (Search National Geographic Kids Cicada Emergence for current links)\n\n- **\"The Cicada Life Cycle Explained\" (Amoeba Sisters)** – An animated 5-minute explainer breaking down each life stage in kid-friendly language  \n  URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6o8uTULrEU (Search Amoeba Sisters Cicada for current links)\n\n---\n\n**Teaching Tip:** This lesson works best in late spring or early summer when cicada emergence is actually occurring in your region.
