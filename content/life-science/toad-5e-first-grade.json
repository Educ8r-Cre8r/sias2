How Bodies Help Animals Survive**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90–120 minutes across two 45–60 minute sessions (or five 20-minute segments)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 1-LS1-1: Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs\n  - 1-LS3-1: Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that young plants and animals are like, but not exactly like, their parents\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Identify** at least three external body parts of a toad and explain what each part helps the toad do\n2. **Describe** how a toad's bumpy skin, eyes, and legs help it survive in its habitat\n3. **Design** a simple solution to a human problem by copying how a toad uses its body parts\n4. **Explain** how a baby toad (tadpole) is like and different from a grown-up toad\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest in toad body parts and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the toad (large, clear, from the photograph provided)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster (A3 size minimum) so all students can see the toad clearly. Place it at students' eye level or project it on a board.\n\n2. **Introduce with intrigue:** \"Look carefully at this animal! It's a toad. Today we're detectives learning about the toad's superpower body parts.\"\n\n3. **Ask these guided discussion questions** (allow 30 seconds thinking time after each):\n   - \"What do you notice about this toad? What body parts can you see?\" *(Students may say: bumpy skin, big eyes, legs, bumpy back)*\n   - \"Why do you think a toad has such big, round eyes?\" *(Guide toward: to see food, to see danger)*\n   - \"What would happen if a toad didn't have strong back legs?\" *(Lead to: couldn't jump away from danger, couldn't move)*\n   - \"If you were a toad, which body part would be your superpower and why?\" *(Encourage creative thinking)*\n\n4. **Create a \"Wonder Wall\":** Write down 2–3 student questions on chart paper (e.g., \"Why is the toad bumpy?\" \"Can the toad jump really far?\"). Tell students, \"We're going to find answers!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's explore and discover how each body part helps the toad survive!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how toad body parts help it survive through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large paper (one per pair/small group)\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Pre-drawn outline of a toad (simple, about 6 inches tall) — print one per pair or group, OR have students trace a toad template\n- Real toads or toad photos (optional: close-up images on tablets/printed cards showing: bumpy skin, eyes, legs, mouth)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (optional but recommended)\n- Picture cards showing: toad eating an insect, toad jumping, toad hiding in soil\n- Tape\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Assign students to pairs or small groups of 3.** Give each group a large paper with a toad outline drawn on it (or they can trace one using a template).\n\n2. **Explain the task:** \"Your job is to be toad scientists. You'll look very carefully at the toad picture and label what each body part does to help the toad survive.\"\n\n3. **Point out the photograph again.** Say: \"Notice the toad's bumpy skin, its big eyes, its back legs, and its mouth. Let's investigate!\"\n\n4. **Provide close-up images or the magnified photograph.** Have students examine the toad using hand lenses (if available) and point to:\n   - The bumpy, bumpy skin\n   - The large, round eyes\n   - The short front legs\n   - The big, muscular back legs\n   - The small mouth\n\n5. **Ask guiding questions while students explore:**\n   - \"What does this body part look like? What texture is it?\"\n   - \"How might the toad use this part to find food or stay safe?\"\n\n6. **Show picture cards** of a toad eating, jumping, and hiding. Say: \"Here's what toads DO with their body parts. Match the picture to the body part!\"\n\n7. **Students record on their toad diagram:** Using words, labels, or simple drawings, students write or draw **what each body part does.** For example:\n   - Bumpy skin = *helps hide / keeps toad safe*\n   - Big eyes = *sees bugs to eat*\n   - Back legs = *jumps away from danger*\n   - Small mouth = *eats insects*\n\n8. **Circulate and encourage description:** Ask, \"How does this help the toad stay alive?\" Prompt students to say it back to you.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Listen to student ideas without correcting—write them down\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What else do you notice?\" \"How might that help?\"\n- Guide observations with specific prompts: \"Let's look at those bumpy parts. What are they for?\"\n- Document student thinking to share in the Explain phase\n- Do NOT provide answers; help students wonder and think\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will identify at least 2–3 toad body parts on the diagram\n- Students will create simple labels or drawings showing *what* each part does\n- Students will use words like \"jumps,\" \"sees,\" \"eats,\" \"hides\" to describe function\n- Diagrams should show some evidence of observation (e.g., bumpy lines on skin, big circles for eyes)\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to how toad body parts help survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student toad diagrams from Explore phase\n- Chart paper with toad body parts labeled\n- The original photograph (projected or displayed)\n- Picture cards of tadpoles vs. adult toads (printed or digital)\n- Word cards with vocabulary (printed, large enough to see)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share student discoveries:** Invite 2–3 groups to show their toad diagrams and explain one body part they labeled. Ask: \"What did this body part help the toad do?\" Affirm all observations, even if incomplete.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with First Grade-friendly definitions:**\n\n   - **External parts:** The body parts on the *outside* of the animal (like skin, eyes, legs, mouth). *\"External means outside!\"*\n   \n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or way an animal acts that helps it survive in its home. *\"An adaptation is like a superpower that helps an animal live!\"*\n   \n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives (like dirt, water, or grass). *\"A habitat is an animal's home.\"*\n   \n   - **Tadpole:** A baby toad that lives in water and looks like a tiny fish with a tail. *\"A tadpole is what a baby toad looks like!\"*\n   \n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy. *\"Toads survive by finding food and staying safe.\"*\n\n3. **Reconnect to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the toad's bumpy skin: \"This bumpy skin is an **adaptation**. It helps the toad hide in dirt and stay safe. That's surviving!\"\n   - Point to the eyes: \"These big eyes are an **adaptation**. They help the toad **see** bugs to eat!\"\n   - Point to the back legs: \"These strong back legs are an **adaptation**. They help the toad **jump** away from danger!\"\n\n4. **Show tadpole vs. toad pictures:** \"Here's something cool! A baby toad is called a **tadpole**. It looks *very* different from a grown-up toad, but it's the same animal! The tadpole has a tail and no back legs yet. The grown-up toad has no tail and strong back legs. They're alike, but NOT exactly the same!\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Point to a body part on the photograph and ask: \"What does this help the toad do?\"\n   - Show a picture of a tadpole and ask: \"Is this a toad or something different?\" Wait for response. \"It's a *baby* toad called a tadpole. How is it different from the grown-up toad?\"\n   - Ask one student: \"What's an adaptation?\" Listen for reference to body parts that help survival.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (Display on anchor chart):**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **External Parts** | Body parts on the outside of an animal (skin, eyes, legs, mouth) |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part that helps an animal survive |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives |\n| **Tadpole** | A baby toad that lives in water (looks like a tiny fish) |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can point to a toad body part and name it\n- Students can say in simple words how at least one body part helps the toad (e.g., \"The eyes see bugs,\" \"The legs jump\")\n- Students understand that a tadpole is a baby toad, but looks different\n- Students use vocabulary in responses (even if imperfectly)\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by designing a human solution inspired by how toads use their body parts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- A real-world problem scenario (printed or described; see below)\n- Paper (8.5\" × 11\" or A4)\n- Crayons, markers, colored pencils\n- Craft materials: popsicle sticks, clay, tape, pipe cleaners (optional, for 3D designs)\n- Picture reference: the toad photograph + close-up of toad skin, legs, eyes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Present the Design Challenge:** \n\nShow this scenario: *\"Imagine a child gets dirt in her eyes while playing outside. She blinks and blinks, but it's hard to see. A toad has something special that helps it with its eyes. Look at the toad's bumpy eyelids! They help protect the toad's eyes. Can YOU design something that helps people protect their eyes like a toad does?\"*\n\n**Step-by-step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Review the toad:** \"Look at the toad's eyes and skin again. What protects them?\"\n\n2. **Explain the task:** \"You're going to **copy** how the toad's body works to solve a human problem. Draw or build something that protects eyes from dirt—just like the toad's bumpy eyelids protect its eyes!\"\n\n3. **Student design options:**\n   - **Draw** a picture of protective goggles or eye covers inspired by a toad's bumpy eyelids\n   - **Build** a simple visor or eye shield using paper, popsicle sticks, or craft materials\n   - **Label** their design: *\"My toad-inspired eye protector has bumpy parts like a toad's eyelids\"*\n\n4. **Guide with questions:**\n   - \"What part of the toad are you copying?\" (Answer: bumpy skin / eyelids)\n   - \"How does it work on the toad?\" (Answer: protects / keeps safe)\n   - \"How will your design work for people?\" (Answer: will protect eyes from dirt)\n\n5. **Have students present:** Each student/pair shows their design and explains: *\"I copied the toad's _____ to make a _____ that helps people _____.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the design process without creating the design yourself\n- Ask: \"Why did you choose that body part?\" and \"How does that help?\"\n- Celebrate creative thinking: \"That's a clever way to copy the toad!\"\n- Encourage sketching/planning before building\n- Allow time for iteration: \"Do you want to change your design?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a simple design (drawing or 3D model) inspired by a toad body part\n- Students can explain which toad body part they copied and why\n- Students connect their design to solving a human problem\n- Designs show evidence of mimicking a specific adaptation\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of toad body parts, adaptations, and how young and adult toads are alike and different.\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Are students identifying body parts and describing function?\n- **Listen during Explain:** Do students use new vocabulary when talking about the toad?\n- **Observe during Elaborate:** Can students connect a toad body part to a human solution?\n- **Check-ins:** Ask individual students: \"Show me the toad's eyes. What do they do?\" Listen for a functional response.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\n**Choose ONE option based on student ability:**\n\n**Option A: Picture-Based (for all students)**\nShow a drawing or photo of a toad. Ask students to:\n1. **Point and name:** Point to three body parts of the toad\n2. **Say what it does:** \"What does this body part help the toad do?\"\n3. **Record:** Draw a line from the body part to a simple picture card showing its function (e.g., big eye → picture of bug, back leg → picture of jump)\n\n**Option B: Verbal Exit Ticket (teacher-led, small group or one-on-one)**\nAsk these questions; record student responses:\n1. \"What are three body parts of a toad?\" *(Success: names at least 2—eyes, legs, skin, mouth)*\n2. \"How does a bumpy/strong/big [body part] help the toad survive?\" *(Success: gives one reason—hides, jumps, sees, eats)*\n3. \"What's a baby toad called? How is it different from a grown-up toad?\" *(Success: says \"tadpole\" and mentions tail or legs are different)*\n\n**Option C: Draw and Label (for all students)**\nProvide a blank toad outline. Students:\n1. Draw or label **2–3 body parts**\n2. Write or draw **what each part does** (e.g., bumpy skin = hide, big eyes = see bugs)\n3. **Success criterion:** At least two body parts labeled with a function\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Success Indicators |\n|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Identify body parts and function** | Student names ≥2 toad body parts and says what each one does (e.g., \"Eyes see,\" \"Legs jump\") |\n| **Describe how body parts help survival** | Student uses word \"help\" or \"survive\" and connects a body part to staying safe or finding food |\n| **Design a solution inspired by toad adaptations** | Student's design copies a real toad body part and solves a human problem (shown in drawing, model, or explanation) |\n| **Explain young vs. adult toads** | Student says baby toad is called \"tadpole,\" mentions one difference (no tail, different shape, no legs), and understands they're the same animal |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify and name 2–3 toad body parts\n- 75% of students can explain how at least one body part helps the toad survive\n- 70% of students can create a design inspired by a toad adaptation\n- 65% of students can explain the difference between a tadpole and adult toad\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary** the day before using picture cards only—no definitions. Show: bumpy skin, big eyes, strong legs. Ask: \"What do you see?\" Build familiarity before formal instruction.\n\n2. **Reduce choices during Explore:** Instead of a blank toad diagram, provide a toad with body parts already outlined and labeled (bumpy skin, eyes, legs, mouth). Students only need to draw or write *what each part does* (not identify parts).\n\n3. **Pair with a strong peer or adult** during the design challenge (Elaborate). Provide a *template* showing how one toad body part (e.g., bumpy skin) could inspire a human tool. Student colors or completes the template rather than starting from scratch.\n\n4. **Simplify exit ticket:** Use a 2-choice picture card format. Point to the toad's eyes and ask: \"Do these help the toad *see* or *jump*?\" Student points to the correct answer. Do this for 2–3 body parts.\n\n5. **Provide a visual checklist** on the Explore handout:\n   - ☐ Bumpy skin (protects/hides)\n   - ☐ Big eyes (sees food)\n   - ☐ Strong legs (jumps)\n   \n   Students check off each one as they find it.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Investigate the life cycle:** Provide pictures showing tadpole → tadpole with back legs → tadpole with front legs → young toad → adult toad. Students sequence them and write 1–2 sentences about what changes at each stage. Connect to 1-LS3-1 (young and adult are alike but not exactly the same).\n\n2. **Compare adaptations across animals:** Show pictures of a toad, frog, and another amphibian (newt, salamander). Ask: \"What body parts are the same? What's different? Why?\" Students create a Venn diagram or comparison chart.\n\n3. **Design two solutions:** In the Elaborate phase, challenge students to design *two* different tools inspired by two different toad body parts (e.g., bumpy skin for eye protection AND strong legs for a jumping toy/game).\n\n4. **Create a \"Toad Adaptation Guide\":** Students write or dictate a simple instruction manual: *\"How to Use a Toad's Bumpy Skin to Stay Safe.\"* Include a drawing and steps.\n\n5. **Problem-solve in reverse:** Show a human tool (e.g., goggles, hiking boot, water-resistant jacket) and ask: \"What toad body part might this copy?\" Guide them to think about which animal adaptation inspired it.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Metamorphosis in a Bottle:** Create a simple observation tank with tadpoles (if available and appropriate for your school) or use a series of photographs/videos showing tadpole-to-toad transformation. Students observe/watch over weeks and record changes with drawings and labels. (Connects to 1-LS3-1: young and adults are alike but not exactly the same)\n\n2. **Habitat Hunt:** Create a classroom \"toad habitat\" in a large bin or terrarium with soil, moss, hide spots, and small plants. (Do NOT put live toads in without proper care training.) Students draw or photograph the habitat and label things toads need: *food (insects), water, hiding spots, soil.* Discuss: \"Why do toads need these things to survive?\" (Connects to LS1-1: meeting animal needs)\n\n3. **Design a Toad Survival Game:** Students create a simple board game or movement game where players take on the role of a toad. Include challenges like \"Find a bug with your big eyes—move 2 spaces!\" or \"Jump away from danger on your strong legs—jump 3 squares!\" Reinforces how body parts help toads survive.\n\n4. **Read-Aloud Connection:** Share a picture book about frogs/toads (e.g., *From Tadpole to Frog* by Gail Gibbons, *Frog* by Jenni Desmond, or similar). Pause to discuss how the pictures show toad body parts and what they do.\n\n5. **Sensory Comparison:** Bring in safe tactile items that feel like toad skin (sandpaper, textured fabric, bumpy rubber ball). Have students touch and describe. Ask: \"How is this like a toad's bumpy skin? Why might bumps help?\" (Kinesthetic learner support)\n\n6. **Toad Facts Display:** Students illustrate one fact about toads (e.g., *\"Toads have bumpy skin to hide,\"* *\"Tadpoles have tails but toads don't,\"* *\"Toads eat bugs\"*). Create a classroom bulletin board: \"Toad Facts Wall\" with student illustrations and captions.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Notes & Tips\n\n- **Photograph use:** The toad photograph is central to all five phases. Return to it frequently in Engage, Explain, and Evaluate. Laminate a color copy so students can point and trace body parts.\n- **Safety with live animals:** If using live toads, consult your school's policy. Check that handling is appropriate and that toads are released safely. Hand-washing after contact is essential.\n- **Accessibility:** Describe the photograph in detail for students with visual impairments. Consider providing tactile models (clay toad) for exploration.\n- **Pacing:** This lesson spans 90–120 minutes. You may split it across two days: Day 1 (Engage + Explore), Day 2 (Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate).\n- **Standards alignment:** Both NGSS standards (1-LS1-1 and 1-LS3-1) are woven throughout; Elaborate specifically addresses 1-LS1-1 (mimicking animal body parts to solve human problems).\n\n---\n\n**You're ready to teach! This lesson builds from observation through application, honoring the curiosity of first graders while grounding them in science practice and standards.**",
