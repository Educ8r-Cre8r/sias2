Exploring Decomposition and Nutrient Cycles\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 50-minute sessions (or three 35-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** 5-LS2-1 (Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment)\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Explain that when an animal dies, its body breaks down and the materials return to the environment.\n2. Identify decomposers (bacteria, fungi) as organisms that break down dead matter and recycle nutrients.\n3. Create a labeled diagram showing how matter moves from a dead organism back into soil and to living plants.\n4. Predict what would happen to an ecosystem if decomposers were not present.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about what happens to living things after they die.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital photograph of the deceased deer (projected or displayed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: images of other dead organisms (fallen leaves, dead fish, etc.)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Allow students to observe silently for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions in sequence** (wait for responses after each):\n   - \"What do you notice in this photograph? What do you think happened to this animal?\"\n   - \"If this animal were to stay in this spot for many months, what do you think would happen to its body?\"\n   - \"Where do you think all the materials from this animal's body would go?\" (Possible responses: soil, plants, air, bugs)\n   - \"Have you ever seen a dead leaf on the ground disappear over time? What happened to it?\"\n\n3. **Record student predictions** on chart paper under \"What We Think Will Happen to the Deer's Body.\" Do not correct or confirm yet.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder: what tiny living things might be involved in breaking down this animal's body? Could those little organisms be helpful to the forest?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Over the next two days, we're going to investigate what really happens when living things die and how their materials get recycled back into nature.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposition through observation of a hands-on model.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- 1 clear plastic sandwich bag or small jar with lid\n- Moist soil (enough to fill bag 1/3 full) — pre-collected and stored\n- 1 dead leaf, small piece of apple, or small dead insect (can use already-dead materials from nature collection box)\n- Paper towel or thin cloth\n- Masking tape and permanent marker\n- Observation sheet (template provided below)\n- Hand lens or magnifying glass\n- Digital camera or phone to photograph initial state\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Set up your decomposition model:**\n   - Place moist soil in your bag, filling it about 1/3 full.\n   - Gently place your dead organism (leaf, apple piece, or insect) on top of the soil.\n   - If using a bag: press out excess air gently and seal it. If using a jar: cover loosely with a cloth or leave lid slightly ajar for air circulation.\n   - Label your bag with your names and today's date using masking tape and marker.\n\n2. **Make initial observations (Day 1):**\n   - Use a hand lens to examine the organism closely. Draw or photograph exactly what it looks like.\n   - On your observation sheet, sketch the organism and describe:\n     - Color (brown, green, etc.)\n     - Texture (smooth, rough, hard, etc.)\n     - Any visible damage or changes\n   - Write: \"What I notice about my organism today\"\n\n3. **Predict and record:**\n   - On your observation sheet, complete this sentence: \"I predict that in one week, my organism will look like _______________ because _______________.\"\n\n4. **Store your model** in a designated classroom location (not in direct sunlight, moderately warm).\n\n5. **Plan observation schedule:**\n   - Students will observe and record observations on Days 3, 5, and 7 (or every 2-3 days depending on your session structure).\n   - Each observation should include: sketches, written descriptions, answers to \"What has changed?\" and \"What do I see that might be decomposers?\" (students may see mold, fungi, or color changes).\n\n**Observation Sheet Template:**\n\n```\nDecomposition Investigation Log\nNames: __________________ Date Started: __________\n\nINITIAL OBSERVATION (Day 1):\nDraw your organism:\n[space for drawing]\n\nDescribe it:\n- Color: ___________________________\n- Texture: __________________________\n- Anything else I notice: ___________________\n\nMy prediction: ________________________________\n\nOBSERVATION 2 (Day ___):\nDraw what it looks like now:\n[space for drawing]\n\nWhat has changed? ______________________________\nDo I see anything that might be decomposers (fuzzy growth, mold)? Yes / No\nWhere? _________________________________________\n\nOBSERVATION 3 (Day ___):\n[Same format as Observation 2]\n\nOBSERVATION 4 (Day ___):\n[Same format as Observation 2]\n```\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice that's different from yesterday?\" \"Why do you think that change happened?\" \"What do you think might be eating or breaking down your organism?\"\n- Do NOT say \"That's mold\" or \"Bacteria is breaking it down.\" Let students observe and wonder.\n- Encourage use of hand lenses and careful sketching.\n- Manage storage and ensure bags/jars remain in appropriate conditions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe visible changes in the dead organism (darkening, softening, appearance of mold/fungi, breakdown).\n- Students will document observations through sketches and written descriptions.\n- Students will generate questions about what is causing the changes (e.g., \"What is that fuzzy white stuff?\" \"Why is it getting darker?\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts of decomposition and decomposers based on their observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with the cycle diagram (teacher-prepared)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n- Optional: close-up images of decomposers (mold under microscope, fungi, bacteria illustrations) from a science website or textbook\n- Vocabulary cards or word wall space\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 student groups to share one observation they made: \"What surprised you? What changed?\"\n   - Record key observations on chart paper:\n     - Organism got darker/softer\n     - Fuzzy white/green growth appeared\n     - Organism is breaking apart\n     - It smells different\n   \n2. **Introduce and explain decomposition (8 minutes):**\n\n   Use this teacher-friendly language:\n\n   *\"Great observations, scientists! You watched something amazing happen. When a living thing dies, special organisms start breaking it down. These tiny living things are called **decomposers**. They are so small you usually can't see them without a microscope, but some you CAN see—like the fuzzy white or green stuff you drew in your models. That's mold or fungi! These decomposers eat the dead organism slowly, breaking it into smaller and smaller pieces. This process is called **decomposition.**\n   \n   Here's the really cool part: when decomposers break down dead things, they turn them into **nutrients**—special materials that go into the soil. Plants can then use those nutrients to grow! So a dead leaf or animal doesn't disappear. It gets recycled. The **matter** (all the stuff that made up that organism) doesn't vanish. It moves from the dead organism into the soil, then into plants, then into animals that eat those plants. It keeps moving in a cycle. Nothing is wasted in nature!\"*\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary (5 minutes):**\n\n   Display and define these terms using the photograph and student observations:\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|\n   | **Decomposer** | A tiny living thing (like bacteria or fungi) that breaks down dead organisms and helps recycle their materials back into nature. Mold is a type of decomposer you can see! |\n   | **Decomposition** | The process of breaking down. When decomposers eat dead organisms and break them into smaller pieces. |\n   | **Nutrient** | Special materials that living things need to grow, like nitrogen and carbon. Decomposers turn dead matter into nutrients. |\n   | **Matter** | All the \"stuff\" that makes up living and nonliving things. It doesn't disappear—it changes form and cycles through the environment. |\n   | **Recycle (in nature)** | When something is used again in a new way. Decomposers recycle dead matter so it can become part of new living things. |\n\n4. **Draw the cycle together (5 minutes):**\n\n   On chart paper, co-create a simple cycle diagram with student input:\n\n   ```\n   LIVING DEER\n       ↓\n   DEER DIES (photograph shows this)\n       ↓\n   DECOMPOSERS BREAK IT DOWN\n   (bacteria, fungi, insects)\n       ↓\n   NUTRIENTS GO INTO SOIL\n       ↓\n   PLANTS USE SOIL NUTRIENTS TO GROW\n       ↓\n   NEW ANIMALS EAT PLANTS\n       ↓\n   CYCLE CONTINUES\n   ```\n\n   Label the deer photograph at the \"Deer Dies\" step. Point to the Explore models and say: \"This is what's happening in your bags—we're watching decomposition in action!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Turn to your partner and explain: What is a decomposer, and why are they important?\"\n   - Listen for: Something eats dead things, breaks them down, puts nutrients in soil, helps plants grow.\n   - Ask: \"If there were NO decomposers on Earth, what would happen?\" (Guide toward: Dead things would pile up, no nutrients would return to soil, plants couldn't grow, food chain would break.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define decomposer, decomposition, and nutrient in their own words.\n- Students understand that matter is recycled, not destroyed.\n- Students recognize their Explore models as examples of decomposition in progress.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to new scenarios and deepen understanding of matter cycling in ecosystems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Option A (Food Chain Extension):** Picture cards of organisms, arrows, string/yarn, whiteboard/poster board\n- **Option B (Ecosystem Scenario Cards):** Printed scenario cards (see below)\n- **Option C (Decomposition Prediction):** Dead organism prediction worksheet\n- Index cards, colored pencils, glue sticks\n\n**Activity:** Choose one option based on class needs.\n\n---\n\n**OPTION A: Building a Complete Food Web with Decomposers**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge:** \"Now that we know decomposers recycle nutrients, let's map out how ALL the matter moves in an ecosystem—not just the living-to-dead part.\"\n\n2. **Provide organism picture cards:** Include: deer (like in photo), plant/grass, decomposer (shown as mold/bacteria image), human hunter, predator (wolf or hawk).\n\n3. **Student task:**\n   - Arrange cards on poster board to show a food chain.\n   - Use arrows to show energy/matter flow.\n   - **Critical step:** Explicitly add decomposer arrows going FROM every organism back TO soil/plants.\n   - Label one arrow: \"When this organism dies, decomposers break it down and return nutrients to soil.\"\n\n4. **Class discussion:**\n   - Why is the decomposer connected to EVERY organism, not just the dead deer?\n   - (Answer: All organisms eventually die and get decomposed.)\n\n5. **Student product:** A labeled food web poster or diagram showing the deer from the photo and how its matter recycles.\n\n---\n\n**OPTION B: Ecosystem Scenario Reasoning**\n\nProvide 3 printed scenario cards. Students work in pairs. For each scenario, they answer: \"What would happen and why?\"\n\n**Scenario Card 1:**\n> *A forest has lots of trees, deer, and fungi/decomposers. But one year, a disease kills all the fungi. What would happen to the forest over time? Explain using what you know about decomposers.*\n\n*Expected answer: Dead organisms wouldn't break down, nutrients wouldn't return to soil, plants wouldn't have nutrients to grow, deer wouldn't have food, and the forest would become unhealthy.*\n\n**Scenario Card 2:**\n> *A farmer wants to grow corn. Every year, he plants corn in the same field, and every year it grows worse. He doesn't let dead leaves or dead plants stay in the field—he removes them all. Why might his corn be getting worse each year? How could decomposers help?*\n\n*Expected answer: Without dead matter decomposing, there are no nutrients going back into the soil. The soil gets \"tired.\" Leaving dead plants to decompose would return nutrients.*\n\n**Scenario Card 3:**\n> *You find a dead squirrel in your yard. Your parent wants to remove it immediately. You want to let decomposers do their job. How would you explain to your parent why decomposition is important?*\n\n*Expected answer: The squirrel's matter will return to soil through decomposition, helping plants grow, which feeds other animals. It's part of the natural cycle.*\n\n**Student task:** Discuss with a partner, record thinking on worksheet, share one scenario with class.\n\n---\n\n**OPTION C: Decomposition Prediction Challenge**\n\n1. **Show students images of different dead organisms:** a fallen tree, dead fish, dead leaves, roadkill.\n\n2. **Task:** Students choose one and predict:\n   - How long will decomposition take? (weeks, months, years?)\n   - What decomposers will be involved? (mold, bacteria, beetles, worms)\n   - Where will the nutrients end up?\n   - Draw a simple cycle for their chosen organism.\n\n3. **Reasoning required:** \"Explain why your decomposing organism will take that long\" (e.g., A tree is bigger, so it takes longer for decomposers to break it down).\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Role (all options):**\n- Listen to student reasoning and ask follow-up questions: \"How do you know?\" \"What would happen if...?\"\n- Guide without giving answers: \"Let's look back at what we learned about decomposers. What would they do here?\"\n- Celebrate connections to the deer photograph: \"Great—you're applying what we learned about the deer in the photo!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply decomposition and nutrient cycling concepts to new scenarios.\n- Students recognize decomposers as essential to all ecosystems.\n- Students can explain cause-and-effect: if decomposers are absent or if matter is removed, ecosystems suffer.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of decomposition, decomposers, and matter cycling.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation of Explore models:** Were students observing carefully and recording changes accurately?\n- **Discussion responses in Explain phase:** Could students define decomposer and explain why decomposers matter?\n- **Elaborate task completion:** Did students correctly apply concepts to new scenarios?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nAdminister this **Exit Ticket** at the end of Session 2. Students respond individually (written or verbally, depending on writing ability).\n\n**Exit Ticket Prompt:**\n\n*Look at this photo of the dead deer again. Answer these questions:*\n\n1. **What will happen to the deer's body over the next few months?** (Describe the process—use the word \"decomposer\" if you can.)\n\n2. **Where will the nutrients from the deer's body go?** (Where in nature will they end up?)\n\n3. **Why are decomposers important to the forest?** (Give at least one reason.)\n\n4. **Challenge question:** If there were no decomposers, how would the forest be different? (Think about plants, soil, other animals.)\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| **Learning Objective** | **Evidence of Success** |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Students explain that when an animal dies, its body breaks down and materials return to the environment. | Student describes decomposition or breakdown in response to Q1; mentions \"decomposer\" or \"breaks down\" |\n| Students identify decomposers as organisms that break down dead matter and recycle nutrients. | Student names decomposers (mold, fungi, bacteria) or describes their role in breaking down matter (Q1, Q3) |\n| Students create a labeled diagram showing how matter moves from a dead organism back into soil and to living plants. | Student's diagram or written explanation in Q2 shows a pathway: dead deer → decomposers → nutrients → soil → plants |\n| Students predict what would happen if decomposers were absent. | Student responds to Challenge Question (Q4) with logical prediction (e.g., \"Dead things would pile up,\" \"Plants wouldn't grow,\" \"No nutrients in soil\") |\n\n---\n\n**How to Score:**\n\n- **Developing (1-2 points per question):** Student response is incomplete or shows limited understanding (e.g., \"Decomposers eat dead things\" but doesn't mention nutrient cycling).\n- **Proficient (3-4 points per question):** Student clearly explains the concept with appropriate vocabulary and one specific detail (e.g., \"Decomposers like mold and bacteria break down the deer. The nutrients go into the soil, and plants use them to grow\").\n- **Advanced (5 points per question):** Student provides detailed explanation, uses precise vocabulary, and makes a connection to a larger ecosystem concept (e.g., \"Without decomposers, the entire food chain would collapse because plants wouldn't have nutrients\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nIf students score Proficient or Advanced on 3 out of 4 exit ticket questions, they have met the learning objectives and demonstrate understanding of 5-LS2-1 (describing the movement of matter among animals, decomposers, and the environment).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n**Support Strategies for Struggling Learners:**\n\n1. **Sentence frames for Exit Ticket:**\n   Provide written sentence starters to reduce writing burden:\n   - \"The deer's body will _______________ because _______________.\"\n   - \"Decomposers are important because they _______________.\"\n   - \"The nutrients from the deer will go to the _______________ and then to the _______________.\"\n   \n   Students fill in the blanks instead of writing from scratch.\n\n2. **Simplified Explore model with more guidance:**\n   - Pre-prepare the decomposition bag (soil already in place; student just adds organism).\n   - Provide a checklist-style observation sheet with drawings already partially done—student just labels parts instead of creating from scratch.\n   - Use hand lens with clear observation prompts: \"Is it softer or harder than yesterday? Is there fuzzy stuff? Is the color different?\"\n\n3. **Partner with a strong reader:**\n   Pair struggling readers with proficient readers during scenario cards (Elaborate phase). The proficient reader reads aloud; struggling learner contributes ideas.\n\n---\n\n**Challenge Extensions for Advanced Learners:**\n\n1. **Investigate decomposition rates:**\n   - Provide multiple decomposition models with different variables: one in light, one in dark; one wet, one dry; one with larger organism piece, one with smaller.\n   - Task: \"Predict which will decompose fastest. Why? Set up your models and collect data over 2 weeks.\"\n   - Students graph decomposition speed and draw conclusions about what speeds up decomposition (moisture, temperature, surface area).\n\n2. **Research real decomposers:**\n   - Assign advanced students to research one specific decomposer (earthworms, specific fungi, insect larvae) and create an informational poster or short video explanation: \"What does this decomposer do, and how does it help ecosystems?\"\n   - Include diagrams showing how their organism breaks down matter.\n\n3. **Design a compost system:**\n   - Challenge: \"Design a home compost bin that uses decomposers to recycle kitchen waste. Label the decomposers involved, predict what will happen, and explain why it works.\"\n   - Students create a labeled diagram or 3D model showing layers and organisms; write an explanation of the decomposition process.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Decomposition Time-Lapse Photography Project (follow-up over 4 weeks):**\n   - Students photograph their Explore decomposition models every 2-3 days.\n   - At the end of the unit, create a time-lapse video or photo sequence showing visible decomposition.\n   - Students narrate the video using learned vocabulary: \"This is mold, a decomposer that breaks down the organism...\" \"Here you can see the matter being recycled...\"\n   - Share with families or another class.\n\n2. **Schoolyard Decomposition Scavenger Hunt:**\n   - Take students outside to search for evidence of decomposition in nature (fallen leaves breaking down, fungi on logs, insects on dead wood, evidence of animal bodies returning to soil).\n   - Photograph findings and create a \"Decomposition Around Us\" bulletin board with captions explaining: \"What decomposer do you see? What matter is being recycled?\"\n\n3. **\"What Happens Next?\" Prediction Series:**\n   - Provide students with a series of illustrated scenarios showing stages of decomposition (Week 1 photo of dead leaf, Week 3 photo of more-decomposed leaf, etc.).\n   - Students arrange in order and write captions explaining what happened, which decomposers were at work, and where the matter is going.\n   - Compare predictions to their Explore model observations.\n\n4. **Guest Expert: Soil Scientist or Farmer Discussion:**\n   - Invite a local farmer, gardener, or soil scientist to discuss how decomposers and nutrient cycling improve soil health.\n   - Students ask prepared questions: \"Why do gardeners compost? What decomposers are in healthy soil?\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** The photograph of the deceased deer may be sensitive for some students. Frame it respectfully: \"This is a natural part of the life cycle. In nature, when animals die, their bodies help the ecosystem continue.\" Provide a content warning to families beforehand if needed.\n- **Decomposition models:** Ensure bags remain sealed (if sealed) or covered to prevent student contact with mold. Wash hands after observing. Do not allow students to open or handle dead organisms directly.\n- **Timing:** Visible decomposition (mold growth, color changes) may take 5-7 days depending on temperature and moisture. Plan your observation schedule accordingly. Warmer classrooms see faster decomposition.\n- **Reinforcement:** Repeatedly connect back to the original deer photograph throughout the lesson: \"Remember the deer? That's what's happening in your models.\"\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Use decomposer, decomposition, nutrient, and matter frequently. Create a word wall and reference it often.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson fully aligns with **5-LS2-1** by having students develop a model of matter movement through the decomposition process and ecosystem cycling, grounded in real observation and the compelling image of the deceased deer.",
