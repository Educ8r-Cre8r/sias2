Identify and name at least three external body parts of a bird and explain what each part helps the bird do.\n2. Describe how a bird's body parts help it survive and meet its needs (finding food, moving, seeing).\n3. Recognize that baby birds look like their parent birds because they have similar body parts and features.\n4. Use materials to create or design something that mimics how a bird's body part works to solve a problem.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by introducing birds through the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed or projected photograph of the pigeon\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: real feathers or bird pictures (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Ask students to look carefully at the pigeon for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you see? Can you describe this animal to a friend who has never seen it?\"\n   - \"What are the different parts of this bird's body? Point to them on the picture.\" (Guide students to notice: head, eyes, beak, wings, feet, tail, feathers)\n   - \"Why do you think a bird has wings? What do wings help the bird do?\"\n   - \"Look at the bird's feet. They are bright red and have bumpy parts. Why might a bird need feet like these?\"\n\n3. **Make a prediction/wonder prompt:**\n   - \"If this is a mommy pigeon, what do you think a baby pigeon would look like? Would it have the same body parts? Would it look exactly the same?\"\n   - Record student predictions on chart paper titled \"What We Wonder About Pigeons.\"\n\n4. **Show students a real feather** (if available) and pass it around so they can feel how light and soft it is. Ask: \"Why would birds need feathers?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Today we're going to explore bird body parts and discover why birds look the way they do and how their special parts help them survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate bird body parts through observation and hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed copies of the pigeon photograph (one per pair of students, or one per student)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Chart: \"Bird Body Parts and What They Do\" (pre-drawn with columns: **Part Name**, **What I See**, **What It Does**)\n- Optional: pictures of baby pigeons, chick images, or other young birds\n- Magnifying glasses (if available)\n- Index cards with labels: \"HEAD,\" \"BEAK,\" \"WINGS,\" \"FEET,\" \"TAIL,\" \"FEATHERS\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Pair students up.** Give each pair a large photo of the pigeon.\n\n2. **Observation task:** Students work together to:\n   - Use magnifying glasses (if available) to look closely at different parts of the bird.\n   - Point to and name each body part they can see.\n   - On the chart (displayed on board or given as handout), students draw or write what each part looks like.\n   - For each part, students guess or discuss what job that part does. Record their ideas.\n\n3. **Focus students' observations on:**\n   - **Eyes:** What color? Round and shiny? What do they help the bird do?\n   - **Beak:** Hard? Pointed? What shape? Could it pick up food? Could it break seeds?\n   - **Wings:** Big? Covered in feathers? Could they help the bird move through air?\n   - **Feet:** What do you notice? Are they bumpy? Have claws? Could they grip a branch or walk on ground?\n   - **Feathers:** Smooth? Overlapping? What color pattern do you see?\n\n4. **Teacher circulates** and asks follow-up questions:\n   - \"Why do you think this bird's feet are bright red?\"\n   - \"If you were a pigeon, which part would you use to find seeds to eat?\"\n   - \"Which part helps a bird stay warm?\"\n\n5. **Document findings:** Students complete the chart by drawing and labeling bird parts.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Facilitate observation without providing direct answers.\n- Ask \"What do you notice?\" and \"Why do you think that?\" rather than explaining.\n- Guide students to think about how body parts work to meet the bird's needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify at least 5 external bird body parts (head, beak, wings, feet, tail, feathers).\n- Students make simple connections between body parts and function (e.g., \"Wings help birds fly,\" \"Beaks help birds eat,\" \"Feet help birds stand\").\n- Students produce a labeled drawing or chart showing bird parts.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (16-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and reinforce concepts discovered during exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Bird Body Parts\" anchor chart (pre-made or created with students)\n- Pigeon photograph (displayed)\n- Picture of a baby pigeon or young bird (to show similarity to adults)\n- Vocabulary cards with images\n- Index cards with vocabulary terms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 3-4 pairs to share one body part they observed and what they think it does. Record their ideas on the anchor chart.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with grade-appropriate definitions:**\n   - **Feathers:** Lightweight coverings on a bird's body that help it fly and stay warm.\n   - **Beak:** The hard, pointed mouth of a bird used for eating and grabbing things.\n   - **Wings:** Body parts covered with feathers that help birds fly and move through the air.\n   - **Feet/Talons (claws):** The bumpy, gripping parts at the end of a bird's legs that help it stand, walk, and hold things.\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and meet its needs.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"This pigeon has red feet. Those red bumpy parts are called scales, and they help the pigeon grip branches and the ground so it doesn't slip.\"\n   - \"See how the pigeon's feathers overlap like roof shingles? That helps water roll off and keeps the bird dry.\"\n   - \"The beak is hard and pointed. Pigeons use their beaks to pick up seeds and food from the ground.\"\n\n4. **Introduce the parent-offspring connection:**\n   - Show a picture of a baby pigeon (squab) or another young bird.\n   - Ask: \"Does the baby bird have the same body parts as the grown-up? What's the same? What's different?\"\n   - Explain: \"Young birds look like their parents because they inherit the same body parts and features. But baby birds are smaller and may have different colored feathers until they grow up.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"What body part does a bird use to fly?\" (Wings)\n   - Ask: \"Why does a pigeon have a pointy beak?\" (To pick up food)\n   - Ask: \"If a baby pigeon grows up, will it look like its parent? Why?\" (Yes, because it will have the same body parts)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Feathers:** Lightweight coverings on a bird's body that help it fly and stay warm.\n- **Beak:** The hard, pointed mouth of a bird used for eating and grabbing things.\n- **Wings:** Body parts covered with feathers that help birds fly and move through the air.\n- **Feet:** The bumpy, gripping parts at the end of a bird's legs that help it stand, walk, and hold things.\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and meet its needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least 3-4 bird body parts and explain one function of each.\n- Students understand that body parts have specific jobs that help birds survive.\n- Students recognize that baby birds inherit body parts from their parents.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing or creating something that mimics how a bird's body part works.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Paper plates, paper cups, straws, yarn, tape, scissors, tissue paper, feathers (real or paper)\n- Chenille stems (pipe cleaners)\n- Markers and colored paper\n- Popsicle sticks\n- Modeling clay\n- Picture of the pigeon (reference)\n\n**Activity: \"Design a Bird Tool\" (Design Challenge)**\n\n**Scenario:** \"Pigeons need special tools to help them survive. Let's create something that works like a bird's body part!\"\n\n**Students choose ONE of these design challenges:**\n\n**Challenge 1: Build a Beak Tool**\n- Problem: \"How can you design a tool that works like a pigeon's beak to pick up small seeds?\"\n- Materials: Popsicle sticks, straws, pencils, paper clips, tape\n- Task: Create a beak-like grabber that can pick up cereal pieces or beads\n- Test: Can your tool pick up small objects like a real beak picks up seeds?\n\n**Challenge 2: Create Feathers for Warmth**\n- Problem: \"Feathers keep birds warm. Can you design something that traps air and keeps warmth in, like feathers do?\"\n- Materials: Tissue paper, cotton balls, aluminum foil, plastic bags, tape\n- Task: Create a layer that feels warm and protects something inside\n- Test: Wrap your design around an ice cube and see which design keeps it from melting the fastest\n\n**Challenge 3: Design Bird Feet**\n- Problem: \"A pigeon's feet have bumpy scales so it can grip branches. How can you make feet that grip?\"\n- Materials: Chenille stems, rubber bands, yarn, tape, textured paper\n- Task: Design feet that can grip and hold a pencil or stick\n- Test: Can your feet design hold a stick without dropping it?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Explain the design challenge clearly with examples.\n- Provide time for students to sketch or plan before building.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"How does a real bird's body part work?\" \"What materials can you use to make it work the same way?\"\n- Encourage testing and refinement.\n- Celebrate creative solutions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a functional tool or design that mimics a bird body part.\n- Students can explain how their design works and how it's similar to the real bird part.\n- Students test their design and make improvements.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of bird body parts, their functions, and inherited traits.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Do they identify body parts accurately? Can they make simple connections to function?\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain phase: Can they use vocabulary appropriately? Do they understand adaptation?\n- Review drawings and charts: Are body parts labeled? Do descriptions show understanding of function?\n- Observe during Elaborate phase: Can students explain how their design mimics a bird part?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\n**Give each student an index card with two tasks:**\n\n**Task 1: Labeling (Show picture of pigeon or bird)**\n- Label at least 3 bird body parts on a simple bird drawing.\n\n**Task 2: Short Answer (Read aloud or have students write/draw)**\n- Ask: \"Pick one part of the bird you labeled. Tell me what that part helps the bird do.\" \n- Students respond with a sentence or drawing (e.g., \"Wings help the bird fly\").\n\n**Task 3: Parent-Offspring Connection (Optional, verbal or drawn)**\n- Ask: \"Baby pigeons grow into adult pigeons. Will they have wings like their parents? Why?\"\n- Expected response: \"Yes, because baby birds inherit the same body parts from their parents.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Exceeds:** Student labels 4+ body parts accurately, explains 2+ functions clearly, and makes a connection to inherited traits.\n- **Meets:** Student labels 3 body parts accurately, explains at least 1 function, and shows understanding of how body parts help birds.\n- **Approaching:** Student labels 2 body parts, may need prompting to explain function.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate knowledge of at least 3 bird body parts and one function per part.\n- Students can explain how a bird's body part helps it survive or meet a need.\n- Students recognize that offspring inherit similar body parts from parents.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Provide a labeled diagram:** Give students a pre-labeled bird picture during Explore phase. Instead of identifying all parts, students focus on 2-3 key parts (wings, beak, feet) and match them to function cards.\n\n2. **Use sentence frames for explanation:** Provide sentence starters:\n   - \"The _____ helps the bird _____.\"\n   - \"A baby pigeon has _____ just like its parent.\"\n   - Use these frames during sharing and exit ticket.\n\n3. **Simplify the design challenge:** For Challenge 1, provide a pre-made beak tool (clothespins or tongs) and have students test it rather than build from scratch. Focus on observation: \"Does this work like a real beak? How?\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Compare multiple birds:** Provide images of 3-4 different birds (pigeon, eagle, robin, duck). Ask: \"How are their beaks different? Why? What does each bird eat?\" Students research and create a comparison chart of adaptations.\n\n2. **Extended design challenge:** Challenge students to design a multi-part bird tool that mimics TWO body parts (e.g., wings AND feet). Ask: \"How do wings and feet work together to help a bird survive?\"\n\n3. **Investigate bird behavior:** Ask: \"How do pigeons use their body parts to behave?\" Have students observe and record: How does the pigeon hold food? How does it balance? How does it turn its head? Connect behavior to body structure.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bird Behavior Observation (Homework or Next Lesson):**\n   - If there are pigeons or birds near your school, take students outside to observe real birds (or show a video).\n   - Students sketch the bird and label body parts they see.\n   - Ask: \"What is the bird doing with its body parts?\" (e.g., hopping with feet, fluffing feathers, eating with beak).\n   - Compare observations to the pigeon in the photograph.\n\n2. **Parent and Baby Bird Matching Game:**\n   - Provide pictures of adult birds and baby birds (chicks, ducklings, squabs).\n   - Students match babies to parents by identifying inherited features (beak shape, feather color, size, feet).\n   - Discuss: \"What features helped you match them? Where did the baby get those features?\"\n\n3. **Bird Adaptation Scavenger Hunt:**\n   - Create a classroom scavenger hunt with pictures of different bird beaks, feet, and feathers.\n   - Label each with a type of food or habitat (seeds, fish, insects, branches, water).\n   - Students match body parts to what the bird eats or where it lives (e.g., \"Long, pointy beak = eating insects from flowers\").\n   - Extend: \"How is the pigeon's beak different from these other birds' beaks? Why?\"\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\nThis lesson encourages students to observe carefully, think critically about animal structures and their purposes, and make connections between inherited traits in offspring. By using the pigeon photograph as an anchor throughout all 5E phases, you maintain student focus on concrete examples while building abstract understanding of adaptation and heredity.\n\nFirst graders learn best when they can touch, observe, and create. The Explore and Elaborate phases are hands-on and playful, which supports engagement. The vocabulary is scaffolded, and the design challenge allows for creative expression while reinforcing that body parts have functions.",
