Observe and describe what a bee and a flower look like using their senses (colors, shapes, body parts).\n2. Explain in simple words that bees need food from flowers and flowers need bees to help them make new flowers.\n3. Identify one body part on a bee and one part on a flower that helps them work together.\n4. Act out or draw how a bee and flower help each other survive.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about bees and flowers using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of bee on red and yellow flower (projected or printed large)\n- Chart paper and markers (teacher use)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or as a poster where all students can see clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask students to turn and talk** to a neighbor: \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the colors and shapes?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate a whole-group discussion** with these specific questions (pause after each for 5-10 seconds of think time):\n   - \"What animal do you see? What do you notice about it?\" (Guide to bee's fuzzy body, wings, legs, antennae)\n   - \"What plant do you see? What colors do you see on the flower?\" (Guide to red petals, yellow center)\n   - \"Why do you think the bee is visiting the flower? What might the bee want?\" (Accept predictions: food, water, etc.)\n   - \"Do you think the flower wants the bee there? Why or why not?\" (Encourage wonder and creative thinking)\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper with simple drawings or words (e.g., \"Bee is hungry,\" \"Bee likes yellow color\").\n\n5. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder if the bee and flower are helping each other... Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to act out what the bee and flower are doing, and we'll discover how they need each other to survive.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the relationship between bees and flowers through hands-on movement and observation activities.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large open floor space\n- Red and yellow construction paper or fabric scraps (to represent flower petals and pollen)\n- Yellow pom-poms, yellow yarn, or gold glitter glue (to represent pollen)\n- Images of real bees (from printed handouts or projected) for reference\n- Student observation journals (blank paper or pre-made with simple boxes to draw in)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Part 1: Role-Play the Bee and Flower (12-15 minutes)**\n   - Divide the class into two groups: \"Bees\" and \"Flowers.\"\n   - Flowers stand in a line or circle, each holding or standing near red and yellow paper to represent petals. Sprinkle yellow pom-poms or yarn around their \"center\" to represent pollen.\n   - Bees move around the room, approaching flowers.\n   - When a bee reaches a flower, the bee gently touches the yellow center and collects a pom-pom or yarn piece (representing pollen collection).\n   - The flower celebrates (\"Yay! A bee is visiting me!\") and the bee celebrates (\"Yay! I found food!\").\n   - After 3-4 rounds, swap roles so all students experience being both a bee and a flower.\n\n2. **Part 2: Observe and Record (5-10 minutes)**\n   - Gather students back together.\n   - Show the original photograph again.\n   - Ask: \"What did the bee do to the flower? What did the flower give the bee?\"\n   - Ask: \"What did the bee do for the flower?\" (Explain gently: The pollen on the bee's body helps flowers make seeds and new flowers.)\n   - Have each student draw in their observation journal: the bee, the flower, or both of them together. Encourage them to draw the yellow pollen if they can.\n   - Circulate and ask students to describe their drawings: \"Tell me about what your bee is doing. Tell me about your flower.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the role-play with enthusiasm and clear directions.\n- Use the photograph as a reference throughout (\"Remember, the real bee in our picture looks like this\").\n- Ask open-ended questions during the observation time: \"What colors do you see? What shape is the bee's body?\"\n- Accept all student drawings and explanations without judgment; focus on the observation and thinking process.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students physically experience and understand the interaction between bee and flower.\n- Students create visual representations (drawings) showing the bee, flower, or their interaction.\n- Students use simple language to describe what they observe: \"The bee is on the flower,\" \"The bee gets yellow stuff,\" \"The flower gets a visitor.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and solidify understanding of how bees and flowers help each other survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (still visible)\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Picture cards or printed images of bee body parts (legs, antennae, wings, proboscis/mouth) and flower parts (petals, center with pollen, stem)\n- Vocabulary cards with simple pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes)**\n   - Invite 3-4 students to share their drawings with the class.\n   - Ask the class: \"Do you agree? Did you see that in our picture?\"\n   - Affirm observations and correct misconceptions gently (e.g., \"The bee does look very fuzzy, doesn't it? That fuzz helps pollen stick to the bee!\").\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7-10 minutes)**\n   - Use simple language and point to the photograph as you introduce each term:\n   - **Pollen:** The yellow powder inside flowers that helps flowers make seeds. (Point to the yellow on the bee's body.)\n   - **Pollination:** When pollen moves from one flower to another, helping flowers make new flowers. (Act it out: \"When the bee visits the first flower, pollen sticks to it. When the bee visits another flower, some pollen rubs off. That's pollination!\")\n   - **Bee:** An animal with six legs, wings, and a special mouth that drinks nectar from flowers.\n   - **Nectar:** The sweet liquid inside flowers that bees drink for food and energy.\n   - **Flower:** The colorful, sweet-smelling part of a plant that makes seeds.\n\n3. **Check for Understanding (3-5 minutes)**\n   - Ask simple yes/no and fill-in-the-blank questions:\n     - \"Do bees need flowers for food? (Yes!)\"\n     - \"Do flowers need bees to help make new flowers? (Yes!)\"\n     - \"What color is the pollen in our picture?\" (Yellow)\n     - \"What does the bee get from the flower?\" (Food/nectar)\n     - \"What does the flower get from the bee?\" (Help making new flowers)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Pollen** | Yellow powder inside flowers that helps flowers make new flowers; it sticks to bees' bodies. |\n| **Pollination** | When pollen travels from one flower to another, usually by a bee, so new flowers can grow. |\n| **Bee** | A flying animal with six legs, wings, and a long mouth that drinks sweet juice from flowers. |\n| **Nectar** | The sweet liquid inside flowers that bees drink like juice to get energy. |\n| **Flower** | The colorful part of a plant that makes nectar and pollen; it needs bees to make new seeds. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize and use simple vocabulary in context (e.g., \"The bee collects pollen\").\n- Students understand the basic reciprocal relationship: bee needs flower for food; flower needs bee for pollination.\n- Students can answer simple questions about how bees and flowers help each other.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by exploring the needs of bees and flowers in a new context and connecting to real-world observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pictures or real samples of different flowers (if available: sunflowers, daisies, zinnias, wildflowers)\n- Small potted flowers or cut flowers in a vase\n- Magnifying glasses (optional)\n- Chart paper titled \"What Bees and Flowers Need\"\n- Crayons, colored pencils, or markers\n- Drawing paper or large pre-made worksheet with a two-column chart (Bee Needs / Flower Needs)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Explore Real Flowers (7-10 minutes)**\n   - If possible, bring in different real flowers or show images of different types of flowers.\n   - Ask: \"Do all flowers look the same? What's different? What's the same?\"\n   - Let students observe closely (with magnifying glasses if available).\n   - Ask: \"Would a bee like these flowers too? Why?\"\n   - Guide students to notice: All flowers have colors, all have pollen, all can feed bees.\n\n2. **Create a \"Needs\" Chart (5-8 minutes)**\n   - Draw two columns on chart paper: one labeled \"Bee Needs\" with a bee picture, one labeled \"Flower Needs\" with a flower picture.\n   - Facilitate student thinking:\n     - **Bee needs:** Food (nectar), places to fly, flowers to visit, safe places to live\n     - **Flower needs:** Bees (to spread pollen), sunlight, water, soil\n   - Record student ideas with simple words and drawings.\n   - Emphasize: \"The bee and flower need each other!\"\n\n3. **Individual Application Activity (3-5 minutes)**\n   - Give each student a drawing paper or worksheet.\n   - Ask them to draw or write (with teacher help) one thing a bee needs and one thing a flower needs.\n   - Provide sentence frames: \"A bee needs ___.\" \"A flower needs ___.\"\n   - Encourage students to include the bee and flower from the original photograph if they wish.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate curiosity about different flowers without forcing all observations.\n- Guide students to recognize patterns (all flowers attract bees, all flowers have pollen).\n- Scaffold the \"Needs\" chart with prompts: \"What does a bee eat? Where does it get that? What does a flower need to grow?\"\n- Affirm all contributions to the chart.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify and articulate needs of both bees and flowers.\n- Students create visual or written representations of these needs.\n- Students begin to see that many different flowers can support bees.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of the bee-flower relationship and what each organism needs to survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n   - **During Explore:** Observe student role-play. Do they understand the interaction? Do they show the bee collecting and the flower receiving?\n   - **During Explain:** Listen to student responses to vocabulary and comprehension questions. Correct gently and re-explain if needed.\n   - **During Elaborate:** Review student drawings and responses on the \"Needs\" chart. Do they show understanding?\n\n2. **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes at end of Day 1 or Day 2):**\n\n   Ask each student (one-on-one or in small groups) these questions and record their responses:\n\n   - **Question 1:** \"Look at this picture of a bee on a flower. What is the bee doing?\" (Accept answers: visiting, eating, collecting pollen, getting food)\n   - **Question 2:** \"Why is the flower happy to see the bee?\" (Accept answers: the bee helps it, the pollen gets shared, the flower needs the bee)\n   - **Question 3:** \"Draw or point to the yellow pollen in the picture. Tell me what it does.\" (Success: Student identifies yellow pollen and explains it helps make new flowers OR that it travels from flower to flower)\n\n3. **Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n   - ✓ Student can describe what a bee is doing in the photograph.\n   - ✓ Student can explain in simple words that the bee and flower help each other.\n   - ✓ Student can identify the yellow pollen and explain its role (even if simplified).\n   - ✓ Student can name one thing a bee needs and one thing a flower needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding by responding to questions with age-appropriate vocabulary and concepts.\n- Students show that they recognize bees and flowers as living things with needs that are connected.\n- Students are ready to extend learning to other pollinators and plants in subsequent lessons.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplify vocabulary:** Use only \"Bee,\" \"Flower,\" and \"Pollen\" if three terms are too many. Focus on \"The bee visits the flower. The bee gets food. The flower gets help.\"\n2. **Use more visual supports:** Provide picture cards during discussions. Let students point instead of answer verbally.\n3. **Shorten the role-play:** Have only 2-3 \"bees\" and 2-3 \"flowers\" interact at a time so students can focus on the movement and concept without overwhelming sensory input.\n4. **Pre-teach body parts:** Before the lesson, review bee and flower pictures with small groups so they have background knowledge.\n5. **Provide sentence starters for drawings:** \"The bee is ___.\" \"The flower is ___.\" Let students copy or fill in one word.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research other pollinators:** Show pictures of butterflies, hummingbirds, and beetles. Ask: \"Do these animals help flowers too? How are they different from bees?\"\n2. **Explore multiple flowers:** Provide pictures of 4-5 different flower types. Ask: \"Which flowers would a bee like best? Why? Do all flowers attract bees?\" Have students sort or categorize.\n3. **Create a food chain:** Introduce the idea that bees eat nectar and flowers make nectar. Ask: \"Where does the flower get energy to make nectar?\" (Sunlight!) Introduce a simple sun → flower → bee chain.\n4. **Compare and contrast:** Provide a Venn diagram template. Have students work in pairs to compare bee and flower (e.g., Both are alive, Bee moves/Flower doesn't, Both need each other).\n5. **Predict and test:** Ask: \"If there were no bees, what would happen to the flowers? If there were no flowers, what would happen to bees?\" Have students draw predictions and discuss real-world consequences.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Flower Garden Observation (Outdoor Science):**\n   - Take students on a nature walk to observe flowers in a garden, park, or schoolyard.\n   - Look for real bees, butterflies, or other insects visiting flowers.\n   - Ask: \"What colors do you see? Are any bees or insects here? What are they doing?\"\n   - Return to class and create a class book: \"Bugs We Saw on Our Flower Hunt\" with drawings and one-sentence descriptions for each student page.\n\n2. **Sensory Flower Station (Fine Motor / Sensory Activity):**\n   - Set up a classroom station with real flowers (or large flower pictures) that students can explore with their senses.\n   - Provide: magnifying glasses, colored pencils, paper, and small sticky notes.\n   - Students observe and draw the flower's parts: petals, center, pollen.\n   - Label a diagram together: \"This is the center where pollen is\" and \"These are the petals that are colorful.\"\n\n3. **Act Out the Life Cycle (Movement / Life Cycle Introduction):**\n   - Create a simple sequence: Seed → Flower Grows → Bee Visits → Pollen Spreads → New Seed → New Flower.\n   - Have students act out each stage in a circle or line dance.\n   - Emphasize: \"The bee helps make this cycle possible!\"\n   - This naturally leads to K-LS1-1 understanding that living things have needs and stages of life.\n\n---\n\n*This lesson honors kindergarteners' natural curiosity about insects and plants while building foundational understanding that living things have interdependent relationships and needs for survival.*",
