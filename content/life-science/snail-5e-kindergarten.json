Exploring What Helps Living Things Survive**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 30-minute sessions (or one 60-minute block with a break)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - **K-LS1-1:** Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Observe and identify** what a snail needs to survive (food, water, shelter, safety).\n2. **Describe patterns** of animal needs by comparing a snail to other living things they know.\n3. **Explain why** snails live in certain places (like on moss and damp rocks).\n4. **Demonstrate understanding** that all living things—including animals, plants, and people—need food, water, shelter, and air to survive.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the snail in the photograph and activate prior knowledge about living things and their needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the snail on moss (enlarged to 8.5\" × 11\" or displayed via projector)\n- Chart paper\n- Markers (multiple colors)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** in a location where all students can see clearly (projected on screen, held up, or posted on board).\n\n2. **Ask students to look quietly for 30 seconds** without talking. Then invite them to turn to a partner and whisper one thing they notice about the picture.\n\n3. **Facilitate a whole-group discussion** using these scaffolded questions:\n   - *\"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about it.\"* (Accept all observations: \"snail,\" \"moss,\" \"green stuff,\" \"shell.\")\n   - *\"Is the snail alive? How do you know?\"* (Students may say: \"It can move,\" \"It has a body,\" \"It eats.\")\n   - *\"Where is the snail? What is it sitting on?\"* (Guide them to notice the moss, rock/stone, damp environment.)\n   - *\"What do you think this snail needs to stay alive and healthy?\"* (Encourage guesses: \"Food,\" \"water,\" \"a home,\" \"shelter.\")\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper in a two-column chart:\n   - **Column 1:** \"What Snails Need\"\n   - **Column 2:** Student responses (write words and/or draw simple pictures)\n\n5. **Wonder prompt:** *\"I wonder... does this snail need the same things YOU need to stay healthy? Let's find out!\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Now we're going to explore and discover what snails really need by making our own snail homes and watching what happens!\"*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate snail needs through hands-on exploration and observation, discovering patterns in what living things require.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Per small group (2-3 students):** \n  - 1 small clear plastic container or cup (8-12 oz)\n  - Soil or potting mix (1-2 inches)\n  - Moss (fresh or dried, from craft store or outside)\n  - 1-2 live snails (garden snails; can be obtained from biology suppliers or found outdoors; *handle gently, return at lesson end*)\n  - Spray bottle or watering can with water\n  - 1 small piece of lettuce or cucumber\n  - Observation sheets (simple pictures to circle or point to)\n  - Colored pencils or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Teacher Setup (before the lesson):**\n- Prepare one \"snail habitat\" per small group.\n- Pre-dampen soil and add moss; place gently in containers.\n- Have snails ready in a secure, separate container until students begin.\n\n**Student Directions (teacher-led with simplified language):**\n\n1. **\"Look inside your container. What do you see?\"** (Soil, moss, rocks—students point and name.)\n\n2. **\"Now I'm going to put a snail in your home. Watch carefully! What does the snail do?\"** (Teacher gently places snail; students observe for 1-2 minutes in silence.)\n\n3. **\"Let's give our snail food. Here's a piece of lettuce. Watch where the snail goes.\"** (Students place food; observe if snail moves toward it or ignores it. No pressure for snails to eat immediately.)\n\n4. **\"Now, let's spray a little water into the moss—not too much! Make it damp like a rainy day.\"** (Each student sprays 2-3 times; discuss how it feels wet, like after rain.)\n\n5. **\"Look at your snail now. Is it moving? Is it eating? Is it hiding? Let's watch for 2-3 minutes and notice what happens.\"** (Students observe and whisper observations to a partner.)\n\n6. **\"Draw or point to what your snail needed in this picture:\"** (Teacher displays observation sheet with simple pictures: food, water, shelter, air. Students circle or point to what they think the snail used.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking open-ended questions:\n  - *\"What is your snail doing right now?\"*\n  - *\"Did the snail move toward the lettuce?\"*\n  - *\"Why do you think the snail went to the moss?\"*\n  - *\"Is the soil wet or dry? Why does that matter?\"*\n- **Do not answer directly**—instead, redirect: *\"What do you think? Let's watch and see.\"*\n- Ensure all snails are handled gently and safely.\n- Have students help create a comfortable home (dampness, food, shelter).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe snails moving, hiding in moss, and potentially eating.\n- Students recognize that snails respond to moisture and food.\n- Students document observations using simple drawings or pointing to picture cards.\n- Students begin to notice patterns: snails hide in moss (shelter), move toward lettuce (food), and need damp environments (water).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect snail observations to broader concepts about what all living things need.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper (from Engage phase + new chart for vocabulary)\n- Picture cards or clipart showing: **shell, food, water, shelter, air** (one image per card, 8\" × 10\")\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to briefly share one thing their snail did: *\"What did your snail do? Where did it go? What did it need?\"*\n   - Record responses on new chart: **\"What Our Snails Needed\"** (may include: water, food, shelter, darkness, moss, soil).\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Display picture cards one at a time and use student-friendly definitions:\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Shell** | \"A hard home on the snail's back that keeps it safe, like a coat of armor.\" |\n   | **Food** | \"What snails eat to get energy and grow. This snail likes lettuce and plants.\" |\n   | **Water/Moisture** | \"Wet stuff that snails need to drink and to keep their bodies from drying out. Snails love damp places!\" |\n   | **Shelter** | \"A safe, cozy place to hide and rest, like the moss and soil.\" |\n   | **Living Thing** | \"Something that is alive. It can grow, eat, move, and need things to stay healthy—like snails, plants, and people!\" |\n\n   - **Point to the photograph** and label each visible element: *\"See the snail's shell? See the moss that gives it shelter? See how wet and damp it is? That's water the snail needs!\"*\n\n3. **Make Connections to Student Experience (5 minutes):**\n   - *\"Snails need food, water, shelter, and a safe place to live. Do YOU need those things too?\"*\n   - Guide students to respond: *\"We eat food. We drink water. We have homes. We need air to breathe.\"*\n   - Create a comparison chart on paper:\n\n   | **Living Thing** | **Needs Food** | **Needs Water** | **Needs Shelter** | **Needs Air** |\n   |---|---|---|---|---|\n   | Snail | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n   | Person (You) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |\n   | Plant | ✓ (soil nutrients) | ✓ | ✓ (roots in ground) | ✓ |\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: *\"If a snail doesn't have water, what might happen?\"* (It might dry out, not move, get sick.)\n   - Ask: *\"Why did the snail go into the moss?\"* (To hide, find shelter, stay safe.)\n   - Ask: *\"What do we call the snail's hard covering?\"* (Shell.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly use terms: **shell, food, water, shelter.**\n- Students explain that snails (and all living things) need these basic things to survive.\n- Students recognize the pattern: all living things have similar needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Deepen understanding by applying snail survival concepts to new scenarios and connecting to students' own lives.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos of different habitats: garden, forest, pond, desert, house\n- \"Where Would a Snail Live?\" worksheet (simple pictures of environments)\n- Optional: small figurines or cutout pictures of snails to place on habitat pictures\n- Chart paper\n- Crayons/colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Choose ONE of the following elaboration activities:**\n\n---\n\n**OPTION A: \"Snail Habitat Detective\" (Recommended for most Kindergarten classes)**\n\n1. **Show pictures of different places:** garden, forest, pond, sandy beach, desert.\n\n2. **Ask:** *\"Which places would be good homes for a snail? Why?\"*\n   - Discuss moisture (snails need damp, not dry).\n   - Discuss food sources (snails need plants).\n   - Discuss shelter (snails need hiding places).\n\n3. **Students draw or point to:** Which habitat would be best for a snail?\n   - **Expected answer:** Garden or forest (moist, plants, shelter). **Not** desert (too dry).\n\n4. **Extend the thinking:** *\"What would happen to a snail in the desert? Would it find water? Food? Why not?\"*\n\n---\n\n**OPTION B: \"What Does a Snail Need?\" Poster Activity (For students needing more hands-on engagement)**\n\n1. Provide each student with a large paper divided into four sections (or already labeled with pictures).\n\n2. Each section represents one snail need:\n   - **Section 1 (Food):** Draw or glue a picture of something a snail eats.\n   - **Section 2 (Water):** Draw raindrops or point to blue water colors.\n   - **Section 3 (Shelter):** Draw or color moss/a hiding place.\n   - **Section 4 (Safety):** Draw the snail's shell.\n\n3. Students create their poster collaboratively or independently (based on ability).\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"Does a snail need water? Where do snails find water in nature?\"*\n- Affirm observations: *\"Yes! Snails live where it's damp, just like we saw in our picture!\"*\n- Encourage reasoning: *\"Why do you think a snail would NOT live in a dry desert?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply snail survival concepts to new contexts (different habitats).\n- Students reason about cause-and-effect: *\"If there's no water, the snail can't survive there.\"*\n- Students create visual representations showing understanding of snail needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of snail needs and connections to broader life science concepts.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** (teacher completes during Explore and Elaborate):\n  - ✓ Student observes snail behavior carefully.\n  - ✓ Student identifies at least one snail need (food, water, shelter).\n  - ✓ Student makes a connection between snail needs and human needs.\n  - ✓ Student uses vocabulary correctly (shell, shelter, food, water).\n\n- **Questions asked during group work:**\n  - *\"Tell me what your snail needed today.\"*\n  - *\"Why do you think the snail went to the wet moss?\"*\n\n---\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (3-5 minutes, end of lesson):**\n\n**Choose ONE format based on class needs:**\n\n**Format A: Three Simple Pictures (For emerging learners)**\n- Show three pictures:\n  1. A snail in dry sand (desert)\n  2. A snail in wet moss with lettuce (garden)\n  3. A snail on a dry rock with no shelter\n\n- **Ask:** *\"Which picture shows a happy, healthy snail? Point to it. Why is that a good home for a snail?\"*\n- **Success criteria:** Student points to picture B and mentions water, food, or shelter.\n\n---\n\n**Format B: Drawing + Oral Explanation (For most students)**\n- **Prompt:** *\"Draw what a snail needs to be healthy and happy. You can draw food, water, shelter, or anything else you think a snail needs.\"*\n- **Follow-up question:** *\"Tell me about your drawing. What did your snail need?\"*\n- **Success criteria:** \n  - Student draws at least one snail need (food, water, shelter, or shell).\n  - Student verbally explains their drawing using at least one vocabulary word (shell, food, water, shelter).\n\n---\n\n**Format C: Sorting Activity (For students who need movement)**\n- Lay out four picture cards: **food, water, shelter, shell**.\n- Give students small cards with snails (or ask them to point).\n- **Ask:** *\"What does a snail need? Find it and point!\"* (Repeat for each need.)\n- **Success criteria:** Student correctly identifies at least 2-3 snail needs.\n\n---\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students articulate that snails need **water, food, shelter, and a shell** to survive.\n- Students explain *why* snails need these things (to stay healthy, safe, alive).\n- Students recognize that snails and people share common survival needs.\n- Students demonstrate understanding through drawings, verbal explanations, or selections.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n---\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce task complexity during Explore:**\n   - Pre-assemble snail habitats; students only observe (rather than setup).\n   - Provide a simplified observation card with only TWO pictures to choose from (e.g., \"Did the snail need water or toys?\").\n   - Allow student to work one-on-one with teacher or aide while observing snail.\n\n2. **Use consistent visual supports:**\n   - Keep vocabulary picture cards displayed throughout the lesson.\n   - Point to cards when using words (e.g., point to water picture while saying \"water\").\n   - Provide \"word bank\" for drawing activities (simple pictures labeled with one-word names).\n\n3. **Scaffold questioning:**\n   - Ask yes/no questions first: *\"Does the snail need water? Yes or no?\"*\n   - Follow with open-ended: *\"Tell me why the snail needs water.\"*\n   - Model answers: *\"The snail needs water because... it keeps the snail from drying out. Can you say that?\"*\n\n---\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extend Elaborate activities:**\n   - Instead of just identifying good snail habitats, ask: *\"Design the PERFECT snail home. What would you put in it? Why?\"*\n   - Students draw detailed plans with labels (soil, moss, water, lettuce) and explain choices.\n\n2. **Make cross-organism connections:**\n   - *\"We learned snails need food, water, and shelter. What other animals need these things? Can you think of three?\"*\n   - Students draw or list other animals (birds, bugs, people) and identify their shared needs.\n\n3. **Introduce life cycles or adaptations:**\n   - *\"Why does a snail have a shell? What would happen without it?\"*\n   - *\"How does the snail's shell help it survive?\"* (Protection, moisture retention.)\n   - Introduce the idea that body parts are \"adaptations\"—special features that help animals survive in their homes.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n---\n\n#### Extension 1: **\"Snail Needs Hunt\" (Outdoor Exploration)**\n\nTake students outside to a garden, shaded area, or even a potted plant zone.\n\n- **Task:** *\"Find a snail or slug if you can. Where is it? What is it hiding in? Does it have water nearby?\"*\n- **Observation goal:** Students observe real snail habitats and identify moisture, shelter, and food sources in nature.\n- **Follow-up:** *\"This snail chose THIS place to live. Why? What does it need here?\"*\n\n---\n\n#### Extension 2: **\"What DO YOU Need?\" Personal Needs Chart**\n\nCreate a classroom chart comparing student needs to snail needs.\n\n- **Format:** Large paper divided into sections (Food, Water, Shelter, Air).\n- **Activity:** Students draw pictures of their own needs:\n  - **Food:** Draw their favorite foods.\n  - **Water:** Draw a water bottle or cup.\n  - **Shelter:** Draw their bedroom or home.\n  - **Air:** Draw themselves breathing or playing outside.\n- **Discussion:** *\"Snails and people both need these things! We're both alive!\"*\n- **Display:** Hang in classroom as a visual reminder of common survival needs.\n\n---\n\n#### Extension 3: **\"Design a Snail Home\" (Art + Science Integration)**\n\nStudents create a snail habitat using craft materials.\n\n- **Materials:** Shoebox or paper cup, construction paper, cotton balls (for moss), paint, water, dried food (lettuce, cucumber).\n- **Task:** *\"Design and decorate a home that a snail would love. Remember: it needs water, food, shelter, and safety!\"*\n- **Reflection:** Students explain their design: *\"I put moss here so the snail has shelter. I made it wet because snails need water.\"*\n- **Display:** Set up a classroom \"Snail Homes\" gallery where students view and discuss each other's creations.\n\n---\n\n### Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Snail sourcing:** Biology supply companies (e.g., Carolina Biological Supply) sell live snails; alternatively, collect from outdoor gardens in damp areas during early morning or after rain. Always return snails to their natural habitat after the lesson.\n- **Safety:** Remind students to be gentle with snails. Wash hands after handling. Some students may be hesitant—offer observation-only roles.\n- **Timing flexibility:** If snails are not available, use high-quality photographs or videos of snails in action. The learning objectives remain valid with visual observation.\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Use snail vocabulary multiple times daily for 2-3 days after the lesson to reinforce retention.\n- **Connection to standards:** This lesson directly addresses **K-LS1-1** because students observe snails and describe patterns in what they need to survive, then connect those patterns to other living things (including humans).\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is ready to teach.
