Learning About Hiding and Survival**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90–120 minutes (can be split across two 45–60 minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards Addressed:**\n  - **1-LS1-1:** Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n  - **1-LS3-1:** Make observations to construct an evidence-based account that young plants and animals are like, but not exactly like, their parents.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Identify** how an owl's coloring helps it hide and survive in its environment (camouflage).\n2. **Observe** and describe the colors and patterns on the owl's feathers and explain why they match certain backgrounds.\n3. **Design** a simple camouflage pattern using materials to help an animal blend into a specific habitat.\n4. **Explain** in simple words how an animal's body features help it stay safe and find food.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about why the owl is hard to see and activate prior knowledge about animal colors and hiding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the Eastern Screech Owl on light-colored stone\n- Light-colored brick or stone (if available, otherwise use pictures)\n- Picture of an owl in flight with bright colors (for contrast; e.g., a blue macaw or cardinal for comparison)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or printed large format. Ask students to look carefully but do NOT tell them what animal is in the picture yet.\n\n2. **Pose initial questions to build curiosity:**\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? Can you find it?\" (Many students will have trouble spotting it at first.)\n   - \"What colors do you see? What about the background—what colors is that?\"\n   - \"Why is it hard to see this animal? What do you think?\"\n   - \"If you were a small mouse or bug, would this animal be easy or hard to find? Why?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"This animal is an owl. Why do you think an owl might have brown and gray feathers instead of bright red or blue feathers like a parrot? Turn and talk to a partner about your idea.\"\n\n4. **Reveal the answer** (if students haven't already discovered it): Point out the owl's eyes and ear tufts. Explain that owls blend into their surroundings—we call that **camouflage**.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's explore how animals use their colors to hide and stay safe. You'll get to be a scientist and test this idea!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover through hands-on investigation how colors and patterns help animals hide in different environments.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3–4 students):**\n- Small paper owls (pre-cut or printed) in three versions:\n  - Version A: Gray/brown speckled (like the photograph)\n  - Version B: Bright solid blue or red\n  - Version C: Solid white\n- Three habitat backgrounds printed or displayed:\n  - Light brick/stone\n  - Green leaves/grass\n  - Snow-covered ground\n- Tape or reusable adhesive\n- Data sheet with pictures of the three owls and three habitats (students mark which owl hides best in each habitat)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Setting Up**\n- Divide students into small groups of 3–4.\n- Assign each group one habitat background (or rotate through all three if time allows).\n- Give each group one of each owl color cut-out.\n\n**Step 2: Investigation**\n- Students tape each owl onto their habitat background and observe which one is easiest or hardest to see.\n- Ask: \"Which owl disappears best? Which one is easiest to spot?\"\n- Students stand back 3–5 feet and look again. Does the answer change?\n\n**Step 3: Recording**\n- Students use their data sheet to draw or check off which owl hides best in their habitat.\n- If advanced, have students color their own owl to match a habitat background.\n\n**Step 4: Gallery Walk (if time permits)**\n- Post all three habitats around the room with the owls in place.\n- Students do a quick walk and observe which owl combinations work best.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Why do you think the gray owl hides better on the stone?\" \"What would happen if the blue owl lived on a blue building?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answer; let them observe and think.\n- Encourage observation language: \"I notice,\" \"I see,\" \"It looks like...\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that the speckled gray/brown owl hides best on stone and brick.\n- Students recognize that bright colors (blue, red) stand out against most backgrounds.\n- Students begin to think about why animals have certain colors.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect exploration to the owl photograph and survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large photograph of the owl (re-display)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pictures showing other animals with camouflage (e.g., spotted fawn, green grasshopper, white Arctic fox) — optional but helpful\n- Simple labeled diagram of an owl with body parts\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2–3 groups: \"Which owl hid best in your habitat? Why?\" Write their ideas on chart paper.\n   - Highlight the pattern: Animals with colors that match their home are harder to see.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Use student-friendly language and show the photograph as you teach each term.\n\n   - **Camouflage:** \"Colors and patterns on an animal's body that help it blend in with its surroundings so it's hard to see.\"\n     - Show the owl. \"The owl's gray and brown colors look like stone and brick, so owls hide really well on buildings!\"\n\n   - **Adaptation:** \"A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and stay safe.\"\n     - \"The owl's feather colors are an adaptation. They help the owl hide from bigger animals that might hurt it.\"\n\n   - **Predator:** \"An animal that hunts and eats other animals.\"\n     - \"Owls hide from predators that might try to catch them during the day.\"\n\n   - **Prey:** \"An animal that is hunted and eaten by another animal.\"\n     - \"Owls hunt mice and insects. Those are the owl's prey. The owl's camouflage helps it sneak up on prey without being seen.\"\n\n   - **Survive:** \"To stay alive and safe.\"\n     - \"Camouflage helps owls survive by keeping them safe and helping them catch food.\"\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Return to the original photograph. \"Look at the owl now. Can you see why it's so hard to find? Its colors match the light brick!\"\n   - Point out specific features: speckled pattern, ear tufts, eye placement.\n   - \"The owl's body is built perfectly for hiding on stone. That's why owls live on buildings and around stone structures.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If an owl had bright blue feathers, would it hide well on a brick building? Why or why not?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do YOU think owls need to hide? Who might they be hiding from?\"\n   - Listen for answers about safety and hunting.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (display on chart):**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|------|\n| **Camouflage** | Colors and patterns that help an animal blend in and hide |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive |\n| **Predator** | An animal that hunts other animals |\n| **Prey** | An animal that is hunted and eaten |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and safe |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that camouflage is a body feature that helps animals survive.\n- Students can name at least two reasons an owl needs to hide (safety from predators; hunting prey).\n- Students connect the vocabulary to the photograph and their exploration activity.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply camouflage concepts by designing their own animal hiding solution.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Brown, gray, and white construction paper scraps or colored tissue paper\n- A printed \"habitat card\" showing a simple background (brick wall, grass field, snowy area, or tree bark)\n- Glue stick\n- Scissors (child-safe)\n- Optional: paint chips in earth tones\n- Optional: printed outline of a simple bird or small animal\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Design a Camouflaged Animal (Recommended for most First Graders)**\n\n1. **Introduce the Challenge:** \"We learned that the owl hides by matching its colors to brick. Now YOU will be a designer. Your job is to create a hiding animal that matches a habitat we give you.\"\n\n2. **Assign or Let Students Choose:** Each student (or pair) gets a habitat card:\n   - Rocky/brick wall\n   - Grass field\n   - Snow ground\n   - Tree bark\n\n3. **Design Process:**\n   - Students tear or cut colored paper to match their habitat.\n   - They glue pieces onto an animal outline (pre-cut) or create their own shape.\n   - Goal: Make the animal hard to see on its background.\n\n4. **Sharing:**\n   - Display all designs on a wall. Do a \"camouflage hunt\"—can students find all the animals?\n   - Each student explains: \"My animal has _____ colors because _____.\"\n\n**Option B: Habitat Matching Game (If time is limited)**\n\n1. Show pictures of 5–6 animals (owl, deer, grasshopper, penguin, polar bear, leopard).\n2. Show 5–6 habitat pictures (stone, grass, snow, savanna, forest, etc.).\n3. Students draw a line connecting each animal to the habitat where it hides best and explain why.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Why did you choose those colors?\" \"Will your animal be easy to see?\"\n- Encourage students to test their design: Place it on the habitat—is it hard to find?\n- Scaffold struggling students by offering pre-cut paper pieces they can arrange before gluing.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a camouflaged animal that reasonably matches a given habitat.\n- Students explain their color choices using vocabulary learned (camouflage, hide, blend, survive).\n- Students demonstrate understanding that body features (color) help animals adapt to their homes.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of camouflage, adaptation, and how animal body features help survival.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Observe which owls students select as \"best hidden\" and listen to their reasoning.\n- **During Explain:** Ask vocabulary check-in questions and note which students use terms correctly.\n- **During Elaborate:** Assess whether students choose colors that actually match their habitat and can explain their choice.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit slip. You may read it aloud and have students respond orally, or advanced students can mark answers with teacher support.\n\n**Option A: Picture-Based Questions (Recommended for most First Graders)**\n\nShow a picture or re-display the original owl photograph.\n\n1. **Question 1:** \"What color is the owl in this picture?\" \n   - Circle: Gray / Brown / Blue / Red\n\n2. **Question 2:** \"What is the owl sitting on?\"\n   - Circle: Grass / Stone and Brick / Snow / Water\n\n3. **Question 3:** \"Why is the owl hard to see?\" (Students can draw or say one reason)\n   - Sentence starter: \"The owl is hard to see because it is _____.\"\n\n4. **Question 4:** \"What word means when an animal's colors help it hide?\"\n   - Say: Camouflage / Predator / Prey / Habitat\n   - Students point to or say the right word.\n\n**Option B: Observation Drawing + Sentence (For advanced students)**\n\n- Provide a simple outline of a bird and a brick-colored background.\n- Student colors the bird to hide on the brick.\n- Student writes or dictates: \"I made my bird _____ colors so it would hide on _____.\"\n\n**Success Criteria (How to Know Students Met Learning Objectives):**\n\n✓ **Objective 1 (Camouflage identification):** Student can identify at least one color or pattern on the owl that helps it hide. Example: \"Gray like stone.\"\n\n✓ **Objective 2 (Observation & description):** Student describes colors on the owl and its background and explains a connection. Example: \"The owl is brown and the brick is brown, so you can't see it.\"\n\n✓ **Objective 3 (Design camouflage):** Student creates an animal that uses colors/patterns to match a habitat reasonably well.\n\n✓ **Objective 4 (Body features & survival):** Student uses \"hide,\" \"camouflage,\" or \"safe\" when explaining why an animal's colors matter. Example: \"Camouflage helps the owl hide from the hawk.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify that the owl's colors match its background.\n- Most students explain one reason camouflage helps animals (safety or hunting).\n- Students demonstrate understanding by creating a camouflaged design and articulating their choice.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:**\n   - Use only \"hide,\" \"colors,\" and \"safe\" if full vocabulary is overwhelming.\n   - Pair multi-syllabic words with pictures every time.\n\n2. **Pre-Made Choices:**\n   - During Elaborate, provide only 2 color choices instead of many options. Example: \"Pick gray or blue to hide on the brick.\"\n   - Use larger pre-cut animal shapes so students only arrange and glue—no cutting required.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Exit Ticket:**\n   - Provide highly structured prompts: \"The owl is hard to see because _____.\" (Offer 2 options: \"it is gray\" or \"it blends in.\")\n   - Accept one-word answers or pointing to pictures.\n\n4. **One-to-One Support During Explore:**\n   - Pair struggling students with a peer or TA to help place owls and observe together.\n   - Ask them simpler questions: \"Which owl can you see the best? Which one hides?\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-Habitat Camouflage Design:**\n   - Give advanced students a habitat with MULTIPLE colors/textures (e.g., a brick wall with ivy, or a snowy forest).\n   - Challenge them to create an animal with a mixed pattern that blends into multiple environments.\n   - Ask: \"Can you make an animal that hides in TWO places? How?\"\n\n2. **Research & Discussion:**\n   - Show pictures of other camouflaged animals (stick insect, Arctic hare, tree frog).\n   - Ask: \"How is the owl's camouflage like the grasshopper's? How is it different?\"\n   - Advanced students can create a comparison chart: \"Animal / Habitat / Camouflage Colors.\"\n\n3. **Problem-Solving Extension:**\n   - Present a scenario: \"If an owl lived in a green forest instead of on stone buildings, what color would its feathers need to be? Draw a new owl.\"\n   - Ask students to predict: \"What if an owl had bright red feathers? Where could it hide? Would it survive?\"\n\n4. **Vocabulary Depth:**\n   - Introduce and use terms like \"adaptation,\" \"predator,\" and \"prey\" in context during their explanations.\n   - Ask: \"Why is camouflage an adaptation? How does it help the owl adapt to its home?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Outdoor Camouflage Hunt (15–20 minutes)**\n   - Take students outside and challenge them to find things in nature that are camouflaged (brown leaves, green bugs on plants, stones that blend together).\n   - Create a class list: \"What did we find that was hard to see? Why?\"\n   - This reinforces that camouflage exists everywhere in nature.\n\n2. **Animal Camouflage Matching Game (Homework or Center Activity)**\n   - Send home or set up a center with pictures of animals (owl, deer, frog, penguin, etc.) and pictures of habitats.\n   - Students draw lines matching animals to where they hide best and color in the animals with appropriate camouflage colors.\n   - Parents/guardians can ask: \"Why did you match that animal to that place?\"\n\n3. **Camouflage Story & Art (Literacy Connection, 2–3 days)**\n   - Read a picture book about animals hiding (e.g., *Hide and Seek* by Corey R. Tabor, or a similar text).\n   - Students illustrate and dictate a sentence: \"My animal hides because _____.\"\n   - Create a class book: \"Why Do Animals Hide? A Camouflage Discovery Book.\"\n   - This bridges life science with language arts and reinforces learning.\n\n4. **Parent Letter & Home Activity**\n   - Send home a simple letter explaining camouflage.\n   - Challenge families to find one camouflaged animal at home or in a photo and bring it to school.\n   - Example: \"Find an animal (real or in a picture) that is hard to see. Why is it hard to see?\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Prior Knowledge:** First graders may not yet understand why animals NEED to hide. Emphasize: \"Owls hide to stay safe and to surprise their food (mice and bugs).\"\n- **Vocabulary Readiness:** Use visuals (photographs, drawings) alongside every new term. Many First Graders are not yet reading, so oral language and images are essential.\n- **Real Owl Photos:** Use high-quality, close-up photos of owls on different backgrounds (stone, tree bark, leaf litter) throughout the lesson to reinforce the camouflage concept.\n- **Safety Consideration:** If you use scissors, supervise carefully and provide child-safe versions. Alternatively, pre-cut all paper pieces for students.\n- **Engagement Hook:** Many First Graders love animals. Starting with \"Can you find the owl?\" is highly engaging because it's a puzzle they can solve.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly uses the photograph to explore life science concepts of adaptation, camouflage, and survival while keeping language, activities, and assessment age-appropriate for First Grade.",
