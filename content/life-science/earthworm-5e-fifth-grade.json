Describe the role of earthworms as decomposers in breaking down dead organic matter and cycling nutrients back to soil.\n2. Explain how earthworms' tunneling activities improve soil quality and support plant growth.\n3. Create a model showing how matter (nutrients) moves between earthworms, plants, soil, and the environment.\n4. Identify earthworms as a key organism in soil food webs and explain their importance to ecosystem health.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about earthworms and their role in soil.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of an earthworm on grass and soil\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or print it large. Ask students to observe quietly for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (write them on the board):\n   - \"Where do you think this earthworm lives, and what do you think it does there?\"\n   - \"What would happen to dead leaves and grass if there were no earthworms in the soil?\"\n   - \"How might earthworms help plants grow in a garden or field?\"\n   - \"Why do you think earthworms come to the surface after it rains?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to show you something amazing about what earthworms do underground. Before we start, I want you to predict: Do you think earthworms help or hurt the soil where plants grow? Why?\" Have students turn to a partner and discuss for one minute, then collect 2-3 predictions on the chart.\n\n4. **Activation of prior knowledge:** Ask, \"What do you already know about what earthworms eat?\" Accept all responses without judgment; write ideas on the chart to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become soil scientists and discover exactly how earthworms recycle dead stuff in soil and make it useful again for plants.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how earthworms break down organic matter and improve soil through hands-on observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 2-liter clear plastic bottles (one per group of 3-4 students)\n- Soil (potting soil or garden soil)\n- Dead leaves, grass clippings, and small pieces of vegetable scraps\n- Water (spray bottle)\n- Earthworms (2-3 per bottle; can be obtained from a bait shop or collected from garden)\n- Rulers\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Observation sheets (see below)\n- Black cloth or paper to wrap around bottles (optional, for creating burrows)\n- Labels and markers\n\n**Observation Sheet Template (provide to each group):**\n```\nEARTHWORM OBSERVATION SHEET\nGroup: ________________     Date: ________________\n\nWhat we put in the bottle at the start:\n- Soil layer depth: _____ cm\n- Organic matter: ________________\n\nWhat we observed the earthworms doing:\nDay 1: _________________________________\nDay 2: _________________________________\nDay 3: _________________________________\n\nChanges in the soil:\n- Soil looks: ____________________________\n- Tunnels/burrows: ______________________\n- Organic matter: ________________________\n\nQuestions: _______________________________\n```\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Layer your bottle:** Fill a 2-liter bottle with alternating 2-3 cm layers of soil and dead organic matter (leaves, grass, vegetable scraps). Use the ruler to measure each layer. Lightly mist with water so the soil is damp but not soggy.\n\n2. **Add earthworms:** Gently place 2-3 earthworms on top of your layers. Observe their initial behavior. Record: Do they burrow immediately or stay on the surface?\n\n3. **Wrap with black cloth** (optional): Earthworms prefer darkness, so wrapping the outside of the bottle in black cloth or paper will encourage burrowing while allowing you to unwrap it to observe.\n\n4. **Observe daily:** Over the next 2-3 days (or up to one week if the lesson extends), unwrap and observe once per day for 3-5 minutes. Use the hand lens to look closely at:\n   - Are there visible tunnels/burrows?\n   - Has the organic matter changed in appearance (color, texture, size)?\n   - Are soil layers still distinct, or are they mixed?\n   - Where are the earthworms positioned?\n\n5. **Record observations** on your sheet using drawings, measurements, and words.\n\n6. **Final observation:** On the last day, gently tip the bottle and observe the bottom. Compare the texture and appearance of soil at the bottom (where earthworms spent most time) to soil at the top.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to each group and ask guiding questions: \"What changes do you notice in the soil?\" \"Where are the earthworms spending their time?\" \"What do you think the earthworms are doing to the dead leaves?\" Avoid telling students what they \"should\" see; let them discover.\n- Model gentle handling of earthworms and emphasize treating them with care.\n- Help groups that struggle with observation by pointing out features without explaining their meaning: \"I notice the soil in the middle looks darker here. What do you observe?\"\n- Ensure bottles stay moist (not waterlogged) and that earthworms remain alive.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will observe earthworms burrowing through layers of soil.\n- Students will see that organic matter (leaves, grass) breaks down or disappears over time.\n- Students will notice soil layers become mixed and less distinct, especially where earthworms have tunneled.\n- Students will discover that soil becomes darker, richer-looking, and more uniform in texture.\n- Students will document evidence through drawings, measurements, and written observations.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the science behind what students observed.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Diagram or poster showing the role of decomposers in a food web (teacher-created or printed)\n- Images of nutrients moving through soil (teacher resource)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Ask 2-3 groups to briefly share one key observation from their earthworm bottles. Write observations on a chart under the heading \"What We Discovered About Earthworms.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (7-8 minutes):** Define each term using student-friendly language and connect back to what students observed:\n\n   - **Decomposer:** An organism that breaks down dead plants and animals into smaller pieces and helps return nutrients to the soil. \"Earthworms are decomposers because they eat dead leaves and grass, and they break them apart into tiny pieces that mix into the soil.\"\n\n   - **Organic Matter:** Dead or living material that comes from plants and animals. \"The leaves and grass clippings you put in your bottles were organic matter. Earthworms broke them down.\"\n\n   - **Nutrient:** A substance that living things need to survive and grow, like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. \"When earthworms break down dead things, they release nutrients that plants need. These nutrients mix into the soil so roots can absorb them.\"\n\n   - **Decomposition:** The process of breaking down dead material into simpler materials. \"You saw decomposition happening when the leaves in your bottles gradually disappeared and turned into soil.\"\n\n   - **Soil Ecosystem:** All the living things (earthworms, bacteria, fungi, insects, roots) and non-living things (soil, water, minerals) in soil working together. \"Your earthworm bottles showed a tiny soil ecosystem.\"\n\n3. **Explain the concept (5 minutes):** Use a simple diagram or draw one on the board:\n\n   ```\n   Dead Leaves & Grass → Earthworms Eat & Tunnel → Broken Down Organic Matter\n   (Organic Matter)      (Decomposition)        → Nutrients Released into Soil\n                                               → Plants Absorb Nutrients\n                                               → Plants Grow Stronger\n   ```\n\n   \"Earthworms are like the recycling center of the soil. Dead plants that fall to the ground get broken down by earthworms and other decomposers. This releases nutrients that were locked up in those dead plants. Now those nutrients are free in the soil, and plant roots can drink them up. When plants absorb these nutrients, they grow bigger and stronger. Eventually, those plants die, fall to the ground, and the whole cycle starts again.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2-3 minutes):** Ask students to turn to a partner and explain: \"Why are earthworms important for helping plants grow?\" Listen to 1-2 pair explanations and clarify misconceptions.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Chart (Display for students to reference):**\n\n| Term | Kid-Friendly Definition |\n|------|------------------------|\n| **Decomposer** | An animal or tiny living thing that breaks down dead stuff and turns it into nutrients for soil |\n| **Organic Matter** | Dead plants, dead animals, leaves, food scraps—anything that was once alive |\n| **Nutrient** | Food for plants; special minerals in soil that plant roots need to grow big and strong |\n| **Decomposition** | The breaking-down process that turns dead stuff into soil |\n| **Soil Ecosystem** | All the living and non-living things in soil working together as a community |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can define decomposer and identify earthworms as decomposers.\n- Students understand that decomposition releases nutrients that plants need.\n- Students see the connection between their Explore observations and the formal vocabulary.\n- Students can explain (in simple terms) why earthworms are important to soil health.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by creating a model of matter cycling through an ecosystem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper (11\" x 14\" or chart paper), one per group of 3-4 students\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Scissors\n- Glue sticks\n- Pre-cut pictures or shapes of: earthworms, plants, dead leaves, sun, soil, decomposed matter, plant roots (teacher-created or printed from clipart)\n- Arrows or yarn to show movement of matter\n- Optional: Digital tool (Google Draw, Canva, or similar) for tech-savvy groups\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the model task (2 minutes):** \"Now that we know how earthworms recycle dead stuff, we're going to create a visual model showing how matter—the nutrients and organic stuff—moves around in a soil ecosystem. Think of it like creating a journey map that shows where nutrients come from and where they go.\"\n\n2. **Model creation (10-12 minutes):** Each group creates a labeled diagram showing:\n   - The sun (energy source)\n   - A living plant with leaves and roots\n   - Dead leaves falling to the soil\n   - Earthworms in the soil\n   - Soil with nutrients mixed in\n   - Arrows showing:\n     - Sun energy helping plants grow\n     - Dead matter falling to soil\n     - Earthworms breaking down dead matter\n     - Nutrients moving back into soil\n     - Plant roots absorbing nutrients\n\n   **Teacher guidance:** \"Your diagram should show a cycle. Matter doesn't disappear—it moves from one place to another. Use arrows to show the path that matter takes as it moves through the system.\"\n\n3. **Group presentation (5-8 minutes):** Have 1-2 groups share their models. Ask the presenting group: \"Show us one arrow on your diagram and explain what's happening at each step.\" Ask observing students: \"What part of the cycle involves earthworms?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Provide sentence frames for groups to use: \"This arrow shows __________ moving from __________ to __________.\"\n- Help groups who struggle by asking, \"Where did the plant get its nutrients? How did they get there? What happened to the old leaves?\"\n- Encourage precision in labeling so that a reader unfamiliar with the topic could follow the cycle.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students create a model showing matter (nutrients, organic material) cycling between plants, decomposers, soil, and the environment.\n- Students use arrows and labels to show the direction and type of movement.\n- Students can explain their model using vocabulary learned in the Explain phase.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that matter is conserved—it changes form but doesn't disappear.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of decomposition, nutrient cycling, and the role of earthworms in ecosystems.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observation of group discussions during Engage\n- Review of completed Observation Sheets from Explore phase (check for accuracy and detail)\n- Listening to pair-shares during Explain phase vocabulary check\n- Observation of model creation process and student explanations in Elaborate phase\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet or digital form with these questions:\n\n```\nEARTHWORM EXIT TICKET\n\n1. What is the main job of earthworms in the soil?\n   a) To eat plants while they are still growing\n   b) To break down dead plants and return nutrients to soil\n   c) To drink water\n   d) To tunnel so rain can fall down faster\n\n2. Draw a simple picture showing: \n   - Dead leaves\n   - An earthworm\n   - Soil with nutrients\n   Use arrows to show how matter moves between them.\n\n3. In one or two sentences, explain why farmers and gardeners like having \n   earthworms in their soil.\n\nCHALLENGE QUESTION (for advanced learners):\n4. If there were NO earthworms in the soil, what would eventually happen \n   to plants growing in that soil? Why?\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Proficient Understanding:**\n- Correct answer to question 1 (b)\n- Drawing shows clear arrows indicating matter movement between leaves, earthworms, and soil\n- Written explanation mentions nutrients, growth, or soil health\n- Reasoning is logical and uses vocabulary from the lesson\n\n✓ **Developing Understanding:**\n- Partially correct answer to question 1\n- Drawing shows some movement but lacks clarity or labels\n- Written explanation shows incomplete understanding of the role of earthworms\n\n✓ **Beginning Understanding:**\n- Incorrect answer to question 1\n- Drawing is incomplete or shows no clear connection\n- Written explanation is vague or incorrect\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most students (80%+) will correctly identify earthworms as decomposers that break down dead organic matter and return nutrients to soil.\n- Students will create or describe a cycle showing matter moving through an ecosystem.\n- Students will articulate (in writing or verbally) the connection between earthworms and plant health.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a sheet with pictures and checkboxes instead of open-ended questions. Example: \"Did you see tunnels? ☐ Yes  ☐ No. Draw the tunnels you saw.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create and post a permanent chart with pictures and definitions of key terms. Allow students to reference it throughout the lesson and during the exit ticket.\n\n3. **Paired Model Creation:** Allow students who struggle with independent model work to partner with a stronger peer. Assign specific roles: one student draws, one labels; one explains, one records.\n\n4. **Modified Exit Ticket:** Offer a multiple-choice version for all questions instead of open-ended drawing or writing. Provide word bank: \"nutrients, tunnels, dead leaves, grow, soil\"\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Investigation:** Ask students to research and predict: \"What would happen to earthworms and soil if the temperature dropped to freezing? How do earthworms survive winter?\" Have them create a presentation or poster.\n\n2. **Deeper Cycling Model:** Challenge students to expand their cycling model to include other decomposers (bacteria, fungi, millipedes) or other organisms in the food web (birds eating earthworms, etc.). Ask them to research and add these organisms to show a more complete ecosystem.\n\n3. **Design Challenge:** \"Design a garden or farm system that would attract and support a healthy earthworm population. What conditions do earthworms need? How would you create those conditions?\" Have students sketch their design with labels.\n\n4. **Quantitative Analysis:** If students graphed the breakdown of organic matter over the observation period, have them calculate the rate of decomposition or make predictions about how long it would take to fully decompose a full layer of leaves.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Vermicomposting Project:** Set up a small vermicomposting bin in the classroom using a plastic storage container, soil, and earthworms. Students feed it kitchen scraps (fruit/vegetable only—no meat or dairy) over several weeks and observe how quickly the earthworms break down waste and produce rich compost. This extends the lesson into a long-term observation project and connects to real-world composting and sustainability.\n\n2. **Earthworm Habitat Research & Report:** Students research earthworm species found in your local area or region. They create an informational poster or digital presentation answering: \"Where do earthworms live? What do they eat? How many eggs does one earthworm lay? What are their predators?\" This adds depth to understanding earthworms as organisms adapted to their environments.\n\n3. **Soil Quality Comparison Study:** Students collect soil samples from different locations (garden with earthworms, compacted soil without visible earthworms, etc.). They compare the texture, color, smell, water absorption, and richness of each sample, then infer which soils have healthy earthworm populations. They present findings on a comparison chart: \"Evidence That Earthworms Improve Soil Quality.\"\n\n---\n\n**Lesson Completion Notes:**\n\nThis lesson engages fifth graders in hands-on discovery of decomposition and nutrient cycling—core concepts in ecosystem function. By observing earthworms directly, students develop a concrete, evidence-based understanding of the role of decomposers, making the abstract concept of \"matter cycling\" tangible and meaningful. The 5E sequence moves from curiosity, through direct observation, to formal vocabulary, then to model-building that demonstrates mastery. The alignment to 5-LS2-1 is strong: students develop and explain a model of matter movement involving plants, animals (earthworms), decomposers, and the environment.",
