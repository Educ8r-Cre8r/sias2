The katydid's body and wings are almost the same color as the plants around it, making it very hard to see. The katydid has long legs, long antennae, and wings that look like leaves.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon: Camouflage**\n\nThis image illustrates **camouflage**—when an animal's color or shape helps it blend in with its environment. The katydid's green color matches the green plants around it, which helps keep it safe from predators (animals that hunt it). This happens because katydids that match their environment are harder to find and eat, so they survive longer and have babies. Over many, many years, katydids developed green coloring through a process called natural selection.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Camouflage:** Animals can hide by blending in with their surroundings using color and shape.\n\n* **Adaptation:** Special features that help animals survive in their homes. A katydid's green color is an adaptation that helps it hide.\n\n* **Predator and Prey:** Some animals hunt other animals for food. Katydids must hide from predators to stay safe.\n\n* **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. Katydids live in grassy, leafy areas where green helps them blend in.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFor Kindergarteners, focus on the concrete observation first: \"Can you find the katydid in the grass?\" This engages their natural curiosity before introducing the \"why\" (it hides because of its color). Use the photo as a visual puzzle rather than diving into evolutionary language. Repeat the word \"camouflage\" consistently so students build familiarity with scientific vocabulary through repetition and context.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Representation:** Provide a printed photo of the katydid image alongside a highlighted or circled version showing where the insect is located. This supports students with visual processing differences. Consider also describing the image aloud (\"I see green leaves, green stems, and a green insect that looks like a leaf\").\n\n**Action & Expression:** Allow students to show their learning through multiple modalities—pointing, drawing, acting out (pretending to hide), or verbally describing what they see. Not all students will be ready to write or speak formally; some may express understanding through movement or dramatic play.\n\n**Engagement:** Connect to students' real-world experience: \"Have you ever played hide-and-seek?

    "firstgrade": "# First Grade Science Lesson Analysis: Katydid Camouflage\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a katydid—an insect that looks like a large green grasshopper—sitting on grass and plant stems. The katydid's body is bright green, just like the leaves and grass around it, making it very hard to spot. You can see its long antennae, wings folded on its back, and strong back legs designed for jumping.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why is this insect so hard to see in the grass?\n\nThis image demonstrates **camouflage** (also called protective coloration), a survival strategy where animals have colors, patterns, and shapes that match their environment. The katydid's green body blends in with green plants because natural selection has favored individuals whose coloring helps them hide from predators. Over many generations, katydids with greener bodies survived longer and had more babies, passing along genes for green coloring. This is an observable example of how animals adapt to their habitats to stay safe.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Camouflage is an adaptation:** Animals have body colors and shapes that help them survive in their environment. The katydid's green color helps it hide from predators like birds.\n\n* **Colors help animals survive:** Animals that blend in with their surroundings are harder for predators to find and eat. This keeps them alive longer.\n\n* **Animals live in habitats:** Habitats are homes where animals find food, water, and shelter. The katydid lives in grassy, leafy areas where green coloring helps it hide.\n\n* **Animals have different body parts for different jobs:** Katydids have long antennae for sensing their environment, wings for flying, and strong back legs for jumping away from danger.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFor First Grade, focus on the observable trait: \"The katydid is green like the grass!\" rather than complex genetic explanations. Use the phrase \"camouflage\" repeatedly so students build academic vocabulary. Point out specific details (body color, leaf shape similarity) with your finger on the image to guide student attention.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nTo support diverse learners, provide a printed image of the katydid on grass so students who struggle with screen viewing can examine it closely. Offer tactile comparisons by letting students hold green fabric samples next to real grass. For English learners, create a visual word wall with picture cards for: katydid, camouflage, green, grass, hide, predator. Allow students to respond to questions through drawing, verbal language, or gesture rather than writing.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** \n1-LS1-1: Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-LS1.A]]: All organisms have external parts (like color and shape) that help them survive.\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-LS4.B]]: Animals have different body parts that help them survive in their habitats.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]: The pattern of green color in the katydid matches the pattern of green in grass and leaves.\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]]: The katydid's green color (structure) helps it hide and survive (function).\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why is it hard to see the katydid in this picture?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **What would happen to a red katydid sitting in green grass? Who might see it?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **Can you find three things in the picture that are the same color as the katydid? Why do you think that helps the katydid?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n4. **What other animals do you think might use camouflage to hide from animals that want to eat them?** (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Camouflage:** When an animal's colors or patterns help it hide in its environment so predators cannot easily see it.\n\n* **Katydid:** A large green insect with long antennae and wings that looks similar to a grasshopper.\n\n* **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and stay safe in its habitat.\n\n* **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals for food.\n\n* **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter.\n\n* **Antennae:** Long, thin body parts on an insect's head used to sense and feel the environment.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Camouflage Hide-and-Seek Game:** Place small green paper cutouts of katydids on a green poster board with various green objects (leaves, grass clippings, green construction paper). Challenge students to find the hidden katydids. Discuss why some were easier or harder to find. Then repeat with a red katydid on the same background to show how poor camouflage makes an animal visible to predators.\n\n2. **Create Your Own Camouflaged Animal:** Provide students with magazines, colored paper, and a \"habitat\" background (green grass field, blue ocean, brown forest floor, etc.). Students cut out or draw an animal and color or decorate it to match their chosen habitat. Display creations and have classmates try to spot each camouflaged animal.\n\n3. **Nature Hunt Observation:** Take students on a short outdoor walk to search for animals that are hard to see because of their coloring. Look for insects on plants, birds in trees, or spiders on branches. Photograph or sketch findings and discuss how each animal's color helps it hide. Create a class book titled \"Animals That Hide.\"\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *The Mixed-Up Chameleon* by Eric Carle — A story about color-changing animals and adaptation (though chameleons change color differently than camouflage, it introduces the concept of color and survival).\n* *Hide and Seek: Animals in Camouflage* by John Woodward — A factual, beautifully illustrated book showing 12 animals with camouflage.\n* *Who Is the Beast?* by Keith Baker — An engaging story exploring how animals use camouflage and color to blend in.\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n* **\"Animal Camouflage for Kids\"** by Crash Course Kids — A 5-minute overview of camouflage with clear examples and fun animation.

The phenomenon is immediately visible and relatable—students can understand why hiding helps an animal stay safe. Use real or high-quality photos whenever possible, and encourage students to find camouflaged creatures in their own outdoor environments to deepen engagement and observation skills.",
    "secondgrade": "# Katydid Camouflage: Second Grade Science Lesson Analysis\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a katydid (a grasshopper-like insect) resting on green plant stems and leaves. The katydid's body is bright green, which helps it blend in with the surrounding plants. You can see its long legs, wings, and antennae clearly in the photo.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** *Camouflage—Why an animal's color and shape help it hide from predators.*\n\nThe katydid appears green because of natural selection and adaptation. Over many generations, katydids with green coloring survived better than those with other colors because predators had a harder time seeing them among green plants. This trait was passed down to offspring, so today most katydids are green. This is **protective coloration**—the insect's color matches its environment, making it harder for birds and other predators to spot it. The katydid's long, thin body shape also mimics the stems and leaves it lives on, providing additional camouflage.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment. The katydid's green color is an adaptation that helps it hide from predators.\n\n* **Camouflage (Protective Coloration):** When an animal's color, pattern, or shape blends in with its surroundings so predators cannot see it easily.\n\n* **Predator and Prey Relationships:** Predators (like birds) hunt prey (like katydids). Animals with better camouflage are less likely to be caught, so they survive and have babies that inherit the same helpful traits.\n\n* **Inherited Traits:** Characteristics that an animal gets from its parents, like green color. Traits that help animals survive are more likely to be passed to the next generation.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching camouflage to Second Graders, use a concrete \"hide and seek\" analogy: \"The katydid plays hide and seek with birds every day. Its green color is like wearing a green shirt to hide in the grass!\" This relatable comparison helps young learners understand why camouflage matters without overwhelming them with complex evolutionary language.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nTo support diverse learners: (1) Provide real specimens or high-quality photos of katydids in different environments; (2) Offer hands-on materials (colored paper, leaves, twigs) so kinesthetic learners can create their own camouflaged insects; (3) Use picture books and video clips alongside text to engage visual and auditory learners; (4) Allow students to respond through drawing, speaking, or acting out predator-prey scenarios rather than only written responses.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** \n2-LS4-1: Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n* [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS4.A]] — Every organism has different traits, and sometimes traits help animals survive in their environment (camouflage, color, shape).\n* [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS4.D]] — There are many kinds of living things in any area, and they exist in different places because of the traits that help them survive there.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] — The pattern of green color matching green plants shows how nature provides patterns that help animals survive.\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] — The katydid's body shape and color (structure) allow it to hide and survive (function).\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why do you think the katydid is green instead of bright red or blue?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **If a katydid lived on brown tree bark instead of green leaves, what color do you think it would be, and why?** (Bloom's: Synthesize | DOK: 3)\n\n3. **What animals do you think hunt katydids, and how does being green help the katydid stay safe?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 2)\n\n4. **Can you think of another animal that is colored to match where it lives? How does its color help it survive?** (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Camouflage:** Colors, patterns, or shapes that help an animal hide by blending in with its surroundings.\n\n* **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal live and survive in its home.\n\n* **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals.\n\n* **Prey:** An animal that is hunted and eaten by other animals.\n\n* **Trait:** A characteristic or feature of an animal's body, like its color, size, or shape.\n\n* **Blend In:** To match or mix with the colors and patterns around something so it is hard to see.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Camouflage Hunt Game:** Hide colored paper cutouts of insects (green, yellow, red, blue) among real plants outdoors or in a classroom nature display. Have students find the insects and discuss which colors were easiest and hardest to find. Connect this to why green katydids are harder for predators to spot on green plants.\n\n2. **Design Your Own Camouflaged Insect:** Provide students with craft materials (colored paper, markers, pipe cleaners, fabric scraps) and have them create an insect and choose a habitat for it (forest, desert, snow, sand, mud). Students must color and design their insect to match the habitat. Display the insects in their habitats and have classmates guess what the insect looks like before revealing it.\n\n3. **Katydid Observation Journal:** If possible, set up a live katydid observation station (or show video clips of katydids in nature). Have students draw the katydid and write or dictate observations about its color, where it rests, and how it moves. Encourage them to notice how the katydid's shape and color help it hide.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *The Mixed-Up Chameleon* by Eric Carle — A story about a chameleon that changes colors, exploring color and camouflage in an engaging, illustrated format.\n* *Hiding* by DK Findout (or similar non-fiction picture books about animal camouflage) — Simple, photo-based explanations of how different animals use camouflage.\n* *Who Hides?* by Yuki Kiuchi — A picture book exploring how different animals use camouflage in nature.\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n* **\"Camouflage in Nature\" - National Geographic Kids** (Approximately 5 minutes)  \n  Description: A short, engaging video showing real animals (including insects) using camouflage to hide in their environments.

By connecting the visible green color to survival advantages, students develop early understanding of natural selection without complex terminology. Encourage outdoor observations and hands-on activities to deepen engagement.",
    "thirdgrade": "# Third Grade Science Lesson Analysis: Katydid Camouflage\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a katydid, an insect that looks like a green leaf, resting on grass and plant stems. You can see how the katydid's body, wings, and legs are all colored green, just like the plants around it. This makes it very hard to spot the katydid among the grass and leaves because it blends in so well.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Animal Camouflage—Why does the katydid look like the plants it lives on?\n\nThe katydid's green color and leaf-shaped wings are examples of **camouflage**, a trait that helps animals hide from predators. Over many generations, katydids with green coloring survived better than those with other colors because they weren't eaten as easily. Animals that match their environment are harder for predators to see, so they live longer and have babies. This process is called natural selection. The katydid's shape, color, and texture all match grass and leaves so well that other animals have a harder time finding it.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Camouflage as an Adaptation:** An adaptation is a body part or behavior that helps an animal survive. The katydid's green color is an adaptation that helps it hide from predators like birds and reptiles.\n\n* **Traits and Inheritance:** Organisms have traits (characteristics) that are passed down from parents to offspring. The katydid's green color is a trait that comes from its parents and can be passed to its babies.\n\n* **Variation in Populations:** Not all katydids look exactly the same—some may be lighter or darker green, or have slightly different shapes. This variation helps some katydids survive better in different environments.\n\n* **Habitat and Environment Fit:** Animals' bodies and behaviors match the places where they live. The katydid lives on plants, and its appearance matches plants perfectly.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching camouflage, use actual live insects or high-quality photos in a progressive sequence: first show the insect alone, then show it in its habitat. This builds cognitive demand and allows students to experience the \"aha moment\" when they finally spot the creature. This concrete discovery is more powerful than simply telling students the insect is camouflaged.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nTo support diverse learners, provide multiple means of representation: (1) Use real images AND illustrations labeled with color and shape; (2) Offer a simplified diagram showing how camouflage works with arrows; (3) Include a video clip showing a katydid moving in grass so kinesthetic learners can see the blending effect in motion.

    "fourthgrade": "# Fourth Grade Science Lesson: Katydid Camouflage\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a katydid, an insect that looks like a green leaf, resting on grass and plant stems. You can see how the katydid's green wings and body blend in perfectly with the green plants around it, making it very hard to spot. This is an excellent example of how some animals change their appearance to hide from predators.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Camouflage (or protective coloration)\n\nThe katydid in this image demonstrates **camouflage**—a survival adaptation where an organism's color, pattern, or shape matches its environment. Scientifically, this happens through natural selection over many generations. Katydids with green coloring were more likely to survive predation because predators couldn't see them easily among green plants. These katydids survived to reproduce and passed this green coloring trait to their offspring. Over time, the katydid population became predominantly green. This is not a conscious choice by the katydid; rather, it's an inherited physical trait that helps the species survive in grassy, leafy environments.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Adaptation:** A trait that helps an organism survive and reproduce in its environment. The katydid's green color is an adaptation that helps it hide from predators.\n\n* **Camouflage/Protective Coloration:** When an animal's color or pattern matches its surroundings so it can hide. The katydid looks like a green leaf, so predators have a harder time seeing it.\n\n* **Natural Selection:** Over time, organisms with traits that help them survive are more likely to have offspring. Katydids that were green survived better and passed this trait to their babies.\n\n* **Predator-Prey Relationships:** Predators hunt other animals (prey) for food. Camouflage helps prey animals escape being eaten.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching camouflage, avoid the misconception that animals \"choose\" to change color or intentionally hide. Fourth graders often anthropomorphize animals. Emphasize that camouflage is an *inherited trait* that develops over many generations through natural selection, not a conscious decision made by individual animals.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nTo support diverse learners:\n- **Representation:** Show multiple photos of different animals with camouflage (stick insects, moths, deer) so students see patterns across examples, not just one case.\n- **Action/Expression:** Allow students to demonstrate understanding through drawing, creating a camouflaged animal with craft materials, or playing a \"spot the animal\" game rather than only through written responses.\n- **Engagement:** Connect to student interests by asking, \"What animal would YOU hide from?\" to make the predator-prey relationship personal and relevant.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n4-LS1-1: Construct an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water. (Note: While this specific PE focuses on plant growth, the camouflage concept is better aligned with the PE below.)\n\n**Better-Aligned Performance Expectation:**\n4-LS4-2: Make observations and write descriptions about the diversity of animal structures that contribute to different functions. (Structures like leaf-like wings contribute to camouflage function.)\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-LS4.A]] - Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-LS4.C]] - Adaptation\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]]\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why do you think the katydid is green instead of red or blue?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n   *This question asks students to connect the katydid's color to its environment.*\n\n2. **If a katydid lived on brown tree bark instead of green grass, what might happen to katydids with green wings over many years?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n   *This pushes students to think about natural selection and adaptation over time.*\n\n3. **What predators do you think hunt katydids, and how does camouflage help the katydid survive?** (Bloom's: Comprehend/Apply | DOK: 2)\n   *This helps students understand predator-prey relationships.*\n\n4. **Can you think of another animal that uses camouflage to hide? How is its hiding method similar to or different from the katydid's?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n   *This allows for comparative thinking and transfers learning to other organisms.*\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment (the katydid's green color is an adaptation).\n\n* **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or pattern looks like its surroundings so predators can't see it easily.\n\n* **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals (a bird that eats katydids is a predator).\n\n* **Prey:** An animal that is hunted and eaten by other animals (a katydid is prey for birds and spiders).\n\n* **Natural Selection:** The process where organisms with helpful traits survive longer and have more babies, passing those traits to the next generation.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Camouflage Hunt Game:** Hide paper cutouts of various colored insects (green, red, blue, yellow) on a bulletin board or poster board filled with green leaves, brown bark images, or other natural textures. Have students count how many of each color they can find in 30 seconds. Discuss why green insects were easiest/hardest to find. This demonstrates camouflage's effectiveness firsthand.\n\n2. **Design Your Own Camouflaged Animal:** Give students a specific habitat (forest floor, snow, ocean sand, or desert) and ask them to draw and color an animal that would be camouflaged there. Have them explain in 2-3 sentences why their animal's colors and patterns would help it hide. This applies the concept creatively and develops predictive thinking.\n\n3. **Observational Nature Walk:** Take students outside to observe insects and small animals in the school garden or nearby green space. Challenge them to find as many camouflaged creatures as possible (grasshoppers, crickets, moths on tree bark, caterpillars on leaves). Photograph or sketch findings and create a classroom display. This grounds the lesson in real-world observation and builds scientific observation skills.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *The Mixed-Up Chameleon* by Eric Carle (explores color change and adaptation in an engaging, illustrated format)\n* *Who Hides Here?* by Wendy Pfeffer (focuses on animal camouflage across different habitats)\n* *Hiding in Plain Sight: How Animals Disguise Themselves* by Celia Godkin (detailed picture book about various camouflage strategies)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n* **\"Camouflage: How Animals Hide in Plain Sight\"** - TED-Ed Lessons\n  A 4-minute animated video explaining camouflage with clear examples.

Fourth graders are developing the ability to think about cause-and-effect relationships and to understand that traits help organisms survive. The discussion questions and activities scaffold from observation to explanation to application, building critical thinking skills in alignment with NGSS expectations.",
    "fifthgrade": "## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a katydid (a green insect similar to a grasshopper) resting on grass and plant stems in its natural environment. The katydid's body color closely matches the green leaves and grass surrounding it, making it difficult to spot among the vegetation. This blending in with the environment is an example of how animals have special features that help them survive in nature.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon: Camouflage as an Adaptation for Survival**\n\nThis image illustrates **camouflage**, a protective adaptation where an organism's appearance blends in with its surroundings. The katydid's green coloring matches its environment (grass and leaves) because of natural selection—over many generations, katydids with coloring that matched plants were more likely to survive predators and pass on their genes to offspring. This is WHY the katydid is green: its color provides protection by making it harder for predators like birds and lizards to find and eat it. The katydid didn't choose this color; it evolved this trait because it helped its ancestors survive.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Adaptation:** A trait or characteristic that helps an organism survive and reproduce in its environment. The katydid's green color is an adaptation.\n\n* **Natural Selection:** Over time, organisms with traits that help them survive are more likely to have offspring, passing those helpful traits to the next generation.\n\n* **Camouflage (Protective Coloration):** An adaptation where an animal's color, pattern, or shape helps it blend into its environment to avoid being seen by predators or prey.\n\n* **Variation in Populations:** Individuals within a species have different traits. Some katydids might be lighter or darker green, and those that match their environment best have a better chance of survival.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching camouflage, encourage students to physically search for the katydid in the photo before you point it out. This \"struggle to find it\" creates cognitive engagement and makes the concept of camouflage personally meaningful. Students will understand *why* camouflage matters when they experience the difficulty of spotting the animal themselves.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple means of representation: show videos of katydids in motion (they're easier to spot when moving), display side-by-side comparison images (katydid isolated vs. katydid in grass), and use tactile materials (green fabric scraps on grass) so students can physically experience how color matching creates invisibility. This supports learners who are visual, kinesthetic, or need concrete examples.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n5-LS3-1: Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water. *[Note: While this PE focuses on plants, your lesson should emphasize 5-LS4-1 below]*\n\n**Primary PE for This Lesson:**\n5-LS4-1: Develop a model to describe that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but all have in common birth, growth, reproduction, and death.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS3.B]] Variation of traits in a species\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.B]] Natural selection and adaptation\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.C]] Adaptation by natural selection over time\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] (The pattern of matching coloration between organism and environment)\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] (How the katydid's green color functions to protect it)\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] (Predation pressure causes evolution of camouflage over generations)\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why do you think the katydid is green instead of red or blue?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **If a katydid lived on tree bark instead of grass, what color do you predict it might be, and why?** (Bloom's: Synthesize | DOK: 3)\n\n3. **What would happen to a population of bright pink katydids if they lived in a grassy field?

How does their coloring or pattern help them survive?** (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or pattern helps it blend in with its surroundings so predators can't see it easily.\n\n* **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an organism survive and do well in its environment.\n\n* **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals for food.\n\n* **Natural Selection:** The process where organisms with traits that help them survive are more likely to have offspring and pass those traits to the next generation.\n\n* **Coloration:** The color or pattern of an animal's body or skin.\n\n* **Variation:** Differences in traits among individual organisms of the same species.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Camouflage Hunt Activity:** Create a classroom \"habitat\" using green poster board, real grass, and paper cutouts of katydids in various colors (green, yellow, red, blue). Have students search for each colored katydid and record how long it takes to find each one. Chart the results to show that green katydids are hardest to find—connecting the data to survival advantage.\n\n2. **Design Your Own Adaptation:** Provide students with images of different habitats (desert, snow, forest, ocean). Ask them to design and draw an imaginary creature that would be well-camouflaged in each habitat, explaining how its color and pattern match the environment. Students can share their designs and defend why their adaptations would help the creature survive.\n\n3. **Adaptation Research Project:** Assign students to research another animal that uses camouflage (stick insect, leaf-tailed gecko, Arctic fox, etc.). Students create a poster or digital presentation comparing their animal's camouflage to the katydid's, identifying similarities and differences in how each adaptation works.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Animals in Disguise* by Joyce Milton (Random House) – Simple explanations of camouflage with colorful illustrations\n- *The Mixed-Up Chameleon* by Eric Carle (Thomas Y.

Fifth graders are cognitively ready to think about cause-and-effect relationships across generations, making this an ideal grade level for connecting camouflage to evolutionary processes. Use the discussion questions to scaffold thinking from concrete observations (\"Why is it green?\") to more complex reasoning (\"What happens to populations over time?\")."
