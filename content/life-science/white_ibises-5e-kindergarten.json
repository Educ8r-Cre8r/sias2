ENGAGE (10-12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the white ibises and activate prior knowledge about animal needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of white ibises (printed large or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: real ibis feather (if available) to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph without explanation. Give students 30 seconds to look quietly.\n2. Ask students to sit in a circle where all can see the image clearly.\n3. Pose these discussion questions (one at a time, allowing think-pair-share time):\n   - \"What animal is this? What do you notice about it?\" (Point out the long, curved beak and long legs)\n   - \"Where do you think this bird lives? What do you see in the picture that tells you?\" (Point to the water, mud, shallow areas)\n   - \"What do you think this bird is doing right now?\" (Probing in mud, looking for food, drinking water)\n   - \"What does this animal need to stay alive and healthy?\" (Accept answers: food, water, a place to live, safety)\n4. Record student observations on chart paper as they share.\n5. Wonder prompt: \"I wonder how the ibis uses its long beak to find food in the mud. Let's discover together!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to act like ibises and find out how they survive in their home!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (18-22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate animal survival needs through hands-on, embodied exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Shallow containers or bins (one per small group of 3-4 students)\n- Water (enough to fill containers 2-3 inches deep)\n- Mud or wet sand (enough to scatter on the bottom of containers)\n- Small objects to represent food: pasta shapes, beads, small pebbles, buttons (washable/non-toxic)\n- Straws or wooden dowels (to represent ibis beaks)\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Observation recording sheet (simple pictures of ibis, water, food, with checkboxes)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Divide students into small groups of 3-4. Each group gets a container setup.\n2. Explain: \"Your container is like a little home where ibises live. We're going to be ibises and practice finding food just like they do!\"\n3. Show students how to use the straw or dowel as a \"beak\" to probe gently in the mud to find the hidden \"food\" objects.\n4. Student directions (use simple, clear language):\n   - \"Dip your straw-beak into the mud and water, just like a real ibis does.\"\n   - \"Feel around gently to find the hidden food pieces.\"\n   - \"When you find food, put it in a pile on the side.\"\n   - \"Take turns with your group so everyone gets a chance to be an ibis.\"\n5. As students explore, ask probing questions:\n   - \"What do you notice about the water and mud? Why do you think the ibis likes this?\"\n   - \"How does your beak (straw) help you find food?\"\n   - \"Do you think the ibis finds food alone or with friends?\" (Gesture to the group)\n6. Students record findings by checking off pictures on the observation sheet: \"I found water,\" \"I found mud,\" \"I found food,\" \"I worked with friends.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups; ask open-ended questions rather than directing.\n- Encourage students to use their senses (\"What does the mud feel like?\" \"Do you see the water?\").\n- Facilitate turn-taking and kindness in groups.\n- Guide without giving answers: \"What do you think will happen if you push the straw deeper?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully use straws to probe in mud and find hidden objects.\n- Students recognize that the ibis habitat includes water, mud, and food sources.\n- Students observe that ibises live and work together in groups.\n- Observation sheets show students checked off key survival needs (water, food, working together).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect exploration to formal concepts about animal needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Visual word cards with pictures: \"food,\" \"water,\" \"home/habitat,\" \"beak,\" \"legs\"\n- Optional: Children's book excerpt about ibises (e.g., \"Animals Need Food\" or similar simple text)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Gather students together. Revisit the photograph.\n2. Facilitate group share-out: \"Tell us one thing you discovered when you were being an ibis. What did you find in the mud?\"\n3. Introduce vocabulary with picture support:\n   - **Food:** \"The ibis eats small fish, shrimp, and bugs it finds in the water and mud. Just like we need to eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, the ibis needs to eat every day.\"\n   - **Water:** \"The ibis lives in shallow water and wet muddy places. It drinks the water and finds food in it. Water keeps the ibis alive and healthy.\"\n   - **Habitat (or Home):** \"The place where an animal lives and finds what it needs is called its habitat. For the ibis, the habitat is shallow water with mud—just like your home has what you need!\"\n   - **Beak:** \"The ibis has a long, curved beak. The beak is like a special tool that helps it dig in the mud and find food. Not all birds have the same kind of beak!\"\n   - **Legs:** \"The ibis has long, thin legs. Long legs help it walk in shallow water without getting stuck. They help the ibis survive in its watery home.\"\n4. Point to the photograph and ask: \"Can you show me the ibis's beak? Its legs? Where is the water? Where is the mud?\"\n5. Create a class anchor chart titled \"What the Ibis Needs to Survive\" with pictures and words:\n   - Food (show with picture of fish/bugs)\n   - Water (show with picture of water)\n   - A home/habitat with shallow water and mud (show picture)\n   - Friends/group (show the photo with multiple ibises)\n6. Check for understanding: \"Why do you think the ibis's long beak helps it survive?\" (Provide wait time; accept \"It helps it find food,\" \"It helps it dig,\" etc.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Food:** Something an animal eats to stay alive and grow.\n- **Water:** A liquid that all animals need to drink to stay healthy.\n- **Habitat:** The home or place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs.\n- **Beak:** The hard, pointed part of a bird's mouth; the ibis uses it like a tool.\n- **Legs:** Body parts that help an animal move and walk in its habitat.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least two things the ibis needs to survive (food, water, habitat).\n- Students understand that the ibis's body parts (beak, legs) help it survive.\n- Students recognize that animals live in places suited to their needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by connecting ibis survival needs to their own needs and other animals.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pictures of other animals (cat, fish, bird, bear, deer)\n- Picture cards of habitats (forest, desert, ocean, grassland, home)\n- Large paper or poster board\n- Crayons and colored pencils\n\n**Activity (Choose one based on time/student engagement):**\n\n**Option A: Comparison Activity**\n1. Show pictures of 2-3 other animals (a duck, a rabbit, a fish).\n2. Ask: \"Does a duck need food? Does a rabbit need water? Do they need a home?\"\n3. Create a simple comparison chart:\n   - Rows: Ibis, Duck, Rabbit, Fish\n   - Columns: Needs Food? Needs Water? Needs Home?\n   - Students help fill in checkmarks; discuss that ALL animals need these things.\n4. Talk about differences: \"The ibis lives in water. The rabbit lives in a burrow. They have different habitats, but both need food, water, and a safe home.\"\n\n**Option B: Draw and Label Activity**\n1. Students draw a picture of an ibis in its habitat.\n2. Teacher or aide helps students label: beak, legs, water, mud, food.\n3. Students dictate or write one sentence: \"The ibis needs __________ to survive.\"\n4. Display drawings on classroom wall titled \"Animal Survival.\"\n\n**Option C: Role-Play Extension**\n1. Students act out a day in the life of an ibis: waking up, finding water, using the beak to find food, resting with the group.\n2. Discuss: \"What would happen if the ibis couldn't find water? What if there was no mud?\"\n3. Reinforce that habitats must have what animals need.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion about similarities and differences across animals.\n- Help students transfer learning from ibis to other animals.\n- Encourage critical thinking: \"Why does each animal need a special home?\"\n- Use the photograph as reference throughout.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that many animals share common survival needs (food, water, habitat).\n- Students can explain why an ibis's habitat is different from other animals' habitats.\n- Students show deeper understanding by applying the concept to new situations.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what animals need to survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student participation during the straw-and-mud exploration: Can they locate food using the tool? Do they engage with the habitat materials?\n- Listen to student responses during discussion: Can they name at least two things the ibis needs?\n- Check observation recording sheets: Are survival needs checked off?\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why does the ibis live near water?\" \"What does the ibis's beak help it do?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\nUse one of the following methods (choose based on kindergarten literacy level):\n\n**Option A: Picture Sorting**\n- Show four pictures: (1) ibis with food in beak, (2) ibis standing in water, (3) group of ibises together, (4) ibis in a desert\n- Ask: \"Which picture shows something the ibis needs to survive?\"\n- Students point to or hold up correct pictures (1, 2, 3).\n\n**Option B: Oral Response**\n- Ask each student individually or in small groups:\n  - \"Tell me one thing an ibis needs to survive.\"\n  - \"Why does the ibis have a long beak?\"\n  - \"Where does the ibis live?\"\n- Record responses on a checklist.\n\n**Option C: Drawing with Teacher Dictation**\n- Students draw an ibis and its habitat.\n- Teacher writes the child's dictated sentence: \"The ibis needs [food, water, home].\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student can name at least 2 of the 4 basic survival needs: food, water, habitat/home, group/safety.\n- ✓ Student can identify the ibis's beak or legs and explain (in kindergarten language) how they help the animal.\n- ✓ Student understands that animals need specific environments and that the ibis lives in water and mud.\n- ✓ Student recognizes that multiple ibises live together (group behavior).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can correctly identify at least one thing the ibis needs to survive when shown the photograph.\n- Students can point to or name the habitat features (water, mud) in the image.\n- Students demonstrate engagement and curiosity about how animal bodies help them survive.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and repeated exposure:** Use only two key terms (food, water) in early sessions; add beak and habitat later. Repeat words with pictures every lesson.\n2. **Hands-on, multisensory approach:** Allow extra time with the mud-and-straw exploration. Pair students with a peer buddy or teacher aide. Provide real objects (feather, picture of ibis food) to touch and observe.\n3. **Visual supports and reduced language:** Use large, clear picture cards instead of words. Ask yes/no questions (\"Does the ibis need food?\" \"Is this water?\") rather than open-ended questions. Point to the photograph frequently to support understanding.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Research and compare multiple habitats:** Ask: \"Do all water birds live in the same habitat? Find a picture of a penguin and an ibis—how are their homes different?\" Encourage students to look at additional animal habitats and explain differences.\n2. **Problem-solving scenarios:** Pose \"what if\" questions: \"What if the mud dried up? What would the ibis do?\" \"If we took away the water, could the ibis survive?\" Have students draw or dictate solutions.\n3. **Extension to food chains:** Introduce the idea that the ibis eats small fish and shrimp. Ask: \"What do you think the small fish eats? What does the ibis do with its food?\" This primes students for later life science learning about predator-prey relationships and food chains.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom Habitat Creation:**\n   - Create a permanent water/mud habitat in the classroom science table with the shallow containers set up long-term. Allow students to return for exploration during choice time. Add new materials (cattail plants, model animals) weekly to deepen observation. Students record new discoveries in a class \"Ibis Journal\" with pictures and words.\n\n2. **Take-Home Animal Needs Hunt:**\n   - Send home a simple sheet with pictures of four animals (dog, fish, bird, rabbit) and their habitats. Ask families to find examples in their own environment and draw or list what each animal needs to survive. Share findings in circle time the next week. This connects home and school learning and engages families.\n\n3. **Ibis Beak Craft and Experimentation:**\n   - Provide straws, tongs, tweezers, and other \"beak-like\" tools. Challenge students to pick up small objects (pom-poms, beads) with each tool. Record which tool works best and why. Create a chart: \"Tools That Work Like Beaks.\" Discuss how different animal beaks are shaped for different foods (thin beak for insects, thick beak for seeds, curved beak for fish). Extend with pictures of various birds (hummingbird, parrot, pelican, woodpecker) and their specialized beaks.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
