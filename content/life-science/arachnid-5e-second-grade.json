Identify spiders as animals and describe at least two body parts that help spiders survive.\n2. Explain why spiders live in different places (habitats) and what they need to survive.\n3. Compare spiders to other animals and describe how spiders are different.\n4. Observe and document details about how animals adapt to their environments.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about spiders and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of spider on sandy/rocky ground (displayed on interactive board, projector, or printed large)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- \"Spider Wonder Board\" (can be a large poster or whiteboard)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board. Do NOT tell students what it is yet. Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. What do you notice? What do you see?\"\n\n2. **Guide observation** with these discussion questions (ask one at a time, allowing think-time):\n   - \"What do you see in the middle of the picture? How many legs does it have?\"\n   - \"Where is this animal? What does the ground look like around it?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this before? Where?\"\n   - \"What do you think this animal is doing here?\"\n\n3. **Create a \"Wonder Board\"** on chart paper. Write: \"I wonder...\" and have students share one thing they wonder about this creature. Examples they might offer:\n   - \"I wonder how spiders walk with so many legs?\"\n   - \"I wonder what spiders eat?\"\n   - \"I wonder why this one is on the ground?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today we're going to discover more about this special animal called a spider. I want you to think: What do you think spiders need to live and be healthy, just like you need food and a safe home?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore and investigate spiders to answer some of our questions!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate spider characteristics and habitats through hands-on observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-drawn spider body diagram outline (simple: head/body, 8 legs) for each student (or printed on worksheet)\n- Pictures of spiders in different habitats (printed or displayed): ground, web on plant, under log, etc. (3-4 images)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Small paper bags or envelopes (one per student)\n- Sand, small pebbles, bits of dried plant material, or other natural materials (collected beforehand)\n- Magnifying glasses (if available)\n- Observation sheet (simple chart: \"What I see,\" \"What I think it helps the spider do\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Spider Body Exploration (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Display the spider photograph again. Say: \"Let's look closely at this spider's body. I'm going to point out each part.\"\n\n2. Use a pointer or your finger to trace on the large photo:\n   - \"This is the spider's body—here in the middle.\"\n   - \"Count with me: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 legs! Spiders have EIGHT legs. Let's count our fingers and toes—we have 10. Spiders have 8!\"\n\n3. Give each student a blank spider diagram. Have them:\n   - Color the body\n   - Count aloud and mark all 8 legs\n   - Label one body part they can see (with teacher help)\n\n4. **Teacher circulates:** Ask each student: \"What do you think the spider's legs help it do?\" (Listen for: walk, run, catch food, climb.)\n\n**Part 2: Habitat Investigation (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. Show 3-4 pictures of spiders in different habitats (you can print these or draw simple versions):\n   - Spider on sandy ground (like the photograph)\n   - Spider on green plants\n   - Spider under a log or in dark place\n   - Spider with its web\n\n2. Say: \"Spiders live in different places. Look at each picture. Where does each spider live? What does that place look like?\"\n\n3. Distribute the \"habitat bags\" you've prepared. Each bag contains:\n   - Sand and pebbles (to represent the spider's ground habitat from the photo)\n   - A small piece of dried plant material or stick\n   - A magnifying glass (optional)\n\n4. Student task: \n   - Open the bag and observe: \"What's in this habitat? What would a spider find here?\"\n   - Use the observation sheet to record or draw:\n     - What materials are in the habitat (sand, rocks, plants)\n     - Why the spider might live here (food, shelter, safety)\n\n5. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask guiding questions:\n   - \"What do you notice about the color of the sand? How does that help the spider hide?\"\n   - \"What could a spider eat in this habitat?\"\n   - \"Is this a safe place for a spider? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and label basic spider body parts (body, legs).\n- Students observe that spiders live in habitats with specific materials (soil, rocks, plants).\n- Students begin to notice connections between spider body/behavior and habitat (e.g., \"The dark spider matches the dark ground\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and clarify spider concepts using student discoveries.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper for vocabulary anchor chart\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Picture cards of spiders and other animals (spider, ant, butterfly, bird, cat—to show diversity)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations from Explore phase** (5 minutes):\n   - Ask 3-4 students to share one thing they discovered about the spider or its habitat.\n   - Write their discoveries on chart paper under \"What We Learned About Spiders.\"\n   - Affirm accurate observations: \"Yes! You noticed the spider's dark color helps it hide in the dirt.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (8-10 minutes):\n\n   Create an anchor chart titled \"All About Spiders\" and add each term as you teach:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Spider:** An animal with eight legs, a body, and eyes. Spiders are hunters.\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives (like the spider's home with soil and rocks).\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. (Example: The spider's eight legs help it move fast and catch food.)\n   - **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or pattern matches its habitat so it's hard to see. (Example: The brown spider matches the brown soil.)\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph** (5 minutes):\n   - Point to the spider in the photo: \"This is a spider. It lives in a habitat with sandy soil and rocks. Its dark color is a camouflage adaptation—it blends with the dark ground.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why does the spider need to hide? What might it be hiding from?\" (Predators like birds. It might also be hiding to sneak up on prey like insects.)\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"How many legs does a spider have?\" (Students respond: 8)\n   - Ask: \"What is the spider's habitat in our picture?\" (Students point to soil/ground)\n   - Ask: \"How does the spider's dark color help it?\" (Students answer: It hides in the dark soil)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use the term \"spider\" and \"habitat\" correctly in sentences.\n- Students understand that adaptations help animals survive.\n- Students recognize the spider in the photo and can name at least one of its adaptations (dark color, eight legs).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding of adaptations and habitats to a new context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of various animals (butterfly, fish, bird, snake, deer, rabbit) with their habitats\n- Paper plates or large cardstock\n- Colored pencils, markers, crayons\n- Glue sticks and craft materials (optional: tissue paper, yarn, natural materials)\n- \"Design Your Own Animal Home\" worksheet or template\n- Real or paper examples of different habitats (forest, desert, water, sky)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Animal Habitat Matching (8 minutes)**\n\n1. Show picture cards of different animals in different habitats.\n2. Ask: \"Just like the spider lives in sandy soil, where do other animals live?\"\n3. Have students match 3-4 animals to their habitats (can be a group activity):\n   - Fish → water\n   - Bird → trees/sky\n   - Snake → under rocks or in grass\n   - Butterfly → flowers and plants\n\n4. Ask: \"Why does each animal live there? What does it find in that habitat?\" (Food, shelter, safety.)\n\n**Part 2: Design a Spider Habitat (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. Give each student a paper plate or cardstock labeled \"My Spider's Home.\"\n\n2. Task: \"Design a habitat where a spider could live and be safe. You can draw it or build it with materials. Include:\n   - Where the spider will live (soil, rocks, plants, corners)\n   - What it might find to eat (tiny insects)\n   - How it will hide (camouflage)\n   - What it needs to survive\"\n\n3. Students create by:\n   - Drawing the habitat with colored pencils\n   - Gluing on craft materials to represent soil, rocks, and plants (sand, brown paper, green paper, small twigs)\n   - Labeling important parts (where spider hides, food source, etc.)\n\n4. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask:\n   - \"Where will your spider hide in this habitat?\"\n   - \"What might your spider eat here?\"\n   - \"Is your habitat similar to the one in our photograph?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a habitat design showing understanding that spiders need food, shelter, and places to hide.\n- Students explain their habitat using vocabulary: spider, habitat, adaptation, camouflage.\n- Work shows understanding of the spider's needs and how the habitat meets those needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of spider body structure, habitats, and adaptations.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Can students identify spider body parts? Do they notice habitat materials?\n- Check-for-understanding questions during Explain phase (See questions in Explain section).\n- Circulating during Elaborate phase: Listen for use of vocabulary; observe habitat designs for accuracy.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes)**\n\nAdminister one of these formats:\n\n**Option 1: Oral Exit Ticket (for all students)**\nShow the original spider photograph again. Ask each student:\n1. \"How many legs does this spider have?\" *(Success: Answers \"8\" or \"eight\")*\n2. \"What is this spider's home called?\" *(Success: Answers \"habitat\" or describes soil/ground)*\n3. \"Why do you think this spider is brown/dark?\" *(Success: Answers \"to hide\" or \"camouflage\" or \"to match the ground\")*\n\n**Option 2: Drawing + Sentence Exit Ticket** (for students who need time to process)\nProvide a simple form:\n- Draw a spider.\n- Draw or describe one place where spiders live.\n- Finish the sentence: \"Spiders have ____ legs.\"\n- Finish the sentence: \"My spider hides by ________________.\"\n\n**Option 3: Picture Sort Exit Ticket**\nShow 4 pictures: (1) a spider, (2) a butterfly, (3) a ladybug, (4) a worm.\nAsk: \"Circle the spider. How do you know it's a spider?\" *(Success: Circled spider and mentions 8 legs or body parts)*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify a spider and name at least one body part (legs, body).\n- ✓ Student can name a habitat where spiders live.\n- ✓ Student can identify one adaptation that helps spiders survive (dark color, 8 legs, etc.).\n- ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary word correctly (spider, habitat, adaptation, or camouflage).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 80% of students answer 3 of 4 questions correctly.\n- Students demonstrate understanding of spider body structure and habitat.\n- Students can explain in simple terms why spiders live where they do.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified spider diagram:** Provide a pre-drawn spider body with legs already sketched. Student only needs to color and point to each leg as you count together.\n\n2. **Habitat sensory exploration:** Let students touch and handle the sand, pebbles, and plant materials from the habitat bag with support. Ask simpler questions: \"Is this rough or smooth? Is it warm or cool? Would a spider like to live here?\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary repetition with visuals:** Post large picture cards with each vocabulary word (spider, habitat, adaptation, camouflage) with simple icons. Point to and repeat these words multiple times throughout the lesson. Use a \"word wall\" for ongoing reference.\n\n4. **Pair with peer teacher:** During Elaborate phase, pair with a confident peer who can help explain the habitat design activity or model drawing the spider.\n\n5. **Provide sentence starters:** For exit ticket, offer frames like: \"The spider has _____ legs. It lives in _____. It hides because _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Research extension:** Ask students to find pictures of 2-3 other types of spiders and compare their habitats. How are they the same? Different? Do all spiders have the same adaptations?\n\n2. **Predict and test:** \"If we moved this spider to a bright green plant instead of dark soil, would its camouflage still work? Why or why not? Draw what might happen.\"\n\n3. **Food web exploration:** Create a simple food web showing: Spider eats insects → insects eat plants → animals eat spiders. Ask: \"What would happen if there were no insects? What about if there were no plants?\"\n\n4. **Write an \"All About Spiders\" booklet:** Advanced students can write and illustrate a 3-4 page booklet with sections: \"Spider Body Parts,\" \"Where Spiders Live,\" \"How Spiders Hide,\" \"What Spiders Eat.\" Share with the class.\n\n5. **Spider habitat design challenge:** \"Design a habitat for a spider that must survive in a cold winter.\" What would it need? Where would it hide?\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Spider Web Investigation:** Bring in pictures of spider webs or create one with yarn on a frame. Discuss: \"Some spiders spin webs to catch food. Why is the web a good adaptation? What does it help the spider do?\" Have students create a simple web with yarn or string on paper.\n\n2. **\"Find the Camouflaged Spider\" game:** Print or draw scenes (forest, desert, beach, rock) and hide spider drawings or stickers in each. Students hunt for spiders and discuss why they're hard to find. Compare habitats: \"Which habitat made it easiest to hide the spider? Hardest?\"\n\n3. **Spider life cycle poster:** Create a simple poster showing spider life stages (egg → baby spider → adult spider). Discuss: \"How do spiders grow? Do they start big or small? What happens as they grow?\" (Note: This touches on growth/change, which is implicit in understanding animal diversity and habitat needs.)\n\n4. **Community circle: \"If I were a spider...\"** Students sit in a circle and complete: \"If I were a spider, I would live in __________ because __________.\" Discuss the variety of habitats chosen and why students think spiders could survive there.\n\n5. **Spider habitat observation outdoors:** On a safe outdoor exploration (playground or garden), search for real spiders or signs of spiders (webs, hiding spots). Document findings with drawings and observations. Discuss: \"What habitats did we find spiders in? Were they like the spider in our photograph?\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\n- **Safety:** While this lesson focuses on spiders as fascinating animals, be aware that some students may have arachnophobia. Frame spiders as \"helpful animals that eat bugs\" and emphasize that most spiders are harmless. Never force a student to touch or look closely at a spider if they're uncomfortable.\n- **Classroom culture:** Use this lesson to build appreciation for all animals, even ones that seem scary or \"creepy.\" Discuss why spiders are important (they eat insects that might bother us or destroy plants).\n- **Resource tip:** The photograph of the dark spider on sandy ground is excellent for discussing camouflage—use it throughout the lesson as your anchor example.",
