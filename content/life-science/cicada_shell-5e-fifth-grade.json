ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the cicada exoskeleton.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph of cicada exoskeleton on tree bark\n- Chart paper and markers (for recording questions)\n- Optional: Audio clip of cicada sounds (15-20 seconds)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Introduce:** Project the photograph on the board or screen. Play a brief cicada sound recording (15-20 seconds) to create multisensory engagement. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Hook Question:** \"What you're looking at is something a cicada left behind. What do you think happened here? Where did the cicada go?\"\n\n3. **Guided Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"Does this look like a complete insect or something else? What's different about it?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this shell is attached to the tree bark? What purpose might that serve?\"\n   - \"If an insect sheds its outer covering, what do you think happens to the body underneath?\"\n   - \"What happens to this empty shell after it falls to the ground?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** Invite students to write or share one thing they wonder about: \"I wonder why insects need to shed their skin...\" or \"I wonder what happens to the cicada after it leaves this shell...\"\n\n5. **Record Predictions:** Create a class chart titled \"Our Cicada Questions\" and keep it visible throughout the lesson for later reference.\n\n**Transition:** \"Over the next two days, we're going to become cicada investigators. We'll discover why insects shed their shells, what happens to those shells, and how one insect's empty home becomes food and nutrients for the rest of the forest.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how matter cycles through ecosystems and observe the physical characteristics of organisms at different life stages.\n\n**Materials (Per group of 3-4 students):**\n- Photograph of cicada exoskeleton (printed copy, 1 per group)\n- Hand lens or magnifying glass (1-2 per group)\n- Tracing paper and pencils\n- Index cards labeled: \"Hard Parts,\" \"Soft Parts,\" \"Connections to Tree,\" \"Color,\" \"Texture\"\n- Optional: Real cicada exoskeleton (if available for safe observation)\n- Worksheet: \"What Does the Exoskeleton Tell Us?\" (see below)\n- Diagram of insect anatomy (antennae, legs, wings, body segments)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Close Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute printed photographs and hand lenses to each group.\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Using your hand lens, carefully examine the photograph or specimen from at least five different angles. Look for details like texture, edges, attachment points, and overall structure.\"\n   - \"On your index cards, describe what you observe in each category: Hard Parts (what's stiff/rigid?), Soft Parts (what looks flexible?), Connections to Tree (how does it hold on?), Color (what colors do you see?), and Texture (is it smooth, bumpy, rough?).\"\n   - \"Use the tracing paper to sketch the outline of the exoskeleton and label any parts you recognize from the insect anatomy diagram provided.\"\n\n3. **Teacher Facilitation:** Circulate and ask probing questions without revealing answers:\n   - \"What does the texture tell you about what this is made of?\"\n   - \"Why do you think it's shaped this way?\"\n   - \"If the insect grew bigger, why couldn't it just stretch this covering?\"\n\n**Part B: Matter Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n4. **Transition Statement:** \"Now imagine this shell falls to the ground. Let's think about what happens to it.\"\n\n5. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Think about a dead leaf or a fallen branch. What happens to these things over time in nature?\"\n   - \"On your worksheet, draw or write: What do you think will happen to this cicada shell over months and years? Who or what will break it down?\"\n   - \"List organisms that might use this shell (decomposers, plants, soil, other insects).\"\n   - \"Create a simple flow diagram showing how the materials from the shell move into the soil and eventually become part of plants again.\"\n\n6. **Teacher Role:** \n   - Ask guiding questions: \"What living things break down dead material?\" \"Where do plants get minerals from?\" \"Could the materials from this shell become part of a plant? How?\"\n   - Do NOT provide answers; guide observation and reasoning.\n   - Listen to student ideas and record interesting theories for the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Detailed observations of exoskeleton structure recorded on index cards\n- Sketches that show understanding of the shell's segmented, hollow structure\n- Initial theories about decomposition and nutrient cycling, even if incomplete\n- Recognition that this object once contained a living organism and had a specific function\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts, clarify misconceptions, and connect exploration to established scientific knowledge about life cycles and matter cycling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Life cycle diagram for insects (showing egg, nymph/larvae, adult stages)\n- Exoskeleton labeled diagram\n- Vocabulary chart on poster board\n- Video clip (optional): \"How Cicadas Grow\" (2-3 minutes, YouTube or similar)\n- Class data chart from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their observations about the exoskeleton's texture, color, and shape.\n   - Ask: \"What surprised you about this shell?\"\n   - Record common observations on the vocabulary chart.\n\n2. **Introduce the Insect Life Cycle (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the life cycle diagram showing: Egg → Nymph/Larva → Adult\n   - Explain: \"Cicadas have an incomplete life cycle. They start as tiny eggs and go through several growing stages. Each time they grow, their skin becomes too tight, so they must shed it—this is called **molting**.\"\n   - Point to the photograph: \"What you see here is called the **exoskeleton**—the outer shell that was left behind when the cicada molted for the last time and became an adult.\"\n\n3. **Key Vocabulary Instruction (5 minutes):**\n   \n   Present each term with a student-friendly definition and a connection to the photograph:\n\n   - **Exoskeleton:** The hard, outer skeleton that insects and some other animals have on the outside of their bodies. It protects the soft body inside but cannot grow or stretch. (Point to the photo: \"This is the cicada's exoskeleton.\")\n   \n   - **Molting:** The process of shedding an old, tight exoskeleton so the animal can grow bigger. The insect splits its old shell and crawls out with a new, larger shell underneath. (Ask: \"Why would an insect need to do this?\")\n   \n   - **Decomposer:** A living thing (like bacteria, fungi, or insects) that breaks down dead material and recycles it back into the soil as nutrients. (Explain: \"When the cicada shell falls to the ground, decomposers will break it apart.\")\n   \n   - **Nutrient Cycle:** The path that materials take as they move from the soil into living things, and then back into the soil when organisms die or shed. (Draw a simple cycle on the board: Soil → Plant → Animal → Dead Material → Decomposer → Back to Soil)\n   \n   - **Life Cycle:** The series of stages that a living thing goes through from birth to death, including growth, reproduction, and aging.\n\n4. **Connect Back to the Photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - \"The shell in this photograph is evidence of molting. When you see this shell on a tree, you know a cicada has gone through one of its growth stages. The shell itself is no longer alive, but it still has a job to do.\"\n   - \"Remember our wonder question: 'What happens to the shell after it falls?' The answer is that decomposers break it down, and its materials become nutrients in the soil that plants use to grow.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - **Quick Write:** \"In one or two sentences, explain what molting is and why insects need to do it.\"\n   - **Think-Pair-Share:** \"Turn to a partner and explain where the materials from a dead exoskeleton go.\"\n   - **Thumbs Up/Middle/Down:** \"How confident are you about what decomposers do?\" (Assess and note who needs additional support.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define exoskeleton, molting, decomposer, and nutrient cycle in their own words.\n- Students understand that molting allows insects to grow and that the shed exoskeleton is no longer part of the living organism.\n- Students can explain, with support, that matter from dead organisms cycles back into the environment through decomposition.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by developing a visual model of nutrient cycling and considering how matter moves through an entire ecosystem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster paper (1 per group of 3-4)\n- Colored markers, colored paper, scissors, glue\n- Magazine images or printed pictures of: trees, soil, decomposer organisms (fungi, worms, bacteria), insects, other animals\n- Nutrient Cycle Template (optional, for scaffolding)\n- Real or artificial small branch with lichen (if available)\n- Ruler\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Develop a Nutrient Cycle Model (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Explain the Task:**\n   - \"You're going to create a model showing how matter from the cicada's exoskeleton moves through the ecosystem. Your model should show: the cicada shell → decomposers → soil → plants (including the tree where the shell was found) → animals.\"\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"With your group, decide how to represent the nutrient cycle. You can draw it as a circle, a pathway, or any diagram that makes sense to your group.\"\n   - \"Include these labels: Exoskeleton, Decomposer, Soil, Tree/Plant, Nutrients (minerals), Animal.\"\n   - \"Use arrows to show the movement of matter. Add at least 3 specific decomposer organisms (examples: fungi, earthworms, bacteria) in your diagram.\"\n   - \"On the side, write a 2-3 sentence explanation of your model: 'Our model shows that matter moves through the ecosystem by...'\"\n\n3. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate and ask clarifying questions: \"Where do these nutrients come from?\" \"What's the role of decomposers in your model?\" \"How does the plant use the nutrients from the soil?\"\n   - Provide the optional template for students who struggle with spatial organization.\n   - Encourage students to reference the photograph and the vocabulary chart.\n\n**Part B: Real-World Connection (6 minutes)**\n\n4. **Introduce a Secondary Observation:**\n   - Show the lichen visible on the tree bark in the photograph (or explain it if not visible).\n   - Ask: \"What if we zoomed in on the tree bark where the cicada shell was sitting? There are other living things here—like lichen and fungi—that are also part of breaking down and cycling matter. How might lichen use nutrients from decomposed material?\"\n\n5. **Extension Prompt:**\n   - \"The tree itself is growing on this spot. It needs nitrogen, phosphorus, and other minerals from the soil. Some of those minerals might have once been part of an insect's exoskeleton. Can you show this connection in your model?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Completed nutrient cycle diagram showing the path of matter from dead exoskeleton to living organisms.\n- Clear evidence that students understand decomposers' role in breaking down matter.\n- Written explanation connecting the cicada shell to plant growth and ecosystem function.\n- Recognition that cycling of matter is continuous and connects all living and nonliving parts of an ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of life cycles, molting, decomposition, and nutrient cycling through multiple measures.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observe During Explore:** Student ability to notice details in the exoskeleton and make initial connections to decomposition.\n- **Listen to Explain Share-Out:** Student vocabulary use and ability to explain molting and decomposition in their own words.\n- **Review Quick Write:** Student comprehension of why molting is necessary.\n- **Analyze Nutrient Cycle Models:** Visual representation of matter movement and accuracy of organism roles.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (End of Day 2)**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket containing the following questions (adjust wording as needed for reading level):\n\n1. **Life Cycle Question:** \"Describe two things that happen to a cicada during its life cycle. Why do you think molting is important for insects?\"\n\n2. **Matter Cycling Question:** \"Imagine a cicada shell falls to the ground. Draw or describe what will happen to it over the next six months. Include at least one decomposer organism.\"\n\n3. **Ecosystem Connection:** \"How are plants and dead insects connected? Use the words 'nutrients' and 'decomposer' in your answer.\"\n\n4. **Reflection Question:** \"What was the most interesting thing you learned about how organisms and the environment are connected?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- **Proficient:** Student accurately describes molting as a growth process, identifies decomposers as organisms that break down dead material, and explains that nutrients from dead organisms return to soil and can be used by plants. Model clearly shows the path of matter.\n\n- **Developing:** Student understands that molting happens and that shells decompose, but may confuse specific decomposer roles or have incomplete understanding of nutrient transfer. Model shows some understanding of cycling but may lack detail.\n\n- **Beginning:** Student recognizes that the exoskeleton is shed but does not yet understand why molting is necessary. May not connect decomposition to nutrient cycling. Model is incomplete or confused.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Review exit tickets and model diagrams for evidence of: (a) understanding of molting as essential for growth, (b) identification of decomposers and their role, (c) comprehension that matter cycles from dead organisms back to plants via soil, and (d) ability to explain ecosystem connections using appropriate vocabulary.\n- Use proficiency checklist to identify students who may need additional scaffolding in future lessons on ecosystems or animal life cycles.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Chart:** Provide a pre-made chart with key vocabulary and pictures (exoskeleton, molting, decomposer, soil, nutrients). Students can refer to this throughout the lesson without having to remember all definitions.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Sheet:** Instead of open-ended inquiry during Explore, provide a structured worksheet with sentence frames: \"The exoskeleton is _____ in color. It feels _____. One body part I recognize is _____. I think decomposers will _____ this shell.\"\n\n3. **Nutrient Cycle Graphic Organizer:** Provide a pre-drawn cycle template with blank spaces for labels and organisms. Students fill in the blanks rather than creating from scratch. This scaffolds spatial reasoning while still requiring them to apply knowledge.\n\n4. **Partner with Peer or Paraprofessional:** Pair struggling students with confident peers during Explore and Elaborate to provide real-time support and model scientific thinking.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Life Cycle Research:** Ask advanced students to research and present the complete life cycle of a specific cicada species, including the number of molts, length of nymph stage (which can be 2-17 years depending on species!), and how long adults live. Create a timeline poster showing the length of each stage.\n\n2. **Ecosystem Modeling Activity:** Have students create a more complex food web or ecosystem model that includes the cicada exoskeleton, multiple decomposers, plants, herbivores, and carnivores. Ask them to trace the path of a single carbon atom or nitrogen atom through multiple organisms.\n\n3. **Design a Decomposition Experiment:** Challenge students to design an experiment to test which decomposer (fungi, earthworms, bacteria) or environmental condition (wet vs. dry, light vs. dark) breaks down an exoskeleton-like material (eggshell, chitin-like material) fastest. Have them predict outcomes and plan how to measure decomposition over time.\n\n4. **Historical/Ecological Investigation:** Ask students to research how cicada emergence cycles (some emerge every 17 years!) affect nutrient cycling and plant growth. How might massive simultaneous molting events change local ecosystems?\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Hands-On Decomposition Observation:** Set up a simple composting or decomposition jar where students add organic material (food scraps, leaves, dead insects if available) and observe over 2-4 weeks. Have students record visible changes, hypothesize about decomposer activity, and connect observations back to what happens to the cicada shell. This extends 5-LS2-1 and allows for long-term data collection.\n\n2. **Create a \"Molting Guide\" for Other Insects:** Have students research other insects that molt (dragonflies, grasshoppers, beetles) and create an illustrated guide showing how often each insect molts, how their body changes, and what happens to each exoskeleton. This integrates literacy and expands understanding of diverse life cycles beyond cicadas.\n\n3. **Investigate Local Tree Bark Microhabitats:** Take students outside to observe tree bark where cicada shells might be found. Have them document all living organisms visible (lichen, moss, small arthropods, fungi) and discuss how these organisms interact with the bark and with decomposing material. This connects 5-LS2-1 to ecosystem observation and biodiversity, building ecological literacy.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
