Identify and describe at least two external body parts that a bee uses to gather food from flowers.\n2. Explain that bees visit flowers to find food they need to survive.\n3. Demonstrate how a bee's body parts help it do its job by creating a model or acting out the behavior.\n4. Recognize that animals have special body parts that help them survive and meet their needs.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, printed color photograph (or display via projector)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Picture of a flower (optional visual aid)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or hold up the bee-on-flower photograph large enough for all students to see clearly. Let students look in silence for 10 seconds, then invite them to turn to a partner and whisper what they notice.\n\n2. **Facilitate Discovery Questions:** Ask the following questions in sequence, pausing for responses:\n   - *\"What do you see in this picture? What is that fuzzy thing?\"* (Guide them toward identifying the bee.)\n   - *\"Why do you think the bee is on the flower? What might the bee be doing?\"* (Accept answers; guide toward \"getting food,\" \"eating,\" \"drinking.\")\n   - *\"Look at the bee closely. What parts of the bee do you see?\"* (Help students notice legs, wings, fuzzy body, long mouth.)\n   - *\"Do you think the bee could do what it's doing without those parts? Why or why not?\"* (Build the idea that body parts help animals do jobs.)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Display chart paper with the heading \"I Wonder...\" and read aloud: *\"I wonder how a bee uses its body parts to get food from a flower.\"* Invite 2-3 students to share their own \"I wonder\" ideas. Write them on the chart (accept invented spelling and drawings).\n\n**Transition:** Now we're going to explore how bees and flowers work together. We'll discover what body parts are special and how they help bees survive.\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how body parts help animals function.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed bee body-parts diagram (simple line drawing labeled with: legs, wings, body, antenna, mouth/proboscis) — one per student or projected\n- Plastic flowers (or paper flowers taped to dowels) — 5-6 for the classroom\n- Craft materials: pipe cleaners, pom-poms, craft sticks, yarn, tape (for each student or small group)\n- Observation worksheet (see below)\n- Clipboards\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Physical Exploration (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Setup:** Place 3-4 craft flowers around the room at student eye level. Give each student or pair a clipboard with the Observation Worksheet (see template below).\n\n2. **Student Directions (Read Aloud and Model):**\n   - *\"We're going to pretend to be bees. Walk to a flower and look very closely.\"*\n   - *\"Use your arms like bee legs—can you reach the flower? Can you move around it?\"*\n   - *\"If you had a long mouth like a bee, could you touch the inside of the flower?\"*\n   - *\"Draw or write what your 'bee body' noticed about the flower.\"*\n\n3. **Recording:** Students draw or write 1-2 observations on their worksheet. Worksheet prompts:\n   - *\"What parts of your body did you use like a bee?\"*\n   - *\"What was hard to do without a long mouth or wings?\"*\n\n**Part B: Model Building (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Transition:** Gather students. Show a simple pipe-cleaner-and-pom-pom bee model.\n2. **Directions:** *\"Now, make a bee using the materials. Use pipe cleaners for legs, string for a long mouth (proboscis), and your pom-pom for the body. Make sure your bee can reach into a flower!\"*\n3. **Student Task:** Working independently or in pairs, students build a simple bee model and test it on a flower. They adjust as needed.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: *\"What parts did your bee need most?\"* *\"Can your bee reach the pollen?\"*\n- Avoid telling students what to build; guide discovery through questions.\n- Encourage trying again if their model doesn't work the first time.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that legs help bees stand and move.\n- Students discover that a long mouth helps reach inside the flower.\n- Students realize that wings and fuzzy body help bees do their job.\n- Drawings and models show at least two body parts and their function.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts; make connections to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original bee-on-flower photograph\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words written and illustrated\n- Body-parts poster (optional: purchase or create a simple labeled bee diagram)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 students to share their observation drawings or model.\n   - Highlight what they discovered: *\"Sarah's bee needed long legs to climb the flower. Marcus found that a long mouth helps the bee reach nectar.\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7-10 minutes):**\n   Display the photograph again. Point to each body part as you introduce vocabulary with **First Grade-friendly definitions**:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Bee:** A small insect that lives with many other bees and visits flowers to find food.\n   - **Flower:** The colorful part of a plant that makes food (nectar) and powder-like dust (pollen) that bees need.\n   - **Legs:** Strong body parts that help a bee stand, walk, and hold onto flowers.\n   - **Proboscis** (say: \"pro-BAH-sis\") **or Mouth:** A long, tube-like part the bee uses to drink sweet juice (nectar) from inside the flower.\n   - **Wings:** Body parts that help the bee fly from flower to flower.\n   - **Fuzzy Body:** Tiny hairs on the bee that help pollen stick to the bee's body.\n   - **Body Parts:** Outside pieces of an animal's body that help it survive and do jobs.\n\n3. **Make Connections (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph: *\"Look at this real bee. See its fuzzy body? See its long mouth? Just like the models you made, this bee uses all these parts to gather food from flowers.\"*\n   - *\"The bee needs the flower to live. The flower needs the bee too. They help each other!\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   Ask students to show with their fingers:\n   - *\"Show me how many legs a bee uses to stand on a flower.\"* (Expect: many fingers/all legs)\n   - *\"Show me the long mouth the bee uses to drink from a flower.\"* (Students point to or trace their own mouth/nose area)\n   - *\"Point to the fuzzy part that helps pollen stick.\"* (Students touch their arms or say \"the body\")\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use at least 3 of the key vocabulary words correctly.\n- Students understand that body parts have specific jobs.\n- Students see the connection between their model/exploration and the real bee in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding to a new context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of different animals (butterfly, hummingbird, ant, dog) — one per student or pair\n- Chart paper titled \"Other Animals Use Body Parts Too\"\n- Drawing paper\n- Crayons and colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-World Connection (3-5 minutes):**\n   - *\"Bees aren't the only animals that have special body parts. Let's think about other animals.\"*\n   - Show a butterfly and hummingbird picture (both visit flowers too).\n   - *\"Do these animals visit flowers? What body parts help them?\"*\n\n2. **Student Application Task (10-15 minutes):**\n   - Assign each student or pair one animal card (butterfly, hummingbird, ant, ladybug, or choose others).\n   - **Directions:** *\"Draw your animal visiting a flower. Label the body parts that help it survive. Tell or write how those parts help your animal.\"*\n   - Sentence frame on board: *\"My [animal] uses its [body part] to ___________.\"*\n\n3. **Pair Share:**\n   - Students share their drawings with a partner or small group.\n   - Peer feedback: *\"What body parts did you see? What does that part help the animal do?\"*\n\n4. **Gallery Walk (optional):**\n   - Post all drawings around the room.\n   - Students walk and place a sticker or checkmark next to drawings where they can see a body part doing a job.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Prompt thinking with questions: *\"How is your animal like the bee? How is it different?\"*\n- Ensure each student labels at least one body part.\n- Guide conversations to help students recognize patterns (many animals have legs, wings, mouths, etc.).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply body-parts concept to a new animal.\n- Drawings show at least one labeled body part and its function.\n- Students explain (orally or written) how a body part helps an animal survive.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of body parts and animal survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** As students explore and elaborate, note:\n  - Can they identify body parts on the bee? (Legs, wings, mouth, fuzzy body)\n  - Do they explain *why* the body part matters? (e.g., \"legs help it climb\")\n  - Can they apply the concept to another animal?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes):**\n\nChoose one format based on your class:\n\n**Option A: Oral Exit Ticket (1-on-1 or small group)**\nAsk each student:\n1. *\"Show me the bee's long mouth in the picture. Why does the bee need it?\"*\n2. *\"What is one body part that helps a bee stay alive?\"*\n3. *\"What does a bee need from a flower?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student points to the proboscis/mouth and explains it drinks nectar (or \"food,\" \"juice\").\n- Student names at least one body part (legs, wings, fuzzy body).\n- Student says \"food,\" \"nectar,\" or \"pollen.\"\n\n**Option B: Drawing Exit Ticket**\nProvide a blank circle (bee outline) or half-sheet of paper. \n- *\"Draw a bee visiting a flower. Show at least one body part that helps the bee.\"*\n- *\"Tell me or write what that body part does.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Drawing shows a bee and flower.\n- At least one labeled or identified body part.\n- Student can verbally explain one function.\n\n**Option C: Quick Checklist**\nShow students the photograph one more time.\n- *\"Do you see legs?\" (Students respond yes/no and show thumbs up)*\n- *\"Do you see a mouth?\" (Respond and show thumbs)*\n- *\"Does the bee get food from the flower?\" (Respond and show thumbs)*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify 2+ bee body parts.\n- 80% of students can explain that the bee uses its body to get food from the flower.\n- 70% of students can name or describe at least one body part and its purpose.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Body-Parts Focus:** Reduce vocabulary to 3 main parts (legs, wings, mouth). Provide a laminated picture card of the bee with these three parts pre-labeled for reference during all activities.\n\n2. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair with a stronger reader/speaker. The partner reads directions aloud, and they build the model together. During the elaborate phase, assign the same animal to both students so they can work collaboratively.\n\n3. **Hands-On Model Language:** During the Explain phase, have the student hold a pipe-cleaner \"leg\" or touch the pom-pom \"body\" while you name parts. Provide tactile, concrete connections rather than asking them to point or draw.\n\n4. **Sentence Frames:** Provide a write-and-fill template:\n   - *\"A bee uses its _____________ to _____________.\"*\n   - *\"The _____________ helps the bee _____________ from the flower.\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Extended Research:** Provide picture books or digital images showing different types of bees (honeybees, bumblebees, carpenter bees). Challenge students to compare: *\"How are these bees the same? How are their body parts different? Why might they be different?\"*\n\n2. **Ecosystem Connection:** Introduce the idea of reciprocal relationships. *\"The bee needs the flower for food. What does the flower need from the bee?\"* (Pollen delivery, reproduction.) Create a simple diagram showing this two-way relationship.\n\n3. **Design Challenge (1-LS1-1 extension):** *\"Imagine you are helping a bee that lost its fuzzy hairs. Design a solution using materials in the classroom to help the bee collect pollen.\"* Students sketch and build a \"pollen-stick\" device or body covering.\n\n4. **Comparative Animal Study:** Assign a \"special pollinator\" (hummingbird, butterfly, bat, wind). Have the student present how that animal's body parts compare to a bee's in visiting flowers.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bee Dance Discovery (Motion & Communication):**\n   Introduce the \"waggle dance\" of honeybees as a bonus behavior. Show a short video clip (30-60 seconds) of bees dancing. Teach students a simple bee dance movement and explain: *\"Bees dance to tell other bees where flowers are!\"* Students perform the dance, reinforcing that behavior (like dancing) is also a way animals use their abilities to survive. *Connects to 1-LS1-2 (behavior).*\n\n2. **Flower Needs Investigation:**\n   Set up a provocation: *\"Bees visit flowers. What do flowers need to grow?\"* Observe real or drawn flowers; discuss soil, water, sunlight. Grow bean or sunflower seeds in cups and check them over 2-3 weeks. Ask: *\"Could we grow flowers for bees to visit?\"* This extends the interdependence concept and introduces plant needs.\n\n3. **Bee Life Cycle and Parent-Offspring Behavior (1-LS1-2):**\n   Introduce the bee life cycle with simple visuals: egg → larva → pupa → adult bee. Explain: *\"A baby bee stays with thousands of other bees in a hive. The adult bees teach baby bees how to visit flowers and find food.\"* Create a simple labeled diagram. Ask: *\"How is a baby bee like its parents? What do parents teach babies?\"* This scaffolds understanding of offspring and parental care.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** If you have bee-allergic students, use only images and models; no live observations.\n- **Real-World Connection:** If possible, observe or listen to bees visiting outdoor flowers before or after this lesson (if safe/appropriate). Even a recording of bee sounds adds authenticity.\n- **Vocabulary Depth:** First graders benefit from repetition. Use the vocabulary words multiple times across both days, and create a \"Bee Words\" word wall with pictures.\n- **Assess as You Go:** The Explore and Elaborate phases are rich with formative assessment opportunities. Use student questions and model-building attempts to adjust pacing and support.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly mirrors what students see in the photograph—a bee gathering food from a flower using specialized body parts—while building toward the core 1st-grade life science idea that animals' external structures help them survive and meet their needs.",
