Identify and describe at least three structural adaptations that help tree frogs survive in their forest habitat.\n2. Explain how an organism's body structures help it survive in a specific environment.\n3. Create a model showing how a tree frog fits into a forest food chain.\n4. Compare the life cycle of a frog to other animals they know, recognizing that frogs have a unique adaptation (metamorphosis) that helps them survive.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how the tree frog in the photograph is perfectly adapted to its environment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Enlarged print or digital projection of the tree frog photograph\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster where all students can see it clearly. Ensure the frog is the focal point.\n\n2. **Pose this opening prompt:** \"This small frog is hanging on a leaf high up in a tree. Take 30 seconds to look carefully at what you notice about this frog's body. What do you see?\"\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What parts of this frog's body do you think help it climb and hold onto the leaf?\" *(Listen for: feet, toes, body shape)*\n   - \"Why do you think a frog would need to live in a tree instead of on the ground?\" *(Listen for: safety from predators, food sources, water)*\n   - \"What would happen if this frog had feet like a duck or a lizard instead of the feet it has?\"\n   - \"Have you ever wondered why frogs look so different from other animals you know?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... what makes this frog so good at living on leaves and branches? What is special about its body?\"\n\n5. **Record student predictions** on chart paper under the heading \"What helps tree frogs survive?\" Keep this visible for the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore what makes tree frogs so perfectly suited to life in the trees. We're going to do some hands-on investigating to discover the answers.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how structural adaptations enable survival by engaging in a hands-on exploration activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Per student or pair:**\n  - 1 small piece of sandpaper (4\" x 4\")\n  - 1 smooth piece of plastic (old laminate scrap or vinyl sheet, 4\" x 4\")\n  - 1 damp sponge piece (4\" x 4\")\n  - Tape\n  - Pencil or marker\n  - \"Finger Pad Exploration\" data sheet (provided below)\n  - Paper towels\n\n- **Teacher/classroom:**\n  - Projector displaying frog photo\n  - Sticky notes (optional, for adhesion test)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Finger Pad Exploration (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** to each pair. Have students label their three surfaces: \"Sandpaper,\" \"Plastic,\" and \"Damp Sponge.\"\n\n2. **Give these step-by-step directions:**\n   - \"Look at the photograph of the tree frog again. Notice the frog's feet. The frog has special sticky pads on its toes.\"\n   - \"We're going to test three different surfaces to understand what helps the tree frog stick to smooth leaves.\"\n   - \"First, rub your fingertip gently on the sandpaper. How does it feel? Does your finger stick or slip? Write or draw what happens on your data sheet.\"\n   - \"Next, rub your fingertip on the smooth plastic. Compare this to the sandpaper. Which one helps your finger stick better?\"\n   - \"Finally, gently press your fingertip on the damp sponge. What happens? Can you feel the stickiness? Does your finger stay in place?\"\n   - \"Which surface most like what a tree frog's toe pad needs to be to stick to a wet leaf?\"\n\n3. **Record observations** on the data sheet using words and simple drawings.\n\n**Part 2: Climbing Challenge (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up a \"leaf climbing station\"** — tape the smooth plastic sheet to a wall or tilted surface.\n\n2. **Give this scenario:** \"Imagine your finger is a tree frog's toe pad. Can you move your finger up the plastic 'leaf' while keeping your finger touching it the whole time?\"\n\n3. **Students take turns** trying to \"climb\" with different techniques:\n   - Using only their fingertip (like smooth frog toes)\n   - Using their whole finger with slight pressure (mimicking the frog's sticky pad)\n   - Using their finger with the damp sponge (simulating the frog's moist toe pads)\n\n4. **Have students record:** \"Which method worked best for 'climbing' the leaf? Why?\"\n\n5. **Class discussion:** \"Why do you think the frog's real toe pads are better than any of our materials?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"What does your finger feel on each surface?\" \"Which surface lets your finger hold on best?\" \"How is that like what a real frog's toe pads do?\"*\n- Avoid explaining; instead, ask students to observe and interpret their own results.\n- Encourage students to make connections to the photograph throughout.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that damp/sticky surfaces provide better grip than smooth or rough surfaces alone.\n- Students will understand that the frog's moist toe pads are an adaptation for climbing smooth leaves.\n- Students will record observations showing they can compare surfaces and predict which works best for the frog's survival.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to the bigger concept of adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase (predictions)\n- Completed data sheets from Explore\n- Projector with frog photograph\n- Vocabulary cards or poster (with images if possible)\n- Whiteboard/markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes)**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share one discovery from their Explore activity.\n   - As they share, record key observations on chart paper (e.g., \"Damp surfaces stick better\").\n   - Affirm their thinking: \"Great observation! This is exactly what helps the tree frog survive.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes)**\n   - Display the frog photograph again. Point to specific body parts as you teach each term.\n   \n   **Vocabulary with Fifth Grade-Friendly Definitions:**\n   \n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. *\"The tree frog's sticky toe pads are an adaptation—they help it survive in the trees.\"*\n   \n   - **Structural Adaptation:** A body part that an animal has that helps it live in its environment. *\"The tree frog's toe pads and large eyes are structural adaptations.\"*\n   \n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. *\"A tree frog's habitat is high up in the trees of a rainforest or forest.\"*\n   \n   - **Camouflage:** Colors or patterns on an animal's body that help it blend in with its surroundings. *\"Look at the frog's green color—it blends in with the leaves. That's camouflage!\"*\n   \n   - **Metamorphosis:** A big change that some animals go through during their life cycle. *\"Frogs start as tadpoles in the water, then change into frogs that live on land. That's metamorphosis.\"*\n\n3. **Connections Back to the Photograph and Activity (3 minutes)**\n   - Point to the frog's feet: \"Remember when you tested the damp sponge? The frog's real toe pads work like that—they are moist and sticky, which is a structural adaptation.\"\n   - Point to the frog's eyes: \"The frog has big eyes that can see in many directions. That's another adaptation—it helps the frog spot insects to eat and see dangers coming.\"\n   - Point to the frog's color: \"The frog is green, just like the leaves. Can you see how it blends in? That's camouflage—another adaptation.\"\n   - Point to the frog on the leaf: \"The frog's entire body—its shape, size, and colors—is perfectly adapted to life in the trees.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes)**\n   - Ask: \"Who can tell me one structural adaptation the tree frog has?\" (Accept: toe pads, large eyes, green color, thin body)\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the frog needs these adaptations?\" (To survive in the tree habitat)\n   - Ask: \"Can anyone use the word 'adaptation' in a complete sentence about this frog?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name at least two structural adaptations of the tree frog.\n- Students understand that adaptations help animals survive in their habitats.\n- Students can explain why the tree frog's particular adaptations are useful for tree-dwelling life.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of adaptations to create a model of the tree frog in its food chain and ecosystem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or poster board (1 per pair or small group)\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Printed images of forest animals (optional): insects, larger birds, snakes, decomposers\n- Scissors and glue sticks\n- \"Food Chain Model\" template or graphic organizer (see below)\n- Images of leaves and plants\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Food Chain Model Creation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Provide this context:** \"The tree frog doesn't live alone. It's part of a community of living things. The frog eats insects, and larger animals eat the frog. This is called a food chain.\"\n\n2. **Model a simple example on the board:**\n   - Draw: Leaf → Insect → Tree Frog → Snake\n   - Explain: \"Energy moves from the plant to the insect, then to the frog, then to the snake. Each organism is adapted to catch or eat the one before it.\"\n\n3. **Provide the \"Food Chain Model\" template:**\n   - Box 1: A plant or leaf (producer)\n   - Box 2: An insect (consumer)\n   - Box 3: The tree frog (consumer)\n   - Box 4: A larger predator (consumer) — options: snake, bird, jaguar\n\n4. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Draw or glue pictures of each organism in the correct order.\"\n   - \"Use arrows to show the flow of energy from one organism to the next.\"\n   - \"Under each organism, write or draw one adaptation that helps it survive. (For example, under the insect, draw its antennae. Under the frog, draw its sticky toe pads.)\"\n\n5. **Emphasize:** \"Every organism on this chain has adaptations. The frog's sticky toe pads help it catch insects. Those same toe pads also help it escape from snakes!\"\n\n**Part 2: Gallery Walk and Discussion (6 minutes)**\n\n1. **Post completed food chain models** around the classroom.\n\n2. **Students walk around and observe other groups' work** (3-4 minutes).\n\n3. **Quick share-out (2-3 minutes):**\n   - \"What were the most interesting adaptations you saw on the food chains?\"\n   - \"How did the tree frog's adaptations help it survive in the chain?\"\n   - \"Did anyone think about how the frog uses its adaptations to get food AND to stay safe?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and prompt thinking: *\"Tell me about the adaptations you drew for each animal. How do they help that animal survive?\"* *\"Why is the tree frog in the middle of your chain instead of at the beginning or end?\"*\n- Guide students to see that adaptations are relevant to their role in the food chain.\n- Affirm creative thinking about multiple uses of adaptations (e.g., toe pads for climbing AND escaping).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a food chain showing the tree frog in an ecosystem context.\n- Students identify at least one adaptation for each organism in their food chain.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that adaptations help organisms survive in specific roles within a food chain.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of adaptations, habitats, and the tree frog's survival strategies.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Engage phase:** Student predictions and wonder questions reveal baseline understanding.\n- **Explore phase:** Observation of data sheets and student engagement shows whether they recognize that certain surfaces/conditions help grip.\n- **Explain phase:** Listen to student vocabulary use and ability to identify adaptations from the photograph.\n- **Elaborate phase:** Review food chain models for accuracy and evidence of understanding that adaptations relate to survival roles.\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (provided to all students at end of lesson):**\n\n*Give students a small card or half-sheet of paper with these questions:*\n\n**Exit Ticket: Tree Frog Adaptations**\n\n1. **Look at this picture of a tree frog.** (Provide a small copy of the lesson photograph or a new tree frog image.)\n\n2. **Name one body part or feature the tree frog has that helps it survive. What does it do?**\n   - Example: *The frog has big eyes so it can see insects to eat.*\n   - Your answer: _________________________________\n\n3. **Where does a tree frog live? (Circle one or write your own.)**\n   - On the ground\n   - In the trees\n   - In the water\n   - Other: __________________\n\n4. **If a tree frog had smooth, dry feet instead of moist, sticky feet, would it be better or worse at living in trees? Why?**\n   - Answer: _________________________________\n\n5. **What is one animal that might eat a tree frog?**\n   - Answer: _________________________________\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- **Meets Expectations:** Student correctly identifies 2+ structural adaptations and explains how they help the frog survive. Student accurately names the frog's habitat (trees) and demonstrates understanding of the food chain with one predator-prey relationship.\n\n- **Approaching Expectations:** Student identifies 1 structural adaptation with partial explanation. Student knows the frog lives in trees. Food chain understanding is incomplete.\n\n- **Below Expectations:** Student cannot identify clear adaptations or shows confusion about the frog's habitat. Food chain reasoning is missing or inaccurate.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will demonstrate that they can identify and name the tree frog's key structural adaptations (toe pads, large eyes, camouflage).\n- Students will explain that these adaptations help the frog survive in its tree habitat.\n- Students will show understanding that the frog is part of a food chain and that adaptations relate to feeding and avoiding predators.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Support:**\n   - Provide a visual vocabulary card for each term (with pictures) that students can reference throughout the lesson.\n   - Use simplified sentences: Instead of \"structural adaptation,\" say \"a special body part that helps the frog stay alive.\"\n\n2. **Graphic Organizer for Explore Phase:**\n   - Provide a template with sentence frames for data recording: *\"The sandpaper felt ___. My finger did/did not stick. The damp sponge felt ___. It was better/worse than the sandpaper because ___.\"*\n\n3. **Scaffolded Food Chain Model:**\n   - Pre-draw the four boxes and provide printed animal images. Students only need to arrange and glue them in order, then match written adaptation labels (rather than generating their own).\n\n4. **Paired Reading of Exit Ticket:**\n   - Have an aide or peer read questions aloud to students who struggle with reading. Allow verbal responses rather than written.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Food Web Instead of Food Chain:**\n   - Challenge advanced students to create a food web showing multiple food chains and how organisms are interconnected. Ask: \"How many different food chains can a tree frog be part of?\"\n\n2. **Behavioral Adaptations Investigation:**\n   - Extend learning to behavioral adaptations: *\"Tree frogs are active at night (nocturnal). Why would this be an adaptation? How does it help them survive?\"* Students research and present findings.\n\n3. **Metamorphosis Deep Dive:**\n   - Provide detailed information about frog metamorphosis (tadpole → tadpole with legs → froglet → adult). Challenge students to create a detailed diagram showing how metamorphosis is an adaptation that allows frogs to live in both water and on land.\n\n4. **Real-World Problem Solving:**\n   - Present a scenario: *\"A scientist is building a habitat for tree frogs in a zoo. Based on what you've learned about tree frog adaptations, what materials and environment must the scientist include?\"* Students design and justify their habitat design.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frog Metamorphosis Life Cycle Project**\n   - Students research the complete frog life cycle (eggs → tadpole → tadpole with legs → froglet → adult frog) and create a labeled diagram or comic strip showing each stage.\n   - Connection: Metamorphosis is a major adaptation that allows frogs to take advantage of both water and land habitats.\n   - Time: 30-45 minutes (can be homework or follow-up lesson)\n\n2. **Rainforest Habitat Diorama or Poster**\n   - Students create a three-dimensional diorama or poster showing a rainforest canopy with multiple organisms (tree frogs, insects, birds, plants, decomposers).\n   - They label each organism and identify how it's adapted to its role in that ecosystem.\n   - Incorporate the tree frog prominently and show its position in the food chain.\n   - Time: 45-60 minutes (homework or extended learning block)\n\n3. **Comparative Adaptations: Frog vs. Fish vs. Tree Frog**\n   - Provide pictures and information about three types of frogs: aquatic frogs (live in water), ground frogs (live on forest floor), and tree frogs (live in trees).\n   - Students create a comparison chart showing how each frog's adaptations are different and suited to its specific habitat.\n   - Discussion question: *\"How would a tree frog survive if it had to live like a fish or a ground frog?\"*\n   - Time: 30-45 minutes (can be a follow-up lesson)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety Reminder:** During the Explore phase, remind students to wash hands after handling sandpaper and damp materials. If using real leaves, ensure they are non-toxic.\n- **Sourcing Images:** The photograph provided works well for the entire lesson. Consider having a few backup images of tree frogs in different poses for the Evaluate phase.\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Post the five key vocabulary terms on the classroom wall for the duration of the unit. Reference them daily.\n- **Real Frogs (Optional):** If your school has access to a live tree frog through a nature center or classroom terrarium, a brief observation could powerfully reinforce learning. Always prioritize animal welfare.\n- **NGSS Connection Note:** This lesson directly addresses 5-LS2-1 by having students develop a model (food chain) showing how matter and energy move through an ecosystem, with the tree frog positioned as a consumer dependent on insects and serving as food for larger predators.",
