ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about plant needs and introduce the bottle garden.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The photograph (printed large, 8.5\" x 11\" or displayed on interactive board)\n- One prepared bottle with sprouting plant (your demo/example)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around printed copies. Explain: \"Today we're going to look at a special picture. Someone put a baby plant in a bottle with water. Let's be plant detectives!\"\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is that?\" (Point to the bottle, plant, water.)\n   - \"Why do you think someone put water in the bottle with the plant?\"\n   - \"What do you think will happen to this tiny plant if we keep it there with water?\"\n   - \"Do you think the plant is alive? What makes you think that?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"Right now, this plant is very small. I think it's going to grow bigger and make more leaves. What do *you* think will happen? Let's find out together!\"\n\n4. **Show your demo bottle** and pass it around (carefully) so students can see a real example. Ask: \"What parts of the plant can you see? Can you point to the leaves? The stem? The roots?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"We're going to make our own bottle gardens just like this one, and we'll watch what happens to our plants. Let's become plant scientists!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant growth by creating and observing their own bottle gardens.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 clean plastic bottle (16 oz water bottle, label removed, rinsed)\n- 1 small seedling OR bean that has already sprouted (pre-sprouted by teacher 3-5 days prior, OR purchase from garden center)\n- Water (in a pitcher or spray bottle)\n- Soil (optional—if roots are visible, no soil needed; if using soil, provide 2-3 tablespoons in a cup)\n- Masking tape and crayons/markers\n- Paper towel or small cloth (optional, to help secure plant in bottle opening)\n- Observation sheet (simple picture chart, see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Look at your bottle. Let's decorate it so we know it's yours. Use a marker to draw your name and a picture on the masking tape. Stick it on your bottle.\"\n\n2. \"Gently pour water into your bottle until it is about 1 inch deep. Be careful—we don't want to splash!\"\n\n3. \"Now, carefully place your little plant into the bottle opening. You might need to hold it gently or let it rest in the bottle. The roots will go down into the water.\"\n\n4. \"Look closely at your plant. Can you see the tiny leaves? Can you see the roots? Draw or point to what you see on your observation sheet.\" *(Provide a simple labeled diagram: leaf, stem, root.)*\n\n5. \"Put your bottle on the windowsill where it gets sunlight. We're going to watch it grow!\"\n\n6. \"Every day for the next few days, look at your plant. Did anything change? Draw what you see on your observation sheet.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Pre-sprout seeds 3-5 days before the lesson so students have visible sprouts to use.\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice about the water? Is it still there? What about the leaves—are they still green? Are they the same size as yesterday?\"\n- Help students secure plants gently in bottle openings without forcing them.\n- Encourage observation without leading answers: \"What do *you* see happening?\"\n- Provide hand-over-hand support if needed for pouring water.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create their own bottle garden and place it in light.\n- Students make daily observations and record simple drawings showing the plant's appearance.\n- Students notice that water stays in the bottle and the plant appears to be absorbing it (leaves may look fresher, or roots may show growth).\n- Students begin to see that the plant is \"alive\" and responding to its environment.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and help students make meaning of their observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photographs of plants with roots, stems, and leaves labeled\n- The original lesson photograph\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Real plant samples (if available) showing all parts\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a circle.** Bring bottles forward (carefully) so all can see. Ask: \"Let's look at our plants together. Did anything change since we started? What did you notice?\"\n\n2. **Create a chart together.** Write the heading: \"**What Plants Need to Live**\"\n   - As students share observations, record ideas. Guide toward:\n     - \"Plants need **water**\" (they drink it through their roots)\n     - \"Plants need **light**\" (from the sun, which they use to grow)\n     - \"Plants need **air**\" (to breathe, though this is simplified for K)\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** with Kindergarten-friendly language:\n\n   - **Plant:** A living thing that grows in soil or water and uses sunlight to make food.\n   - **Root:** The part of the plant that soaks up water from below. *Point to the roots in the bottle.* \"See? The roots drink the water!\"\n   - **Stem:** The part that holds the plant up and carries water from the roots to the leaves.\n   - **Leaf:** The green parts that catch sunlight and help the plant eat and grow.\n   - **Water:** What plants drink to stay alive and healthy. *Show the water in the bottle.* \"The plant's roots are drinking this water right now!\"\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:** \"Remember the picture we started with? Look—that plant in the bottle looks like our plants now. It has roots in the water, a stem, and leaves. The person in the picture gave it water and light, just like we're doing!\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Point to a plant part and ask: \"What's this called?\" (Repeat for root, stem, leaf.)\n   - Ask: \"What does a plant drink?\" (Water.)\n   - Ask: \"Where does a plant get energy to grow?\" (From sunlight.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Plant** | A living thing that grows and needs water and sunlight to be healthy. |\n| **Root** | The part under the ground (or in water) that drinks water for the plant. |\n| **Stem** | The green stick part that holds up the leaves and carries water to them. |\n| **Leaf** | The flat, green parts that catch sunlight and help the plant grow. |\n| **Water** | What plants drink to stay alive, just like we drink water. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least two parts of a plant (roots, stem, leaf).\n- Students can state that plants need water and light to survive.\n- Students understand that the plant in the photograph and their own plants have the same basic needs.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of plant needs to new scenarios and deepen thinking.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Three bottles (pre-prepared by teacher):\n  - Bottle A: Plant with water in a sunny spot (control)\n  - Bottle B: Plant with water in a dark closet or covered area (no light)\n  - Bottle C: Plant with NO water in a sunny spot (no water)\n- Chart paper labeled \"Predictions\" and \"Observations\"\n- Observation journals (simple picture cards)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the \"Plant Detective Challenge\":** \"Now that we know plants need water and light, let's test our thinking. I made three special bottles, and each one is different. Let's predict what will happen.\"\n\n2. **Show each bottle and ask predictions:**\n   - Bottle A (water + light): \"This plant has water and sunlight. What do you think will happen?\"\n   - Bottle B (water, no light): \"This plant has water, but I put it in a dark closet. What will happen without sunlight?\"\n   - Bottle C (no water, light): \"This plant has sunlight but NO water. What will happen without a drink?\"\n\n3. **Record predictions on chart paper** with drawings or words. Ask: \"Why do you think that will happen?\"\n\n4. **Over the next 3-5 days, observe the bottles together:**\n   - Compare how the plants look.\n   - Ask: \"Which plant looks healthiest? Why?\"\n   - Record observations with pictures: green/yellow, growing/not growing, healthy/droopy.\n\n5. **Conclusion discussion:** \"What did we learn? Do plants really need BOTH water and light? What happens if they only have one?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide observations without judgment: \"What color is the leaf now? How does it compare to Bottle A?\"\n- Ask: \"Why do you think Bottle B's plant is getting pale? Remember, plants need sunlight.\"\n- Validate predictions even if incorrect: \"You thought it would stay green—let's watch and see what happens!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that plants in water and light thrive (Bottle A).\n- Students notice that the plant without light becomes pale/yellow (Bottle B).\n- Students see that the plant without water becomes droopy/dry (Bottle C).\n- Students conclude that **plants need BOTH water and light** to survive.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant needs and observable changes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation Questions:** As students care for plants, ask:\n  - \"Show me the root. What does the root do?\" \n  - \"What's happening to the leaves? Why do you think that is?\"\n  - \"Why did we put water in the bottle?\"\n- **Checklist:** Observe whether students can identify plant parts and state basic needs (water, light).\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket):**\n\nUse one of these methods based on your students' abilities:\n\n**Option 1: Drawing and Labeling** *(For most K students)*\n- Provide a simple outline of a plant in a bottle.\n- Ask students to:\n  - Draw or color a leaf green.\n  - Draw or color a root.\n  - Draw water in the bottle.\n  - Point to or name one thing the plant needs to live.\n\n**Option 2: Yes/No Picture Statements** *(For emerging readers)*\nShow four pictures and ask \"Does a plant need this?\"\n- Picture 1: Water (Yes)\n- Picture 2: Light/Sun (Yes)\n- Picture 3: Toy (No)\n- Picture 4: Soil/dirt (Yes)\n\n**Option 3: Observation Checklist** *(Teacher-led)*\nAsk each student individually:\n- \"Can you show me where the roots are?\" ✓ or ✗\n- \"Can you tell me something the plant needs?\" ✓ or ✗\n- \"Did your plant grow or change?\" ✓ or ✗\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students can identify at least **two plant parts** (root, stem, leaf).\n- Students can name **at least two things plants need** to survive (water and light).\n- Students can describe **one change** they observed in their plant over time.\n- Students understand that **plants are living things** that grow and change.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will successfully identify roots and leaves.\n- Most students will state \"water\" and \"light/sun\" when asked what plants need.\n- All students will have documented observable changes in drawings or descriptions.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that this bottle garden mimics what the photograph shows.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-made observation sheets with pictures:** Provide a simple chart with boxes showing a plant with green leaves, a plant with yellow leaves, and a droopy plant. Students point to or circle which one theirs looks like each day instead of drawing from scratch.\n\n2. **Vocabulary anchor chart with photos:** Display large, clear images of each plant part (root, stem, leaf, water) on the classroom wall. Point to the chart when discussing vocabulary, and allow students to reference it.\n\n3. **Peer buddy system:** Pair emerging learners with a more confident student during Explore and Elaborate phases. The buddy can model pouring water carefully and help hold the plant.\n\n4. **Simplified language:** Use one-word or two-word phrases: \"Plant needs water.\" \"Roots drink.\" \"Leaves green.\" Reinforce these repeatedly.\n\n5. **Hands-on manipulation:** Provide real plant samples students can touch and hold (with roots, stem, and leaves already separated) so they understand parts through tactile experience, not just pictures.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended observation and predictions:** Ask advanced students to make predictions about *how much* the plant will grow. Provide a simple ruler or measurement strip. Ask: \"How many centimeters tall is your plant? Will it grow taller?\" Record measurements over time and create a simple bar graph.\n\n2. **Introduce photosynthesis concept (simplified):** Explain that \"plants eat sunlight\" and turn it into food to grow. Ask: \"What does your plant do with the sunlight? Where does it turn sunlight into food?\" (Answer: in the leaves) Discuss why the leaf in the dark bottle gets pale.\n\n3. **Experiment design:** Challenge students to design their own experiment. Ask: \"What if we didn't use water? What if we used juice? What if we used hot water?\" Have them predict, set up a test, and observe results.\n\n4. **Compare different plants:** Provide sprouts of different species (bean, basil, marigold). Ask: \"Do all plants need the same things? Do they grow at the same speed?\" Encourage observation of similarities and differences.\n\n5. **Create a \"plant care guide\":** Have students draw or dictate steps for how to care for a plant, creating their own instruction manual. This reinforces understanding of plant needs through teaching others.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Windowsill Garden Observation Project:** Send bottles home with families (with care instructions). Students observe and record changes weekly for 2-4 weeks. Create a class display of all bottles showing growth over time. Discuss: \"Which plants grew the biggest? Why? What did their owners do to help them grow?\"\n\n2. **Plant Needs Sorting Game:** Create picture cards of things plants need (water, sun, soil) and things they don't (toy, candy, rock). Students sort into two groups: \"Plants need this\" and \"Plants don't need this.\" Discuss why for each item. Extend by having students find items around the classroom or home to sort.\n\n3. **Dramatization: \"We Are Plants\":** Students act out the life cycle of a plant. One child is the root (crouches down, reaches up), one is the stem (stands and grows taller), one is the leaf (stretches arms like leaves catching sunlight), and one is water droplet (moves water to roots). Repeat the action as the \"plant grows.\" Discuss what each part does and why it matters.\n\n4. **Sensory Plant Exploration:** Bring in a variety of potted plants with different textures (soft fuzzy leaves, smooth waxy leaves, rough stems). Students touch and describe using descriptive words. Ask: \"How are these plants the same? How are they different? What does each plant need?\"\n\n5. **Picture Book Connection:** Read *\"From Seed to Plant\"* by Gail Gibbons or *\"The Tiny Seed\"* by Eric Carle. After reading, have students sequence story pictures showing plant growth stages. Connect to their own observations: \"Our plants are growing just like the ones in the book!\"\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson is designed to span 2-3 weeks if you want to see significant growth. Session 1 (Engage + Explore) takes 30-40 minutes. Sessions 2 and 3 (Explain + Elaborate) occur over the next 1-2 weeks as students observe changes. Evaluation can be embedded throughout or done as a final activity.\n\n- **Pre-lesson preparation:** Sprout seeds 3-5 days before Engage phase. This ensures students have visible root systems and leaves to observe. (Use bean seeds, which sprout quickly, or purchase small seedlings.)\n\n- **Bottle preparation:** Clean and dry bottles completely before the lesson. Label bottles A, B, C with tape for the Elaborate phase.\n\n- **Sustainability:** This lesson beautifully demonstrates upcycling—using a recycled plastic bottle as a planter. Emphasize: \"We can help plants grow using things we already have!\"\n\n- **Real-world connection:** If possible, connect to the school or classroom garden. Ask: \"Do you see gardens outside? Do those plants need water and light too?\"",
