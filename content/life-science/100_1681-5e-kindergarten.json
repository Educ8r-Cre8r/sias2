Observe and describe what a plant needs to grow and stay healthy (specifically water).\n2. Make predictions about what will happen to a plant when it receives water.\n3. Use simple words to explain why water is important for plants.\n4. Demonstrate how to water a plant and care for a living thing.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about plant needs using the photograph.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Projected or printed image of the photograph (large enough for all students to see clearly)\n  - Chart paper or whiteboard\n  - Markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  Display the photograph prominently and allow students to observe for 30-60 seconds in silence. Then facilitate this discussion:\n\n  1. **\"What do you see in this picture?\"** (Point to various parts: the bottle, the water, the green plant with leaves, the leaves of plants outside the window.)\n  \n  2. **\"Why do you think someone put a plant inside a bottle with water?\"** (Accept all answers; this is activation of prior knowledge. Students may say \"to help it grow,\" \"it's thirsty,\" \"plants like water,\" etc.)\n  \n  3. **\"What do you think the plant needs to stay alive and healthy? Let's think about what you need!\"** (Guide students to recognize: water, food, air, sunlight. Write their ideas on chart paper.)\n  \n  4. **\"If we took away the water from this plant, what do you think would happen?\"** (Encourage predictions: it would die, turn brown, stop growing, droop, etc.)\n\n  **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if we grew a plant in water like this one, would it grow bigger and stronger, or would it stay the same? Let's find out!\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be plant scientists and grow our own plants in bottles. We'll watch what happens when plants get water!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate plant needs through hands-on observation and care of a seedling in water.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Small clear plastic bottles (16-20 oz) — 1 per student or per pair (cleaned and filled partially with water)\n  - Fast-growing seedlings or bean sprouts (pre-sprouted for 3-5 days, or use nursery seedlings with small root systems visible)\n  - Observation journals or paper for drawing\n  - Colored pencils or crayons\n  - Optional: magnifying glasses\n  - Paper towels\n  - Spray bottle with water (for misting leaves if needed)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Step-by-step Student Directions:**\n\n  1. **Observe the bottle setup:** \"Look at your bottle. What do you see inside? Can you see the water? Can you see the plant's roots?\"\n\n  2. **Draw what you see:** \"Draw a picture of your bottle and plant in your journal. Color the water blue and the plant green. Draw the roots you can see.\"\n\n  3. **Make a prediction:** \"My plant will grow because it has ________.\" (Students complete the sentence—most should say \"water.\")\n\n  4. **Place the plant in sunlight:** Position bottles on a windowsill or table near natural light.\n\n  5. **Observe daily (or every 2-3 days):** \"Look at your plant each day. Is it growing? Are the leaves getting bigger? Are new leaves appearing? Draw what you see in your journal.\"\n\n  6. **Care for the plant:** If the water level drops significantly, students (with teacher guidance) add a small amount of water to keep the roots submerged.\n\n  **How the Activity Connects to the Photograph:**\n  Students are replicating the exact setup shown in the image—a seedling rooted in water—allowing them to directly observe plant growth over time.\n\n  **What Students Should Record or Document:**\n  - Initial drawing of the setup\n  - Daily or every-other-day drawings showing visible growth\n  - Simple observations: \"My plant got taller,\" \"New leaves grew,\" \"The roots got longer,\" etc.\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  Ask guiding questions without providing answers: \"What has changed since yesterday?\" \"Where is the plant growing?\" \"Do you think it's growing because of the water?\" Avoid directly stating conclusions; allow students to notice patterns through repeated observation.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  Students should observe visible growth in their seedlings over 5-7 days (longer root development, new leaf unfurling, or general size increase). They should connect this growth to the presence of water in their bottles.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after students have observed plant growth.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper or whiteboard with student observations recorded\n  - Enlarged photograph from the Engage phase\n  - Real plant (the one from the classroom or one from the photograph, if available)\n  - Picture cards or labels showing \"roots,\" \"leaves,\" \"water,\" \"grow\"\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Group Share-Out from Explore Phase:** \n     - Gather students in a circle with their observation journals.\n     - Ask 4-5 students to share one observation: \"What did you notice about your plant?\" Record key words on chart paper.\n     - Celebrate that most plants grew or changed—this is evidence.\n\n  2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary:**\n     Hold up the photograph and point to parts as you introduce terms:\n\n     - **Roots:** \"These tiny parts at the bottom of the plant drink the water. They help the plant stand up and get food from the water.\"\n     - **Leaves:** \"These green parts on the plant catch sunlight. Sunlight helps the plant make energy to grow.\"\n     - **Water:** \"This is what the plant drinks. Without water, the plant gets tired and droops.\"\n     - **Grow:** \"When a plant gets the things it needs—like water and sunlight—it grows. It gets bigger, taller, and stronger.\"\n     - **Survive:** \"To survive means to stay alive. Plants need water to survive.\"\n\n  3. **Check for Understanding:**\n     Ask simple questions:\n     - \"Show me with your hands: Where are the roots? Where are the leaves?\"\n     - \"What does a plant drink?\" (Water!)\n     - \"What happened to the plant in the picture when it got water?\" (It grew.)\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n\n  | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n  |------|----------------------------|\n  | **Roots** | The parts of the plant that drink water and hold it in the ground. |\n  | **Leaves** | The green parts of the plant that help it get energy from sunlight. |\n  | **Water** | The liquid that plants drink to live and grow. |\n  | **Grow** | To get bigger, taller, or stronger. |\n  | **Survive** | To stay alive; plants survive when they get what they need. |\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  Students should understand that plants need water to survive and grow, and can name the basic parts of a plant. They should be able to explain, in simple words, why the plant in the photograph is growing in water.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding by exploring other plants and their needs in a real-world context.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Classroom or outdoor plants (potted plants, plants outside the window, etc.)\n  - Watering cans or spray bottles\n  - Observation sheets or clipboards\n  - Optional: pictures of different habitats (desert, rainforest, aquatic)\n  - Chart showing \"What Plants Need\" (sun, water, soil, air)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Option A: Plant Care Walk (Indoors or Outdoors)**\n  \n  1. Take students on a short walk around the classroom or outside to observe plants in their natural or classroom environment.\n  2. At each plant, ask: \"Does this plant look healthy? What do you think it needs? Does it have water?\"\n  3. If appropriate, invite students to help water a classroom plant (with teacher guidance).\n  4. Return to class and draw or dictate: \"The plant I saw needed ________ to grow.\"\n\n  **Option B: Matching Game**\n  \n  1. Show pictures or real examples of different plants (a cactus, a water lily, a sunflower, a fern).\n  2. Discuss: \"Do all plants need water the same way?\" (Some need a lot of water, some need less, some grow in water.)\n  3. Students sort plants by how much water they might need: \"Lots of water,\" \"Some water,\" \"A little water.\"\n\n  **Option C: Create a Plant Needs Poster**\n  \n  1. As a class, create a visual chart showing what plants need: sunlight, water, air, and soil (or water, like the seedling in the bottle).\n  2. Students draw or add pictures to the poster.\n  3. Display in the classroom as a reference for plant care.\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  Facilitate observation by pointing out healthy vs. unhealthy plants, asking open-ended questions, and encouraging students to apply their new vocabulary (roots, leaves, water, grow, survive).\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  Students apply their understanding of plant needs to real plants in their environment. They recognize that water is essential for plant survival and can explain why in simple terms.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant needs, specifically water.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (During Lessons):**\n  - Observe student responses during discussions: Can they name plant parts? Do they identify water as essential?\n  - Review observation journals: Do drawings show evidence of plant growth? Do written or dictated observations mention water or growth?\n  - Listen to language: Are students using new vocabulary (roots, leaves, grow, survive)?\n\n  **Exit Ticket or Summative Assessment:**\n  \n  Show students the original photograph again and ask (you may ask verbally and record responses, or students may draw/write):\n\n  1. **\"Why is the plant in the bottle growing?\"** \n     - Success: Student says \"because it has water\" or \"the water helps it grow.\"\n\n  2. **\"What would happen if we took away all the water?\"**\n     - Success: Student predicts the plant would die, droop, turn brown, or stop growing.\n\n  3. **\"Draw or tell me: What does this plant need to survive?\"**\n     - Success: Student identifies water and possibly sunlight or soil.\n\n  **Alternative Assessment (Hands-On):**\n  - Students demonstrate proper plant care: watering a plant or placing a plant in sunlight.\n  - Success: Student waters carefully, understands the action helps the plant.\n\n- **Success Criteria:**\n  - Student can name at least one thing plants need to survive (water).\n  - Student can observe and describe changes in plant growth over time.\n  - Student recognizes that water is important for plant health.\n  - Student uses simple vocabulary correctly (plant, water, grow, leaf/leaves).\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  Most Kindergarten students should be able to articulate that plants need water and should show evidence of observing plant growth in their journals. All students should understand that caring for plants means providing water.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n  1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Focus on just three terms (plant, water, grow) rather than all five. Use pictures and real objects as visual references.\n  \n  2. **Guided observation:** Pair struggling students with a partner or provide one-on-one guidance during Explore. Ask leading questions: \"Is your plant bigger today?\" \"Where is the water?\" \"What color are the leaves?\"\n  \n  3. **Pre-made observation sheet:** Provide a simple sheet with drawings of a bottle on Day 1 and Day 5, and have students circle or point to what changed (size, number of leaves, etc.) rather than drawing freehand.\n\n- **Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n  1. **Prediction and hypothesis:** Ask advanced students to predict: \"If we didn't water the plant for 2 weeks, what would happen?\" Then have them suggest ways to test this (not by starving their own plant, but by discussing, observing a wilted plant, or role-playing).\n  \n  2. **Comparative observation:** Provide two seedlings—one in water (like the photo) and one in soil. Ask: \"How are these plants the same? How are they different? Do they both need water?\" Students observe and compare over 1-2 weeks.\n  \n  3. **Plant needs beyond water:** Introduce the idea that plants also need sunlight. Have advanced students place one seedling in a sunny spot and one in a darker area, and predict/observe which grows better.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Literature Connection – Plant Growth Stories**\n   - Read aloud a picture book about plants (e.g., *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle, *From Seed to Plant* by Gail Gibbons).\n   - Students act out the plant life cycle: seed → sprout → grow → flower (simple dramatization).\n   - Extend observation: \"Where did seeds come from? Do all plants grow from seeds?\" (Introduce simple diversity of plant growth.)\n\n2. **Home Plant Care Project**\n   - Send home a seedling in a water bottle (like the photograph) along with simple care instructions and a \"Plant Journal\" for parents and students to share.\n   - Instructions: \"Water when water level drops. Keep in sunlight. Draw what you see each week.\"\n   - Students bring back journals to class and share observations in a follow-up circle.\n\n3. **Classroom Plant Care Responsibility Chart**\n   - Create a rotating chart where pairs of students are assigned to water classroom plants for one week.\n   - Students record: \"Today I watered the plant. It needs water to survive and grow.\"\n   - Build responsibility and reinforce that plants depend on us to meet their needs.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
