Identify fungi as decomposers that break down dead organic matter in ecosystems.\n2. Explain how fungi help move nutrients from dead material back into the soil.\n3. Describe the role fungi play in the survival and growth of other organisms in an ecosystem.\n4. Create a model showing how matter moves through an ecosystem with the help of decomposers.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed copies of the fungal growth photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student observation worksheets (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image of the pink/red fungal growth on decaying wood on a large screen or distribute printed copies. Ask students to look closely for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Questions:**\n   - \"What do you think this pink, bumpy stuff is? Is it alive?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this organism is growing on dead wood instead of in the soil or on a leaf?\"\n   - \"What happens to all the dead branches and leaves that fall in a forest?\"\n   - \"If nothing broke down dead things, what would happen to a forest over time?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder why nature created an organism that eats dead things instead of living things. What do you think?\"\n\n4. **Capture Predictions:** Have students turn to a partner and make one prediction about what this organism does and why it might be important. Record 3-4 predictions on chart paper.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate what this mysterious organism is and discover why it's actually a superhero for the forest!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small clear containers or bags (one per student pair)\n- Pieces of dead wood, bark, or twigs (collected beforehand or purchased from craft/landscape suppliers)\n- Moist paper towels or soil\n- Water spray bottle\n- Labels and markers\n- Magnifying glasses (optional)\n- Student investigation sheets (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Building a Decomposition Model (20 minutes)**\n\n1. **Pair students.** Give each pair:\n   - One clear container\n   - One piece of dead wood/bark\n   - One moist paper towel (to simulate forest soil moisture)\n   - One label\n\n2. **Provide Step-by-Step Directions:**\n   - \"Place the moist paper towel in the bottom of your container.\"\n   - \"Place the dead wood on top of the paper towel.\"\n   - \"Spray the wood lightly with water so it's moist (like forest floor).\"\n   - \"Label your container with your names and today's date.\"\n   - \"Predict: What do you think will happen to this wood over the next few days? Will it change? Draw or write your prediction on your investigation sheet.\"\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:**\n   - \"The organisms we saw in the photo are going to grow on your wood just like they're growing on the wood in the picture. We're going to watch it happen!\"\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Students sketch or describe the wood's current appearance.\n   - Students write their prediction of what will happen.\n\n5. **Storage Instructions:**\n   - Store containers in a warm, dimly lit place (shelf near a window or classroom corner).\n   - Keep moist but not waterlogged over the next 3-5 days.\n\n**Part B: Observation Protocol (if continuing next session)**\n   - Check containers every day.\n   - Students observe and record: color changes, texture changes, any visible growth.\n   - Use magnifying glasses to look for detail.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask prompting questions without revealing the answer: \"What do you notice changing?\" \"Why might moisture be important?\" \"Do you see any living things growing?\"\n- Do not introduce the term \"fungi\" or \"decomposer\" yet.\n- Accept all predictions without judgment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe (or predict based on the photograph) that organisms grow on dead wood.\n- Students will recognize that moisture and time are factors in the decomposition process.\n- Students will understand that dead material does not simply disappear—something is breaking it down.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary and definitions\n- Photograph of the fungal growth\n- Student reference sheet or notebook\n- Optional: Pictures of different fungi types\n- Real or image examples of: mushrooms, mold, decomposing logs\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Observations (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 student pairs to share their observations and predictions.\n   - Affirm observations: \"You're right—something IS growing on the wood!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n   Present each term with student-friendly language, writing definitions on chart paper:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Fungi (FUN-jye):** Living organisms that are not plants or animals. They get energy by breaking down dead things and absorbing the nutrients.\n   - **Decomposer:** An organism whose job is to break down dead plants and animals, turning them into nutrients that can be used again.\n   - **Decomposition:** The process of breaking down dead material into smaller pieces and nutrients.\n   - **Nutrient:** A material that living things need to grow, like nitrogen and carbon found in soil.\n   - **Matter:** Anything that takes up space and has weight—in ecosystems, matter includes dead plants, animals, and nutrients in soil.\n\n3. **Make Connections to Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - \"The pink bumps in this photograph are fungi. They're decomposers. They're breaking down this dead wood.\"\n   - \"As they break it down, they're releasing nutrients back into the soil.\"\n   - \"Those nutrients will help new plants and trees grow!\"\n   - **Gesture to the image:** \"See how the fungi are scattered across the wood? They're eating the dead material, which is their job in nature.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can someone explain what the fungi in the photo are doing?\" (Students should mention breaking down or decomposing wood.)\n   - Ask: \"Why is it important that fungi do this job?\" (Accept answers about nutrients, forest health, preventing piles of dead stuff.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that fungi are living decomposers.\n- Students recognize that decomposition is a process that returns nutrients to the environment.\n- Students see fungi as organisms with a specific role in ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Diagram template or large paper\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- Model materials (optional): paper, yarn, cut-outs to build a physical model\n- Ecosystem picture cards or images (forest, field, ocean floor)\n- Student handout: \"Matter Movement in an Ecosystem\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Create a \"Matter Cycle\" Model (15-20 minutes)**\n\n1. **Task:** Students work in pairs to create a simple model or diagram showing how matter moves through an ecosystem with the help of decomposers.\n\n2. **Provide a Scaffold:**\n   - Distribute a worksheet with labeled boxes: \"Living Plant,\" \"Plant Dies,\" \"Fungi Decompose,\" \"Nutrients in Soil,\" \"Plant Grows Again\"\n   - Students draw arrows showing the movement of matter.\n   - Students label what happens at each stage.\n\n3. **Guiding Questions:**\n   - \"What happens to the plant when it dies?\"\n   - \"Who breaks it down?\"\n   - \"Where do the nutrients go?\"\n   - \"How does the next plant get nutrients to grow?\"\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - Show students pictures of different ecosystems (forest floor, garden, old apple orchard).\n   - Ask: \"Where do you think fungi are growing right now? Why do those places have lots of fungi?\"\n   - Discuss: \"Dead leaves in your yard, kitchen compost, old logs in the forest—fungi are working everywhere!\"\n\n5. **Optional Extension:**\n   - Advanced students create a more complex model with multiple decomposers (bacteria, worms, fungi) or a fuller ecosystem including animals eating plants.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide model templates for students who need structure.\n- Ask probing questions to deepen thinking: \"What would happen if fungi didn't exist?\"\n- Affirm connections between photograph, exploration, and the broader ecosystem concept.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation showing matter moving from dead organisms → decomposer action → nutrients → new growth.\n- Students explain the role of fungi in returning matter to the environment.\n- Students connect the photograph to a broader ecosystem cycle.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Observation of student questions during Engage\n- Quality of predictions in Explore phase\n- Responses to check-for-understanding questions in Explain\n- Accuracy and completeness of model in Elaborate\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (digital or paper) with the following questions:\n\n1. **Look at the photograph one more time.** What is happening to the wood? (Accept: fungi are growing on it, breaking it down, decomposing it)\n\n2. **Why does a forest need fungi?** (Accept answers about: nutrients get returned to soil, helps new plants grow, breaks down dead material, keeps forest healthy)\n\n3. **Draw or write:** Show one example of where you might find fungi decomposing dead material in your neighborhood. (Accept: yard, garden, forest, compost, etc.)\n\n**Alternative Exit Ticket (for differentiation):**\n- **Visual Exit Ticket:** Students point to a labeled diagram and identify the role of the decomposer.\n- **Verbal Exit Ticket:** Students explain their understanding to the teacher in a brief 1-on-1 conversation.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n✓ Student identifies fungi as decomposers or organisms that break down dead material.\n✓ Student explains that decomposition returns nutrients to the environment.\n✓ Student provides at least one real-world location where decomposition happens.\n✓ Student demonstrates understanding that decomposers are important to ecosystems.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can name the role of fungi in an ecosystem.\n- 75%+ of students can explain how matter (nutrients) moves from dead organisms back into the soil.\n- Students show evidence of connecting the photograph to the broader concept of nutrient cycling.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Provide a Word Bank:** Give students a list of key vocabulary words (fungi, decomposer, nutrient, decomposition, matter) to reference during discussions and written responses. Pair word cards with simple pictures.\n\n2. **Use a Sentence Frame:** For exit ticket responses, provide sentence starters:\n   - \"The fungi in the photo are ________________.\"\n   - \"Fungi are important because ________________.\"\n   - \"In my neighborhood, I see fungi breaking down ________________.\"\n\n3. **Simplify the Model:** Reduce the number of steps in the matter cycle model. Focus only on: Dead Wood → Fungi Break It Down → Nutrients in Soil. Use a three-box diagram instead of a complex cycle.\n\n4. **Pre-Teach Vocabulary:** Review key terms with support students before the Explain phase using picture cards and real examples (actual mushrooms, moldy bread, or log photos).\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper Ecological Exploration:** Ask students to research and report on different types of decomposers (bacteria, earthworms, fungi) and compare their roles. Create a Venn diagram showing how they work together.\n\n2. **Extended Matter Tracking:** Have students create a more complex ecosystem model that includes multiple organisms (e.g., plant → herbivore → carnivore → decomposers → soil → plant again). Track the same carbon atom or nitrogen atom through the entire cycle with color coding.\n\n3. **Real-World Application:** Challenge students to design a compost system for the classroom or school that uses decomposers. Have them explain which organisms would be most important and why. Bonus: Set it up and monitor it over weeks.\n\n4. **Inference and Analysis:** Provide images of ecosystems with and without visible decomposers. Ask: \"What would happen to this ecosystem if all the decomposers died? Create a prediction and explain your reasoning with details.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fungi Hunt Journals (Outdoor or Classroom):**\n   - Take students on a nature walk or look around the school grounds/community for fungi in natural decomposition settings (fallen logs, mulch, shade areas, near tree bases).\n   - Students photograph or sketch fungi they find and record the location, moisture level, and what the fungi was decomposing.\n   - Back in class, students create a \"Fungi Map\" of their school or neighborhood showing where decomposers are at work.\n   - *Connection:* Reinforces that decomposition is happening constantly in real environments.\n\n2. **Decomposition Time-Lapse Project:**\n   - Continue observing the exploration containers over 2-3 weeks, photographing them every 2-3 days.\n   - Create a time-lapse video or photo sequence showing the fungi growth and wood decomposition progression.\n   - Students write captions explaining what's happening at each stage.\n   - Present to another class to teach them about decomposers.\n   - *Connection:* Deepens understanding of decomposition as an observable process over time.\n\n3. **Nutrient Cycling Simulation Activity:**\n   - Use role-playing or a game to model matter movement in ecosystems.\n   - Assign students roles: Living Plants, Dead Plants, Decomposers (fungi), Soil Nutrients, and New Growing Plants.\n   - Use objects (beads, cards, yarn) to represent carbon and nitrogen atoms moving between roles.\n   - Students physically move around the classroom to show how matter cycles from organism to organism.\n   - *Connection:* Kinesthetic learning reinforces the abstract concept of matter cycling and interdependence.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\n- **Timing:** The Explore phase requires observation over several days. Plan accordingly—consider starting this on Day 1 and returning to observe on Days 3-5, or adjust expectations if time is limited.\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wash hands after handling wood, soil, or containers. Do not allow students to taste or handle unknown fungi found outdoors.\n- **Real-World Link:** This lesson connects to students' everyday experiences (yard waste, composting, forest visits) and helps them see science happening right in their community.\n- **Photo Reuse:** Return to the original photograph frequently throughout the lesson—students will understand it more deeply by the end.",
