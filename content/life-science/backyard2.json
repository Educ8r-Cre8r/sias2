There are yellow and white flowers blooming, green grass, a small pond, rocks, and a wooden fence in the background. You can see many types of plants growing together – tall flowers, ground covers, and garden plants creating a mini ecosystem. It's like a nature wonderland right in someone's backyard!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates a human-created ecosystem with many interacting parts. The garden includes producers (plants making food from sunlight), habitat for consumers (insects, birds, and small animals), and decomposers (in the soil). The small pond provides water for wildlife and creates a wetland microhabitat. Gardens like this support biodiversity by providing food, water, and shelter for many organisms. It shows how humans can work with nature to create healthy, thriving ecosystems!\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Ecosystem**: A community of living things (plants, animals, insects) interacting with their environment (soil, water, air, sunlight).\n\n2. **Biodiversity**: Having many different types of plants and animals living in one area. More diversity usually means a healthier ecosystem.\n\n3. **Habitat**: A place where organisms find everything they need to survive – food, water, shelter, and space to live and reproduce.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate a \"micro-ecosystem observation station\" in your schoolyard! Choose a small area (even just 2 feet x 2 feet) and have students observe it daily for one week. They can count different plant types, look for insects, notice birds visiting, and sketch what they see. This teaches ecosystem concepts through direct observation and scientific documentation.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n- **Outdoor Learning**: Take students outside to observe real ecosystems firsthand\n- **Visual Mapping**: Have students create ecosystem maps showing where different organisms live and interact\n- **Sensory Exploration**: Let students touch soil, smell flowers, listen for birds to engage multiple senses\n- **Choice in Documentation**: Students can record observations through drawings, photos, written notes, or voice recordings\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS2.C]]: Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.D]]: Biodiversity and Humans\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS2.A]]: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems]]: Understanding how parts of ecosystems work together\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1.
