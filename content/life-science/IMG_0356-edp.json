Your seed house needs to let water in, keep the seed warm and safe, and let you peek inside to see what's happening. Can your seed grow new leaves in one week?\n\n**3-5 Version:**  \n*Design and build a germination chamber that promotes optimal seedling growth.* Your chamber must (1) maintain consistent moisture without waterlogging roots, (2) allow observation of root and shoot development without opening the chamber repeatedly, (3) hold the seedling upright, and (4) fit within a 4\" × 6\" footprint. Test your design by growing a seed for 10 days and measuring root length, shoot height, and number of leaves. Compare results with at least one alternative design.\n\n## EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem** — This phase fits best because the visible mixed stages of plant development invite students to ask: *\"What conditions does a seed need to grow well?\"* and *\"How can we observe growth happening?\"* The photo doesn't show a solution yet; it shows a real-world need (plant growth) that requires investigation and problem-solving.\n\n## Suggested Materials\n\n- Paper towels or coffee filters\n- Small clear plastic cups or resealable plastic bags\n- Seeds (bean, radish, or lentil seeds work quickly)\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Ruler (for 3–5 measurement task)\n- Optional: potting soil, perlite, or sand for comparison tests\n\n## Estimated Time\n\n**K-2:** 15 minutes setup + 10 minutes daily observation over 7–10 days  \n**3-5:** 20 minutes planning + 15 minutes build + 10 minutes daily observation/measurement over 10 days + 20 minutes final analysis and comparison\n\n## Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS 3-5-ETS1-1** (define a simple design problem) and **K-2-ETS1-1** (ask questions and predict solutions to simple problems) by having students identify real constraints (moisture, light, air, stability) and test their design choices against measurable plant growth outcomes.",
