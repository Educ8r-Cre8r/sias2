Explain the relationship between insects and flowering plants, including how insects obtain food from plants.\n2. Trace the movement of energy and matter from the sun through plants to animals using a visual model or diagram.\n3. Construct an argument about why insects visiting flowers are important for plant survival and reproduction.\n4. Identify how plants obtain materials from air and water, and how those materials support plant growth that feeds other organisms.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring the plant-insect interaction visible in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the daisy with the assassin bug\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector without explanation. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about this insect? What is it doing on the flower?\" (Accept observations without correction.)\n   - \"Why do you think this bug is visiting this flower? What do you think it's looking for?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen insects on flowers or plants at home or in a garden? What were they doing?\"\n   - \"Do you think the flower gets anything from having the insect visit it, or is the insect just taking food?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder: If insects stopped visiting flowers, what would happen to the plants and flowers we see?\" Write this question on chart paper and tell students they will explore this question together.\n\n4. **Brief think-pair-share:** Have students turn to a partner and answer, \"What do plants need to grow?\" (Activate prior knowledge about plant needs.)\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate how insects and plants help each other, and how energy and materials move from plants to the animals that eat them.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how plants provide food for insects and trace the movement of energy and matter in a simple food chain.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Drawing paper or construction paper (one per student)\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Dried beans or pasta in a small container (to represent pollen)\n- Small dish or cupped hand (to represent flower center)\n- Picture cards or printouts of: sun, daisy flower, assassin bug, decomposer (earthworm or fungus)\n- Yarn or string\n- Tape or glue sticks\n- Chart showing \"What plants need: sunlight, water, air, soil nutrients\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Tracing Energy with a Model (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Explain the task:** \"We're going to create a model showing how energy moves from the sun through a plant to an insect. A model is a representation that helps us understand how something works.\"\n\n2. **Show students the picture cards** (sun, flower, insect, decomposer).\n\n3. **Demonstrate the energy chain physically:**\n   - Stand in the middle with the flower picture.\n   - Ask: \"The daisy gets energy from the sun. How? Where does it get energy?\" (Guide them: plants capture sunlight and use it along with water and air to make their own food through photosynthesis—keep language simple: \"Plants use sunlight, water, and air to make food for themselves.\")\n   - Place the sun picture to the left.\n   - Ask: \"Where does the insect get energy?\" (From eating the flower's nectar and pollen.)\n   - Place the insect picture to the right of the flower.\n   - Explain: \"The energy goes sun → plant → insect. This is called a food chain.\"\n\n4. **Student activity—Create a Food Chain Diagram:**\n   - Provide students with their paper and picture cards.\n   - Have students arrange and glue or draw the four elements: sun → flower → insect → decomposer (e.g., earthworm or soil bacteria).\n   - Have them draw arrows between each, showing the direction energy moves.\n   - Ask them to label each arrow with what is being transferred (energy, food, nutrients).\n\n5. **Documentation:** Students should write or label: \"The sun gives energy to the plant. The insect eats the plant and gets energy. When the insect dies, decomposers break it down and return nutrients to the soil for plants to use.\"\n\n**Part B: Pollination and Plant Reproduction (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Simulate pollen transfer:**\n   - Place dried beans or pasta in a small dish (representing flower pollen).\n   - Invite a student volunteer to dip their finger in the \"pollen\" and touch it to another student's hand (representing visiting a second flower).\n   - Ask: \"What just happened? The pollen from one flower is now on another flower. Why is this important?\"\n\n2. **Explain (simply):** \"When an insect visits a flower, pollen sticks to its body. When it visits another flower, the pollen comes off and helps make seeds. Without insects moving pollen, many flowers couldn't make seeds, and new plants couldn't grow.\"\n\n3. **Ask:** \"So what does the flower give to the insect?\" (Food—nectar and pollen.) \"What does the insect give to the flower?\" (Help making seeds by moving pollen.)\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate to observe students' diagrams. Ask guiding questions: \"Where does the flower get its energy?\" \"Why does the insect need the flower?\" \"What would happen if there were no insects?\" Do not provide answers; instead, prompt students to think.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students produce a food chain diagram showing energy moving from sun to plant to insect to decomposer, and understand that insects help plants reproduce by moving pollen.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration; connect back to the photograph and address learning goals.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Vocabulary posters or chart paper\n- The original photograph\n- Student food chain diagrams from Explore phase\n- Whiteboard or chart paper for recording key ideas\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Display 3–4 student food chain diagrams on the board.\n   - Have volunteers explain their diagrams to the class: \"Tell us what you showed and why you arranged it this way.\"\n   - Affirm correct representations: \"Yes, you showed that the sun's energy reaches the plant, then the insect, then the decomposer.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Write each term on chart paper and display visually.\n   - **Food Chain:** A path that shows how energy moves from the sun through plants and animals in an ecosystem. The sun → plant → insect → decomposer.\n   - **Pollinator:** An animal (like an insect) that moves pollen from one flower to another, helping plants make seeds.\n   - **Energy Transfer:** The movement of energy from one living thing to another. Plants get energy from sunlight; insects get energy by eating plants.\n   - **Matter:** All the \"stuff\" that makes up living and non-living things. Matter moves through ecosystems—water goes from soil to plants to insects; nutrients move from soil to plants and back again.\n   - **Producer:** A living thing that makes its own food using sunlight, water, and air. Plants are producers.\n   - **Consumer:** A living thing that eats other living things to get energy. Insects are consumers.\n\n3. **Revisit the Photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Show the photograph again.\n   - Ask: \"Now that we've explored, let's look at this picture again. What is happening? Use our new vocabulary words.\"\n   - Guide students to say: \"The bug is a **consumer** visiting a **producer** (the daisy). The bug is a **pollinator** helping the plant. The insect is getting energy (food), and the plant is getting help making seeds.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can someone explain why the insect needs the flower?\"\n   - Ask: \"Can someone explain why the flower needs the insect?\"\n   - Ask: \"Where did the flower get the energy to grow in the first place?\" (Sunlight, water, and air.) \"Can you trace that energy to the insect?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|-----|\n| **Food Chain** | A path showing how energy moves from the sun through plants and animals. |\n| **Pollinator** | An animal that moves pollen between flowers so plants can make seeds. |\n| **Energy Transfer** | The movement of energy from the sun to plants to animals. |\n| **Matter** | The \"stuff\" that makes up all living and non-living things; it moves through food chains (water, nutrients, minerals). |\n| **Producer** | A living thing that makes its own food using sunlight, water, and air (like plants). |\n| **Consumer** | A living thing that eats other living things to get energy (like insects and animals). |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students use the vocabulary correctly to describe the relationship between the insect and flower, and can explain how energy and matter move through a simple food chain.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by modeling how plants obtain materials and tracing matter through the ecosystem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster board or chart paper (one per small group)\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- Images or printed pictures of: soil, plant roots, flower, insect, decomposer, rain, sun, air\n- Arrows or yarn to show movement of matter\n- Optional: digital tools if available (create digital ecosystem model)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Real-World Application: Complete Ecosystem Model**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:** \"We've learned how energy moves from sun to plant to insect. But plants also need water and nutrients from soil to grow. Let's create a bigger model that shows ALL the materials (matter) that move through an ecosystem and back again.\"\n\n2. **Explain the concept (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Plants get materials from three places: sunlight from the sun, water from soil (or rain), and air (carbon dioxide). They use these to grow. When insects eat plants, those materials move into the insect. When the insect dies, decomposers break it down and return materials to the soil. The cycle continues.\"\n   - Introduce the term: **Nutrient Cycle** or **Matter Cycle.**\n\n3. **Small group task—Build an Ecosystem Model (12 minutes):**\n   - Divide students into groups of 3–4.\n   - Provide each group with chart paper and materials.\n   - Task: \"Create a circular diagram showing how water, nutrients, sunlight, and air move through an ecosystem. Include: sun, air, rain/water, soil, plant roots, flower, insect, and decomposer. Use arrows to show the direction matter moves. Label each arrow with what is being transferred.\"\n   - Circulate and prompt with questions: \"Where does water come from? Where does it go? What happens to the nutrients when a plant dies? How does the soil get its nutrients back?\"\n\n4. **Gallery Walk (3 minutes):**\n   - Display completed models around the classroom.\n   - Have groups do a quick gallery walk and observe other models.\n   - Ask: \"What do all these models have in common?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** Facilitate by asking guiding questions rather than giving answers. Encourage students to reference their food chain diagrams from Explore. Help groups see that matter cycles—it doesn't disappear; it moves from one organism to another and back to the soil.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students create a model showing how multiple materials (water, nutrients, sunlight, air) move through an ecosystem from the environment to plants to animals and back. They articulate that matter is recycled, not lost.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant-insect relationships, energy transfer, and the movement of matter through ecosystems.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Did students correctly arrange the food chain? Could they explain energy flow?\n- Vocabulary check during Explain: Could students use the six terms correctly in context?\n- Group model during Elaborate: Does the ecosystem model show multiple materials moving? Are arrows labeled?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with a question set (written or verbal for support):\n\n**Option A (Written—show with drawing or writing):**\n1. \"Look at this picture of a butterfly on a flower. Draw and label a food chain showing how energy moves from the sun to the butterfly.\"\n2. \"The flower needs water, sunlight, and air to grow. Explain where the flower gets each of these materials.\"\n3. \"Why is the butterfly important to the flower? Use the word 'pollinator' in your answer.\"\n\n**Option B (Verbal or Discussion—teacher asks):**\n1. \"Tell me what a pollinator is and give an example.\"\n2. \"Trace the energy from the sun to an insect eating a plant. What steps does the energy go through?\"\n3. \"How does matter (nutrients, water) move through an ecosystem? Does it disappear, or does it go somewhere?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- **Developing:** Student can identify what the insect and plant are doing in the photograph; can name one thing a plant needs (sun, water, or air).\n- **Proficient:** Student draws a food chain with sun → plant → insect; explains that insects help pollinate flowers; names two materials plants need (sunlight and water).\n- **Advanced:** Student creates a complete ecosystem model showing energy transfer and matter cycling; uses vocabulary correctly; explains why matter is recycled and energy flows one direction.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students demonstrate understanding that plants are producers obtaining materials from their environment, insects are consumers obtaining energy from plants, insects aid plant reproduction through pollination, and matter (nutrients, water) cycles through ecosystems while energy flows in one direction (sun → organisms).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Sentence Frames for Verbal Explanations:** Provide pre-made sentence frames for exit tickets:\n   - \"The flower gets _____ from the sun, _____ from the soil, and _____ from the air.\"\n   - \"The insect is important to the flower because it helps _____.\"\n   - \"Energy moves from the _____ to the _____ to the _____.\"\n\n2. **Simplified Food Chain Cards:** Provide pre-made, color-coded picture cards for Explore Phase so students only arrange and glue; reduce the number of organisms from four to three (sun → plant → insect).\n\n3. **Partner Pairing:** Pair struggling learners with stronger peers during the group model-building activity. Assign specific roles (one person draws, one person labels, one person manages materials).\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Food Web Model:** Have students research and create a **food web** instead of a simple food chain, showing multiple insects (bee, butterfly, ant) and multiple plants (daisy, clover, grass) all interconnected. Ask: \"What would happen if one organism disappeared from the web?\"\n\n2. **Decomposer Deep Dive:** Task students with investigating what happens to matter when organisms die. Provide resources about decomposers and have them create a detailed diagram or written explanation of how a dead insect returns nutrients to soil.\n\n3. **Real-World Pollinator Research:** Have students choose a local plant and research which pollinators help it reproduce. Create a presentation or infographic showing the plant-pollinator relationship and explain why protecting that pollinator protects the plant.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom Observation Journaling:** Set up a \"flower watching station\" if possible (a potted flower or images of flowers). Over one week, have students keep a daily journal documenting which insects visit, how long they stay, and what they observe about pollen transfer. Graph or chart their observations.\n\n2. **Design a Pollinator Garden:** Have students research plants that attract pollinators and design a small pollinator garden layout (drawn to scale). Include plant names, blooming seasons, and which pollinators they attract. Discuss how a community could create habitat for pollinators.\n\n3. **Food Chain Card Game:** Create a set of organism cards (sun, grass, flower, ladybug, butterfly, assassin bug, bird, mouse, decomposer). Shuffle and have students work in pairs to arrange them into correct food chains, then compare chains and discuss which organisms can be in multiple chains (food webs).\n\n4. **Experiment: Pollinator Simulation:** Set up stations with small cups of flour (representing pollen) and have students use brushes or cotton swabs to transfer \"pollen\" from one flower picture to another. Measure and record how much pollen transfers with each attempt. Compare different tools (brush, cotton swab, paintbrush) to see which simulates an insect's body best.",
