Identify the basic parts of a seedling (roots, stem, leaves) and describe what each part does.\n2. Predict what a seedling needs to grow (water, sunlight, soil) based on observations.\n3. Design and conduct a simple investigation to test whether seedlings need water and light to survive.\n4. Record observations about plant growth over several days using drawings and words.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how plants grow from seeds and what they need to survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed copy or digital projection of the photograph (IMG_9509.jpeg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Small potted seedling (optional, for in-hand observation)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image on the board or pass around a printed copy. Give students 30 seconds to look silently.\n\n2. **Pose Wonder Questions:** Ask students:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe it to a friend.\"\n   - \"Where did this little plant come from? Was it always this big?\"\n   - \"What do you think this baby plant needs to keep growing bigger and stronger?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the plant is surrounded by dark, wet-looking stuff?\"\n\n3. **Make a Prediction:** Ask: *\"If you had a tiny seed at home, what would you give it to help it grow into a plant like this one?\"* Have students share answers. Record their ideas on chart paper titled \"What Do Seeds Need to Grow?\"\n\n4. **Show Enthusiasm:** Say: *\"Today, we're going to be plant scientists! We'll figure out exactly what seeds need to grow big and strong—just like the seedling in this picture.\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Let's explore what plants really need by growing our own seedlings and testing our ideas.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students conduct a hands-on investigation to observe how seedlings respond to different growing conditions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 12-18 clear plastic cups or small clear containers (so roots are visible)\n- Potting soil or seed-starting mix\n- Bean seeds (dried beans work well) or radish seeds\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Masking tape and permanent markers\n- Sunny windowsill and a dark cabinet or closet\n- Observation journals or recording sheets (one per student or pair)\n- Ruler\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Setup (Teacher-Led, 5 minutes before):**\n- Prepare three identical sets of cups with moist soil and pre-planted seeds.\n- Label sets: \"Sunny + Water,\" \"Sunny + No Water,\" \"Dark + Water\"\n- Place one set in a sunny window, one in a dark space, and keep one accessible for daily watering observations.\n\n**Student Investigation (20-25 minutes):**\n\n1. **Assign Groups:** Divide the class into 3 groups. Each group is responsible for one condition.\n\n2. **Distribute Seeds and Containers:** Give each group 4-5 cups with pre-planted seeds matching their assigned condition. Have them place cups in the correct location (sunny window, dark closet, or designated watering station).\n\n3. **Daily Observations (Days 1-5):**\n   - **Day 1:** Students observe what they see right now. Record: \"Is anything happening? What does the soil look like? Can you see anything growing?\"\n   - **Days 2-5:** Students check their seeds daily. For the \"Sunny + Water\" group, spray soil lightly to keep moist. For the \"Sunny + No Water\" group, do NOT water. For the \"Dark + Water\" group, water but keep in darkness.\n\n4. **Record Observations:** Students draw and write what they see each day:\n   - *\"Did anything come up through the soil yet?\"*\n   - *\"If yes, what does it look like? Is it green? Brown? Tall? Short?\"*\n   - *\"Use your ruler to measure the seedling's height.\"*\n\n5. **Compare Groups:** At the end of 5 days, bring all three sets together and have students observe the differences:\n   - The \"Sunny + Water\" group should show healthy green seedlings.\n   - The \"Sunny + No Water\" group should show little to no growth.\n   - The \"Dark + Water\" group should show tall, pale/yellowish seedlings (etiolation).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups to ask guiding questions (not answers): *\"What do you notice about this seedling compared to the one from yesterday?\"* *\"Do you think this one is healthy? Why or why not?\"*\n- Prompt students to feel the soil: *\"Is it wet or dry? How does that match your predictions?\"*\n- Encourage drawings and words in journals without correcting observations.\n- Prevent teacher bias—let the conditions speak for themselves.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will visually see that seedlings in light and water grow best.\n- Students will document that dark conditions produce weak, pale growth.\n- Students will recognize that lack of water prevents growth.\n- Students will create a visual record (drawings with measurements) of plant changes over time.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize student observations using scientific vocabulary and connect results to the original photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase (\"What Do Seeds Need to Grow?\")\n- Healthy seedling from the investigation (preferably the \"Sunny + Water\" group)\n- Large labeled diagram showing seedling parts (optional, pre-made poster)\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Have each investigation group present their observations: *\"What happened to your seedlings? Show us your drawings. What did you learn?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"Which group had the healthiest seedlings? Why do you think that was?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   \n   Display a healthy seedling and point to each part as you teach:\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Seedling** | A very young plant that just started growing from a seed. |\n   | **Root** | The part of a plant that grows down into the soil to drink water and hold the plant in place. |\n   | **Stem** | The part of a plant that grows up and holds the leaves. It carries water and food to all the plant's parts. |\n   | **Leaves** | The green parts of a plant that catch sunlight and help the plant make its own food. |\n   | **Sunlight** | Light from the sun that plants need to grow strong and green. |\n\n3. **Connect to Observations (5 minutes):**\n   - *\"Remember the seedling in the photograph? It was green and had strong leaves—just like your healthy seedlings! That's because it had water and sunlight.\"*\n   - Point to each part on the healthy seedling: *\"This seedling has roots in the soil drinking water. Its stem is strong and green. Its leaves are catching sunlight. All three things working together help it grow!\"*\n   - Show the pale seedling from the dark group: *\"This one didn't get sunlight, so it turned pale and weak. Plants really do need light!\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"What would happen if we took the healthy seedling and put it in a dark closet for a week?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"Why do you think plants need sunlight?\"* (Accept: to make food, to stay green, to be strong.)\n   - Ask: *\"If this seedling's roots dried up, what would happen?\"* (Accept: it would die, it wouldn't grow, etc.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the main parts of a seedling and explain one function of each.\n- Students understand that sunlight and water are essential for healthy plant growth.\n- Students can predict plant behavior based on conditions (e.g., \"no water = no growth\").\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their learning to a new scenario and deepen understanding of plant needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or drawings showing different plant scenarios (see Activity below)\n- Real or toy plants in various conditions (optional)\n- Chart paper with two columns: \"Healthy Plant\" and \"Unhealthy Plant\"\n- Crayons/colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Scenario Sorting (Recommended for most classrooms)**\n\n1. **Present Scenarios:** Show images or describe situations:\n   - *Scenario 1:* A plant on a sunny windowsill that gets water every day.\n   - *Scenario 2:* A plant in a closet with no window that never gets watered.\n   - *Scenario 3:* A plant on a sunny windowsill but no one waters it for 3 weeks.\n   - *Scenario 4:* A plant in a basement corner with one small light and water three times a week.\n\n2. **Small Group Task:** In groups of 3-4, students predict what will happen:\n   - *\"Will this plant be healthy or unhealthy? Draw what you think it will look like in two weeks.\"*\n   - *\"Why did you make that choice? What did it get or NOT get?\"*\n\n3. **Gallery Walk:** Display drawings on the wall. Have students walk around and add sticky notes or comments to other groups' predictions.\n\n**Option B: Design Your Own (For advanced learners)**\n\nStudents design the \"perfect home\" for a seedling:\n- *\"Draw a picture showing where you would put a seedling and what you would do for it every day. Label the sun, water, and soil.\"*\n- Students explain to a partner: *\"Why would this be a good home for a growing plant?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate small group conversations without confirming/denying predictions.\n- Ask: *\"What makes you think that? What did the plant need that it didn't have?\"*\n- Encourage students to reference their investigation data and the photograph.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply knowledge of plant needs to new scenarios.\n- Students recognize that plants with both light and water thrive; those without one or both struggle.\n- Students create visual representations showing understanding of plant requirements.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students have met the learning objectives through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing throughout the lesson):**\n- **Observation Notes:** Circulate during Explore and Elaborate. Note which students can:\n  - Identify seedling parts accurately\n  - Make logical predictions about plant needs\n  - Record observations with detail\n- **Questioning:** Use student responses to Explain-phase check-for-understanding questions to gauge understanding in real-time.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 minutes at the end of Day 2)**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (drawn or written):\n\n**Question 1 (Visual):** *\"Draw a seedling and label the roots, stem, and leaves.\"*\n\n**Question 2 (Written/Verbal):** *\"Name TWO things a seedling needs to grow. How do you know?\"*\n\n**Question 3 (Application):** *\"If you found a sad, pale plant in a dark corner, what would you do to help it? Why?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| **Criterion** | **Proficient** | **Developing** | **Emerging** |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Identifying Parts** | Accurately labels roots, stem, and leaves; can name one function of each. | Labels 2 out of 3 parts correctly; vague about function. | Attempts to label parts but lacks accuracy. |\n| **Plant Needs** | Names at least 2 needs (sunlight, water) and explains with evidence from the investigation. | Names 2 needs but explanation is unclear or incomplete. | Names 1 need or cannot explain why. |\n| **Application** | Suggests moving plant to light/watering it and explains the reasoning. | Suggests one solution but reasoning is incomplete. | Suggests a solution with no clear reasoning. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will accurately identify the three main parts of a seedling.\n- 85% of students will correctly identify that sunlight and water are essential for growth.\n- 75% of students will apply their learning by predicting or explaining plant behavior in new scenarios.\n- All students will have created a record of plant growth over 5 days.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheets:** Provide pre-drawn seedling diagrams where students only need to circle or color the parts (roots, stem, leaves) rather than draw from scratch. Include sentence frames: *\"I see _____ growing. It is _____ (color). The plant needs _____ to stay healthy.\"*\n\n2. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair struggling students with stronger observers. During Explore, the pair shares one set of cups and takes turns recording. The stronger student models drawing/labeling while the partner observes and adds details.\n\n3. **Real Objects During Explain:** Before discussing vocabulary, let students hold and feel actual plant parts (a real seedling, a leaf, a root). Hands-on sensory input before abstract vocabulary is more accessible.\n\n4. **Repeated Exposure:** Review the photo and key vocabulary (roots, stem, leaves) for 2-3 minutes each morning during the 5-day investigation period to reinforce retention.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Variables:** Challenge advanced groups to add a fourth condition—*\"What if we gave a plant water but rotated it so it never faced the sun directly?\"* or *\"What if we gave a plant only colored light (red vs. blue)?\"* Have them form hypotheses and observe.\n\n2. **Measurement and Graphing:** Have advanced students create a line graph showing seedling height over 5 days for each condition. Ask: *\"Which condition made the fastest growth?\"* and *\"Can you predict how tall the plant might be on Day 10?\"*\n\n3. **Research Extension:** Provide books or simple websites about how different plants grow (fast-growing vs. slow-growing; plants that prefer shade vs. sun). Have students create a poster: *\"Which plants are best for a sunny classroom window?\"*\n\n4. **Reverse Engineering:** Show photos of struggling houseplants and have students diagnose the problem: *\"Why do you think this plant looks droopy? What would you recommend?\"* This requires applying knowledge to real-world plant care.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grow a Classroom Bean Plant to Maturity (2-3 weeks):**\n   - Select the healthiest seedling from the investigation.\n   - Transplant it into a larger pot with soil.\n   - Place on the sunny windowsill and water regularly.\n   - Have students measure, draw, and measure weekly to track growth from seedling → established plant → flowering/fruiting stage.\n   - **Connection:** *\"Let's see what happens after the seedling stage!\"*\n\n2. **Plant a Seed in a Sealed Bag (Quick, Great for Home):**\n   - Give each student a ziplock bag with a moist paper towel and a bean seed.\n   - Have them tape it to a sunny window at home.\n   - Each day, they observe and draw what happens (usually sprouts in 3-5 days).\n   - Return drawings to school and create a class book: *\"Our Seeds Grew!\"*\n   - **Connection:** *\"Can you grow a seedling without soil? What do the roots need?\"*\n\n3. **Investigate Other Plant Needs (Water pH, Soil Type, Temperature):**\n   - After mastering sunlight and water, introduce a simple follow-up: *\"Does the type of water matter?\"* or *\"Does temperature change how fast seeds sprout?\"*\n   - Design similar investigations comparing distilled water vs. tap water, or placing seeds in a warm spot vs. a cool spot.\n   - **Connection:** *\"We discovered two big needs. Are there other secrets plants have?\"*\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\n- **Timing:** The 5-day investigation can compress to 3 days in a pinch, but 5 days gives clearer observable differences. Plan accordingly.\n- **Moisture Management:** Keep the \"Sunny + Water\" and \"Dark + Water\" groups equally moist (not soggy). The \"Sunny + No Water\" soil should be moist initially but not watered again.\n- **Safety:** Bean and radish seeds are non-toxic but remind students not to eat them. Ensure drainage holes or monitor water so mold doesn't grow.\n- **Real-World Connection:** Consider having a houseplant in your classroom. Reference it throughout: *\"See how our classroom plant sits by the window? That's what it needs!\"*\n\nThis lesson directly addresses **2-LS2-1** by having students plan and conduct a structured investigation to test the necessity of sunlight and water for plant growth. The photograph serves as the hook—a real seedling that students can observe, measure, and use as a reference point for their own growing plants.",
