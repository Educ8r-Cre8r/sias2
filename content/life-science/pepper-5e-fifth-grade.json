Identify the main structures inside a pepper fruit and explain what each structure does.\n2. Describe how a pepper plant uses water, air, and soil nutrients to grow and produce seeds.\n3. Explain how seeds help pepper plants survive and create new plants.\n4. Use evidence from the pepper to support claims about what plants need to grow.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about what's inside fruits.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed on projector, document camera, or printed poster board)\n- One whole fresh green bell pepper (unopened) for teacher to hold\n- Red poster board or colored background (as in photograph)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image of the cut pepper on the screen. Do NOT explain what it shows. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Pose Intriguing Questions:**\n   - \"What do you think this object is? What clues help you know?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen inside a pepper before? What surprised you about what's inside?\"\n   - \"What do you think those little cream-colored bumpy things are?\" (pointing to the seeds/placenta)\n   - \"Why would a pepper plant make so many tiny things inside one fruit?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** Hold up the unopened whole pepper. Say: \"This is a pepper plant's fruit, just like an apple or orange is a fruit. Inside this pepper is something very important for making new pepper plants. Turn to a neighbor and predict: What do you think is inside? Why would the plant put it there?\"\n\n4. **Record Predictions:** Have 3–4 students share predictions aloud. Write key ideas on chart paper (e.g., \"seeds,\" \"food,\" \"water\").\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to cut open a pepper and become plant scientists—we'll discover what's really inside and figure out why pepper plants make these special structures.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the internal structures of a pepper through careful observation and recording.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3–4 students):**\n- 1 fresh green bell pepper, already cut in half lengthwise (or students will cut with plastic knife)\n- Plastic knives (if students will cut; otherwise pre-cut by teacher)\n- Paper towels\n- Small paper plates or trays to contain seeds and pieces\n- Hand lenses (1 per student)\n- Observation sheet (template provided below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Small cups of water (for rinsing hands if needed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute Materials:** Give each group a pre-cut pepper half, plate, hand lens, and observation sheet.\n\n2. **Student Directions (Read aloud and display on board):**\n   - *Step 1:* Look at the outside of your pepper half. Use the hand lens. What color is it? Is it smooth or bumpy? Draw what you see.\n   - *Step 2:* Gently touch the inside walls of the pepper. Are they thick or thin? Smooth or bumpy?\n   - *Step 3:* Look for the white or pale yellowish bumpy structure inside. This is called the placenta. Carefully remove a few seeds and place them on your paper towel. Count them. Sketch them with the hand lens.\n   - *Step 4:* Feel the seeds. Are they hard or soft? Are they attached to anything?\n   - *Step 5:* Look at the green chambers or sections inside the pepper. How many do you see? Draw the inside layout of your pepper.\n   - *Step 6:* Use the hand lens to look at a single seed up close. Describe it in 2–3 words on your observation sheet.\n\n3. **Documentation:** Students complete the \"Pepper Scientist\" observation sheet (template below).\n\n   **PEPPER SCIENTIST OBSERVATION SHEET**\n   ```\n   Name: ________________________    Date: ___________\n   \n   OUTSIDE THE PEPPER:\n   Color: ____________   Smooth or Bumpy? ______________\n   Thickness of wall: thin / thick / medium\n   \n   INSIDE THE PEPPER:\n   Sketch what you see:\n   [Box for drawing]\n   \n   Seeds: I counted _____ seeds in my pepper.\n   \n   One seed looks like: _________________________ (2–3 words)\n   \n   The white/yellow bumpy part is attached to: _______________\n   \n   Questions I have about my pepper:\n   1. ___________________________________________________\n   2. ___________________________________________________\n   ```\n\n4. **Connection to Photograph:** Pause halfway through exploration. Display the photograph again. Ask: \"Does your pepper look like the one in the picture? What's the same? What's different?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: *\"What are those white bumpy things holding onto?\"* or *\"Count your seeds—are there a lot or a few?\"*\n- Redirect observations rather than confirming: *\"I notice you said the walls are thick. How does that help protect what's inside?\"*\n- Do NOT label structures yet. Students should use their own descriptive language.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and sketch a cut pepper.\n- Students count 50–150+ seeds per pepper.\n- Students notice that seeds are attached to the white/cream structure (placenta).\n- Students record their observations in words and drawings.\n- Students generate questions about why peppers are designed this way.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to life science concepts about plant reproduction and growth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Labeled diagram of pepper cross-section (teacher-created or from NGSS resource library)\n- The photograph (displayed again)\n- One more whole pepper (optional, for demonstration)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out (5 minutes):** Ask groups to share 1–2 observations. Create a class list on chart paper titled \"What We Found Inside Our Peppers.\" Accept all descriptive language (seeds, little bumpy things, chambers, walls, etc.).\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (7–8 minutes):** Using the photograph and student observations, teach these terms:\n\n   **VOCABULARY:**\n   - **Pepper (Fruit):** The part of a flowering plant that holds and protects seeds. Not all fruits are sweet—some, like peppers, are vegetables we eat!\n   - **Seeds:** Tiny objects inside the fruit that can grow into new pepper plants. Seeds hold a baby plant inside plus food to help it start growing.\n   - **Placenta:** The white or cream-colored bumpy structure inside the pepper that holds and feeds the developing seeds before the pepper ripens. It's like a \"seed holder.\"\n   - **Pericarp:** The thick green outer wall of the pepper that protects the seeds inside, like a strong shell.\n\n3. **Make Connections to the Photograph (4–5 minutes):**\n   - Project the photograph. Point to and label each structure.\n   - Ask: *\"Why would a plant make such a thick wall around its seeds?\"* (Protection from being eaten or damaged.)\n   - Ask: *\"Why are there so many seeds in one pepper?\"* (If some seeds get eaten or don't grow, others might survive and become new plants.)\n\n4. **Connect to Plant Growth (3 minutes):** \n   - Ask: *\"How do you think this pepper grew so big? What did the pepper plant need?\"*\n   - Guide students to recognize: *\"The plant used water from the soil through its roots, air (carbon dioxide) through its leaves, and nutrients from the soil—all of this helped the pepper grow big and strong so it could hold lots of seeds.\"*\n   - Display a simple diagram showing arrows of water (up from roots) and air/sunlight (into leaves).\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"Can anyone show me a seed on the photograph? What's it connected to?\"* (Raise hand responses.)\n   - Ask: *\"Why is the outer wall green? What does it protect?\"* (Choral response or turn-and-talk.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand the function of each pepper structure.\n- Students can label or identify structures on the photograph.\n- Students begin connecting pepper structure to what plants need (water, air, soil nutrients).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of plant structures and growth to a new context—plant growth cycles and survival strategies.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Activity Choice 1 (Recommended):** Seed Prediction & Growth Model\n  - Lima bean seeds or bean seeds (soaked overnight)\n  - Clear plastic cups\n  - Potting soil\n  - Water\n  - Chart paper showing \"Timeline of a Bean Plant\"\n  \n- **Activity Choice 2:** Pepper Life Cycle Diagram\n  - Blank paper or poster board\n  - Markers, colored pencils, magazines (for cutting/collaging)\n  - Scissors, glue sticks\n\n- **Activity Choice 3:** Plant Needs Investigation\n  - Pre-made scenarios on cards (see below)\n  - Chart paper labeled \"What Plants Need to Grow\"\n\n**Activity: Plant Growth Model (Most Direct Connection)**\n\n1. **Show and Tell (2 minutes):** Display soaked bean seeds. Explain: *\"These seeds look similar to the pepper seeds you observed. If we plant them, they'll grow into bean plants. Let's trace the journey of a seed from inside a fruit to a growing plant.\"*\n\n2. **Build a Growth Model (10 minutes):** \n   - Students work in pairs or small groups.\n   - **Task:** Create a simple labeled diagram showing the journey of a pepper seed:\n     - *Stage 1:* Seed inside the pepper fruit\n     - *Stage 2:* Seed planted in soil with water and air\n     - *Stage 3:* Seed sprouting into a seedling\n     - *Stage 4:* Young pepper plant growing\n     - *Stage 5:* Adult plant making flowers\n     - *Stage 6:* Flower becomes a new pepper (cycle repeats)\n   \n   - At each stage, students draw arrows and label: **What the plant needs** (water from soil, air/sunlight, nutrients).\n\n3. **Plant a Seed (5–8 minutes, optional for more time-intensive version):**\n   - Distribute cups, soil, and bean seeds.\n   - Students plant one seed 1 inch deep, water gently.\n   - Explain: *\"Over the next 2–3 weeks, we'll observe this seed grow just like a pepper seed would. It will use water, air, and nutrients from the soil.\"*\n   - Assign two \"seed scientists\" per plant to water and observe daily.\n\n4. **Reflection Question:** *\"What would happen if we didn't give the seed water? Or if we put it in a dark closet with no light?\"* (Turn-and-talk or write one sentence.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to ensure students are labeling each stage clearly.\n- Ask: *\"Where does the seed get water? Where does it get air?\"* to reinforce inputs.\n- Facilitate the planting process to minimize spills; demonstrate the correct depth and watering amount.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a diagram showing the full life cycle of a pepper or bean plant.\n- Students identify water, air, and soil nutrients as essential inputs at different growth stages.\n- Students plant a seed and take responsibility for its care.\n- Students can explain how a seed becomes a plant that eventually makes new seeds.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pepper structures, plant growth requirements, and life cycles.\n\n**Formative Assessments (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase reviewed for accuracy and detail.\n- Hand-raise responses to check-for-understanding questions in Explain phase.\n- Quality of labels and connections in Elaborate phase diagrams.\n\n**Summative Exit Ticket (Administer at end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a printed exit ticket. Students may draw or write answers.\n\n   **PEPPER SCIENTIST EXIT TICKET**\n   ```\n   Name: ______________________    Date: ___________\n   \n   1. Draw and label 3 parts of a pepper and what each part does.\n      [Box for drawing]\n   \n   2. Fill in the blanks:\n      Pepper plants need _____________ from the soil, \n      _____________ from the air, and _____________\n      from sunlight to grow big and strong.\n   \n   3. Why does a pepper plant make so many seeds inside one fruit?\n      (Circle your best answer)\n      A. To make the fruit taste better\n      B. To give more seeds a chance to grow into new plants\n      C. To feed the pepper plant\n      D. Because it's fun for the plant\n   \n   4. If a seed from a pepper grew into a plant, what would it need?\n      List 2 things: ______________________________\n   ```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students correctly identify at least 2 of 3 pepper structures (seed, placenta, pericarp).\n- Students correctly identify 2–3 things plants need (water, air/CO₂, sunlight, soil nutrients).\n- Students explain that multiple seeds increase survival chances (demonstrates understanding of adaptation).\n- Students can apply knowledge to explain what a seedling needs.\n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Exit tickets scored on a 3-point scale (emerging, proficient, advanced).\n- Proficient = correctly answers 3 of 4 questions with labels/explanations.\n- Review observation sheets for evidence of careful observation and curiosity.\n- Monitor seed-planting follow-up observations over next 2–3 weeks for evidence of sustained understanding.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a pre-drawn diagram of a pepper cross-section with blanks to fill in (e.g., \"This is a ____. It holds ____. It protects ____\"). Students label rather than sketch from scratch.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Word Bank:** During Explain phase, provide a chart with pictures and words (seed, placenta, pericarp, pepper). Students point to or match rather than recall independently.\n\n3. **Peer Observation Partnerships:** Pair struggling students with proficient peers during Explore. Assign roles: one student observes aloud while partner records; then switch. This scaffolds both language and recording.\n\n4. **Modified Exit Ticket:** Provide multiple-choice or matching format instead of open-ended questions. Include a word bank for fill-in-the-blank items.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Comparative Fruit Study:** Provide cross-sections of another fruit (tomato, apple, or cucumber). Challenge students to compare: *\"How are the insides similar? Different? Why might fruits from different plants have different arrangements of seeds?\"* Students create a Venn diagram or comparison chart.\n\n2. **Seed Dissection & Germination Prediction:** Provide germination prediction hypothesis. Split a soaked bean seed carefully in half (pre-done by teacher). Students use hand lens to identify the embryo plant and food storage. Then they predict and test: *\"Will a split seed still germinate? Why or why not?\"* Students design a mini-experiment over 1–2 weeks.\n\n3. **Plant Adaptation Research:** Challenge students to research and present why pepper plants evolved to produce many seeds. Introduce the concept of **natural selection**: *\"Plants that made more seeds were more likely to survive and pass this trait on.\"* Students create an illustrated poster or digital presentation explaining this.\n\n4. **Water & Nutrient Transport Modeling:** Provide materials to create a model showing how water moves up from roots and nutrients disperse through a plant (e.g., celery in colored water, yarn string showing pathways). Students explain the model in writing or to a peer.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Sprouting Race & Observation Journal (1–2 weeks follow-up):**\n   - Students plant pepper or bean seeds in cups with different conditions: one with light & water, one in darkness, one with no water.\n   - Over 10–14 days, students observe and sketch daily in a journal.\n   - Compare growth. Discuss: *\"Which seed sprouted? Which did not? What does this tell us plants NEED?\"*\n   - Connects to 5-LS1-1 (materials needed for growth).\n\n2. **From Seed to Fruit: Pepper Plant Life Cycle Comic Strip (Take-Home/Extension):**\n   - Provide a 6-panel blank comic strip template.\n   - Students illustrate and write captions showing: seed → sprout → seedling → flowering plant → flower → pepper fruit (with seeds inside).\n   - Assign one panel per student pair; compile into a class comic book.\n   - Reinforces life cycle understanding and sequencing.\n\n3. **Seed Dispersal Exploration & Design Challenge (1–2 class periods):**\n   - Ask: *\"How do pepper seeds get from a fruit to the ground so they can grow into new plants?\"*\n   - Explore real examples: peppercorns in a food/spice, wind-blown seeds (like maple helicopters), animal-dispersed seeds.\n   - **Design Challenge:** *\"Design a structure to protect and carry a pepper seed so it could travel to a new growing spot.\"* Use craft supplies (cotton balls, paper, rubber bands, tissue). Test designs with a gentle \"wind test\" (blow) or \"animal test\" (toss).\n   - This extends understanding of plant adaptation and survival strategies.\n\n4. **Interdisciplinary: Cooking with Peppers & Discussion (Science + Health/Social Studies):**\n   - Bring a fresh pepper to the kitchen (or classroom if policy allows). Show how we eat peppers as food.\n   - Discuss: *\"We eat peppers as vegetables, but to the plant, they're fruits that hold seeds. Why would people eat these fruits?\"* (Nutrition, taste, food security—ancient peoples cultivated peppers.)\n   - Safe tasting activity (if no allergies): Try raw pepper slice. Discuss texture, flavor, seeds.\n   - Connect to ecosystems: *\"What animals eat peppers in nature? How does that spread seeds?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Summary\n\n**This lesson addresses:**\n- **5-LS1-1** through focus on what pepper plants need (air, water, soil) to grow and develop seeds.\n- **5-LS2-1** through modeling how matter (water, nutrients, air) moves from environment into the plant and becomes part of the growing pepper and seeds.\n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** Structure & Function (seed structure protects embryo; placenta holds seeds), Systems & Models (plant as a system taking in materials and producing fruit).\n- **Science Practices:** Developing and using models, analyzing data from observations, supporting arguments with evidence from the pepper.\n\n---\n\n**Ready to teach?
