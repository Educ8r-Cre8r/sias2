ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (at least 18\" × 24\") or digital display on smartboard/projector\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Audio of water sounds or fall ambience playing softly\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen where all students can see it clearly. Give them 30 seconds of silent looking time.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (one at a time, wait for responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about the trees.\" (Accept all responses: colors, leaves, water, wood, dock.)\n   - \"Why do you think these trees are growing right next to the water?\" (Allow wild guesses and reasoning.)\n   - \"Look at the leaves — what colors do you see? Why might they be different colors?\" (Introduce idea of seasons changing.)\n   - \"If you were a tree, what would you need to stay healthy and happy?\" (Activate prior knowledge about basic needs.)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... do you think the trees drink the water like we drink water? Let's find out!\" \n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper. Label it \"What Trees Need to Live.\" This becomes a reference tool throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Good thinking! Now we're going to explore and discover what trees really need by being scientists.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 2-3 small potted plants (or fast-growing seeds in clear cups with soil)\n- Water in watering cans or cups\n- Sunny windowsill and a dark closet or cabinet\n- Simple observation worksheets (pictures of plants with sunny/dark, watered/dry conditions; students circle or color)\n- Chart paper labeled \"Our Plant Experiment\"\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide the class into two groups** (you can do this simultaneously with parent volunteer help or rotate groups if alone).\n\n2. **Group 1 — Light Investigation:**\n   - Place one potted plant on a sunny windowsill.\n   - Place an identical plant in a dark closet or under a covered box.\n   - Have students water both plants equally every day (demonstrate once; let them help).\n   - Over 5-7 days, students observe which plant looks happier, greener, and stronger.\n   - **Student task:** Draw or color a picture comparing the two plants. Which one looks healthier?\n\n3. **Group 2 — Water Investigation:**\n   - Provide two small pots with the same type of plant or soil.\n   - Water one plant normally (about 1-2 tablespoons every other day).\n   - Keep the other plant completely dry (don't water it).\n   - Have students observe for 5-7 days and notice changes.\n   - **Student task:** Draw or color a picture showing what happens to the plant that gets water vs. the one that doesn't.\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Ask guiding questions without giving answers: \"What do you notice? Is this plant the same as yesterday? What do you think happened?\"\n   - Help students water plants carefully (fine motor practice).\n   - Encourage students to touch soil gently, observe leaves, compare colors.\n   - Do NOT say \"Light helps plants\" or \"Plants need water\" — let them discover.\n\n5. **Daily Observations (can be shortened if you use established plants):**\n   - Students draw pictures each day on a simple chart.\n   - Encourage phrases like \"The sunny plant looks...\" or \"The dry soil feels...\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that plants with light and water look greener and healthier.\n- Students will notice visible wilting, browning, or drooping in neglected plants.\n- Students will record observations through drawings (writing optional for K).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase (\"What Trees Need to Live\")\n- Photograph of the dock and trees (displayed again)\n- Picture cards or clipart showing: sun, water droplet, soil\n- Markers in multiple colors\n- Optional: Real leaf samples from outside\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on the carpet.** Ask them to bring their observation drawings from the Explore phase.\n\n2. **Share-Out from Exploration:**\n   - Invite 3-4 students to show their drawings and tell what they discovered.\n   - Highlight key observations: \"You noticed the sunny plant stayed green!\" or \"The plant without water drooped down.\"\n\n3. **Introduce the Big Idea:**\n   - \"Scientists discovered something important: Plants need three main things to stay alive.\"\n   - Point to the picture again. \"Remember those trees by the water? They're happy and healthy because they have everything they need!\"\n\n4. **Teach Key Vocabulary** (use visuals for each):\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Visual** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|-----------|\n   | **Sunlight** | Bright light from the sun that helps plants grow and stay green | Picture of sun; point to window |\n   | **Water** | Liquid that plants drink through their roots (like we drink juice) to stay healthy | Picture of water droplet; point to lake in photo |\n   | **Soil** | The dirt where plants grow their roots and get food | Hold up soil sample or point to ground |\n   | **Roots** | The part of the plant that drinks water from the ground (usually under the dirt) | Draw on board; show on a real plant if available |\n   | **Leaves** | The green parts on trees that help catch sunlight | Hold up or show a real leaf |\n\n5. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - \"Look at this picture again. Do these trees have sunlight?\" (Yes — the sun is shining on them.)\n   - \"Do they have water?\" (Yes — they're right next to the lake!)\n   - \"Do they have soil?\" (Yes — their roots are in the ground on the shore.)\n   - \"That's why these trees are so big and healthy!\"\n\n6. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Without water, what happens to a plant?\" (It wilts/droops.)\n   - \"If a plant is in a dark closet, what might happen to its leaves?\" (They turn brown/yellow.)\n   - \"Where do trees drink water from?\" (The ground/soil through roots.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least two things plants need (sunlight and water).\n- Students understand that the trees in the photo are healthy because they have their needs met.\n- Students use the new vocabulary in context.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with heading: \"Trees Need...\"\n- Picture cards: sun, water, soil, seed, roots, leaves\n- Glue sticks and large poster paper\n- Magazines or clipart sheets to cut out pictures (optional)\n- Access to the outdoor area or window view\n\n**Activity Option 1 — Tree Needs Collage (Indoor):**\n\n1. **Show students a large poster labeled \"Trees Need...\"**\n2. **Provide picture cards or cut-out images** of the three things trees need plus related images (seed, roots, leaves, rain, clouds).\n3. **Student task:** Glue pictures onto the poster to show what trees need.\n4. **Class discussion:** \"Can we find any pictures of trees that are healthy? How do we know they're healthy?\" (They're green, big, have lots of leaves.)\n5. **Create a classroom \"Trees Are Alive\" bulletin board** with completed work.\n\n**Activity Option 2 — Tree Walk & Observation (Outdoor, weather permitting):**\n\n1. **Take students outside** to observe a real tree or shrub on school grounds.\n2. **Ask them:**\n   - \"Is the sun shining on this tree?\" (Point up.)\n   - \"Do you think this tree gets water? Where from?\" (Rain, sprinklers, ground.)\n   - \"Can you see the roots?\" (Usually no, but they're in the ground.)\n   - \"What color are the leaves?\" (Helps determine if tree is healthy.)\n3. **Collect a fallen leaf** (if safe and appropriate) and examine it together.\n4. **Compare to the photograph:** \"This tree needs the same things as the trees in our picture!\"\n\n**Activity Option 3 — Act It Out (Movement/Drama):**\n\n1. **Students become trees:**\n   - \"Pretend you're a tree. Show me how you look when you get lots of sunlight!\" (Stretch tall, reach arms up.)\n   - \"Now pretend you don't get water. How do you look?\" (Droop, bend, slow movements.)\n   - \"Now you get water again! Show me how you perk up!\" (Straighten, reach up again.)\n2. **This kinesthetic activity embeds the concept** that trees respond to their needs.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion without leading answers.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"Why do you think the tree perked up when it got water?\"\n- Praise specific observations: \"You noticed the healthy leaves are bright green!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation showing trees need sunlight, water, and soil.\n- Students apply concepts to real-world observation (actual trees).\n- Students demonstrate understanding through movement and discussion.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what plants need to survive.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation notes:** Listen to student responses during Engage and Explain phases. Do they mention at least two plant needs?\n- **Drawing analysis:** Review student observation drawings from Explore phase. Do they show differences between plants with and without resources?\n- **Questioning:** Use think-pair-share: \"Turn to a friend and tell them one thing trees need to survive.\"\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (5 minutes at end of Lesson):**\n\n**Choose ONE format based on your class:**\n\n**Option 1 — Picture Sorting (Non-reader friendly):**\n- Show students 4 picture cards: sun, rock, tree, water\n- Ask: \"Which two pictures show things that trees need?\" \n- Students point or place pictures in a hoop labeled \"Trees Need This.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Correctly identifies sun and water (or soil).\n\n**Option 2 — Drawing with Dictation (Kindergarten-appropriate):**\n- \"Draw a happy, healthy tree. Then tell me one thing your tree needs to stay alive.\"\n- You or an aide scribe their response.\n- **Success Criteria:** Drawing shows a tree; student can name at least one need (sunlight, water, soil).\n\n**Option 3 — Verbal Check (Whole Group):**\n- Gather students. Ask individually or in small groups:\n  - \"Name one thing a tree needs to live.\"\n  - \"If a plant doesn't get water, what happens?\"\n  - \"Why are the trees in our picture healthy?\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student correctly answers at least 2 of 3 questions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify at least two things plants need to survive (from the list: sunlight, water, soil).\n- Students explain the connection between the photograph (trees by water in sunlight) and why those trees are healthy.\n- Students demonstrate understanding through drawings, verbal responses, or sorting activities.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only \"sun,\" \"water,\" and \"dirt\" if \"soil\" and \"roots\" are too abstract. Add these terms gradually.\n\n2. **Concrete Demonstrations:** Show a withered plant alongside a healthy one. Let students touch and compare. Say, \"This plant has water. This plant does NOT have water. What's different?\" This makes the concept tangible.\n\n3. **Smaller Group Work:** During Explore phase, provide extra adult attention. Pre-plant seeds in clear cups so growth is visible in days, not weeks. Use faster-growing plants (bean seeds, fast grass).\n\n4. **Chunked Questions:** Instead of \"What do trees need?\", ask simpler yes/no questions first: \"Do trees need water? Yes or no?\" Then, \"Do they need sunlight?\" Build from there.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extended Inquiry:** Challenge students to predict and test: \"What if we give this plant extra water? What might happen?\" Introduce the concept of \"too much\" (roots rot). Observation becomes more sophisticated.\n\n2. **Multi-Step Thinking:** Ask, \"The trees in the picture grow by the water. Why do you think they don't grow in the dark forest away from the sun?\" Push them to synthesize multiple needs.\n\n3. **Real-World Connection:** Show pictures of different habitats (desert, rainforest, grassland, forest). \"Why might trees in the desert be smaller or different? Do they still need sun, water, and soil?\" Introduce adaptation.\n\n4. **Seasonal Exploration:** Bring in pictures of the same trees in winter, spring, and fall. \"Do trees need the same things in winter? Do they still have water? Where is it?\" Build foundational understanding of life cycles.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Our Classroom Tree Journal\"** — Throughout fall and winter, students observe a tree on school grounds weekly. Take photos or draw pictures showing the tree in different seasons. Build a class booklet titled, \"How Trees Change but Still Need the Same Things.\" Compare leaves, branch shape, and growth patterns. This extends LS1-1 by having students observe long-term patterns.\n\n2. **\"Trees Around Our School\"** — Take students on a nature walk around the school or neighborhood. Create a simple map showing where trees grow. Ask: \"Why do trees grow here?\" (Near water? In sunlight? In soil?) Back in class, sort pictures of trees by habitat. Discuss: \"What do all these trees have in common?\" (They have the same basic needs, even in different places.)\n\n3. **\"Plant Care Responsibility Chart\"** — Assign students to be \"plant caretakers\" for classroom plants on a rotating schedule. Create a simple picture chart: sun (move plant to sunny spot), water (watering can), and soil (check it's moist). Students take turns and earn a \"Plant Helper\" sticker. This embeds the concept through ongoing responsibility and observation.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing Flexibility:** If you want to complete this in one session, shorten Explore to 10 minutes by using pre-established plants that already show visible differences (healthy vs. neglected). Show pictures of growth progression rather than waiting for live growth.\n  \n- **Photography Connection:** This lesson is especially powerful if taught when fall colors are visible outside your classroom. Take students to view the actual trees; connect the photograph to their real-world observations.\n\n- **Vocabulary Scaffolding:** For Kindergarten, \"roots\" is abstract. Use phrases like \"the part that drinks water underground\" before introducing \"roots.\" Add \"roots\" in Explain phase after students have explored with concrete observations.\n\n- **Safety:** If using real plants, ensure they're non-toxic and no soil is ingested. Supervise water activities closely.\n\n- **Family Connection:** Send home a simple one-page handout with three pictures (sun, water, soil) and the message, \"What does your plant need? We're learning that plants need sun, water, and soil to live. Check a plant at home together!\" This bridges home and school learning.",
