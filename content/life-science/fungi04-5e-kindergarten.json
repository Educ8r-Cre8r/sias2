Observe and describe what fungi look like using colors, shapes, and textures they see in the photograph.\n2. Explain that fungi are living things that need certain places to grow, like dead wood and wet soil.\n3. Identify that fungi grow in forests and help break down dead leaves and wood.\n4. Demonstrate understanding that all living things need specific places and conditions to survive.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about fungi as living organisms by observing vivid visual details in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large projected or printed copy of the fungi photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small natural items (twigs, bark pieces, damp soil in a clear container) to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Pose these discovery questions** (one at a time, allowing think-pair-share or hand-raising):\n   - \"What colors do you see in this picture? Which color is your favorite?\" *(Color observation)*\n   - \"These pink and red bumpy things are alive and growing. What do you think they need to grow?\" *(Prior knowledge connection)*\n   - \"Why do you think these pink things are growing on the brown, dead wood?\" *(Habitat exploration)*\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this in your yard or the park?\" *(Personal connection)*\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what happens if we touched these bumpy shapes. What do you think would happen?\" Encourage wild predictions without correction.\n\n4. **Record student observations** on chart paper using their exact words (e.g., \"It looks like pink popcorn!\" \"It's growing on the dead stick!\").\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be forest explorers and discover what these special living things need to grow, just like we need food and water.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposition and habitat needs through sensory exploration and model building.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Plastic cups or small containers (one per student or pair)\n- Damp (not wet) potting soil or dark compost\n- Small twigs, bark pieces, or wood chips (collected beforehand or purchased)\n- Spray bottles with water\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Chart to record observations (drawn template with pictures of soil, wood, water)\n- Towels for cleanup\n\n**Activity:**\n\n*Part A: Sensory Exploration of Forest Floor (10 minutes)*\n\n1. **Distribute materials** to each pair: a small cup with moist soil, a twig or bark piece, and a hand lens.\n\n2. **Guided discovery (teacher-led with minimal explanation):**\n   - \"Feel the soil. Is it wet or dry?\" (Students respond—moist, wet, squishy)\n   - \"Look at the wood with the hand lens. Do you see any tiny spots or bumps on it?\" (If available, some bark pieces may show early fungal growth)\n   - \"Press the soil gently. What happens?\" (It sticks together—showing moisture)\n\n3. **Student exploration:** Allow 5 minutes for students to examine, feel, and observe without much direction. Encourage questions like \"What happens if I break the wood?\" but don't answer—redirect them to keep exploring.\n\n*Part B: Building a Fungal Habitat Model (10 minutes)*\n\n4. **Transition to construction:** \"Fungi need special things to grow. Let's build a place where fungi might like to live.\"\n\n5. **Simple model-building directions:**\n   - Place soil in the cup\n   - Add a small twig or wood piece on top\n   - Lightly mist with water from spray bottle (model what \"damp\" means)\n   - Place in a cool, shaded location (windowsill away from direct sun, or a shelf)\n\n6. **Observation recording:** Students draw or point to pictures on a chart showing what they added: soil, wood, water. Teacher or aide documents each student's contribution.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Why do you think that's happening?\" \"What else could fungi need?\"\n- Resist explaining why; instead, prompt observation: \"Let's keep watching what happens.\"\n- Note students' language and observations for the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students handle and observe decomposing materials (soil, decaying wood).\n- Students create a model habitat that mimics conditions fungi need.\n- Students make verbal observations: \"It's squishy,\" \"It's dark,\" \"There's water in the soil,\" \"The wood is crumbly.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect observations to formal science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple illustrations (pre-drawn or drawn during this phase)\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student habitat models from Explore phase\n- Optional: photo of real fungal fruiting bodies for comparison\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations (5 minutes):** Ask 3–4 volunteers to describe what they felt, saw, or built during Explore. Record their language without correction.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (10 minutes) with Kindergarten-friendly definitions and visual support:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Fungi** (say: \"FUN-jy\"): Living things that are not plants and not animals. They grow in dark, wet places and help make dead things turn into soil. *(Show the photograph and point to the pink structures.)*\n   - **Decompose** (say: \"dee-com-POSE\"): To break down or rot. When fungi work on dead wood, it gets smaller and turns into soil that helps new plants grow. *(Mime breaking something into pieces.)*\n   - **Habitat** (say: \"HAB-i-tat\"): The special place where a living thing lives and grows. Fungi need dark, damp places with dead wood or soil. *(Point to the cups/models students created.)*\n   - **Living thing** (or \"organism\"): Anything that grows, needs food or nutrients, and changes over time. Fungi are living, even though they're not plants or animals. *(Compare: \"Like your pet or a plant in our classroom—fungi is alive too!\")*\n   - **Spores** (say: \"SPORZ\"): Tiny, tiny seeds that fungi make and spread to grow in new places. Those bumpy pink things release spores! *(Hold up a pinecone or seeds and say, \"Like these, but much, much smaller!\")*\n\n3. **Make connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"See all those pink bumpy parts? Those are the fruiting bodies of fungi—they make spores to spread.\"\n   - Hold up a student-created model: \"Just like we gave the fungi soil, water, and dead wood, it needs those same things in the forest.\"\n   - \"Fungi are alive, and like all living things, they need the right home to grow.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Can you point to the dead wood in this picture?\" (Students point.)\n   - \"Is fungi a plant, an animal, or something different?\" (Students answer—encourage responses like \"different\" or \"its own thing.\")\n   - \"What did we add to help fungi grow?\" (Students recall: soil, water, wood.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use or recognize the words: fungi, decompose, habitat, living thing, spores.\n- Students explain: \"Fungi need damp soil,\" \"Fungi grow on dead wood,\" \"Fungi are alive.\"\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding by predicting where fungi grow and exploring fungi's role in nature.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photo set of forest habitats: forest floor with leaves, dead log, damp rocks, mushrooms in a yard, rotting compost\n- Student prediction sheet (drawn pictures or yes/no checklist with visuals)\n- Optional: short, age-appropriate video clip (1–2 minutes) of a forest floor or time-lapse fungal growth\n- Outdoor exploration kit (if weather permits): hand lenses, clipboards, paper\n\n**Activity Option A: Habitat Detective (indoor)**\n\n1. **Show picture cards one at a time** and ask: \"Would fungi like to grow here? Why or why not?\"\n   - Card 1: Sunny, dry rock\n   - Card 2: Dark, damp forest floor covered in leaves\n   - Card 3: Wet, dead log in shade\n   - Card 4: Dry, sandy beach\n\n2. **Students vote or point** to show their predictions and explain reasoning (e.g., \"Fungi needs damp—so the wet log is good!\").\n\n3. **Affirm and extend:** \"You're thinking like forest scientists! Fungi love dark and damp.\"\n\n**Activity Option B: Outdoor Fungi Hunt (if weather permits)**\n\n1. **Take students on a short neighborhood or school-ground walk** (10 minutes) to search for:\n   - Dead logs or fallen branches\n   - Damp soil or leaf litter\n   - Any visible fungi (mushrooms, shelf fungi, molds—if present and safe to view from a distance)\n\n2. **Use hand lenses** to examine small details; students describe what they see and feel.\n\n3. **Back in classroom:** Draw or paint what you found; discuss what made those spots good homes for fungi.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask, \"What does this place have that fungi needs?\" (dark, damp, dead wood)\n- Affirm predictions: \"That's good thinking—fungi would love that dark, wet spot!\"\n- Guide without directing: \"What do you notice about where fungi like to grow?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students predict correctly where fungi would and wouldn't grow.\n- Students explain: \"Fungi grows on wet, dark, dead wood\" or \"Fungi doesn't like dry, sunny places.\"\n- Students show curiosity about decomposition: \"What happens to the leaves?\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of fungi as living organisms with specific habitat needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student descriptions and predictions during Engage and Elaborate phases.\n- Listen for use of vocabulary: fungi, damp, habitat, decompose.\n- Check student models during Explore for evidence of understanding (e.g., did they include soil AND water? Did they place it in a dark spot?).\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\n**Option 1: Draw and Label (Recommended for Kindergarten)**\n\nProvide a simple template with a drawn habitat scene showing a dead log, soil, and water. Ask students to:\n- Circle or color the things fungi needs to grow.\n- Draw a simple fungi shape on the wood.\n- Tell you one thing fungi needs (teacher or aide records verbatim response).\n\n**Option 2: Verbal Interview (Small group)**\n\nAsk each student:\n1. \"Is fungi a plant, an animal, or something different?\" *(Success: \"Something different\" or \"Its own thing\")*\n2. \"Where do you think fungi grows—in a sunny desert or in a damp forest?\" *(Success: \"Damp forest\" with reasoning)*\n3. \"What does fungi need to grow?\" *(Success: At least two of: soil, water, dead wood, dark place)*\n\n**Option 3: Observation Checklist (Teacher-completed)**\n\nDoes the student...\n- ☐ Describe fungi using observable features (color, bumpy, round)?\n- ☐ Identify that fungi is a living thing?\n- ☐ Name at least one habitat need (damp, dark, dead wood)?\n- ☐ Predict habitat suitability (e.g., \"Fungi would grow here\" with reasoning)?\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding K-LS1-1:**\n- Student observes and describes fungi's appearance using sensory details.\n- Student identifies at least 2–3 things fungi needs to survive (moisture, decaying matter, shade).\n- Student explains that fungi lives in specific places because it needs those conditions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most Kindergarteners will correctly identify that fungi needs water and dead wood.\n- Many will describe fungi as \"alive\" and different from plants/animals.\n- Some will spontaneously connect to decomposition: \"It breaks down the dead stuff.\"\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Tactile-first exploration:** Provide extra time in Explore phase to handle and feel soil and wood without pressure to record. Use sensory bins with varied textures (wet clay, peat moss, bark) so students can experience \"damp\" and \"decomposing\" concretely before formal vocabulary.\n\n2. **Vocabulary scaffolding:** Use gesture and movement with words. For \"decompose,\" physically break a cracker or pretend to crumble leaves. For \"spores,\" use pinecones or seeds as visual analogs. Pair each word with a picture card students can point to during discussion.\n\n3. **Simplified exit ticket:** Replace drawing with a two-choice picture selection (e.g., \"Does fungi like dry or wet?\" with sun/rain pictures). Student points; teacher records their choice and one-word explanation.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Spore investigation:** Show students magnified images of spores (from a website or science book). Ask: \"How do you think these tiny spores travel from one place to another?\" Discuss wind, water, and animals as dispersal agents. Have students draw or demonstrate spore travel.\n\n2. **Time-lapse observation:** If possible, set up a \"fungi observation station\" over 2–3 weeks. Have advanced students sketch daily changes to the habitat model and predict what will happen next. Introduce the idea of a \"life cycle\"—fungi grows, makes spores, and spreads.\n\n3. **Ecosystem role extension:** Introduce the idea that fungi is a \"decomposer.\" Ask: \"If fungi breaks down dead leaves, where does all that stuff go?\" Guide to soil and new plant growth. Create a simple food web diagram (plants → soil made by fungi → new plants) and have students act out the roles.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fungi Art Project:** Students create a mixed-media collage or painting of a forest floor using tissue paper, natural materials (leaves, twigs, soil), and paint to show fungi growing. Display with captions: \"Fungi breaks down dead wood and makes new soil for plants.\"\n\n2. **Fungi Life Cycle Story:** Create a simple 4-panel comic or sequence of drawings showing: (1) Fungi grows on wood, (2) It makes spores, (3) Spores spread, (4) New fungi grows elsewhere. Students illustrate and dictate the story to a teacher or aide.\n\n3. **Classroom Decomposition Observation:** Set up a sealed, transparent container with leaves, soil, and moisture. Place in a cool spot and observe over 4–6 weeks. Students predict what will happen, observe mold/fungi growth, and discuss how it connects to the forest fungi. Tie to seasons and forest cycles: \"In fall, leaves fall. Fungi helps turn them back into soil for spring!\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Photo relevance:** The vivid pink fruiting bodies make this photograph ideal for Kindergarten—students are immediately drawn to the color and unusual appearance, which naturally prompts the question \"What is this?\" This curiosity is the foundation of science learning.\n  \n- **Safety considerations:** If conducting an outdoor fungi hunt, ensure students do not touch or taste any fungi without explicit permission and teacher verification. Use hand lenses to observe from a safe distance.\n\n- **Habitat models:** Student-created models may not show visible fungal growth within the lesson timeframe (fungal growth takes days to weeks). Frame this as scientists do: \"We're making observations and predictions. Real scientists have to wait and watch to see what happens next!\" Return to models over the next week and discuss any changes.\n\n- **Inclusive language:** Frame fungi as neither plants nor animals—its own kingdom. This challenges assumptions and opens minds to biodiversity. Use visual supports (photographs, drawings) consistently to support diverse learners.",
