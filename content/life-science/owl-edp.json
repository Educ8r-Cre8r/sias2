  "content": "# Engineering Design Challenge: Owl Camouflage\n\n## Visible Elements in Photo\n- A small owl (appears to be a screech owl or similar species) with mottled gray and brown feather patterns\n- Pointed ear tufts on the head\n- Large forward-facing eyes\n- Textured white/light gray concrete or stone surface behind the owl\n- A dark curved object (bucket or container rim) in the lower left corner\n- Natural sunlight creating shadows on the background surface\n\n## Reasonable Inferences\n- **From feather pattern**: The owl's coloring matches the gray-brown tones of the stone background, suggesting camouflage is a survival strategy this animal uses to hide from predators and blend into rocky or weathered environments.\n- **From forward-facing eyes and ear tufts**: This owl is a predator that hunts in low-light conditions and relies on keen hearing and sight; the design of its head features suggests adaptations for detecting movement.\n- **From stone background**: This photo was taken in or near a human structure (building, wall, or shelter), indicating the owl may seek refuge in urban or semi-developed spaces.\n\n## Engineering Task\n\n### K-2 Version:\n**\"Build a Hide-Out for an Owl\"**\n\nYour job is to create a safe hiding spot where an owl can rest and stay hidden from danger. Look at the owl's colors in the picture—it has gray and brown spots and patches. \n\nUse paper, cloth scraps, and tape to build a small nest or shelter. Make it blend in with a gray or brown background so the owl is hard to spot. Your shelter should:\n- Have a cozy opening where the owl can peek out\n- Use colors that match the wall or background around it\n- Be sturdy enough to stay together\n\n### 3-5 Version:\n**\"Design a Camouflaged Roost Structure for Nocturnal Raptors\"**\n\nScreech owls and similar raptors roost on stone surfaces, bark, and building exteriors during the day. Your challenge is to design and build a roosting box or shelter that allows the owl to remain camouflaged and safe from predators.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Your roost must measure no larger than 12\" × 8\" × 6\"\n- It must include an entrance hole (1.5\"–2\" diameter) positioned for the owl to observe its surroundings\n- The exterior surface must use at least three colors/textures that match concrete, stone, or tree bark\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- The structure holds together without falling apart\n- When tested against a gray concrete background, it reduces the visibility of a small toy owl placed inside (peer testers must identify it correctly less than 80% of the time)\n- The entrance allows sight lines but provides shelter from rain/sun\n\n## EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis photo shows a real animal with a real adaptation strategy (camouflage). Students observe the problem the owl *solves* naturally—\"How do small owls survive in open, exposed spaces?\"—and then design a human-made solution. The challenge begins by asking \"What does this owl need?\" rather than jumping to solutions, making the Ask phase the natural entry point.\n\n## Suggested Materials\n- Construction paper, poster board, or cardboard tubes\n- Fabric scraps, burlap, or textured cloth\n- Paint, markers, or chalk in gray, brown, and white tones\n- Tape, glue, or staples\n- Small cardboard boxes or plastic containers (for roost structure)\n- Cotton balls or raffia (optional nesting material)\n- Toy bird or foam model (for testing camouflage effectiveness in 3–5 version)\n\n## Estimated Time\n- **K-2**: 45 minutes (one session: 10 min. observation, 30 min. building, 5 min. sharing)\n- **3-5**: 90 minutes across two sessions (Session 1: 20 min. research/planning, 40 min. build; Session 2: 20 min. refine, 10 min. test and evaluate)\n\n## Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task addresses **NGSS ETS1.A (Defining and Delimiting Engineering Problems)** by asking students to identify a real animal's survival need and constrain their designs around observable features (color, size, material durability), directly connecting form-to-function and natural adaptation to engineered solutions.",
