  "content": "# Engineering Design Challenge: Owl Camouflage & Shelter\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n- One owl with mottled gray-brown plumage perched on a light-colored brick or concrete wall\n- Textured white/cream-colored brick or stone surface with visible mortar lines and surface variation\n- Owl's ear tufts (horns) clearly visible at the crown of head\n- Owl's patterned feathers showing intricate dark and light markings\n- Curved metal rim (bucket or container edge) in lower left corner of frame\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n- **From mottled plumage + light wall**: The owl's coloring matches the brick surface, suggesting camouflage is a survival strategy. The owl blends in with its resting environment to avoid predators or hide from prey.\n- **From textured wall surface + owl's position**: Owls need rough, irregular surfaces with crevices to rest safely during daylight. The mortar lines and brick texture provide grip and concealment.\n- **From ear tufts + forward-facing eyes**: This predator hunts at night and relies on hearing and vision; any shelter design must allow the owl to remain alert while hidden.\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K–2: Build a Cozy Hide-Out for an Owl**\nDesign and build a hiding spot for a toy owl using blocks, boxes, or clay. Your hiding spot should:\n- Be big enough for the owl to fit inside\n- Have a small opening so the owl can peek out and watch for danger\n- Be made from materials that look like tree bark or rocks so it blends in\n\n*Teacher script: \"Owls rest during the day in places where they can hide from other animals. Can you make a safe, secret spot where an owl could sleep?\"*\n\n---\n\n**3–5: Design a Camouflaged Roost Structure**\nDesign a wall-mounted roost shelter for a small owl that maximizes concealment while allowing the bird to remain alert. Your design must meet these criteria:\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Use only natural or recycled materials (bark, twigs, moss, cardboard, paper)\n- Roost opening must face forward (no top-only entrances)\n- Shelter footprint cannot exceed 20 cm × 15 cm\n- Structure must support a 200g mass (simulated owl) for at least 2 minutes without tipping or collapsing\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Surface texture and color blend with a light brick or concrete wall within arm's reach\n- At least 3 distinct materials used\n- The roost conceals 80% or more of the mass when viewed from 1 meter away\n- Structure can be mounted and removed without permanent damage\n\n*Challenge variation:* Test multiple camouflage patterns. Which color combination makes your roost hardest to spot?\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis photo shows a real animal in its natural behavior (resting on a textured surface), which makes **Ask** the ideal starting point. Students first observe what owls actually need—concealment, a textured surface to grip, protection from view—before they design a solution. The owl's camouflage becomes the *problem to solve* (\"How can we help an owl hide?\") rather than a pre-designed answer. This grounds the challenge in authentic animal ecology rather than jumping straight to building.\n\n### Suggested Materials\n1. **Bark pieces, twigs, and moss** (collected outdoors or purchased from craft suppliers)\n2. **Crumpled brown/gray paper, newspaper, or paper bags** (for layering and texture)\n3. **Cardboard tubes, egg cartons, or corrugated cardboard scraps** (for frame structure)\n4. **Natural clay or air-dry clay** (to bind materials and model surface)\n5. **Sandpaper or craft cork sheets** (to simulate rough tree bark texture)\n6. **String or hot glue** (for assembly; supervise hot glue with younger students)\n\n### Estimated Time\n- **K–2**: 2 sessions of 30–40 minutes each (building + play/observation)\n- **3–5**: 2–3 sessions of 45–50 minutes each (design sketch + building + testing/refinement)\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions** by asking students to design structures that meet multiple constraints (camouflage, stability, size), while **ETS1.A: Defining Problems** grounds the design in real animal needs observed in nature—turning a wildlife photograph into an authentic engineering problem.",
