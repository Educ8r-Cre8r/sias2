You can see white flowers blooming on the water, darker plants with red flowers in the background, and fallen logs around the edge. The pond is a home for many living things!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** *Why do plants and flowers grow in ponds, and why do they look different from plants in gardens?*\n\nPlants like water lilies have special adaptations that allow them to live in water. Their roots stay underwater while their leaves and flowers float on the surface to get sunlight. The water provides the moisture these plants need, and the pond ecosystem—with its water, soil, rocks, and logs—creates a unique habitat where many organisms live together.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Habitats:** A habitat is a special place where plants and animals live. A pond is one type of habitat that has water, soil, plants, and many living things.\n\n* **Plant Adaptations:** Different plants have special features that help them live in different places. Water lilies have flat leaves that float and strong stems that keep them in the water.\n\n* **Ecosystem Relationships:** Living things in a habitat depend on each other. Plants need water and sunlight; animals need plants for food; decomposers (like fungi on the logs) break down dead material.\n\n* **Observable Features:** Ponds show us living things (flowers, plants, insects) and non-living things (water, rocks, logs, soil) working together.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nUse the \"Notice, Wonder, Investigate\" routine with this image. Have students first observe and list what they see, then ask \"I wonder why...\" questions. This builds scientific curiosity and encourages deeper thinking before formal instruction. For second graders, this activates prior knowledge and makes abstract concepts concrete.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple means of representation by offering both visual observation of the real image AND a simplified diagram showing pond layers (surface, underwater, bottom). Allow students to explore the concept through visual, tactile, and kinesthetic modalities—such as creating a model pond in a clear container with water, rocks, and plants. Provide sentence frames for discussion: \"I see ___ because ___\" to scaffold language production for emergent speakers.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** \n2-LS4-1 Make observations of plants and animals to compare diversity of life in different habitats.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS4.A]] - Different plants and animals live in different habitats; they have different structures that suit them for the environments where they live.\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS2.A]] - Plants depend on water and light to grow; animals depend on plants or other animals for food, and they all depend on a healthy environment.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Plants and animals have patterns of behavior and structure suited to their environment.\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]] - A pond is a system with living and non-living parts that work together.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think the water lilies need to live and grow in the pond?** (Bloom's: Remember/Understand | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why do you think the white water lily flowers are floating on top of the water instead of being under it?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If all the water disappeared from this pond, what would happen to the plants and animals living there? Why?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **How is a pond habitat different from a garden habitat, and what living things might be found in each place?** (Bloom's: Compare/Contrast | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Habitat:** A place where plants and animals live and find everything they need to survive (food, water, shelter, sunlight).\n\n* **Water lily:** A flowering plant that floats on the water with wide, flat leaves and pretty flowers.\n\n* **Adapted:** Having special body parts or behaviors that help a living thing survive in its habitat.\n\n* **Ecosystem:** All the living things (plants, animals, insects) and non-living things (water, soil, rocks) in an area that depend on each other.\n\n* **Decomposer:** A living thing (like fungi or bacteria) that breaks down dead plants and animals, returning nutrients to the soil.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Create a Classroom Pond Model:** Provide students with clear plastic containers, water, soil, rocks, and aquatic plants (or pictures of them). Have pairs create a miniature pond habitat and observe it over several weeks, drawing pictures and recording changes. This builds observational skills and understanding of living systems.\n\n2. **Habitat Hunt Walk:** Take students on a nature walk around school grounds to find different habitats (under logs, near bushes, under rocks). Have them sketch or photograph small habitats and compare them to the pond habitat. Discuss: \"What living things did we find? What did they need?\"\n\n3. **Water Lily Flower Craft & Observation:** Provide paper, paint, and craft supplies. Have students create their own floating water lilies while you read aloud and discuss how real water lilies float. Then, if possible, float their creations in a shallow tub of water to see how they stay up—making the connection between design and function concrete.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *A Pond and Its Inhabitants* by Jonathan Adolph (Simple, photo-based exploration of pond life)\n- *Who Lives Here?

Encourage students to return to the image multiple times throughout the unit, noticing new details and making deeper connections to concepts taught.",
