Identify the main parts of a growing plant (seed, root, stem, bud) and describe their basic functions.\n2. Explain that plants need sunlight and water to grow and develop.\n3. Observe and compare plant growth over time using a simple plant investigation.\n4. Use pictures and words to describe the different stages of a plant's life cycle.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring what happens inside a seed.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the photograph (one per student or small group, OR projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: One or two small sunflower seeds to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or distribute printed copies to small groups. Do NOT explain what it is yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What color is it?\"\n   - \"What do you think is growing inside this green part? Have you ever seen something like this before?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this plant came from—how did it start?\"\n   - \"What do you think is going to happen to this bud next? Will it stay the same or change?\"\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** \n   - \"This green stem came from something really small—a tiny seed! Turn to your partner and share: What does a seed need to grow into a plant like this one? What do you wonder about how plants grow?\"\n   - Record student ideas on chart paper without correcting them. This is their \"Before\" thinking.\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be plant scientists and do our own investigation to see what seeds really need to grow big and strong like the plant in this picture!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what seeds need to grow by conducting a simple, controlled plant growth experiment.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- 4 small clear cups (or clear plastic containers)\n- Potting soil (approximately 2 cups per group)\n- Sunflower or bean seeds (4-6 per group)\n- Water (access to a watering can or spray bottle)\n- Labels and crayons/markers\n- Measuring tape or ruler\n- Classroom windows and a dark cabinet or box\n- \"Plant Investigation\" recording sheet (see template below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Teacher Setup (do this before the lesson):**\n- Pre-label four cups per group:\n  - Cup 1: \"Sun + Water\"\n  - Cup 2: \"No Sun (Dark) + Water\"\n  - Cup 3: \"Sun + No Water\"\n  - Cup 4: \"No Sun + No Water\"\n- Prepare soil in advance to speed up the lesson.\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and model the first step):**\n\n1. \"We're going to plant seeds in four different conditions to see what helps them grow. This is just like the seed that became the plant in our picture.\"\n\n2. \"Fill each cup about ¾ full with soil. Press the soil down gently.\" (Demonstrate.)\n\n3. \"Put two seeds into each cup, about one finger-deep in the soil.\" (Model with one cup.)\n\n4. \"Follow the label on each cup:\n   - Cup 1 stays on the sunny windowsill and you water it every 2 days.\n   - Cup 2 goes in a dark cabinet and you water it every 2 days.\n   - Cup 3 stays on the sunny windowsill and you DO NOT water it.\n   - Cup 4 goes in the dark cabinet and you DO NOT water it.\"\n\n5. \"Today, record on your sheet: When you planted the seed, did it look the same in all four cups? Draw or write what you see.\"\n\n6. **Over the next 7-10 days**, students observe and record plant growth every 2 days using the recording sheet:\n   - Draw or write what they see in each cup.\n   - Measure the height of any sprouts using a ruler.\n   - Notice the color of sprouts (green, yellow, pale).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What's different about this cup? Which seeds are growing best? Why do you think that is?\"\n- Do NOT say, \"Plants need sunlight.\" Let students discover it through observation.\n- Help students water only the designated cups.\n- Ensure dark cups stay dark by covering them or storing them in a cabinet between observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Cup 1 (Sun + Water): Seeds sprout; green stems and leaves develop.\n- Cup 2 (Dark + Water): Seeds sprout; long, pale yellow stems (etiolation); no true leaves.\n- Cup 3 (Sun + No Water): Seeds may not sprout or sprout very slowly; soil will be dry.\n- Cup 4 (Dark + No Water): Seeds will not sprout; soil will be dry.\n- Students record observations with drawings and simple measurements.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect discoveries to the photograph and life science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words pre-written\n- The original photograph (projected or printed)\n- Student recording sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: Life cycle picture cards showing seed → sprout → plant with bud\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you notice about the seeds in the sunny cups with water? What happened in the dark cups?\"\n   - Create a simple T-chart on the chart paper:\n     - **\"Plants Grew Well\"** (Sun + Water)\n     - **\"Plants Did NOT Grow Well\"** (Dark, No Water, or Both)\n   - Let students share their observations; record them.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (each with a simple definition):\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---------------------------|\n   | **Seed** | A tiny package that has everything a baby plant needs to start growing. |\n   | **Sprout** | A baby plant that has just started to grow from a seed. |\n   | **Stem** | The green part of a plant that holds it up and carries water to the leaves. |\n   | **Sunlight** | Bright light from the sun that plants need to grow strong and green. |\n   | **Water** | A liquid that plants drink through their roots to stay alive and grow. |\n\n3. **Connection to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Show the photo again. \"This green stem came from a seed, just like the seeds you planted. The bud at the top (point to it) is going to open into a flower. But first, the seed needed sunlight and water to grow into this strong stem. Without sunlight and water, this plant wouldn't be here.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"What two things did your plant seeds need to grow?\" (Sunlight and water.)\n   - Show a picture of a plant in a dark room and ask, \"Will this plant grow? Why or why not?\"\n   - Have students do a \"thumbs up/sideways/down\" gesture to show if they think a seed will grow: with sun and water (thumbs up), without sun (thumbs down), without water (thumbs sideways).\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Seed:** A tiny package that has everything a baby plant needs to start growing.\n- **Sprout:** A baby plant that has just started to grow from a seed.\n- **Stem:** The green part of a plant that holds it up and carries water to the leaves.\n- **Sunlight:** Bright light from the sun that plants need to grow strong and green.\n- **Water:** A liquid that plants drink through their roots to stay alive and grow.\n- **Life Cycle:** The different stages a living thing goes through as it grows and changes.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name two things plants need to grow (sunlight and water).\n- Students can identify the stem in the photograph.\n- Students understand that the bud is the next stage after the stem grows.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding by predicting and discussing what will happen to the plant in the photograph and by observing diversity in real plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original photograph\n- Live plant(s) in the classroom (a potted sunflower, bean plant, or any healthy plant with a bud or flower)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Pictures of different plants at different life cycle stages\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Predict the Next Stage (10 minutes)**\n1. Show the photograph again. \"This bud is about to open. Based on what you learned, what do you think will happen next?\"\n2. Have students discuss with a partner.\n3. Share ideas aloud and record them.\n4. If available, show a picture of a sunflower in bloom to confirm their predictions.\n5. Ask: \"This plant needed sunlight and water to grow from a seed to a plant with a bud. What will it need to keep growing and make a flower?\"\n\n**Option B: Observe a Real Plant (10 minutes)**\n1. If you have a live flowering plant or a plant with a bud in your classroom, bring it to the circle.\n2. Ask students to observe: \"Does this plant have sunlight? Water? Is it growing?\"\n3. Have students point to the stem, leaves, and bud/flower.\n4. Discuss: \"How do we know this plant got what it needed to grow?\"\n\n**Option C: Life Cycle Review (10 minutes)**\n1. Show picture cards or drawings of a plant's life cycle: seed → sprout → plant with leaves → plant with bud → flower.\n2. Have students arrange themselves in a line to act out the life cycle, or arrange picture cards in order.\n3. Discuss each stage: \"What stage is the plant in the photograph?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What will this plant look like in one week? Two weeks?\"\n- Encourage students to use vocabulary (stem, seed, sunlight, water) in their responses.\n- Validate all predictions; emphasize that scientists observe to find answers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students predict that the bud will open into a flower.\n- Students apply their knowledge: \"It still needs sunlight and water to make a flower.\"\n- Students can sequence the life cycle stages and identify where the plant in the photo fits.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant growth and life cycles.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation During Explore Phase:** Circulate and listen to student explanations. Do they notice which seeds are growing? Can they connect growth to sunlight and water?\n- **Vocabulary Check:** During Explain, listen to students use new vocabulary. Can they identify stem, seed, and sprout?\n- **Group Discussions:** In Elaborate, assess whether students apply their learning to new situations (predicting the bud will open; recognizing that plants need ongoing sunlight and water).\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket**\n\nGive each student a simple half-page with the following (can be drawn, written, or a combination):\n\n**Question 1:** Draw a seed and a sprout. Label which is which.\n\n**Question 2:** Plants need two things to grow. Circle the correct answers:\n- [✓] Sunlight and water\n- [ ] Sunlight and dirt\n- [ ] Water and wind\n- [ ] Dirt and rocks\n\n**Question 3:** Look at this plant (show a photo or draw a plant in a dark room with no water). Will it grow? Circle: **YES** or **NO**. Why? (Students can draw or write one word.)\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Students correctly label a seed and sprout.\n- ✓ Students identify sunlight and water as two things plants need.\n- ✓ Students correctly predict that a plant in darkness without water will not grow well and attempt to explain why.\n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Learning Objective | How to Assess |\n|-------------------|--------------|\n| Identify plant parts (seed, stem, bud) and their functions. | Exit Ticket Question 1; observations during Explore phase. |\n| Explain that plants need sunlight and water. | Exit Ticket Questions 2 & 3; group discussions in Elaborate. |\n| Observe and compare plant growth over time. | Recording sheets from Explore; drawing/measurement data. |\n| Describe stages of a plant's life cycle. | Ability to sequence life cycle pictures; predict the bud's next stage. |\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Recording Sheet:** Provide a pre-drawn template where students only need to check boxes or circle pictures instead of drawing/writing:\n   - \"My plant grew: YES / NO\"\n   - \"My plant is: Tall / Short / No sprout yet\"\n   - \"I see: Green color / Yellow color / No change\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Support:** Create a word wall with picture cards for each vocabulary term (seed, sprout, stem, sunlight, water). Point to and say words aloud multiple times. Have students repeat.\n\n3. **Partner Pairing:** Pair struggling students with stronger readers/writers. Assign the struggling student the \"Observer\" role (identifies what's growing) and the partner the \"Recorder\" role (draws/writes). Switch roles daily.\n\n4. **Hands-On Vocabulary:** Use real seeds, soil, and a watering can to demonstrate each vocabulary word. Let students touch and explore before using the words.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Investigation:** Have advanced students add a 5th condition: \"Sun + Lots of Water\" (overwatered). Ask: \"What happens if a plant gets too much water? Is more always better?\" Challenge them to predict and test.\n\n2. **Detailed Observations:** Require advanced students to measure plant height in centimeters and create a simple line graph showing growth over time (Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10). Introduce the concept: \"A graph helps us see data more clearly.\"\n\n3. **Life Cycle Extension:** Have advanced students create a detailed 4-6 stage life cycle poster (seed → germination → sprout → seedling → plant with bud → flower → seed pod). They can research and draw each stage or arrange photos in sequence.\n\n4. **Transfer Learning:** Ask: \"What other living things have life cycles? Can you tell the story of a butterfly's or frog's life cycle?\" Encourage them to draw or write comparisons.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Sorting Science:**\n   - Collect seeds from your classroom or ask families to send in seeds (sunflower, bean, pumpkin, corn, lettuce).\n   - Have students sort seeds by size, color, shape, or texture using a Venn diagram or chart.\n   - Discuss: \"Do all seeds look the same? Do you think big seeds grow into big plants?\"\n   - Plant different seeds and observe which ones sprout fastest or grow tallest.\n   - **Connection:** This reinforces observation skills and introduces biodiversity (2-LS4-1).\n\n2. **Plant Needs Poster Project:**\n   - In small groups, students create a colorful poster showing what plants need: sunlight, water, soil, and air.\n   - They can draw, glue pictures from magazines, or use symbols to show each need.\n   - Groups present their posters and teach the class about one plant need.\n   - Display posters in the classroom as a visual reference.\n   - **Connection:** Reinforces learning objectives and creates a classroom resource.\n\n3. **Class Plant Care Journal:**\n   - Assign student pairs a \"Plant Monitor\" role for one week.\n   - They water the class plant, observe it, draw what they see, and write (or dictate for a teacher to write) one sentence: \"Today our plant looks ___ because ___.\"\n   - Compile pages into a class book: \"Our Plant Grows: A Classroom Investigation.\"\n   - Read together as a shared text to reinforce vocabulary and life cycle concepts.\n   - **Connection:** Encourages ongoing observation and responsibility for living things.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Timing:** The Explore phase spans 7-10 days. Plan the Engage and Explain phases for Day 1, then have students observe their seeds daily (or every 2 days) for 1-2 weeks. The Elaborate and Evaluate phases work best on Day 7-10 when differences between conditions are most visible.\n\n- **Photograph Integration:** Return to the photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. Use it as an anchor to help students see that real plants go through the same stages they're observing in their seeds.\n\n- **Real vs. Realistic:** If your school garden or outdoor space has flowering plants, take students outside for a \"Plant Walk\" before or after this lesson to see real examples of stems, buds, and flowers in natural conditions.\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wash hands after handling soil and seeds. Check for any allergies before beginning (some children may have allergies to certain plant materials).\n\n- **Adaptations:** If you don't have access to sunlight-rich windowsills, use a grow light (clip light with a cool LED bulb) positioned above the \"sunny\" cups. This keeps conditions consistent regardless of weather.",
