ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the king snake in a child's hand.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on projector or interactive board\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording student observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without any introduction. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation, then ask them to turn to a partner and describe what they see.\n\n2. **Facilitate a brief whole-class discussion** with these specific questions:\n   - \"What do you notice about the colors and patterns on this snake's body? Why might a snake have bright stripes like this?\"\n   - \"If you were a small animal in the wild, what would you think when you saw these bright red, black, and white stripes? Would you want to get near this snake? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"How do you think this snake uses its eyes, nose, or other body parts to find food or stay safe?\"\n   - \"What do you already know about snakes? How are they different from other animals you know?\"\n\n3. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"Before we learn more, I want you to think: Does this snake have body parts that help it survive? If so, what do you think they are, and how do they help?\" Record student predictions on chart paper.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become snake detectives! We'll examine a real snake (or high-quality images and videos) to figure out how every part of its body—from its stripes to its scales to its eyes—helps it stay alive and safe in the wild.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how external structures function through hands-on exploration and sensory simulation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Option A (Live animal):** A king snake (or another non-venomous snake) in a secure, transparent enclosure; snake handling protocol and safety gloves if students will observe closely\n- **Option B (If live snake unavailable):** High-quality close-up photographs or video clips of king snakes; snake specimen (taxidermied or cast model) if available\n- **Snake anatomy observation sheets** (printed with labeled diagrams of snake body parts: head, scales, eyes, nostrils, body length, coloration pattern)\n- **Colored pencils, markers**\n- **Magnifying glasses** (1 per pair of students)\n- **Tape, string, measuring tape**\n- **Paper or poster board** for creating models\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (Structured Exploration):**\n\n1. **Station 1 – Observing the Snake's Coloration and Pattern (5 minutes):**\n   - Look at the snake's stripes and colors. Using the observation sheet, draw or color in the pattern you see.\n   - Discuss with your partner: \"Why do you think this snake has bright colors instead of being plain brown or green like other snakes?\"\n   - Record: \"This coloration might help the snake by ___________.\"\n\n2. **Station 2 – Examining External Structures (7 minutes):**\n   - Using magnifying glasses, observe the snake's scales, eyes, nostrils, and head shape.\n   - On your observation sheet, label what you see.\n   - Fill in this sentence for each structure: \"The snake's [structure] helps it _____________ because _____________.\"\n   - Examples: head, scales, eyes, nostrils, body shape.\n\n3. **Station 3 – Simulating Snake Senses (6 minutes):**\n   - Snakes don't see in color like we do. Snakes can feel heat and vibrations on the ground.\n   - **Vibration activity:** Blindfold your partner. Have them place one hand on a table. Tap gently on the table at different locations. Can they tell where the tap is? (This mimics a snake's ability to sense vibrations through its body.)\n   - **Heat detection:** Hold your hand above (not touching) a warm object (like a cup of warm water). Can you sense the heat without seeing it? (This simulates how snakes detect warm-blooded prey.)\n   - Record: \"Snakes sense their world differently than I do because _____________.\"\n\n4. **Station 4 – Measuring and Recording (2 minutes):**\n   - If using a live snake or model, measure its body length with string and a measuring tape.\n   - Record the length and note: \"A long, flexible body helps the snake by _______________.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between stations, asking guiding questions rather than giving answers: \"What do you notice about that structure? How might that help the snake survive?\"\n- Use prompts like: \"What would happen if the snake didn't have that? How would it change?\"\n- Ensure safety protocols are followed if a live animal is present.\n- Use a think-aloud: \"I notice the snake's scales are smooth and overlapping. I wonder why that's important...\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Completed observation sheets with labeled diagrams of external structures\n- Written or drawn predictions about how each structure functions\n- Notes on sensory experiences comparing snake senses to human senses\n- Engagement with the snake or materials with curiosity and respect\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after student exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large diagram or poster showing snake anatomy (labeled)\n- **Vocabulary cards** with definitions (printed or written on index cards)\n- Photograph of the snake from the original lesson\n- Chart paper for anchor chart creation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3–4 pairs to share one discovery from their exploration stations.\n   - Record key phrases on an anchor chart: \"External structures we discovered: _______________.\"\n   - Highlight any student observations about function (e.g., \"Scales protect the body\" or \"Eyes help the snake see predators\").\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Explanation (8 minutes):**\n   - **Introduce key vocabulary** with reference to the original photograph and student observations:\n   \n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **External structure:** A part of an animal's body that is on the outside and can be seen (like skin, scales, eyes, or fins).\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment.\n   - **Function:** The job or purpose that a body part does for the animal.\n   - **Coloration:** The colors and patterns on an animal's body; in snakes, coloration can serve as a warning to predators or as camouflage.\n   - **Sensory organs:** Body parts that help animals receive information from the environment (eyes, ears, nose, skin).\n\n3. **Make Direct Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember the bright red, black, and white stripes on our snake? That coloration is an **external structure** with an important **function**. Some predators see those bright colors and think, 'That snake might be dangerous—I should stay away!' Even though king snakes are not venomous, they look like venomous snakes. This **adaptation** keeps the king snake safe. This is called **mimicry**.\"\n   - \"The snake's smooth scales are another external structure. Their function is to protect the snake's body and help it move smoothly through grass or underground.\"\n   - \"Snakes receive information about their world through their senses, but not the same way we do. Snakes have poor color vision but excellent heat detection. Their brain processes this sensory information and helps them decide: Should I move toward that warm thing (food) or away from that vibration (danger)?\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Can someone explain in their own words: Why is the snake's bright coloration an adaptation?\"\n   - Ask: \"How is a snake's way of sensing the world different from yours?\"\n   - Look for students to mention color, vibrations, heat, or predators in their responses.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define and use terms like \"external structure,\" \"adaptation,\" and \"function\" in context.\n- Students understand that the snake's coloration serves a protective function (mimicry).\n- Students can articulate that snakes sense their environment differently than humans (heat, vibrations, limited color vision).\n- Students recognize the connection between structure and survival.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by constructing arguments and creating models.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster board or chart paper (1 per pair or small group)\n- Markers, colored pencils, colored paper\n- Scissors, glue sticks\n- Ruler for drawing\n- **Argument template worksheet** with sentence frames (see below)\n- Images of other snakes with different colorations (provided by teacher)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Build an Argument About Adaptation (10 minutes):**\n   \n   Students work in pairs to complete a **structured argument** using this sentence frame template:\n\n   > **Claim:** The king snake's bright red, black, and white stripes are an important adaptation because __________.\n   >\n   > **Evidence (from what we observed):** \n   > - The stripes are very bright and easy to see.\n   > - The snake's coloration looks similar to a venomous snake called a coral snake.\n   > - [Add 1–2 more observations your pair made]\n   >\n   > **Reasoning:** Because these stripes make the snake look dangerous or like a venomous snake, predators are less likely to attack it. This helps the snake survive.\n\n   - Students fill in the blanks and add their own evidence.\n\n2. **Create a Labeled Model or Diagram (8 minutes):**\n   \n   - On poster board, students draw or construct a large diagram of a snake showing at least 5 external structures.\n   - Each structure must be labeled with a sentence explaining its function.\n   - Example: \"**Eyes:** Help the snake see movement and shadows to find food and avoid danger.\"\n   - Students may use colored paper to create a 3D snake, draw and color a 2D diagram, or create a collage.\n\n3. **Gallery Walk or Presentation (optional, 2–3 minutes):**\n   - Display completed arguments and models around the room.\n   - Students briefly share one thing their snake model shows.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide sentence frame support so students focus on reasoning, not writing mechanics.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"How does that structure help the snake stay alive?\" or \"What would happen if the snake didn't have that?\"\n- Circulate to ensure students are making connections between structure, function, and survival.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- A completed argument with a claim, evidence, and reasoning about snake adaptation.\n- A labeled diagram or model showing at least 5 external structures with functional explanations.\n- Evidence of deeper understanding: students can explain *why* a structure matters for survival, not just *what* it is.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of external structures, function, and sensory differences in animals.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing During Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore stations: Can students identify external structures and make connections to function?\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain phase: Do students use vocabulary correctly and show understanding of adaptation?\n- Review student-written observations and responses on worksheets for evidence of reasoning.\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5–10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket containing these questions (adjust wording for reading level):\n\n---\n\n**Exit Ticket: Snake Detectives**\n\n**Name: _________________ Date: _________________**\n\n1. **Look at this picture of a green snake.** (Provide an image of a different snake species or plain colored snake.)\n   - How is this snake's coloration different from the king snake we studied?\n   - Why might a green snake have green coloring instead of bright red, black, and white stripes?\n\n2. **Circle the correct answer:**\n   - A snake's external structures are: **(a) inside its body (b) on the outside of its body where we can see them (c) only on its head**\n   - The king snake's bright stripes help it survive because: **(a) they make it look pretty (b) they make predators think it might be dangerous and leave it alone (c) they help it see in the dark**\n\n3. **Complete this sentence:**\n   - One way a snake senses its world differently than I do is: ______________________________.\n\n4. **Challenge Question (optional, for advanced learners):**\n   - If you were designing a new animal to live in a desert, what external structures would you give it, and why? Explain how each structure would help it survive.\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- **Developing:** Student can identify 2–3 external structures but struggles to explain their function or makes unclear connections to survival.\n- **Proficient:** Student can identify 3–4 external structures, explain their functions, and make clear connections to survival (e.g., \"The stripes warn predators\"; \"Scales protect the body\").\n- **Advanced:** Student goes beyond the snake example, compares colorations across species, explains mimicry or camouflage clearly, and articulates how sensory differences affect behavior.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets demonstrate that students can:\n  - Identify external structures of the snake\n  - Explain at least two functions of these structures related to survival\n  - Compare the king snake's adaptation to another snake or animal\n  - Describe one way snakes sense their environment differently than humans\n  - Apply understanding to a new context (designing an animal)\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-made observation sheets with visuals:** Provide partially completed anatomy sheets with pictures and labels already present. Students only need to circle or color structures and complete simple sentence frames: \"This [structure] helps the snake _______________.\"\n\n2. **Peer partnerships during Explore:** Pair struggling students with stronger readers/observers. Assign roles: one student observes, the other records. Switch roles at each station.\n\n3. **Vocabulary anchor chart with pictures:** Create a large, illustrated vocabulary poster with real images of snake structures. Refer to it frequently during discussion. Allow students to use it as a reference during writing.\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Offer a matching version where students draw a line to connect external structures (picture) to their function (word or picture).\n\n---\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Comparative anatomy:** Provide images of different snake species (king snake, corn snake, garter snake, python) with different colorations and ask: \"Which snake is camouflaged? Which uses mimicry? Which is a warning coloration? How does each adaptation help that snake survive in its specific habitat?\"\n\n2. **Research extension:** Have students research and present on a specific snake adaptation (heat pits in pit vipers, rattle in rattlesnakes, hood in cobras) and explain how that external structure/behavior helps the snake function in its environment. Create a presentation or infographic.\n\n3. **Design challenge:** \"If a king snake were to move to a different habitat—like a snowy forest—would its red, black, and white stripes still be a good adaptation? Why or why not? What coloration would you design instead, and why?\"\n\n4. **Sensory investigation:** Have students design an experiment to test how well they can sense vibrations or temperature without vision (more complex sensory simulation). Record and graph results.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Snake Sensory Simulation Game:** Create a classroom game where students wear blindfolds and navigate an obstacle course using only \"snake senses\"—feeling vibrations created by a partner tapping the floor, or detecting the location of a warm object (hand, heat pack, or lamp). Debrief: \"How hard was it to move without seeing? How do you think snakes manage?\" This deepens understanding of how animals adapt to their sensory abilities.\n\n2. **Mimicry vs. Reality Investigation:** Research the coral snake (venomous) and king snake (non-venomous). Create a comparison poster or Venn diagram showing how they look similar (mimicry) and how their behaviors are different. Include the rhyme: \"Red touches yellow, kill a fellow; red touches black, friend of Jack.\" Discuss why mimicry is a successful adaptation and how it shows evolution and survival.\n\n3. **Design Your Own Adapted Animal:** Students choose a habitat (arctic, desert, rainforest, ocean) and design an animal with external structures suited to that environment. Include a labeled diagram with at least 5 structures, each labeled with its function. Have students present to the class: \"My animal has [structure] because in the [habitat], this helps it [function/survive].\" This applies the structure-function concept to creative, open-ended thinking and can be completed in one class period or as homework.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
