ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about decay, decomposition, and how dead things benefit ecosystems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the nurse log (displayed on screen or printed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Small samples of decomposing wood/bark (if safely available) or images of fungi/insects living in decaying logs\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions** (pause for student responses after each):\n   - \"What do you notice about this log? What looks different about the inside and outside?\"\n   - \"Do you see any living things in or around this log? What might be living inside that hollow space?\"\n   - \"If this log fell down 10 years ago, what do you think it looked like when it first fell? What changed?\"\n   - \"Why would plants be growing right next to a dead, rotting log instead of avoiding it?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder: If the log is dead, how could it help new plants grow? Let's investigate!\"\n\n4. **Chart student predictions** on paper: \"What do you think is happening inside that log?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore what's really breaking down this wood and how that process helps the entire forest ecosystem stay healthy.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposition through observation and data collection of organic material breakdown.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- 4 small clear cups or jars\n- Soil (2-3 handfuls per group)\n- Torn pieces of different materials: fresh leaves, dead leaves, shredded paper, small twigs/bark pieces\n- Water (spray bottle)\n- Magnifying glasses\n- Observation sheet (handout or digital form)\n- Optional: Microscope slides to view fungi or decomposer organisms if available\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the investigation:** \"We're going to set up an experiment to watch decomposition in action. We'll layer soil with different dead materials and observe what happens over the next 1-2 weeks.\"\n\n2. **Step-by-step student directions:**\n   - **Step 1:** Fill each cup halfway with soil.\n   - **Step 2:** In Cup 1: Add dead leaves and a small twig; in Cup 2: Add fresh green leaves; in Cup 3: Add shredded paper; in Cup 4: Keep soil only (control).\n   - **Step 3:** Lightly mist each cup with water so soil is damp but not soggy.\n   - **Step 4:** Use magnifying glasses to carefully examine the surface and sides of each cup. Draw or describe what you observe (color, texture, any visible creatures or growth).\n   - **Step 5:** Record observations on the observation sheet: date, material type, initial observations, any visible signs of breakdown or organism activity.\n   - **Step 6:** Label and store cups in a consistent location (not in direct sun). Mist lightly every 2-3 days.\n\n3. **Connection to photograph:** \"Just like in our photograph, the log is being broken down by moisture, fungi, insects, and bacteria. Our cups are mini versions of that process.\"\n\n4. **What students should record:**\n   - Initial observations (color, texture, presence of any organisms)\n   - Changes observed over 1-2 weeks (darkening, softening, mold growth, insect presence, reduction in size)\n   - Sketches or descriptions of any visible decomposers\n   - Predictions about what will happen next\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice changing? Which materials break down fastest? Why do you think that is?\"\n- Avoid telling students what they'll see; encourage them to make their own observations.\n- Ensure cups stay moist and accessible for daily or every-other-day observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe visible decomposition (mold, darkening, material breakdown) within days.\n- They notice that different materials decompose at different rates.\n- They document evidence that organisms (fungi, bacteria, possibly small insects) are active in breaking down the materials.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Build understanding of decomposition, decomposers, and nutrient cycling with formal vocabulary.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Diagram of nutrient cycle (teacher-created or from curriculum materials)\n- Vocabulary cards or anchor chart\n- Photograph of the nurse log (revisited)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore:**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their observations: \"What did you see breaking down in your cups? What do you think caused that change?\"\n   - Display photographs or sketches of observations on the board.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** using the students' observations as examples:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Decomposition:** The process by which dead organisms are broken down into simpler materials that return to the soil. (\"In your cups, you watched decomposition happen—the leaves and paper got smaller and darker as decomposers broke them apart.\")\n   - **Decomposers:** Living organisms (bacteria, fungi, insects) that break down dead matter and return nutrients to soil. (\"The mold you saw growing on leaves? That's a decomposer called a fungus. Bacteria are too tiny to see, but they're also decomposers!\")\n   - **Nutrients:** Materials that living things need to grow, like nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus found in soil. (\"When leaves decompose, they turn into rich, dark soil full of nutrients that plants can use.\")\n   - **Nutrient Cycle:** The path that materials (nutrients, water, carbon) take as they move from the environment → living things → decomposers → back to the environment. (\"The nutrients in that dead log don't disappear—they cycle back into the soil to feed new plants!\")\n   - **Nurse Log:** A fallen tree that decomposes and provides nutrients and a growing surface for new plants and fungi. (\"That's exactly what's happening in our photograph!\")\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Look at the nurse log again. See the dark, crumbly material inside? That's partly decomposed wood. Fungi are breaking it down. Notice the fresh wood edges? Those are fresh surfaces for decomposers to work on. Over many years, all of this will become rich soil.\"\n   - \"Why would new plants grow right beside a rotting log? Because the decomposers are creating the perfect growing medium—nutrient-rich soil!\"\n\n4. **Introduce the nutrient cycle model:**\n   - Draw or display a simple cycle diagram:\n     - Dead log → Decomposers (fungi, bacteria, insects) → Nutrients released into soil → Plants absorb nutrients + water from soil → Plant grows → Eventually dies → Returns to soil → Cycle continues\n   - \"Matter doesn't disappear in nature. It cycles around and around. The wood in that log will become part of new plants, animals will eat those plants, and when those animals die, their matter cycles back again.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why is a decomposing log important to a forest, even though it's dead?\"\n   - Ask: \"Where do you think the nutrients in your plant's soil come from?\"\n   - Thumbs-up/sideways/down check: \"Do you understand what decomposers do?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define decomposition and name types of decomposers.\n- They understand that matter cycles through the environment.\n- They connect their observation of decay in the cups to the nurse log photograph.\n- They recognize that plants get growth materials from nutrient-rich soil created by decomposition.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply nutrient cycle understanding to a new context and deepen reasoning about ecosystem interdependence.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster paper or digital slide template\n- Colored pencils, markers\n- Optional: Additional photographs of decomposing logs, forest floors, compost piles\n- Scenario cards (printed or displayed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the elaboration task:**\n   - \"Now that you understand how decomposition works, I want you to become nutrient cycle detectives. You'll create a model showing how matter moves through an ecosystem.\"\n\n2. **Small group task (groups of 3-4):**\n   - Assign each group one of these scenarios:\n     - **Scenario A:** A fallen tree log in a forest (like our photograph)\n     - **Scenario B:** A home compost pile with food scraps and yard waste\n     - **Scenario C:** A dead animal on the forest floor\n     - **Scenario D:** A forest ecosystem after a tree is cut down\n   - Each group creates a labeled diagram or poster showing:\n     - The starting material (dead log/waste)\n     - The decomposers involved (at least 3 types)\n     - How nutrients are released\n     - Where those nutrients go next (soil, plants, water)\n     - At least one organism that benefits from decomposition\n   - Include arrows showing the movement of matter/nutrients\n\n3. **Real-world connection:**\n   - \"This is exactly why we compost! By intentionally creating the right conditions for decomposition, we speed up the nutrient cycle and create rich soil for gardens instead of sending waste to landfills.\"\n\n4. **Gallery walk (optional):**\n   - Display completed models around the room.\n   - Students walk around and place sticky notes with observations or questions on other groups' models.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask probing questions: \"What decomposers would be active in your scenario? What would you find if you dug into soil under the log?\"\n- Encourage students to use evidence from their own Explore observations and the nurse log photograph.\n- Clarify misconceptions (e.g., matter doesn't disappear; it transforms).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create accurate visual models of the nutrient cycle.\n- They apply decomposition concepts to new contexts.\n- They explain how decomposition benefits other organisms and the ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of decomposition, decomposers, and nutrient cycling.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative assessment during lessons:**\n   - **Observation of Explore phase:** Listen to student explanations of what they observe in cups. Do they mention decomposers? Do they connect observations to decay?\n   - **Group discussions in Explain:** Monitor vocabulary use and reasoning. Are students connecting decomposition to nutrient cycling?\n   - **Elaborate models:** Review diagrams for accuracy and evidence of understanding (decomposers named, nutrients tracked, connections shown).\n\n2. **Exit Ticket or Summative Assessment** (choose one format):\n\n   **Option A: Written Response** (distribute at the end of session 2)\n   - Prompt: \"Look at the photograph of the nurse log one more time. Write or draw to answer: **Why is this dead log important to a forest? Where do you think the nutrients from this log will go in the next 5 years?** Use at least two vocabulary words we learned: decomposition, decomposer, nutrient, or nutrient cycle.\"\n\n   **Option B: Short-Answer Questions**\n   1. \"Name two decomposers that break down dead wood.\" (Accept: fungi, bacteria, insects, worms)\n   2. \"What happens to nutrients when a log decomposes?\" (Accept: They are released into soil; they cycle back to be used by plants; they return to the environment)\n   3. \"How does decomposition help plants grow?\" (Accept: It creates nutrient-rich soil; decomposers break down dead matter into nutrients plants can use; it returns materials to the ground)\n\n   **Option C: Draw and Label**\n   - Provide a simple diagram of a log with soil and a growing plant. Students label:\n     - Where decomposers are working\n     - What happens to the wood\n     - Where nutrients go\n     - What the plant uses from the soil\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n   - ✓ Student identifies at least one type of decomposer.\n   - ✓ Student explains that decomposition releases nutrients into soil.\n   - ✓ Student connects decomposition to plant growth or the nutrient cycle.\n   - ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary term correctly (decomposition, decomposer, nutrient, or nutrient cycle).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets and models show that students understand decomposition as a process that recycles matter.\n- Students can explain the role of decomposers in ecosystems.\n- Students connect observation to explanation (e.g., \"The mold in our cup is a decomposer, just like the fungi breaking down the log in the photograph\").\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n1. **Vocabulary scaffolding:** Provide a word bank with definitions during the Explain phase and when completing exit tickets. Pre-teach key terms using images (show photos of mold, bacteria under a microscope, insects in logs).\n2. **Observation sheet structure:** Simplify the recording sheet by providing sentence frames: \"I see _____. The _____ is breaking down the _____. The _____ is a decomposer because _____.\"\n3. **Model simplification:** In the Elaborate phase, provide a partially completed cycle diagram. Students fill in missing steps and labels rather than creating from scratch.\n4. **Partner with stronger students:** Assign mixed-ability groups during Explore and Elaborate so struggling learners can observe and discuss with peers before recording independently.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n1. **Investigate decomposition rates:** Ask advanced students to calculate decomposition rates from their cup observations. \"If a leaf decayed 50% in 5 days, at what rate is it decomposing? How long might the entire log take to fully decompose?\"\n2. **Explore environmental factors:** Design an experiment testing how temperature, moisture, or light affect decomposition speed. \"Would the log decompose faster in wet conditions or dry conditions? Let's design an experiment to find out.\"\n3. **Nutrient tracing:** Challenge students to trace where specific nutrients (nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus) go through multiple cycles. \"A molecule of carbon in the log might travel to soil, into a plant, into a deer, back to soil. Can you trace a complete path?\"\n4. **Real-world application:** Research and present on industrial composting, mycoremediation (using fungi to clean contaminated soil), or the role of decomposition in landfills vs. compost facilities.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Long-term observation logs:** Continue monitoring the decomposition cups through the end of the unit or grading period. Have students create a time-lapse sequence (photos or sketches weekly) showing material breakdown. Create a graph tracking the visual changes week to week. This reinforces that decomposition is a gradual, measurable process.\n\n2. **Build a classroom compost bin:** Set up a small compost system in a clear container where students can add food scraps, leaves, and shredded paper. Regularly observe and record decomposition. Connect observations to both the cups and the nurse log. Discuss what conditions (moisture, air, warmth) speed up decomposition and why. This brings the lesson into a practical, ongoing classroom experience.\n\n3. **Research and present: \"Decomposers Around Us\":** Assign students to research one type of decomposer (earthworms, millipedes, specific fungi like shelf fungi or cup fungi, bacteria). They create a poster, digital presentation, or short video explaining: What does it eat? Where does it live? Why is it important? Students present findings to the class, building collective knowledge about decomposer diversity.\n\n4. **Forest floor exploration:** If possible, take students on a nature walk to observe decomposing logs, fungi, and organisms in a natural setting. Collect samples safely, photograph fungi and insects, and document what they see. Back in the classroom, compare observations to the nurse log photograph and their experimental cups. Discuss biodiversity in a real decomposing log vs. their models.\n\n5. **Letter from a decomposer:** Have students write a creative letter from the perspective of a decomposer (a fungus, bacterium, or insect) explaining what it does in the ecosystem and why it's important. This reinforces understanding through narrative perspective and creativity.\n\n---",
