ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the unusual organism in the photograph and activate prior knowledge about living things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph of the stinkhorn mushroom\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen without any introduction. Let students look silently for 15-20 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions one at a time, allowing 20-30 seconds of think time before responses:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe it to a friend.\"\n   - \"Is this a plant, an animal, or something else? Why do you think so?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this orange thing lives? What do you notice around it?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this before? Where?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what this orange mushroom needs to stay alive and healthy, just like you need food, water, and air. What do you think a mushroom needs?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper with a three-column chart: \"I think it's a...\" | \"I think it needs...\" | \"I wonder...\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become mushroom scientists and explore what we can find out about this amazing orange fungus!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate mushroom characteristics and the decomposition habitat through sensory exploration and direct observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small mushroom specimens (store-bought button mushrooms or collected local mushrooms in sealed containers) — **1 per pair of students**\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses — **1 per student**\n- Soil or mulch samples in shallow trays — **1 per pair**\n- Paper towels\n- Observation recording sheets (simple picture/word templates with labels for: color, shape, size, texture, where it grows)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Optional: A small rotting log or decaying wood piece in a clear container (highly visual)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Direct Observation of a Mushroom (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Pair students** and distribute one mushroom per pair.\n\n2. **Give these step-by-step directions:**\n   - \"Look at your mushroom with your eyes. What color is it? What shape is it?\"\n   - \"Gently touch your mushroom. Is it smooth or bumpy? Soft or hard?\"\n   - \"Use your hand lens. Look at the very bottom of the mushroom. What do you see?\" (Students will observe gills or pores under the cap.)\n   - \"Sniff your mushroom gently. Does it have a smell? What does it remind you of?\"\n\n3. **Document observations:** Students draw or label their mushroom on the observation sheet, adding color and noting what they felt, saw, and smelled.\n\n**Part B: Exploration of the Mushroom Habitat (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show students the soil/mulch tray** and ask: \"Where do you think mushrooms grow? Let's explore the home of a mushroom.\"\n\n2. **Have pairs take turns:**\n   - Feeling the soil texture (damp, dark, crumbly)\n   - Using a hand lens to look for tiny pieces of decomposing material\n   - Observing the color and smell\n\n3. **Discuss:** \"Mushrooms don't grow on hard, dry ground. They grow in places with dead leaves, rotting wood, and soil. This is their home.\"\n\n4. **Connect to photograph:** \"Look at the orange mushroom in our picture. What do you see around it? Yes! Pieces of wood. That's the mushroom's home.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice? What does that feel like? What does that tell us about where mushrooms live?\"\n- Guide students without telling them answers; encourage careful observation.\n- Model proper hand lens use if needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students complete an observation sheet with drawings and descriptions of the mushroom's color, shape, texture, and the habitat.\n- Students recognize that mushrooms grow in damp, dark places with decomposing material.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration findings to life science concepts about diverse organisms and their habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Photograph of the stinkhorn mushroom\n- Picture cards or book illustrations showing plants, animals, and fungi side by side (optional but helpful)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 student pairs to show their observation sheets and share one thing they discovered.\n   - \"What did you notice about where mushrooms like to grow?\" (Dark, damp, with dead stuff)\n   - \"What did your mushroom feel like?\" (Soft, smooth, cool, spongy)\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions (8 minutes):**\n\n   Create a simple anchor chart with drawings and words:\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|\n   | **Fungus (Mushroom)** | A living thing that is not a plant and not an animal. It grows in dark, wet places and helps break down dead things. |\n   | **Decompose** | To break down or fall apart. Mushrooms help dead leaves and wood decompose (break down) so they become part of the soil again. |\n   | **Habitat** | The home where a living thing lives. A mushroom's habitat is damp soil or rotting wood. |\n   | **Organism** | Any living thing — plants, animals, mushrooms, and more. |\n   | **Gills** | The thin strips under a mushroom's cap that help it make babies (spores). |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the mushroom: \"This orange mushroom is a fungus. See the wood chips all around it? That's its habitat—its home. The mushroom is breaking down the wood, helping it decompose.\"\n   - \"Mushrooms are not plants because they don't have roots or leaves. They are not animals because they don't move around or eat other living things. Mushrooms are their own special kind of living thing!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Quick hand signals: \"If a mushroom is a plant, put your thumbs sideways. If it's something different, put your thumbs up.\"\n   - Ask: \"Where do mushrooms like to live? Turn to your partner and tell them one thing mushrooms need.\"\n\n**Vocabulary Table (as listed above):**\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students use the term \"fungus\" or \"mushroom\" to describe the organism.\n- Students explain that mushrooms need dark, damp places with dead material.\n- Students recognize mushrooms as living things that are different from plants and animals.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (17 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by exploring how the mushroom's body structure helps it survive and investigating the role of fungi in breaking down dead material.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Two clear containers with soil/compost\n- One set with a piece of fresh apple or banana; one without (prepared 2-3 days before the lesson)\n- Hand lenses\n- Pictures of different fungi (shelf fungi, puffballs, molds on bread — all age-appropriate and safe)\n- Paper and crayons for predictions\n- Optional: A small terrarium with active decomposition (prepared in advance)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Decomposition Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show the two containers** and explain: \"We put a piece of apple in one container with soil. We left the other container empty. Let's look at what happened.\"\n\n2. **Guide observation:**\n   - \"Which container has more change? What do you see?\" (Mold, breakdown of fruit, darker/damp conditions)\n   - \"What might have caused this change?\" (Fungi and other tiny living things breaking down the fruit)\n   - \"The fungus is decomposing the fruit—breaking it down. When things decompose, they become food for soil and new plants!\"\n\n3. **Connect to the stinkhorn:** \"Just like the fungus broke down the apple, the orange mushroom in our picture is breaking down the wood chips. Mushrooms are nature's recyclers!\"\n\n**Part B: Fungi Are Everywhere! (7 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show picture cards** of different fungi: shelf fungi on a tree, a puffball mushroom, mold on bread (in a sealed, safe container).\n\n2. **Ask:** \"Do all fungi look the same? What colors and shapes do you see?\" Students observe that fungi come in many varieties.\n\n3. **Discuss:** \"Fungi are living things all around us. Some are big and orange like our stinkhorn. Some are tiny and you can't see them. But they all help break down dead things and recycle them in nature.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Ask questions that guide thinking: \"What is happening to the apple? What do you think caused that?\"\n- Celebrate observations: \"Great noticing! Yes, something is breaking down the fruit.\"\n- Make real-world connections: \"Have you ever seen mold on bread at home? That's a fungus, too!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students observe visible decomposition and connect it to the work of fungi.\n- Students understand that fungi help break down dead material.\n- Students recognize that fungi come in many forms and are important in nature.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fungal characteristics, habitats, and the role of fungi in decomposition.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- **Observation checks:** During Explore and Elaborate, note which students accurately describe the mushroom's habitat and characteristics.\n- **Question responses:** Listen to answers during discussions. Do students use vocabulary correctly? Can they explain where mushrooms live?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket. Use one of these formats:\n\n**Option 1: Picture + Words**\nStudents draw and label:\n- Draw a mushroom and its habitat (soil, wood, dark place)\n- Write or dictate: \"A mushroom is a _____. It lives in _____.\"\n\n**Option 2: Yes/No with Drawing**\n- \"Is a mushroom a plant? Circle YES or NO. Draw why or why not.\"\n- \"Do mushrooms help break down dead things? Circle YES or NO. Draw an example.\"\n\n**Option 3: Sentence Completion (Teacher reads aloud)**\nStudents circle the correct answer or draw:\n- \"A mushroom is a _____ (plant / animal / fungus / rock)\"\n- \"Mushrooms like to grow in places that are _____ (hot and dry / cold and hard / dark and damp)\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n✓ Student correctly identifies a mushroom/fungus as a living organism different from plants and animals.\n✓ Student describes the mushroom's habitat (damp, dark, with decomposing material).\n✓ Student recognizes that mushrooms break down dead things.\n✓ Student observes and records characteristics using words or pictures.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \nStudents demonstrate understanding through drawings, verbal responses, or written/dictated sentences that show:\n- Recognition of fungi as living organisms\n- Understanding of fungal habitats\n- Awareness of decomposition's role in nature\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Vocabulary anchor chart with pictures:** Keep the vocabulary chart visible throughout the lesson. Use consistent visuals (draw the same mushroom each time) so students build familiarity.\n\n2. **Sentence frames for responses:** Provide sentence starters such as:\n   - \"A mushroom is a _____.\"\n   - \"Mushrooms grow in _____ places.\"\n   - \"Mushrooms help break down _____.\"\n   \n   Students can point to or fill in one word rather than generating full sentences.\n\n3. **Peer partnerships:** Pair struggling learners with strong observers during Explore. Assign the partner as the \"recorder\" so the struggling student focuses on observation and the partner documents.\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Use only yes/no questions with visual choices (pictures of mushrooms, damp soil, plants, etc. to point to) rather than open-ended drawing.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deep dive into decomposition:** Ask advanced students to predict: \"If we leave this apple for two more weeks, what will happen? Why?\" Have them sketch a sequence showing the breakdown over time.\n\n2. **Research and share:** Provide picture books or curated websites about different types of fungi (puffballs, shelf fungi, truffles, morels). Ask: \"How are these fungi the same and different from our mushroom? Where do they live?\"\n\n3. **Design a fungal habitat:** Challenge students to design a terrarium or shoebox \"home\" for a mushroom. What would they put in it? Why? Have them explain their design choices using vocabulary from the lesson.\n\n4. **Investigative prediction:** Provide multiple sealed containers (wet soil with bread, dry soil with bread, wet soil with wood, dry soil with wood). Ask: \"Which container will grow the most mold? Why?\" Have them make a prediction chart and check back over a week.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Mushroom Life Cycle Exploration:** Show students pictures of a mushroom at different stages (button stage, full cap, releasing spores). Create a simple sequence strip or flip book showing how mushrooms grow. Discuss: \"How is a baby mushroom made?\" (Introduce the concept of spores as mushroom \"seeds,\" keeping language simple.)\n\n2. **Nature Walk Fungus Hunt:** On a school nature walk or outdoor exploration, look for fungi in the environment (fungi on dead logs, mold on fallen leaves, mushrooms in shaded areas). Take photographs or sketches. Back in class, create a class \"Fungi We Found\" chart and discuss habitats.\n\n3. **Decomposition Observation Jar:** Create a layered \"soil jar\" with students: sand, soil, leaves, fruit scraps, and wood pieces. Seal it loosely and observe over 2-3 weeks. Discuss: \"What's happening inside? What living things are helping break things down?\" This extends the decomposition concept and shows fungi at work over time.\n\n4. **Storybook Connection:** Read aloud *Fungi* by Rebecca Hirsch or *A Mushroom in the Rain* by James Stevenson. Discuss how fungi appear in stories and nature.\n\n5. **Sensory Description Poem:** Have students create a group sensory poem about mushrooms:\n   - \"Mushrooms are _____ (color)\"\n   - \"Mushrooms feel _____ (texture)\"\n   - \"Mushrooms live in _____ (habitat)\"\n   - \"Mushrooms help _____ (role in nature)\"\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Safety:** If using real mushrooms, ensure they are edible varieties from a grocery store (button mushrooms are ideal and safe). Never allow students to taste or eat specimens. Wash hands after handling.\n- **Preparation:** Prepare decomposition containers 2-3 days in advance so visible changes are apparent during the lesson.\n- **Pacing:** This lesson works well as two 40-minute sessions (Engage/Explore on Day 1; Explain/Elaborate/Evaluate on Day 2) or as a single extended 70-minute session with a short movement break between Explore and Explain.\n- **Real-world connection:** This lesson sets the foundation for understanding ecosystems, food chains (decomposers), and the interconnectedness of living things—all essential K-2 life science concepts.",
