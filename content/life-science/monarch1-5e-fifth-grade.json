Students will investigate the stages of metamorphosis and explore the relationship between organisms and their habitats.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Identify and describe the four stages of complete metamorphosis** in monarch butterflies (egg, larva/caterpillar, chrysalis/pupa, adult butterfly).\n2. **Explain why monarch caterpillars must eat milkweed plants** to grow and survive, connecting organism needs to their habitat.\n3. **Create a visual model or diagram of the monarch life cycle** that shows how matter (food/energy) moves through the organism as it grows.\n4. **Predict how environmental changes** (temperature, plant availability) would affect a monarch's ability to complete metamorphosis.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the photograph (or printed copies, 1 per student or pair)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: live or preserved chrysalis and butterfly specimen (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without explanation on the projector or distribute printed copies. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions** (write on board as you ask):\n   - *What do you see in this picture? Describe the shapes, colors, and sizes of these objects.*\n   - *Do you think these are the same animal at different times, or are they different animals? Why do you think that?*\n   - *One of these objects is green and one is tan/brown. What do you think is inside the green one?*\n   - *If this green thing is alive, how do you think it got its food and water while attached to that wall?*\n\n3. **Invite predictions:** \"I'm going to tell you that these are both parts of a butterfly's life story. Turn to a partner and predict: What might happen next to the green object? Where did it come from before it looked like this?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become butterfly detectives and discover exactly what's happening in this photograph—and what amazing changes happen inside that green structure.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover the stages of metamorphosis through hands-on modeling.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- 4 index cards or small pieces of paper\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Pictures or diagram cards showing the four stages of monarch life cycle (egg, larva, chrysalis, adult butterfly)—pre-printed or drawn by teacher\n- Optional: Real images printed from reliable sources (e.g., monarch watch, butterflies and moths of north america)\n- String or tape\n- Ruler\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Teacher Preparation:** Before the lesson, print or draw four simple, large illustrations showing:\n  1. A tiny egg on a milkweed leaf\n  2. A striped caterpillar on a milkweed leaf\n  3. A green chrysalis hanging from a branch\n  4. An adult monarch butterfly with wings spread\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"You are going to arrange the life stages of a monarch butterfly in the correct order. First, look at each picture card I'm giving you. Don't arrange them yet—just observe each one carefully for 30 seconds.\"\n\n2. \"With your partner, discuss: What do you notice about how the monarch looks different in each picture? Talk about size, shape, color, and what it's doing.\"\n\n3. \"Now, arrange your four cards in the order you think a monarch changes. Remember: all living things have to eat and grow. Where do you think the caterpillar finds food? (Show them that milkweed is the clue—it appears in the egg and larva stages.)\"\n\n4. \"Once you've arranged them, draw arrows between each stage on your cards or use string to connect them in order. This is a **life cycle**—a circle of life.\"\n\n5. **Recording:** Students should label each stage with a sentence starter:\n   - \"The egg stage: _______\"\n   - \"The caterpillar stage: _______\"\n   - \"The chrysalis stage: _______\"\n   - \"The adult butterfly stage: _______\"\n\n6. \"Walk around the room and look at two other groups' life cycles. Are they in the same order as yours? Talk about what you see.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and listen to partner conversations without correcting.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice about the caterpillar's stripes? Why might that coloring matter?\"* or *\"Where does the caterpillar get bigger—in this stage or that stage?\"*\n- If students struggle ordering, ask: *\"Which one is the tiniest? Which one has wings? Start there.\"*\n- Do not explain the correct order yet—let students reason through it.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will physically sequence the stages, though order may vary.\n- Students will notice that the organism changes dramatically.\n- Students will recognize that the caterpillar stage involves eating (milkweed is visible).\n- Students will begin to ask questions: *\"Does the butterfly eat? How long does each stage last? Does the caterpillar really turn into the green thing?\"*\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The original photograph (projected)\n- Life cycle diagram poster or teacher-drawn illustration\n- Vocabulary cards or chart\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students together** and display the original photograph again.\n\n2. **Conduct a group share-out:**\n   - \"Let's look at the arrangements you made. Most of you ordered them this way: [show correct sequence]. Let's talk about why.\"\n   - \"The tan object on the left—can anyone guess what that is now?\" (Explain: This is an **empty chrysalis**—the butterfly has already come out!)\n   - \"The green object in the middle is a **chrysalis with a living butterfly inside, waiting to emerge.**\"\n\n3. **Introduce the formal concept of **Complete Metamorphosis**:**\n   - Write on board: \"**METAMORPHOSIS** = A complete change in form\"\n   - Explain in Fifth Grade language: \"Metamorphosis means the monarch butterfly changes its body shape and how it looks four different times during its life. It's not just getting bigger—the caterpillar becomes something completely different!\"\n\n4. **Teach the four stages** (use the diagram and photograph):\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n   - **Egg:** A tiny structure laid on a milkweed leaf; too small to see without looking closely. This is where a new butterfly's life begins.\n   \n   - **Larva (or Caterpillar):** The stage that hatches from the egg. It looks like a small worm with stripes and legs. Its only job is to **eat milkweed leaves and grow bigger**. It can grow 3,000 times its size in just a few weeks!\n   \n   - **Chrysalis (or Pupa):** A hard, green shell where the caterpillar transforms into a butterfly. Inside, the caterpillar's body completely reorganizes—it doesn't eat during this stage. It's like nature's waiting room before the big change!\n   \n   - **Adult Butterfly:** The final stage. It has wings, six legs, and a long tube called a **proboscis** that it uses to drink nectar from flowers (not eat leaves anymore!).\n\n5. **Connect to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the green chrysalis: \"This is stage 3. A living butterfly is inside this shell right now, changing.\"\n   - Point to the tan/clear object: \"This is what's left after the adult butterfly comes out. It's empty now—like a shed snakeskin.\"\n\n6. **Address the matter/energy connection (NGSS 5-LS2-1):**\n   - Ask: *\"We said caterpillars eat lots of milkweed. Where does all that food go?\"*\n   - Explain: \"The caterpillar's body uses the milkweed (which comes from soil and water) to **build its body and grow bigger**. Energy from the food helps it change into a chrysalis, and then a butterfly. Plants give materials to animals, and animals use those materials to live and grow.\"\n\n7. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If a caterpillar couldn't find any milkweed plants, could it become a butterfly? Why or why not?\"* (Listen for: \"No, because it needs to eat and grow; it wouldn't have enough energy to change.\")\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can name and identify the four stages of metamorphosis.\n- Students understand that metamorphosis is a dramatic, complete body change.\n- Students recognize that caterpillars require milkweed to grow and transform.\n- Students begin to grasp that food/matter from plants becomes a building material for the growing organism.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by modeling the complete life cycle and exploring adaptations.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Large sheet of paper (11\" × 17\" or poster board)\n- Colored pencils, markers, or colored paper for collage\n- Ruler\n- Glue stick\n- Optional: Digital device to research monarch migration (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Life Cycle Wheel (Recommended for visual learners)**\n\n1. \"You're going to create a **life cycle wheel** that shows how a monarch goes from stage to stage, over and over again.\"\n\n2. Distribute large paper. Have students:\n   - Draw a large circle in the center of the page.\n   - Divide the circle into 4 equal sections (like a pizza with 4 slices).\n   - Label each section: Egg, Larva, Chrysalis, Adult.\n   - Draw or color each stage in its section.\n   - Draw arrows connecting the sections in a circle to show the cycle continues.\n\n3. \"Around your wheel, answer these questions in complete sentences:\"\n   - *Where does a monarch lay its eggs?*\n   - *What does a caterpillar eat, and why must it eat so much?*\n   - *What happens inside the chrysalis?*\n   - *What does an adult butterfly eat?*\n\n**Option B: Adaptation & Survival Story (For students ready for deeper reasoning)**\n\n1. Display the photograph again. Ask: \"Why is the chrysalis green? What advantage does that color give it?\"\n\n2. Introduce the term **adaptation:** \"A body part or behavior that helps an organism survive in its environment.\"\n\n3. Have students write or draw a short story (3-5 sentences + illustration) titled:\n   - *\"Why the Green Chrysalis Survives\"* or\n   - *\"How the Monarch's Stripes Help the Caterpillar Hide\"*\n\n4. Example prompt: \"A bird is flying near a branch looking for food. Why doesn't it see the green chrysalis hanging there? Draw and explain.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask: *\"Can you tell me why you chose that color for that stage?\"* or *\"How does the caterpillar's striped pattern help it?\"*\n- Encourage detailed labeling and complete sentences.\n- For students creating adaptation stories, ask: *\"What would happen if the chrysalis were bright yellow instead? Would the butterfly survive?\"*\n- Provide sentence frames if needed: \"The chrysalis is green because ___. This helps it ___.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students produce a visual model of the complete life cycle with accurate sequencing.\n- Students can explain the function of each stage.\n- Students begin to connect structures (green coloring, stripes) to survival advantages.\n- Student writing shows understanding that organisms have traits suited to their survival.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of metamorphosis, life cycles, and organism-environment relationships.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n\n- **Explore Phase:** Observe student reasoning while arranging life stages. Note: Can they justify the order? Do they mention the need for milkweed? \n- **Explain Phase:** Listen to responses about the relationship between caterpillars and milkweed. Correct misconceptions immediately (e.g., *\"The caterpillar doesn't stay inside the chrysalis—it transforms into something new\"*).\n- **Elaborate Phase:** Review student labeling and questions answered on their life cycle wheels. Look for complete sentences and accurate details.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nDistribute a half-sheet of paper at the end of the lesson. Students answer **all three questions**:\n\n1. **\"Look at this chrysalis in the photograph. What stage of the monarch's life is happening right now? What is inside it?\"** \n   *(Expected: Students identify stage 3, know a butterfly is transforming inside, or that a chrysalis is a resting/changing stage)*\n\n2. **\"A scientist wants to raise monarch caterpillars. She has oak leaves, grass, and milkweed plants. Which plant should she use and why?\"**\n   *(Expected: Milkweed, because that's what monarchs eat; they need specific plants to survive and grow)*\n\n3. **\"Draw or describe one way a chrysalis's green color helps it survive.\"**\n   *(Expected: Camouflage, hides from predators, blends with leaves, etc.)*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- **Developing:** Student answers 1-2 questions with partial accuracy; may confuse stages or miss the milkweed connection.\n- **Proficient:** Student answers all 3 questions with accurate details; explains the milkweed-caterpillar relationship and identifies the chrysalis stage.\n- **Advanced:** Student answers all 3 questions with detailed reasoning; makes connections between adaptation and survival; may mention additional facts (e.g., \"the caterpillar eats so much because it needs energy to transform\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- 75%+ of students correctly identify the four stages and sequence them.\n- 80%+ of students explain that caterpillars need milkweed to grow.\n- 70%+ of students describe at least one adaptation and its purpose.\n- Students can use vocabulary (metamorphosis, chrysalis, larva, adaptation) in context.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide a labeled life cycle sequence** that students arrange in order rather than discovering order independently. Ask them to copy labels and draw simple pictures for each stage.\n\n2. **Use a sentence frame** for exit ticket questions:\n   - \"The chrysalis is stage ___. Inside, a ___ is becoming a ___.\"\n   - \"Monarch caterpillars must eat ___ because ___.\"\n\n3. **Offer a **simplified vocabulary list** (write on board, keep visible):\n   - Egg / Caterpillar / Chrysalis / Butterfly\n   - Milkweed (the plant it eats)\n   - Metamorphosis (big change)\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Research and present:** \"Monarch butterflies migrate thousands of miles. Research: Why do they have to migrate? What happens to monarchs in winter? Create a migration map.\"\n\n2. **Explore ecological connections:** \"Milkweed is disappearing because people remove it as 'weeds.' What would happen to monarchs if all milkweed disappeared? Create a cause-and-effect diagram.\"\n\n3. **Design an experiment:** \"If a caterpillar only had oak leaves instead of milkweed, what would happen? Design a simple experiment to test this. What would you observe? What would you measure?\" (Can be theoretical or teacher-guided observation.)\n\n4. **Adaptation deep dive:** \"Monarchs have bright orange and black wings. This is called **warning coloration**—it tells predators 'I'm toxic, don't eat me!' Design a new monarch pattern that would warn predators in a different environment (like a desert or forest). Explain your design.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Raise Live Monarchs (if resources allow):**\n   - Order monarch caterpillars and milkweed from a butterfly-raising kit (Monarch Watch, Insectopia, or similar supplier).\n   - Students observe real metamorphosis over 4-6 weeks; photograph/document each stage.\n   - Release adult butterflies outdoors at end of cycle.\n   - **Standards aligned:** Direct observation of 5-LS2-1 (matter flow) and life cycle concepts.\n\n2. **Monarch Migration Research Project:**\n   - Introduce Monarch Watch tagging program or migration maps.\n   - Students research: *Where do monarchs go in fall? How do they know where to go? How far do they travel?*\n   - Create a migration poster or infographic showing routes, distances, and challenges monarchs face.\n   - **Real-world connection:** Connect to geography, seasonal changes, and animal behavior.\n\n3. **Plant a Milkweed Garden or Container:**\n   - Partner with school grounds staff or parents to plant native milkweed species near school.\n   - Students design labels, learn which species are native to your region, and monitor for visiting monarchs.\n   - Document visitors with drawings or photographs throughout the fall migration season.\n   - **Service learning:** Students help restore habitat for an endangered species.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Monarch populations are declining** due to habitat loss and pesticide use. Mentioning this adds real-world relevance and may inspire students to care for the species.\n- **Timing:** This lesson works best in spring (when monarchs emerge from chrysalis) or late summer/early fall (during migration). If teaching outside these windows, emphasize that the cycle is year-round but happens at different times in different places.\n- **Sourcing images:** If you don't have access to a chrysalis photograph, high-quality images are available free from Monarch Watch (monarchwatch.org), iNaturalist, or educational sites like National Geographic Kids.\n- **Vocabulary depth:** Fifth graders may also learn the scientific term *pupa* (singular chrysalis, but pupa is the broader term). Use both terms and explain: \"Chrysalis is the special name for a butterfly pupa.\"\n- **Connection to plants:** This lesson directly supports 5-LS1-1 (plants provide materials for growth) by showing students how plant material (milkweed) becomes animal body material (growing caterpillar). Make this explicit in the Explain phase.\n\n---\n\n## NGSS Alignment Summary\n\n| Standard | How This Lesson Addresses It |\n|----------|------|\n| **5-LS1-1:** Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water. | Students observe that caterpillars eat milkweed (a plant) and use that plant material to grow and transform. Discussion: Where does the plant get water and nutrients? (soil, air, water) How does the caterpillar use the plant material? (energy, body building). |\n| **5-LS2-1:** Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment. | Students create a life cycle model showing how matter flows: milkweed (plant) → caterpillar (animal) → chrysalis → adult butterfly. The food energy and material from the plant becomes the animal's body. Students trace the path of matter through the organism's growth stages. |\n\n---\n\n**Lesson Created By:** K-5 Science Curriculum Developer (5E Model)  \n**Date:** 2024  \n**Ready to Use:** Yes—all materials and directions are specific and actionable.",
