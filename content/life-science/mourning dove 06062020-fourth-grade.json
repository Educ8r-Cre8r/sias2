The bird has gray-brown feathers and is resting near a large clay pot and some small evergreen shrubs. This peaceful scene shows how wild animals can live alongside plants in outdoor spaces.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe anchoring phenomenon shown is **habitat selection and animal-plant interactions in a garden ecosystem**. The mourning dove has chosen this garden location because it provides essential survival needs: shelter from the dense vegetation, potential food sources from seeds and plants, water access, and safe nesting materials. This demonstrates how animals actively select environments that meet their basic life requirements, and how human-created spaces like gardens can support wildlife when they contain the right combination of resources.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Habitat Requirements**: Animals need specific environmental conditions including food, water, shelter, and space to survive and reproduce.\n\n2. **Animal Adaptations**: The mourning dove's coloring, body shape, and behaviors are adaptations that help it survive in various environments.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Interactions**: Gardens represent human-modified ecosystems where plants and animals interact, showing how living things depend on each other and their environment.\n\n4. **Life Cycles and Reproduction**: Birds like mourning doves need safe spaces to build nests and raise their young, which influences where they choose to live.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"See-Think-Wonder\" thinking routine with this image. Have students first observe what they see, then think about what's happening, and finally wonder about questions they have. This builds scientific observation skills and generates student-driven inquiry.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to record their observations - drawing, verbal descriptions, or digital tools. Consider pairing students so English language learners can discuss observations in their home language before sharing in English.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n**Zoom In:** At the cellular level, the dove's feathers contain specialized cells called melanocytes that produce pigments creating the gray-brown coloration. These pigments help with camouflage by matching natural environments like soil and tree bark.\n\n**Zoom Out:** This garden is part of a larger urban ecosystem where mourning doves migrate seasonally across continents. The dove may travel hundreds of miles between breeding and wintering grounds, connecting this single garden to a vast network of habitats across North America.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"Birds live in gardens because they like pretty flowers.\"\n   **Clarification:** Birds choose habitats based on survival needs like food, water, shelter, and nesting sites, not aesthetic preferences.\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"All birds eat the same things.\"\n   **Clarification:** Different bird species have specialized diets - mourning doves primarily eat seeds, while other birds eat insects, nectar, or fish.\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"Animals don't need to choose where they live.\"\n   **Clarification:** Animals actively select habitats that provide their specific survival requirements, and poor habitat choices can threaten their survival.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** 3-LS4-3 - Construct an argument with evidence that in a particular habitat some organisms can survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all.\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS4.C]] - Environmental changes affect organisms and habitats\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS1.B]] - Growth and development of organisms  \n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] - Events have causes that generate observable patterns\n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]] - A system is a group of related parts that make up a whole\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What evidence do you see that this garden provides what the mourning dove needs to survive? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. How might this garden habitat change during different seasons, and how would that affect the animals living here? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n3. If you were designing a garden to attract birds, what features would you include and why? (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 3)\n\n4. What other animals might also find this garden habitat suitable for their needs? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Habitat:** The natural home where an animal finds everything it needs to survive\n* **Adaptation:** Special features that help animals survive in their environment\n* **Ecosystem:** A community of living things interacting with each other and their environment\n* **Camouflage:** Colors or patterns that help animals blend in with their surroundings\n* **Migration:** The seasonal movement of animals from one place to another\n* **Environment:** All the living and non-living things that surround an organism\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- \"A Seed Is Sleepy\" by Dianna Hutts Aston\n- \"Birds, Nests and Eggs\" by Mel Boring\n- \"Our Animal Friends at Maple Hill Farm\" by Alice and Martin Provensen\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- \"Mourning Dove Facts and Sounds\" - Educational video about mourning dove behaviors, calls, and habitat needs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGz36rgF9HI)\n- \"How Birds Choose Where to Live\" - Explores habitat selection in various bird species with clear examples for elementary students (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQiVgCsRgM8)",
