Identify decomposers and explain their role in breaking down dead organic matter in an ecosystem.\n2. Trace the movement of matter (nutrients) as it moves from soil through decomposers, plants, and animals.\n3. Develop a model showing how decomposition returns nutrients to soil for plant growth.\n4. Support an explanation that decomposers like larvae are essential for cycling matter and supporting life in an ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about decomposition and the organism in the photograph, activating prior knowledge about life cycles and ecosystems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of larva (displayed on screen or printed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: actual soil sample in a clear container\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions to spark discussion:**\n   - \"What do you see in this photograph? Describe the organism and its environment.\"\n   - \"Why do you think this creature is living in the soil? What might it be doing there?\"\n   - \"What do you think happens to dead leaves, dead plants, and dead animals in nature? Where do they go?\"\n   - \"If this organism is eating the soil and organic matter, where does all that material go when it leaves the organism's body?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if all the dead things in nature just piled up forever, what would the world look like? Who or what is responsible for breaking down all that dead material and returning it to the soil?\"\n\n4. **Chart student predictions** on a piece of chart paper titled \"What We Think Happens to Dead Stuff.\" Save this for later reference.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate how tiny creatures like this larva help recycle dead material back into the soil, and we'll trace where all that matter goes.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposition and matter movement through a hands-on composting model, discovering the role of decomposers in breaking down organic material.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear 2-liter plastic bottles or clear cups (one per student or pair)\n- Soil (potting soil or garden soil)\n- Dead leaves, grass clippings, or plant scraps (pre-collected and dried)\n- Shredded paper or cardboard\n- Small insects if available (pill bugs, worms, or millipedes—optional but highly recommended), OR images of decomposers to place in the model\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Markers for labeling\n- Observation sheets (provided below)\n- Magnifying glasses\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** to each student or pair. Explain: \"We're going to build a model of a decomposition system. This will help us see how decomposers break down dead material and return it to the soil.\"\n\n2. **Layer the bottle or cup** (Student Directions):\n   - Add 2-3 inches of soil to the bottom.\n   - Add 2-3 inches of dead leaves, grass, and plant scraps.\n   - Add 1-2 inches of shredded paper or cardboard.\n   - Add another layer of soil on top (about 1-2 inches).\n   - Lightly spray with water to make it moist but not soggy.\n   - If adding live organisms, add them now. Otherwise, label where decomposers would live.\n\n3. **Label and observe:** Students use markers to label the layers and write predictions about what they think will happen. Display bottles in a classroom location with consistent light and temperature.\n\n4. **Documentation:** Students complete an \"Decomposition Model Observation Sheet\" with:\n   - Drawings of what they see in each layer at the start\n   - Predictions: \"What do I think will happen to the leaves over time?\"\n   - \"What role might decomposers play?\"\n\n5. **Teacher Facilitation:**\n   - Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you predict will happen to these leaves? Why? How might a tiny organism help break this down?\"\n   - Avoid stating answers; instead, ask students to explain their thinking.\n   - Encourage close observation with magnifying glasses.\n\n6. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students build a physical model of an ecosystem with decomposing material.\n   - Students make predictions about matter movement and decomposition.\n   - Students observe that dead material can be broken down in layers over time.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and ecological concepts, connecting the Explore activity to the photograph and the larger cycle of matter in ecosystems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of larva (display again)\n- \"Food Web and Decomposers\" diagram or poster\n- Vocabulary cards or chart\n- Optional: video clip (2-3 minutes) showing decomposition in time-lapse\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 student pairs to share their observations and predictions from the Explore phase.\n   - Ask: \"What changes do you expect to see in your models over the next week?\"\n   - Record observations on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Write each term on chart paper with student-friendly definitions:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Decomposer:** A living thing that breaks down dead plants and animals and returns nutrients to the soil. Examples: bacteria, fungi, millipedes, pill bugs, earthworms, and insect larvae (like the one in the photograph).\n   - **Decomposition:** The process of dead material being broken down by decomposers into smaller and smaller pieces until it becomes part of the soil.\n   - **Nutrient:** A substance that organisms need to grow and survive, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, or carbon. Nutrients come from soil and are cycled through living things.\n   - **Matter:** Anything that takes up space and has weight. In ecosystems, matter (like carbon, nitrogen, and water) moves from the environment into organisms and back again.\n   - **Ecosystem:** A community of living things and their non-living environment all interacting together.\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Display the larva photograph again.\n   - Explain: \"This larva is a decomposer. It lives in soil and dead organic material, eating it and breaking it down. As it does, the nutrients from that dead material are returned to the soil where plants can use them to grow. The larva eventually becomes an adult insect, but the nutrients it helped release continue moving through the ecosystem.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students: \"Why is this larva important to our ecosystem?\" (Accept answers like: \"It breaks down dead stuff,\" \"It returns nutrients to the soil,\" \"It helps recycle matter.\")\n   - Ask: \"If there were no decomposers, what do you think would happen?\" (Students should infer: dead things would pile up, nutrients wouldn't be recycled, plants wouldn't have nutrients to grow.)\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students understand the definition and ecological role of decomposers.\n   - Students can explain that decomposition breaks down dead material and returns nutrients to soil.\n   - Students recognize that the larva in the photograph is performing a vital ecological function.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by modeling the movement of matter through an entire ecosystem food web and connecting decomposition to plant and animal survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster paper or whiteboard\n- Colored markers\n- Images of organisms (plants, herbivores, carnivores, decomposers—provided or drawn by students)\n- Arrows or string to show connections\n- \"Matter Movement Chart\" template\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce a Classroom Ecosystem Model (3 minutes):**\n   - Explain: \"Now we're going to zoom out and see how the decomposer we learned about fits into a bigger picture. Let's trace how matter moves through an entire ecosystem—from soil to plants to animals and back again.\"\n\n2. **Co-Create an Ecosystem Model (10 minutes):**\n   - Draw a simple ecosystem diagram on a large paper or whiteboard showing:\n     - **Soil (with nutrients)**\n     - **Plant** (arrows showing it takes nutrients from soil and uses them to grow)\n     - **Herbivore** (animal that eats the plant)\n     - **Carnivore** (animal that eats the herbivore)\n     - **Decomposer** (larvae, bacteria, fungi breaking down dead leaves, dead animals)\n     - **Arrows returning to soil** (showing nutrients cycling back)\n\n3. **Facilitate Student Analysis (7 minutes):**\n   - Ask students to trace the path of matter (nutrients) starting from the soil:\n     - \"Where do plants get the materials they need to grow?\" (From soil and water and air)\n     - \"What happens to the plant's matter when an animal eats it?\" (It becomes part of the animal's body)\n     - \"What happens when the plant dies? When the animal dies?\" (Decomposers break it down)\n     - \"Where does that matter go?\" (Back into the soil as nutrients for the next generation of plants)\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - Explain: \"This is called the nutrient cycle or the cycle of matter. It's happening right now in your garden, in a forest, in a field, and in your decomposition model at home. Decomposers like the larva in our photograph are the key to making this cycle work. Without them, dead material would just pile up, and plants wouldn't have nutrients to grow.\"\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students develop a visual model showing matter moving through an ecosystem.\n   - Students trace the pathway of nutrients from soil → plants → animals → decomposers → back to soil.\n   - Students articulate why decomposers are essential to ecosystem function.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of decomposers, matter movement, and ecosystem cycles through formative and summative assessment strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Circulate during Explore and Elaborate phases and listen for students' explanations.\n- Ask probing questions: \"Explain why the decomposer is important. Where does the matter go?\"\n- Note which students understand the cycle versus those who need reinforcement.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nProvide each student with an index card and ask them to respond to one or more of the following (adjust complexity based on student readiness):\n\n*Version 1 (Standard):*\n1. \"In one or two sentences, explain what decomposers do.\"\n2. \"Where does the matter (nutrients) from a dead leaf go?\"\n3. \"Why would an ecosystem have a problem if there were no decomposers?\"\n\n*Version 2 (Simplified):*\n1. \"Draw a decomposer. Label it.\"\n2. \"What does a decomposer eat?\"\n\n*Version 3 (Extended):*\n1. \"Explain how the larva in the photograph contributes to the cycle of matter in an ecosystem.\"\n2. \"Predict what would happen to soil quality if decomposers disappeared.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Students can name at least one decomposer and describe its role in breaking down dead material.\n- ✓ Students can trace matter movement: soil → organism → decomposer → back to soil.\n- ✓ Students understand that decomposers return nutrients to soil for plant growth.\n- ✓ Students recognize the ecological importance of decomposers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show that students understand decomposers and their role in nutrient cycling.\n- Decomposition models (observed over 1-2 weeks) show visible changes in material, providing concrete evidence of decomposition.\n- Students can explain, in their own words, why the larva in the photograph is important to nature.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use consistent, simple language (e.g., \"breaks down,\" \"returns to soil,\" \"eats dead stuff\"). Create a visual vocabulary chart with pictures and definitions that remains posted throughout the unit.\n\n2. **Concrete Model Reinforcement:** Provide students with pre-labeled diagrams of the decomposition process and ecosystem cycle. Allow them to color-code arrows and trace pathways with highlighters instead of drawing from scratch.\n\n3. **Sentence Starters for Discussion:** Offer frames such as:\n   - \"This decomposer is important because ___.\"\n   - \"The matter from the dead leaf goes to ___.\"\n   - \"Without decomposers, ___.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research Extension:** Have students research different types of decomposers (bacteria, fungi, insects, earthworms) and create a classification chart showing which organisms decompose different materials (leaves, wood, meat, etc.).\n\n2. **Comparative Modeling:** Ask students to design two decomposition models—one with decomposers and one without—and predict differences in the rate of breakdown. Have them create a hypothesis and collect data over two weeks.\n\n3. **Nutrient Cycle Deep Dive:** Challenge students to research and present on specific nutrient cycles (nitrogen cycle, carbon cycle, phosphorus cycle) and explain how decomposers fit into each one. Create a more complex ecosystem model incorporating multiple interconnected cycles.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Long-Term Decomposition Observation:** Students continue observing their decomposition models over 2-3 weeks, taking photographs and measurements weekly. They create a time-lapse photo series or a line graph showing the breakdown of material over time, providing visual evidence of matter transformation and nutrient cycling.\n\n2. **Vermicomposting Project:** Set up a classroom vermicomposting bin (using red wiggler earthworms, soil, and kitchen scraps). Students observe worms as decomposers, track the breakdown of food waste, and harvest finished compost. This reinforces that decomposers work at different scales and can be managed deliberately for sustainability.\n\n3. **Soil Composition Investigation:** Collect soil samples from different locations (garden, forest, playground). Students examine them with magnifying glasses to identify decomposed material, observe color differences (richer soil = more decomposed matter), and infer about decomposer activity levels. Students hypothesize why some soils are richer than others based on decomposer presence and activity.\n\n4. **Design a Decomposer Habitat:** Students design an ideal habitat for decomposers (drawings, written descriptions, or 3D models). They specify conditions like moisture, temperature, darkness, and food sources, explaining how each factor supports decomposer survival and function.\n\n---",
