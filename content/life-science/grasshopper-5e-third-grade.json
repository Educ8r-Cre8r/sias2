ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about grasshopper body structures and their purpose by examining the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, color printout or digital display of the grasshopper photograph\n- Chart paper and markers (for recording student questions)\n- Optional: Sound clip of grasshopper chirping (from a free source like YouTube or Freesound.org)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Image:** Show the grasshopper photograph on a screen or printed poster. Do NOT provide context yet.\n\n2. **Think-Pair-Share Questions:** Ask students to turn to a partner and discuss these questions (2-3 minutes per question):\n   - *\"What do you see in this picture? What parts of the grasshopper can you notice?\"* (Students observe antennae, legs, wings, head, body color.)\n   - *\"Why do you think a grasshopper has such long, strong back legs?\"* (Let them guess—jumping, running, kicking.)\n   - *\"What color is this grasshopper? Why might that color be helpful?\"* (Green blends with plants; brown looks like dried plant parts.)\n   - *\"If you were a tiny grasshopper, what would you need to do to stay safe from animals that want to eat you?\"* (Hide, jump away, find food, see enemies coming.)\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Today, we're going to discover which body parts are most important for keeping a grasshopper alive. Let's wonder: What superpower does a grasshopper's body give it?\"\n\n4. **Record Wonder Questions:** Write 2-3 student questions on chart paper to revisit during Explain/Elaborate.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become grasshopper detectives and investigate how grasshoppers use their bodies to survive!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate grasshopper body structures and adaptations through hands-on modeling and comparison.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital images of grasshoppers in various colors (green, brown, striped)—provide 3-4 different images per small group\n- Drawing paper and colored pencils\n- Pipe cleaners, craft sticks, and play dough (to build a grasshopper body model)\n- Ruler\n- Habitat observation cards (printed images showing: tall grass field, desert sand, tree leaves, garden soil)\n- Chart paper labeled \"Grasshopper Body Parts and Their Jobs\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Anatomy Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute Images:** Assign small groups (3-4 students) one or more grasshopper images. Include the photo from the lesson and 2-3 variations.\n\n2. **Guided Exploration:** Provide this worksheet or verbal instruction:\n   - *\"Look carefully at your grasshopper pictures. Find and circle or point to: antennae (long feelers), strong back legs, wings, eyes, and mouth.\"*\n   - *\"Measure or compare: How many times longer are the back legs than the front legs?\"*\n   - *\"What colors do you see? Draw a picture of your grasshopper and color it.\"*\n\n3. **Record Observations:** Students draw a labeled diagram of the grasshopper with at least four body parts identified.\n\n**Part B: Adaptation Investigation Through Modeling (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Build a Grasshopper:** Provide pipe cleaners, craft sticks, and play dough. Ask students:\n   - *\"Use your materials to build a grasshopper body. Make the back legs VERY strong and long because grasshoppers use them to jump.\"*\n   - *\"How high can you make your grasshopper jump by flicking the back legs?\"*\n\n2. **Color Camouflage Test:** Provide habitat cards (grass field, sandy desert, green leaf, brown soil).\n   - *\"Now imagine: If your grasshopper was bright pink, could it hide in this grass field? Why not?\"*\n   - *\"What color grasshopper would hide best in each habitat?\"*\n   - Have students sort the grasshopper images by which habitat each would survive best in.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask probing questions: *\"Why do you think that body part is important?\"* and *\"How does that color help the grasshopper?\"* \n- Do NOT tell students; guide them to think about function and survival.\n- Encourage careful observation: *\"Look closer at the leg joints—can you see why they're bent that way?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students draw and label a grasshopper with at least 4 body parts.\n- Students recognize that long back legs help grasshoppers jump.\n- Students understand that grasshopper color helps them hide in their habitat.\n- Students can match grasshopper color to a suitable habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to the concept of adaptations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Vocabulary posters (prepared in advance or created with students)\n- Chart paper: \"Adaptations Help Grasshoppers Survive\"\n- Digital images or video clip showing a grasshopper jumping (optional; 1-2 minutes)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out from Explore:** \n   - Ask 3-4 groups to share one observation: *\"What did your grasshopper body part discovery teach you?\"*\n   - Record key ideas on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary:** Present these five terms with student-friendly definitions. Use the original photograph to point to each:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Adaptation:** A body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. *Example: A grasshopper's strong back legs are an adaptation for jumping.*\n   - **Antennae:** Long feelers on the grasshopper's head that help it smell and sense the world around it. *Example: Grasshoppers wave their antennae to find food.*\n   - **Camouflage:** When an animal's color matches its habitat so it's hard to see. *Example: A green grasshopper hiding in green grass.*\n   - **Habitat:** The home of an animal—the place where it lives and finds food, water, and shelter. *Example: A grasshopper lives in grasslands and meadows.*\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive by meeting your needs for food, water, air, and safety. *Example: A grasshopper survives by jumping away from predators.*\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - *\"Look at our grasshopper again. Its green and brown color is an adaptation—an adaptation for what?\"* (Camouflage/hiding.)\n   - *\"Its super-strong back legs are an adaptation for what?\"* (Jumping to escape danger.)\n   - *\"Its antennae are an adaptation for what?\"* (Finding food and sensing danger.)\n   - *\"All of these adaptations help the grasshopper survive in its habitat, the grass and plants.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students to point to a body part in the photo and name an adaptation: *\"Show me the antennae. What is it an adaptation for?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"If a grasshopper lived in a red desert instead of green grass, would its color adaptation still work well?\"* (No, it would be easy to see.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the term \"adaptation\" correctly in a sentence.\n- Students can name at least two grasshopper adaptations and explain why each helps survival.\n- Students understand that adaptations match animals to their habitats.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Deepen understanding by applying adaptation concepts to new animals and scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images or stuffed animals of 3-4 different animals (e.g., rabbit, duck, fish, bird) with habitats clearly shown\n- Habitat cards (forest, pond, desert, meadow)\n- Large paper or digital template: \"Adaptation Detective Sheet\"\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Adaptation Detective Game (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Present a New Animal:** Show an image of a rabbit in a meadow habitat.\n   - *\"This is a rabbit. It lives in meadows and grasslands, just like our grasshopper. What body parts do you see?\"*\n   - Have students call out observations (long ears, back legs, fluffy fur, fast runners).\n\n2. **Connect to Adaptation:**\n   - *\"A rabbit has long ears. Is that an adaptation? How does it help the rabbit survive?\"* (Hear danger coming, find food.)\n   - *\"A rabbit has strong back legs. How is that like our grasshopper's adaptation? How is it different?\"* (Both jump, but for different reasons.)\n\n3. **Student Application:** Display another animal (duck, fish, or bird) with its habitat.\n   - *\"Now it's your turn. Name one body part this animal has. Is it an adaptation? How does it help this animal survive in its habitat?\"*\n   - Have 2-3 students share their thinking aloud.\n\n**Part B: Habitat Match Challenge (3 minutes)**\n\n1. Provide adaptation cards (e.g., *\"I have webbed feet\"*) and habitat cards.\n   - Students match: *\"Webbed feet are good for living in a ___.\"* (Pond/water.)\n   - Discuss why the match works.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Ask open-ended questions: *\"How would that adaptation help this animal survive?\"* and *\"Would this adaptation work in a different habitat?\"*\n- Affirm reasoning: *\"Good thinking! You noticed that both the grasshopper and rabbit have strong back legs, but they use them for different reasons.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply the concept of adaptation to a new animal.\n- Students construct simple explanations linking body parts to survival advantages.\n- Students recognize that different animals can have similar adaptations for different purposes.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student mastery of learning objectives using formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** As students explore and explain, note:\n  - ✓ Can students identify grasshopper body parts?\n  - ✓ Can students explain why each body part is useful?\n  - ✓ Do students use the word \"adaptation\" correctly?\n  - ✓ Can students connect color to camouflage?\n\n- **Think-Pair-Share Check-Ins:** Pause and ask:\n  - *\"Why do you think a grasshopper needs antennae?\"*\n  - *\"If a grasshopper was bright orange, could it survive in green grass? Why or why not?\"*\n  - Listen for reasoning, not just correct answers.\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes):**\n\nProvide one of these options (choose based on class):\n\n**Option A: Draw and Label**\n- *\"Draw a grasshopper. Label three body parts. Next to each one, write or tell what that body part helps the grasshopper do.\"*\n\n**Option B: Multiple Choice with Reasoning**\n- *\"A grasshopper has strong back legs. This is an adaptation that helps the grasshopper:*\n  - *A) Find food*\n  - *B) Jump away from danger*\n  - *C) See in the dark*\n  - *Why did you choose that answer?\"*\n\n**Option C: Short Constructed Response**\n- *\"Explain: How does a grasshopper's green color help it survive? Use the word 'adaptation' in your answer.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least two grasshopper body parts correctly.\n- ✓ Student explains how at least one body part helps the grasshopper survive.\n- ✓ Student uses \"adaptation\" or \"camouflage\" correctly in context.\n- ✓ Student shows understanding that body parts match the habitat.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will demonstrate that they understand adaptations as helpful body features.\n- Students will connect at least two grasshopper adaptations to survival.\n- Students will recognize camouflage as a survival strategy.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Provide a picture of a grasshopper with body parts already labeled. Ask students to draw a line matching each body part to a simple icon showing its job (e.g., legs → arrow for jumping).\n\n2. **Sentence Frame Scaffold:** Provide sentence starters during Explain and Elaborate:\n   - *\"A grasshopper's _____________ helps it _____________.\"*\n   - *\"The grasshopper's color is green because _____________.\"*\n   - Students fill in with word bank support if needed.\n\n3. **Hands-On Modeling:** Allow students who struggle with drawing to use manipulatives (play dough, pipe cleaners, craft materials) to demonstrate understanding of body parts and adaptations instead of written responses.\n\n4. **Pair with a Peer Coach:** Assign struggling students to work with a confident peer during Explore and Elaborate. Peer can model observation and explain thinking aloud.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-Habitat Investigation:** Provide images of grasshoppers from different ecosystems (desert grasshopper, tropical grasshopper, meadow grasshopper). Ask:\n   - *\"How do grasshoppers in different places have different adaptations?\"*\n   - *\"Why might a desert grasshopper look different than a meadow grasshopper?\"*\n   - Have students research or hypothesize about variation in the same species.\n\n2. **Predator-Prey Adaptation Chain:** Challenge students to research *how grasshoppers got their adaptations*—introduce the idea that predators (birds, spiders) \"pressured\" grasshoppers to evolve strong legs and camouflage:\n   - *\"If there were no predators, would grasshoppers need to jump so fast?\"*\n   - *\"Create a diagram showing how a grasshopper and a predator relate to each other.\"*\n\n3. **Comparative Anatomy:** Provide images of grasshoppers alongside crickets, locusts, and katydids. Ask:\n   - *\"How are these insects similar? How are they different?\"*\n   - *\"Which adaptations do they all share? Why?\"*\n   - Have students sort adaptations by whether they're universal to all jumping insects or unique to grasshoppers.\n\n4. **Design an Adaptation:** Provide a scenario: *\"Imagine a grasshopper needs to live on a snowy mountain. What new adaptations would it need? Draw or describe your design.\"* This allows students to apply understanding to creative synthesis.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### 1. **Grasshopper Life Cycle and Growth**\n**Connection to 3-LS1-1 (Life Cycles)**\n- Research the grasshopper life cycle (egg, nymph stages, adult).\n- Create a life cycle wheel or poster showing how grasshoppers grow.\n- Discuss: *\"Do grasshoppers have the same life stages as other animals you know (birth, growth, reproduction, death)?\"*\n- **Materials Needed:** Chart paper, colored pencils, reference images, optional: live grasshopper observation (if available through a pet supply store or local nature center).\n\n### 2. **Grasshopper Habitat Diorama or Ecosystem Model**\n**Connection to 3-LS4-3 (Habitat Survival)**\n- Students create a miniature grassland habitat in a shoebox or on poster board showing:\n  - Plants the grasshopper eats\n  - Shelter or hiding places (tall grass, soil)\n  - Predators or threats\n  - Label at least three adaptations that help the grasshopper survive in *this specific* habitat\n- **Materials Needed:** Shoeboxes, cotton, paper, paint, grass/plant pictures, markers, craft supplies.\n\n### 3. **Adaptation Scavenger Hunt or Nature Walk**\n**Real-World Application**\n- Take students on a school grounds or local park walk to find other animals with visible adaptations:\n  - Squirrel's bushy tail (balance, warmth)\n  - Bird's wings (flight)\n  - Ant's strong legs (carrying food)\n- Students photograph or sketch and label one animal's adaptation and explain its survival benefit.\n- Back in class, create a classroom \"Adaptation Gallery\" of findings.\n- **Materials Needed:** Clipboards, paper, colored pencils, cameras or smartphones (optional), field guides.\n\n### 4. **Comparative Adaptation Chart Across Multiple Species**\n**Connection to 3-LS4-2 and 3-LS4-3**\n- Create a class chart comparing grasshoppers to 3-4 other animals (frog, cricket, bird, rabbit).\n- Rows: Animal name, Habitat, Leg Type, Color/Camouflage, Other Adaptations.\n- Discuss: *\"Why do different animals have different adaptations even if they live in similar places?\"*\n- **Materials Needed:** Chart paper, reference images, colored markers, internet access (if researching).\n\n### 5. **\"If Animals Had Different Adaptations\" Scenario Stories**\n**Critical Thinking and Imagination**\n- Provide scenario cards:\n  - *\"If a grasshopper had tiny, weak back legs, what would happen?\"*\n  - *\"If a grasshopper were bright pink instead of green, how would its life change?\"*\n  - *\"If a grasshopper had no antennae, how would it find food?\"*\n- Students write or draw predictions about how each adaptation change would affect survival.\n- **Materials Needed:** Scenario cards, paper, pencils, optional: digital storyboarding tools.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes and Tips\n\n1. **Safety Reminder:** If you plan to observe live grasshoppers, ensure they are kept humanely and that students understand they are living creatures. Visit local pet stores or reach out to nature centers for community partnerships.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:** Use the photograph repeatedly as an anchor point. Every time you introduce a new term, point to the image: *\"See the antennae here? That's what we call an antenna.\"*\n\n3. **Cultural Connections:** Grasshoppers appear in folktales, music, and art across many cultures. You might briefly mention this to build interest, though it's outside the science scope.\n\n4. **Misconception Alert:** Students may think adaptations are \"chosen\" by animals or develop during an animal's lifetime. Clarify gently: *\"Adaptations are traits animals are born with because their parents had them. A grasshopper cannot decide to have stronger legs; it is born that way.\"*\n\n5. **Assessment Flexibility:** The exit ticket can be verbal, visual, or written depending on students' literacy levels. A struggling student can point to body parts and say their function aloud; an advanced student can write a paragraph.\n\n6. **Technology Integration:** If available, use a short video of a grasshopper jumping (30 seconds) during Explain to show the adaptation in action. This reinforces the connection between structure and function.\n\n7. **Homework Connection:** Send home a \"Grasshopper Hunt\" worksheet. Families find pictures or videos of grasshoppers online and label one adaptation they notice. Students bring findings to share.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson firmly grounds students' understanding of how body structures and traits help organisms survive in their habitats—a cornerstone concept of evolutionary adaptation appropriate for Third Grade. The 5E flow moves students from wonder to investigation to explanation to application, ensuring deep, transferable understanding.",
