This is a survival strategy that helps the animal hide from predators.\n- **Animal-Plant Habitat Relationships:** The katydid lives among grasses and plants, depending on this specific environment for food, shelter, and protection. The habitat provides everything the animal needs to survive.\n- **Diversity of Life in Habitats:** Different animals live in the same grassy habitat and have different body structures suited to their environment (e.g., the katydid's shape and color differ from birds, insects, or other animals that share the same space).\n- **Structural Features and Survival:** The katydid's body shape (long legs, flat body, leaf-like wings) and green color are external structures that help it survive, hide, and move through its grassy habitat.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Hide and Seek in the Grass: How Animals Survive in Their Homes**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 40-minute sessions\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-LS4-1: Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Observe and describe how a katydid's color and body shape help it hide in a grassy habitat.\n2. Identify the connection between an animal's physical features and the place where it lives.\n3. Compare how different animals' body structures are suited to living in a grassy habitat.\n4. Explain why matching the environment is important for an animal's survival.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about how animals hide in their environments and activate prior knowledge about habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the katydid in grass\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Show students the image without revealing what animal is in it. Ask them to look carefully for 20-30 seconds in silence while you say, \"There is a living animal in this picture. Can you find it?\"\n\n2. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"Do you see the animal? Where is it hiding? What does it look like?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this animal is so hard to see in the grass?\"\n   - \"What color is the animal? What colors do you see in the grass?\"\n   - \"What part of the grass does the animal look like?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** Ask students, \"What do you think this animal eats? Why would it be helpful for this animal to look like the grass and plants around it?\"\n\n4. **Record Wonder:** On chart paper, write down student observations and questions. Highlight their ideas about color, hiding, and safety.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become animal detectives. We'll explore how animals like this one live safely in their habitats by looking like their homes!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how camouflage works and discover the connection between an animal's features and its habitat.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Green construction paper or poster board (8.5\" × 11\")\n- Crayons, colored pencils, or markers in various shades of green\n- Scissors\n- Glue stick\n- Small paper cutouts of animals (birds, beetles, caterpillars, snakes—provided pre-cut or students draw them)\n- Grass and plant images printed on paper, or actual pressed grass/plant samples (optional)\n- Observation recording sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the Investigation:** Explain, \"We're going to create a habitat and see if we can hide animals in it, just like the katydid hides in grass.\"\n\n2. **Student Steps:**\n   - Give each student/pair a sheet of green construction paper (the \"habitat\").\n   - Provide pre-cut animal shapes or ask students to draw simple animals on separate paper.\n   - Students color their animal and habitat using various shades of green to match.\n   - Students glue their animal onto the habitat, trying to hide it using color and placement.\n   - Students place their habitat on a desk or wall.\n\n3. **Hide-and-Seek Hunt:** Students walk around the classroom and try to find hidden animals in their classmates' habitats. They mark on a sheet how many animals they can spot.\n\n4. **Observation Recording:** Students complete a simple chart:\n   - \"Which animals were easy to find? Which were hard to find? Why?\"\n   - \"What colors helped animals hide?\"\n   - \"What would happen if an animal was a bright color (red, yellow) instead of green?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"Why did you choose that shade of green?\" \"How does your animal blend in?\" \"What if we put this animal in a flower garden instead—would it still hide?\"\n- Avoid giving answers; instead, guide students to observe and think.\n- Record student language about color, matching, and hiding.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that matching colors help animals hide.\n- Students will understand that an animal's color connects to where it lives.\n- Students will see that different shades of green work better than bright colors.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect findings to formal science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Photograph of katydid (displayed again)\n- Visual anchor chart (prepared ahead)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Ask students:\n   - \"What did you discover about hiding in habitats? Turn and talk to a partner first.\"\n   - Collect 3-4 student responses and write them on chart paper.\n   - Affirm observations: \"You noticed that green animals hide better—that's exactly right!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary:** Teach each term using the photograph and student discoveries:\n\n   | **Vocabulary** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Camouflage** | When an animal's color or shape looks like the place where it lives, so it's hard to see. |\n   | **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and safety. |\n   | **Adaptation** | A body part or color that helps an animal survive in its habitat. |\n   | **Survive** | To stay alive and safe. |\n\n3. **Make Connections:** Point back to the photograph:\n   - \"This animal is called a katydid. Its green color and leaf-shaped wings are adaptations that help it survive in a grassy habitat.\"\n   - \"The katydid's camouflage keeps it safe from predators—animals that hunt other animals.\"\n   - \"The grass is the katydid's habitat. It gives the katydid food and a place to hide.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students to show thumbs up/middle/down: \"Do you understand why the katydid is green?\"\n   - Ask individual students: \"What would happen if a katydid lived in a red flower garden? Would its green color still help it hide?\"\n   - Have students point to the katydid in the photograph and name one body part they see.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or shape matches its surroundings so predators can't see it easily.\n- **Habitat:** The home of an animal; the place where it lives, finds food, and stays safe.\n- **Adaptation:** A special feature of an animal's body or behavior that helps it survive where it lives.\n- **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n- **Predator:** An animal that hunts other animals for food.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define camouflage and adaptation in their own words.\n- Students understand why the katydid's green color and shape are helpful.\n- Students recognize the relationship between an animal and its habitat.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to new contexts and deepen thinking about habitat diversity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of different habitats (forest, desert, ocean, snow, garden)\n- Picture cards of different animals (polar bear, camel, fish, butterfly, frog, owl)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Habitat Matching Game:** Show picture cards of different habitats and animals. Ask students:\n   - \"Which animals live in each habitat? Why would that animal's color help it survive there?\"\n   - Examples: Polar bear (white) in snow, camel (tan) in desert, green frog in pond plants.\n   - Have students sort animal cards into habitat pictures, explaining their choices aloud.\n\n2. **Design Your Own Camouflaged Animal:**\n   - Give students a blank habitat picture (forest, desert, ocean, etc.).\n   - Ask: \"What animal do you think lives here? What color and shape should it have to hide?\"\n   - Students draw and color an animal that would be camouflaged in that habitat.\n   - Students write or dictate one sentence: \"My animal lives in a _____ habitat. Its _____ color helps it hide from predators.\"\n\n3. **Diversity Discussion:** Ask students:\n   - \"Why do different animals look different?\" (They live in different habitats!)\n   - \"If we saw a green katydid, a tan camel, and a white polar bear, how do we know they all survive well? What's the same about them?\" (They all match their homes!)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"Why do you think that animal lives there?\" \"What would happen if we switched animals to different habitats?\"\n- Celebrate creative thinking: \"I like how you thought about that!\"\n- Record student language about diversity and adaptation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply camouflage concepts to new habitats.\n- Students recognize that different animals have different features suited to different environments.\n- Students begin to understand biodiversity and habitat specialization.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of camouflage, adaptation, and habitat relationships.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe students during the hide-and-seek activity. Can they identify which animals blend in? Do they use color language (dark green, light green)?\n- Listen to student talk during Explore and Elaborate. Are they using words like \"camouflage,\" \"habitat,\" and \"hide\"?\n- Review observation recording sheets from Explore. Do students recognize color-matching patterns?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple paper divided into three sections:\n\n**Section 1: Draw It**\n- \"Draw a katydid hiding in grass.\"\n\n**Section 2: Write or Dictate**\n- \"Why is the katydid green?\" \n- (Acceptable answers: \"It hides in grass.\" \"Predators can't see it.\" \"Its color matches the plants.\")\n\n**Section 3: Show with Your Hands**\n- Show the size of a katydid (small, with fingers).\n- Point to the grass in the picture.\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student can identify or locate a camouflaged animal in a habitat.\n- ✓ Student explains that the animal's color helps it hide or stay safe.\n- ✓ Student names the habitat (grass, plants) where the katydid lives.\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary like \"hide,\" \"color,\" \"grass,\" or \"safe.\"\n\n**Scoring:**\n- **Meets Standard:** Student completes all three sections with accurate information.\n- **Approaching Standard:** Student completes the drawing and one written response accurately.\n- **Developing:** Student completes the drawing but needs support explaining the connection between camouflage and survival.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Explore Activity:** Provide pre-colored animal shapes instead of asking students to color them. Students only need to glue them onto the habitat and observe hiding success.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Support:** Use picture cards paired with vocabulary words. Point to the photo and say the word aloud several times. Have students repeat and then point to the picture independently.\n\n3. **One-on-One Check-In:** During the hide-and-seek hunt, sit with the student and help them locate animals. Ask, \"What color do you see? Does it match the green paper?\" Guide their observations with questions rather than telling them the answer.\n\n4. **Modified Exit Ticket:** Allow students to respond by pointing, drawing only (no writing), or speaking to an adult. Accept one-word answers (\"green,\" \"hiding,\" \"safe\").\n\n---\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Predict and Explain:** Ask advanced students to predict whether a katydid would survive in different habitats (snow, desert, water). Have them draw or write: \"A katydid would NOT survive in a _____ because _____.\" Encourage them to think about why matching the habitat is important.\n\n2. **Design a New Adaptation:** Provide a scenario: \"If katydids lived in a red flower garden instead of grass, what color would they need to be? Why? Draw your new katydid and explain.\"\n\n3. **Research and Report:** Have students research one other insect or animal that uses camouflage (stick insect, moth, grasshopper, leaf butterfly). Create a simple poster showing the animal and its habitat, labeled with the word \"camouflage.\"\n\n4. **Extend the Comparison:** Ask students to compare how different animals use adaptations other than color (e.g., shape, texture, behavior). \"How is hiding in grass like hiding under a log? How is it different?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Nature Walk Hunt:** Take students on a outdoor exploration of the school yard or nearby green space. Challenge them to find one animal that blends into its habitat (insect, bird, etc.). Have students sketch or photograph it (if possible) and discuss what makes it hard to see. Back in the classroom, create a class chart: \"Animals We Found in Our Habitat.\"\n\n2. **Camouflage Craft: Make a Katydid:** Students create a 3D paper katydid using green construction paper, rolled/folded to create legs and wings. Display them in a \"grass\" habitat made from green streamers or paper strips. This reinforces body structure and habitat connection through creative play.\n\n3. **Story and Discussion: \"The Katydid's Song\":** Read aloud a picture book about insects or animals hiding in nature (e.g., *Dear Catterpillar* by Andry Desai Hidén or *Hiding* by Kathryn Heling). After reading, discuss how the animals' colors and shapes help them survive in their homes. Have students act out being a hidden katydid and a predator searching for it.\n\n4. **Sensory Exploration:** Bring in a live katydid (if available from a local nature center or educational supplier) or high-quality video of one. Let students observe its movement, hear its sound (many katydids sing), and discuss how its other adaptations (not just color) help it survive. Extend with questions: \"How does the katydid's shape help it move through grass? How does its sound help it find a mate?\"\n\n5. **Comparison Chart: Animal Adaptations Across Habitats:** Create a large class chart with habitat pictures and have students contribute drawings and descriptions of animals and their adaptations (color, shape, size, speed). Display in the classroom as a reference for future lessons on diversity.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
