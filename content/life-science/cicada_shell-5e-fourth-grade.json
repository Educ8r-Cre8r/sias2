  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Cicada Shell\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **External structures and adaptation:** The hard exoskeleton visible in the photograph is an external structure that protects the cicada's body during its life cycle and serves as a defense mechanism.\n- **Life cycle transformations:** The shed shell (exuvia) demonstrates that cicadas grow by molting, shedding their outer skin as they mature—a key stage in their complete life cycle.\n- **Organism-environment relationships:** Cicadas live on tree bark where lichens also grow, showing how organisms share habitats and use environmental features (bark texture) for shelter and survival.\n- **Structural function:** The intricate details of the exoskeleton—legs, wings, and segmented body—reveal how external body parts are specifically shaped to help the cicada survive, move, and interact with its environment.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**What's Inside the Shell? Exploring How Cicadas Grow and Change**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fourth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or three 30-minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** 4-LS1-1 (structures and functions); 4-LS1-2 (senses and responses)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify external structures of a cicada and explain how each structure helps the cicada survive.\n2. Describe the cicada's life cycle, including the molting process, using evidence from the shed shell.\n3. Explain why cicadas shed their exoskeleton and how this helps them grow.\n4. Use observations of the cicada shell to construct an argument about how external structures support an animal's survival and growth.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the mysterious brown shell and activate prior knowledge about animal growth and change.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of cicada shell on tree bark (displayed on board/projector or printed copies)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording student ideas\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without explanation. Show it for 30 seconds in silence and ask students to observe carefully.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice in this picture? What do you see?\" (Let students describe the brown object and lichen without labeling yet.)\n   - \"Do you think this is a living thing or something that was left behind? Why do you think that?\"\n   - \"What animal might have made or left this shell-like object? What clues help you guess?\"\n   - \"Why would an animal leave behind something like this? What do you wonder about it?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder if this shell is like the one you might find from a hermit crab at the beach, or if it's completely different. What do you think?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions and questions** on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to investigate what this shell is, why the animal left it behind, and what it tells us about how animals grow and change.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate external structures of the cicada and discover evidence of molting and growth.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Printed high-quality photograph of the cicada shell (or access to the image on tablets/computers)\n- Magnifying glass or hand lens\n- Cicada shell or detailed replica (if available; optional but impactful)\n- Observation worksheet with labeled diagram outline of cicada\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Ruler for measurement\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Close Observation (8 minutes)**\n- Distribute printed images or provide magnified projection.\n- Direct students: \"Use your magnifying glass to look very closely at the brown shell. You're going to become experts on what it looks like.\"\n- Ask: \"What parts can you see? Look for a head, legs, wings, body segments. What shape is it? Is it smooth or bumpy?\"\n- Students sketch or label what they observe on their worksheet.\n\n**Step 2: Comparative Analysis (8 minutes)**\n- Show students a small photo or drawing of a living cicada (side-by-side comparison).\n- Ask: \"How does the shell look like a living cicada? How is it different?\"\n- Record observations: \"The shell looks like an outline... the legs are still there... it's empty inside... it's brown like dried out skin.\"\n\n**Step 3: Structure-to-Function Investigation (6 minutes)**\n- Point to specific parts of the shell: legs, wings, mouth area, body segments.\n- Ask for each part: \"Why would a cicada need *legs*? Why would it need *wings*? What purpose do these structures serve?\"\n- Students write one word or a short phrase next to each labeled structure (e.g., \"legs = climbing,\" \"wings = flying\").\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"How do you think this structure helps the cicada survive?\"\n- Avoid labeling the shell as a \"molt\" or \"exoskeleton\" yet—let students discover through observation.\n- Ask: \"Does it look like something is missing? Where is the cicada?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify major external structures (head, thorax, abdomen, 6 legs, 2 pairs of wings, antennae).\n- Students make the connection that the shell is *empty*—the animal is gone.\n- Students begin to understand that structures like legs and wings are for moving and surviving.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and concepts of exoskeletons, molting, and growth; connect observations to the cicada's life cycle.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (still displayed)\n- Whiteboard or chart paper for vocabulary\n- Life cycle diagram of cicada (teacher-created or from reliable source)\n- Optional: Video clip (2-3 minutes) of cicada molting (search \"cicada molting\" on YouTube for short, age-appropriate clips)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**1. Guided Share-Out (5 minutes)**\n- Call on students to share observations from the Explore phase.\n- Record key findings: \"It has legs... it looks empty... the shell is hard...\"\n\n**2. Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes)**\n- Write terms on the board and define in student-friendly language:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Exoskeleton** | A hard, outside skeleton that covers an animal's body like a suit of armor. It protects the animal inside. |\n| **Molt** | When an animal sheds (or leaves behind) its old exoskeleton because it has grown too big for it. A new, soft skeleton underneath gets hard. |\n| **External Structures** | Body parts on the outside of an animal that help it survive, move, eat, and grow (like legs, wings, antennae). |\n| **Life Cycle** | The stages an animal goes through from birth to adult to old age, including changes and growth. |\n| **Exuvia** | The empty shell left behind when an animal molts. (Use the word once, but don't require students to remember it.) |\n\n**3. Explain the Cicada's Story (5 minutes)**\n- \"This brown shell is called a *molt* or *exuvia*. A cicada left it behind.\"\n- \"Cicadas spend most of their lives underground as babies called *nymphs*. Then, when they are ready, they crawl up tree trunks.\"\n- \"When a cicada gets too big for its hard outside skeleton, it has to *molt*—it wiggles out and leaves the old shell behind, just like we saw in the picture.\"\n- \"The new skeleton underneath is soft at first, then it hardens. The cicada is bigger now and can continue to grow.\"\n- Show the simple life cycle: egg → nymph (underground, many years) → crawls up tree → molts → adult cicada (with wings) → makes sounds → reproduces.\n\n**4. Connect to the Photograph (2 minutes)**\n- Point to the shell: \"This is what we found. The cicada has left this behind and moved on.\"\n- Show the lichen on the tree: \"Cicadas live on trees like this one. The hard bark and rough texture give them places to hide and climb.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Ask: \"Why did the cicada leave this shell behind?\"\n- Ask: \"What do the legs and wings help the cicada do?\"\n- Ask: \"Is the cicada still in the shell?\" (Students should say no.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that the shell is shed skin, not the living cicada.\n- Students can name external structures and explain their function (legs for climbing, wings for flying, antennae for sensing).\n- Students grasp the concept that molting allows growth.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of structures and growth to a new scenario and create evidence-based arguments.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Drawings or photos of 3-4 different insects (ant, butterfly, beetle, grasshopper)\n- Blank index cards\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: Small plastic insects or bug models\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Structure-Function Matching Game**\n\n1. Display images of 3-4 different insects side-by-side with the cicada shell.\n2. Assign students to small groups. Each group gets one insect image.\n3. **Task:** \"Your insect is different from the cicada, but they both have external structures. Describe what structures your insect has and how those structures help it survive in its environment.\"\n4. Groups draw or label their insect, identifying at least 3 external structures and their functions.\n5. **Gallery walk:** Post drawings around the room. Students walk and compare how different insects have different structures for different survival needs.\n   - Example: A butterfly has wings for flying far distances; a cicada has wings for flying short distances and escaping predators.\n\n**Option B: Argument Construction**\n\n1. Provide each student or pair with an index card.\n2. **Prompt:** \"Look at the cicada shell again. Write or draw an argument answering this question: How do the cicada's external structures (like legs, wings, or antennae) help it survive and grow?\"\n3. **Argument frame:**\n   - \"The cicada's *[structure]* helps it survive because...\"\n   - Use evidence from the photograph.\n4. Students share arguments aloud. Record on a class poster.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to notice that structure and function are connected.\n- Ask: \"Why does this insect have *this* structure? What does it need to do to stay alive?\"\n- Encourage evidence-based thinking: \"What in the picture helps you know that?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different animals have different external structures suited to their environments and survival needs.\n- Students construct simple, evidence-based arguments: \"The cicada's legs help it climb trees because they are long and strong.\"\n- Students deepen understanding of how growth (through molting) allows animals to become more capable.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of external structures, functions, and the molting process.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n- Circulate during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n- Listen to student explanations and check that they can link structures to functions.\n- Ask individual students: \"Show me a leg on the cicada shell. Why does a cicada need legs?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative, administered at end of session):**\n\nProvide each student with this simple exit ticket:\n\n---\n\n**Cicada Shell Exit Ticket**\n\n1. **Look at the cicada shell photo one more time.** What do you see? (Draw and label 3 parts.)\n\n2. **Why did the cicada leave this shell behind?**\n   - [ ] The cicada died.\n   - [ ] The cicada grew too big and needed to shed its old skeleton.\n   - [ ] Another animal took the cicada's shell.\n\n3. **How does the cicada's structure help it survive? Choose one part (legs, wings, or antennae) and explain.**\n   - \"The cicada's _____________ helps it _____________ so it can _____________.\"\n\n4. **What did you learn today that surprised you?**\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students accurately identify at least 3 structures on the cicada shell.\n- Students select the correct answer about molting (Option B).\n- Students write or say a complete explanation linking one structure to its function (Standard 4-LS1-1).\n- Students can describe evidence from the photograph to support their explanation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will demonstrate understanding that the shell is a molt.\n- Most students will connect at least one external structure to its survival function.\n- All students will show increased curiosity about animal life cycles and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support for Struggling Learners:**\n\n1. **Provide a labeled diagram.** Give students a pre-labeled outline of the cicada shell with structure names (leg, wing, antenna, head, thorax, abdomen). They match functions to labels rather than identifying structures independently.\n\n2. **Use a physical model or real shell.** If available, let students handle a preserved cicada shell or a detailed replica. Tactile learners benefit from touching and rotating the object.\n\n3. **Simplify the exit ticket.** Offer multiple-choice or sentence-frame options:\n   - \"The cicada's legs help it _____ (climb / fly / see).\"\n   - Remove the drawing requirement; accept oral explanations.\n\n4. **Pair with a peer.** During Explore, pair a struggling reader/observer with a strong partner. The partner supports observation and vocabulary.\n\n**Challenge for Advanced Learners:**\n\n1. **Investigate the molting cycle in depth.** Research how many times cicadas molt (5-6 times during nymph stage) and how their size changes. Create a growth chart or timeline comparing cicada size at each molt stage.\n\n2. **Compare exoskeletons across arthropods.** Provide images of shells from insects, crustaceans (crab, lobster), and arachnids (spider). Ask: \"How are these exoskeletons the same? How are they different? Why might different arthropods have different exoskeleton structures?\" Create a Venn diagram or comparison chart.\n\n3. **Design an animal with specific structures.** Challenge: \"Design a new animal that lives in [habitat: rainforest canopy, desert, pond]. What external structures would it need to survive there? Draw it and explain your choices using evidence about how structures help survival.\"\n\n4. **Investigate sensory structures.** Focus on antennae: research how cicadas use antennae to detect vibrations, mates, and environment. Create a poster explaining: \"How do a cicada's antennae help it survive?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cicada Sound Investigation (Inquiry-Based):**\n   - Play a short audio clip of cicada calls (readily available online).\n   - Ask: \"What animal makes this sound? Why do you think cicadas make loud noises?\"\n   - Research: Cicadas produce sound to find mates. The sound-producing structures are on the abdomen.\n   - **Activity:** Students design a device (using paper cups, rubber bands, and craft materials) that vibrates and produces sound, mimicking how a cicada's sound-making structures work. This connects to 4-LS1-2 (sensory processing and response).\n\n2. **Observe Real Cicada Shells or Cicadas in Nature (Field Extension):**\n   - Take a \"nature walk\" around the school grounds in late summer/early fall to search for cicada shells on trees.\n   - Collect shells (with permission and care) and bring them back to the classroom for detailed observation.\n   - Students compare shells of different sizes, inferring that larger shells come from older cicadas.\n   - Create a \"cicada shell museum\" display with labeled specimens.\n\n3. **Life Cycle Comic Strip or Animation (Creative Extension):**\n   - Students create a 4-6 panel comic strip or simple stop-motion animation (using photos and objects) showing the cicada's life cycle: egg → nymph in soil → nymph climbs tree → molting → adult → reproduction.\n   - Captions should explain what happens at each stage and why structures matter.\n   - This reinforces the sequence of growth and the importance of external structure changes across the life cycle.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
