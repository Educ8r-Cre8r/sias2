Identify and label external structures of climbing vines (stem, leaves, tendrils, roots) and describe the function of each structure.\n2. Explain how vine structures help the plant survive by allowing it to grow toward sunlight and compete for light in crowded spaces.\n3. Construct an argument using evidence (observations from the photograph and their own investigation) that specialized plant structures support survival.\n4. Compare the structures of climbing vines to non-climbing plants and explain why different plants have different adaptations.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about vines and activate prior knowledge about plant structures and their purposes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of climbing vine (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen without explanation. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** (write them on chart paper as you ask):\n   - \"What do you notice about how this plant is growing? Why do you think it's growing this way instead of straight up?\"\n   - \"What special parts of this vine do you see? Point to something that looks different from a plant in a pot on your classroom windowsill.\"\n   - \"If this plant didn't have these special curly parts (tendrils), what might happen to it?\"\n   - \"Why would a plant want to climb up something tall? What advantage would that give it?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I have a mystery vine to show you today. Before we investigate, predict: What special structures do you think this vine has that help it climb? Why would those structures be useful?\" Have students turn-and-talk with a partner for 1 minute, then record 2-3 predictions on chart paper titled \"Our Vine Predictions.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's investigate real climbing plants and discover how their special body parts help them survive!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate climbing vine structures hands-on and observe how tendrils function.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Fresh vine cutting with tendrils (if available: morning glory, pea shoots, or grape vine—check school garden or local nursery; or use the photograph if fresh materials unavailable)\n- String or thin wire\n- Pencil or wooden dowel (smooth, about 1 inch diameter)\n- Hand lenses (one per pair of students)\n- Paper clips\n- Observation sheet (see below)\n- Plant specimen jars with water (if using fresh vines)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Close Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute hand lenses.** Assign students to pairs.\n\n2. **If using a fresh vine cutting:** Place the vine in water in a jar. If using only the photograph, display a high-quality close-up image on screen or printed sheet for each pair.\n\n3. **Direct students:** \"Using your hand lens, observe your vine carefully. Look for these parts and describe what you see: the main stem, the leaves, and the thin curly parts (we call these tendrils). Draw and label each part on your observation sheet. What do you notice about how the tendrils look? Are they straight or curly? Do they wrap around anything?\"\n\n4. **Observation Sheet Prompts:**\n   - Sketch the vine, labeling: stem, leaves, tendrils\n   - What color is the stem? Is it thick or thin?\n   - Describe the tendrils. Are they smooth or textured? Straight or coiled?\n   - How are the leaves arranged on the stem?\n\n**Part B: Testing Tendril Function (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials:** Each pair gets a pencil/dowel, string, and fresh vine cutting (or demonstrate with one specimen at the board).\n\n2. **Instruct:** \"Hold your pencil upright like a tiny fence post. Gently place the vine's tendrils near the pencil. Observe what happens over the next 5 minutes. Does the tendril touch the pencil? Does it curl around it? Does it grip tightly?\"\n\n3. **Scaffold the observation:** \"If nothing happens right away, that's okay. We're looking for any movement or curling. Record what you observe in drawings and words on your sheet.\"\n\n4. **Challenge observation:** \"Try wrapping a paper clip around the pencil (to mimic a bumpy branch). Do the tendrils respond differently to a bumpy surface than a smooth one?\"\n\n5. **Ask students to predict:** \"Based on what you see, why would a curly tendril be useful to a vine growing in nature?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among pairs, asking guiding questions without providing answers:\n  - \"What did you notice when the tendril touched the pencil?\"\n  - \"How is this tendril different from a leaf or the main stem?\"\n  - \"Why do you think nature designed this plant part this way?\"\n- Ensure students are documenting observations in words and sketches.\n- If vines respond slowly, remind students this is a gradual process and have them draw predictions of what they think will happen.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Sketched and labeled diagram of vine parts\n- Written or drawn observations of tendril behavior\n- Recognition that tendrils curl and grip (or can grip) around supports\n- Prediction that tendrils help the vine climb and stay attached to surfaces\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and plant structure-function relationships; connect exploration to survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Labeled diagram of vine (teacher-created or from textbook)\n- Photograph of the original vine\n- Pictures of other climbing plants (optional: ivy, clematis, hops—show variety)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Ask pairs to share one observation from their exploration. Record observations on chart paper. Guide students toward discovering:\n   - Tendrils curl and wrap around supports\n   - The stem is flexible and can bend\n   - Leaves are positioned to catch light\n   - Vines are lighter/thinner than stiff plants\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):** Present and define these terms using the vine photograph and exploration observations:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Tendril:** A thin, curly, thread-like part of a vine that wraps around objects to help the plant climb and hold on.\n- **Stem:** The main part of the plant that holds up leaves and transports water and nutrients throughout the plant; in vines, it's flexible and can bend and wrap.\n- **Leaf:** The broad, flat part of the plant that captures sunlight and makes food for the plant through photosynthesis.\n- **Adaptation:** A special structure or behavior that helps a living thing survive in its environment.\n- **Support:** Something that holds something else up; vines need support structures like fences, trees, or trellises to grow tall.\n\n3. **Make explicit connections (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Look back at the original photograph. This vine is growing on a wooden fence. Why is that smart for the vine? [It doesn't have to use energy to build a thick, strong trunk like a tree. Instead, it uses thin tendrils to grip the fence and grow upward toward the sunlight.]\"\n   - \"In nature, vines often grow in forests where many plants compete for sunlight. Vines with flexible stems and curly tendrils can climb up tree trunks and reach the sun without the expense of creating a thick, heavy trunk. This is an adaptation that helps vines survive.\"\n   - \"The structure of the vine—its flexibility, its tendrils, its light weight—supports its function: climbing and surviving.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (ask these questions to the group):**\n   - \"Why would a vine need to climb instead of growing flat on the ground?\"\n   - \"What would happen to this vine if it didn't have tendrils?\"\n   - \"Is the tendril an adaptation? Why or why not?\"\n   - (Expect: Yes, because it helps the vine survive by allowing it to climb toward light and attach to surfaces.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can name and describe the function of at least three vine structures (tendrils, stems, leaves).\n- Students understand that plant structures are adapted to help the plant survive.\n- Students recognize that different plants have different adaptations depending on their environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by comparing vine adaptations to other plants and constructing an argument about plant structures and survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or images of 4-5 different plants (tomato plant with stakes, cactus, sunflower, climbing ivy, water lily) printed or projected\n- Venn diagram worksheet (two circles: \"Vine Structures\" and \"Tomato Plant Structures\")\n- Argument frame graphic organizer (see below)\n- Chart paper for class argument\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Comparative Structure Analysis (7 minutes):**\n\n   - Show images of different plants side by side with the vine.\n   - Ask: \"These plants all need to survive. But they have very different structures. Why?\"\n   - Use a Venn diagram to compare vine structures to another plant (e.g., a tomato plant):\n     - **Vine:** flexible stem, tendrils, climbing, light weight\n     - **Tomato plant:** stiff stem, may need stakes for support, grows upward, heavier\n     - **Both:** leaves, stems, roots, grow toward sunlight\n   - Guide discussion: \"The vine's adaptations work well for *its* environment (places where it can climb). The tomato plant's structure works for growing in a garden. Different structures, different survival strategies.\"\n\n2. **Construct an Argument Using Evidence (11 minutes):**\n\n   - Provide the **Argument Frame:**\n     - **Claim:** Vines have special external structures that help them survive.\n     - **Evidence:** (Students cite observations from their exploration and the photograph—e.g., \"We observed that tendrils curl around pencils,\" \"The vine's stem is flexible and thin,\" \"We saw tendrils gripping tightly\")\n     - **Reasoning:** (Students explain *why* these structures help survival—e.g., \"Curly tendrils help the vine grip surfaces so it can climb high toward sunlight without building a heavy trunk. This helps the vine compete for light in crowded spaces.\")\n\n   - **Guided practice:** Model filling in the first part of the argument as a class on chart paper using one piece of evidence. Then have students work in pairs or small groups to complete the argument with their own evidence and reasoning.\n\n   - **Student task:** \"Write or draw your own argument with at least one piece of evidence from your exploration and explain why that structure helps the vine survive.\"\n\n3. **Share arguments:** Invite 2-3 pairs to share their completed arguments. Discuss how different evidence supports the same claim.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate Venn diagram comparison without judgement (\"these are just different solutions to survival\").\n- Scaffold argument writing for students who struggle: provide sentence starters like \"The tendril helps the vine survive because...\" or \"When we tested the vine, we noticed...\"\n- Challenge advanced students: \"Can you think of another plant that might need a different adaptation? Why?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Completed Venn diagram comparing vine and non-vine plant structures\n- Written or drawn argument with clear claim, evidence, and reasoning\n- Articulation that plant structures are matched to their environments and survival needs\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant structures and their functions in supporting survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Observation of student sketches and descriptions during Explore phase\n- Listening to discussions during share-out and comparative analysis\n- Quality of evidence cited in arguments during Elaborate phase\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes at end of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide students with a **different photograph or description** of a climbing plant (e.g., ivy, pea plant, clematis) they haven't studied. Ask:\n\n1. **Identify structures:** Name two external structures you see in this climbing plant. What do you think each one does?\n\n2. **Explain adaptation:** This plant also has tendrils (or similar climbing structures). Why is this an adaptation that helps this plant survive?\n\n3. **Apply learning:** If you were designing a robot plant that needed to climb a fence, what structures would you give it? Why?\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- ✓ Students accurately identify at least two external plant structures.\n- ✓ Students explain a structure's function related to climbing or capturing sunlight.\n- ✓ Students make a connection between plant structure and survival (explicitly stating structure helps with climbing, finding light, or competing).\n- ✓ Students apply learning to a new situation (robot plant design).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate:\n- Clear understanding that plant external structures serve functions\n- Ability to recognize adaptations in new plant examples\n- Capacity to construct logical explanations linking structure to survival\n- Transfer of learning to novel scenarios\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary anchor chart:** Create a visual chart with pictures of vine parts labeled in simple terms (stem, leaf, curly gripper, roots). Keep this posted and reference it frequently. Allow students to point to or use the chart when explaining.\n\n2. **Structured observation sheet:** Provide a pre-drawn outline of a vine with labeled blanks for structures instead of requiring students to draw independently. Students fill in functions or descriptions of what they already see.\n\n3. **Sentence starters for arguments:** Provide written sentence frames:\n   - \"The [structure] helps the vine survive because...\"\n   - \"When we tested the vine, we saw that the tendril...\"\n   - \"This is good for the vine because it can now...\"\n\n4. **Pair with a peer buddy:** During Explore and Elaborate, pair struggling students with patient peers for shared investigation and discussion.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research extension:** Provide access to pictures or videos of different climbing strategies (twining stems vs. tendrils vs. aerial rootlets). Ask students to research and compare three different climbing adaptations and create a poster showing how each one works.\n\n2. **Design challenge:** \"Design a new vine adaptation that would help a plant climb in a different environment—for example, climbing an underwater cliff or a sandy desert dune. Sketch your design and explain why your adaptation would work.\"\n\n3. **Deeper argumentation:** Ask advanced students to construct arguments comparing *two different plant adaptations* and evaluate which is \"better\" for different environments. (\"Tendrils work better for climbing trees because... but aerial rootlets work better for climbing rocks because...\")\n\n4. **Biodiversity exploration:** Have students find images of climbing plants from different parts of the world and investigate whether plants from similar climates have similar adaptations (convergent evolution thinking for 4th grade level).\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Raise a Climbing Plant:** Start seeds of a climbing plant (peas, morning glories, or sweet potatoes) in cups in the classroom. Provide a small trellis, fence, or string for each cup. Students observe over 2-3 weeks and document the plant's growth, tendril movement, and how it attaches to the support. Compare growth rates of plants with and without support structures. This extends the investigation to *real growth over time*.\n\n2. **Vine Structure Model Building:** Provide craft materials (pipe cleaners, green paper, straws, tape) and ask students to build a 3D model of a vine showing all external structures and how they function. Have them present their model to the class, explaining each part's role in helping the plant survive. This is a kinesthetic way to deepen understanding of form and function.\n\n3. **Field Investigation: Vine Hunt in School Grounds:** Take students outside to find real climbing vines or ivy on fences, buildings, or trees on school property. Have them observe and sketch what they find, noting what the vine is climbing on, which direction it's growing (toward sunlight), and what structures they can see. Discuss how real vines in nature use the same adaptations they studied. This connects classroom learning to real-world ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson plan uses the photograph as the primary visual reference and scaffolds students toward independent investigation, formal explanation, and evidence-based argumentation—all key practices for 4th-grade science and aligned to 4-LS1-1.**",
