Green plants and dappled sunlight surround the peaceful woodland setting where this nocturnal animal has found shelter.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image represents the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of animal adaptation and habitat selection. The raccoon demonstrates behavioral adaptation by resting during daylight hours, as raccoons are nocturnal mammals that are most active at night. The animal has chosen this tree stump as a resting spot because it provides elevation for safety, a solid surface, and is located in a shaded area that offers protection from predators and harsh sunlight. This behavior showcases how animals instinctively select microhabitats within their larger ecosystem that meet their specific survival needs.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Animal Adaptations**: Raccoons have both physical adaptations (facial masks reduce glare, dexterous paws for manipulating objects) and behavioral adaptations (nocturnal activity patterns, opportunistic feeding habits).\n\n2. **Habitat Requirements**: All animals need four basic habitat components - food, water, shelter, and space arranged in a way that allows survival and reproduction.\n\n3. **Forest Ecosystem Interactions**: Raccoons serve as both predators and prey in woodland ecosystems, helping control insect and small animal populations while providing food for larger predators.\n\n4. **Mammalian Characteristics**: Raccoons exhibit typical mammal traits including fur for insulation, live birth, milk production for young, and warm-blooded metabolism.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use this image to introduce the concept of \"animal neighborhoods\" - just like humans choose where to live based on their needs, animals select habitats that provide everything necessary for survival. This analogy helps students connect to the scientific concept.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to demonstrate their understanding of animal adaptations: allow them to draw, act out, create models, or verbally explain how the raccoon's features help it survive. This supports diverse learning preferences and abilities.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n**Zoom In:** At the cellular level, the raccoon's fur contains specialized cells called melanocytes that produce different amounts of melanin pigment, creating the distinctive color patterns including the dark facial mask. These pigment cells respond to genetic instructions that determine coat coloration patterns.\n\n**Zoom Out:** This raccoon is part of a complex forest food web that extends across entire watersheds. Raccoons help disperse seeds through their droppings, contributing to forest regeneration. Their feeding habits connect aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as they hunt for crayfish, frogs, and insects near water sources, then travel inland to forage for fruits, nuts, and small mammals.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: \"Raccoons wash their food because they are clean animals.\"\n   **Reality**: Raccoons have highly sensitive paws, and wetting them enhances their sense of touch, helping them better examine and manipulate food items.\n\n2. **Misconception**: \"Animals choose where to live randomly.\"\n   **Reality**: Animals select habitats based on specific survival needs - availability of appropriate food, water, shelter, and space for raising young.\n\n3. **Misconception**: \"All animals are active during the day like humans.\"\n   **Reality**: Many animals are nocturnal (active at night) or crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk) as adaptations to avoid predators, reduce competition, or take advantage of cooler temperatures.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation**: 5-LS2-1 - Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: \n  - [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS2.A]] - The food of almost any kind of animal can be traced back to plants\n  - [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS1.C]] - Animals engage in behaviors that increase their chances of survival\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: \n  - [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]] - A system can be described in terms of its components and their interactions\n  - [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] - The way an object is shaped or structured determines many of its properties and functions\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What evidence can you observe in the photo that suggests this raccoon has adaptations for climbing? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. How might the raccoon's choice to rest on this tree stump during the day help it survive in the forest ecosystem? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n3. If you were to design the perfect habitat for a raccoon, what components would you include and why? (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 4)\n\n4. What other animals might compete with raccoons for similar resources in this forest habitat? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Nocturnal:** Active during nighttime hours when it is dark outside.\n* **Adaptation:** A special feature or behavior that helps an animal survive in its environment.\n* **Habitat:** The natural place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs to survive.\n* **Ecosystem:** All the living and non-living things in an area that interact with each other.\n* **Mammal:** A warm-blooded animal that has fur or hair and feeds milk to its babies.\n* **Microhabitat:** A small, specific area within a larger habitat that meets particular survival needs.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- \"Raccoons\" by Emily Rose Townsend\n- \"North American Animals: Raccoons\" by Megan Borgert-Spaniol\n- \"What If You Had Animal Eyes?\" by Sandra Markle\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- \"Raccoon Facts for Kids\" - Educational video covering raccoon adaptations, habitat, and behavior (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFZFjoX2cGg)\n- \"Wild Kratts: Raccoon Powers\" - Animated exploration of raccoon abilities and ecosystem role (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac4GaGG-NS8)",
