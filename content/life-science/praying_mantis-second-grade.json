The mantis is perched on a plant stem near colorful pink and yellow flowers. You can see its big eyes looking forward and its leafy green color that helps it hide among plants.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why does the praying mantis hold its front legs up in that special way?\n\nThe praying mantis holds its front legs up because it is a **predator** (an animal that hunts other animals for food). This pose helps the mantis catch insects like flies and grasshoppers that come near flowers. When an insect gets close, the mantis uses its powerful front legs to grab it very quickly—faster than we can blink! The mantis also has excellent eyesight and can turn its head almost all the way around to watch for prey. This is an example of how animals have special **adaptations** (body parts and behaviors) that help them survive.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Animal Adaptations:** The praying mantis has special body features that help it survive. Its green color blends in with plants (camouflage), its powerful front legs help it catch food, and its big eyes help it see prey.\n\n* **Food Chains and Predators:** The praying mantis is a predator that eats smaller insects. It hunts near flowers because insects come to flowers for food.\n\n* **Insect Body Structure:** The praying mantis has six legs (like all insects), two large eyes, and wings folded on its back. Its front two legs are specially adapted for catching prey.\n\n* **Habitats:** Praying mantises live in gardens, fields, and other places with plants and flowers where they can find food and hide from larger animals.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nSecond graders learn best through observation and hands-on exploration. Before diving into vocabulary, have students watch a short video or observe pictures of a praying mantis moving and hunting. Ask them to describe what they notice BEFORE you introduce the word \"predator.\" This builds schema and makes new vocabulary meaningful. You can also bring in a live praying mantis (if safe and ethical) for brief observation with proper handling protocols.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nTo support diverse learners: (1) **Representation:** Provide images, videos, AND real specimens if possible; some students need multiple modalities. (2) **Action & Expression:** Let students draw or act out how a praying mantis moves and catches food instead of only writing. (3) **Engagement:** Connect to student interests—ask if they've ever seen an insect in their backyard, making the lesson personally relevant. Use think-pair-share discussions to give all students time to process.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\nK-LS1-1: Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n* [[NGSS:DCI:K-LS1.A]] - All organisms have external parts and internal systems.\n* [[NGSS:DCI:K-LS1.C]] - All organisms have needs (food, water, air, shelter).\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Students notice patterns in how the praying mantis's body structure matches its hunting behavior.\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] - Students understand how the mantis's powerful front legs and large eyes help it survive.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **What do you think the praying mantis uses its big front legs for?** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **Why is the praying mantis's green color helpful when it sits on plants?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **If a praying mantis couldn't turn its head, how would that change the way it hunts for food?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **Where would be a good place to find a praying mantis, and why?** (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals for food.\n\n* **Prey:** An animal that gets eaten by another animal.\n\n* **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home.\n\n* **Camouflage:** Colors or patterns on an animal's body that help it blend in with its surroundings so other animals can't see it easily.\n\n* **Insect:** A small animal with six legs, three body parts, and often wings.\n\n* **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Insect Hunt and Observation:** Take students outside to a garden or grassy area (with proper supervision). Have them look for insects near flowers and plants. Ask them to observe and sketch what they see. Discuss: What do these insects need? Where do they hide? Would a praying mantis want to live here? This connects the lesson to their real world.\n\n2. **Make a Praying Mantis Model:** Provide pipe cleaners, construction paper, and googly eyes. Have students build a 3D model of a praying mantis and label its body parts (head, legs, eyes). Display models around the classroom and have students explain what each part does.\n\n3. **Predator-Prey Movement Game:** Play a classroom game where some students are \"insects\" (moving around the room) and one student is the \"praying mantis\" (trying to tag them gently). Rotate roles. Afterward, discuss how being a predator and being prey feel different, and why animals need to be fast or sneaky to survive.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *Praying Mantis* by Darlene R.
