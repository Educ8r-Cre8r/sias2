Its feathers are mix of white, brown, and gray, and you can see its small dark eye. The bird looks calm and is resting, maybe after fishing. Behind it is blue sky. That enormous pouch can hold 2-3 gallons of water - that's like holding three big milk jugs in your mouth!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image showcases one of the most specialized feeding adaptations in the bird world - the gular pouch. When pelicans dive-bomb into the ocean from heights up to 60 feet, they scoop up fish in that expandable throat pouch. The pouch can hold three times more than the pelican's stomach! After catching fish, the pelican drains out the water through the sides of its beak and swallows the fish whole.
