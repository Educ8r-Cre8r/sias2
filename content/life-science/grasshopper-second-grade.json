The sunflower is brown and has lots of small seeds packed together in the center.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe anchoring phenomenon shown here is **animal feeding behavior and habitat use**. The grasshopper is positioned on the sunflower because it provides both food (seeds and plant material) and shelter. This represents how animals have specific body parts (structures) that help them get food and survive in their environment. The grasshopper's strong mandibles (jaws) can chew plant material, while its powerful hind legs allow it to jump to safety if needed.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Animal Body Parts and Functions**: Grasshoppers have specialized structures like strong hind legs for jumping, antennae for sensing, and chewing mouthparts for eating plants.\n\n2. **Plant-Animal Interactions**: Animals depend on plants for food and shelter, showing how living things are connected in nature.\n\n3. **Animal Needs**: All animals need food, water, shelter, and space to survive, and they use their body parts to meet these needs.\n\n4. **Habitat Requirements**: Animals live in places that provide everything they need to survive.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"See-Think-Wonder\" thinking routine with this image. Have students observe what they see, think about what's happening, and wonder about questions they have. This builds scientific thinking skills.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide magnifying glasses for students to examine real grasshoppers or detailed pictures. Create tactile models of grasshopper body parts using clay or pipe cleaners so all students can explore the structures through multiple senses.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In**: At the microscopic level, the grasshopper's mandibles have tiny cutting edges that work like scissors to slice through plant fibers. Special digestive enzymes in the grasshopper's stomach break down cellulose from plant cell walls.\n\n2. **Zoom Out**: This grasshopper is part of a larger food web where it serves as both a primary consumer (eating plants) and prey for birds, spiders, and other predators. The sunflower field ecosystem supports many interconnected species.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: \"All insects are bad and hurt plants.\"\n   **Clarification**: Many insects like grasshoppers are important parts of nature and help feed other animals. They only take what they need to survive.\n\n2. **Misconception**: \"Grasshoppers only eat grass.\"\n   **Clarification**: Grasshoppers eat many different plants including flowers, leaves, and seeds from various plants, not just grass.\n\n3. **Misconception**: \"The grasshopper is hurting the sunflower.\"\n   **Clarification**: The sunflower is already done growing and making seeds. The grasshopper is using it for food and shelter, which is natural behavior.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation**: 2-LS4-1 - Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas**: \n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS4.A]] - There are many different kinds of living things in any area, and they exist in different places on land and in water.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts**:\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] - The shape and stability of structures of natural objects are related to their function.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. \"What body parts help this grasshopper get food from the sunflower?\" (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. \"How might this grasshopper's life be different if it lived in a desert instead of near sunflowers?\" (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n3. \"What do you notice about the grasshopper's legs, and how do you think they help it survive?\" (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n4. \"If you were designing an animal to live on sunflowers, what body parts would you give it?\" (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Antennae:** Long, thin body parts that help insects smell, touch, and sense their surroundings.\n* **Habitat:** The natural place where an animal lives and finds everything it needs to survive.\n* **Mandibles:** The strong jaw parts that grasshoppers use to bite and chew their food.\n* **Structure:** A body part of a living thing that has a special job or function.\n* **Consumer:** An animal that gets energy by eating plants or other animals.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Grasshoppers* by Cheryl Coughlan\n- *From Egg to Grasshopper* by Shannon Zemlicka\n- *Are You a Grasshopper?* by Judy Allen\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- \"Grasshopper Body Parts\" - Educational video showing grasshopper anatomy and adaptations (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n- \"How Grasshoppers Jump\" - Slow-motion footage explaining grasshopper locomotion for kids (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)",
