Observe and describe what animals eat in the photograph.\n2. Identify at least two animals and name one food each of those animals eats.\n3. Explain that animals need food to stay alive and grow.\n4. Sort pictures of animals and foods to show what different animals eat.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the grasshopper-on-hibiscus photograph (or display on whiteboard/projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it large. Say: *\"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see? Take a moment to look at everything—the big things and the tiny things.\"* Allow 30 seconds of quiet observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (one at a time, allowing think-pair-share responses):\n   - *\"What is the green creature in this picture? Have you ever seen something like this?\"*\n   - *\"What do you think the green creature is doing with the flower? Why might it be there?\"*\n   - *\"Do you think this creature is hungry? What makes you think so?\"*\n   - *\"What do you eat when you're hungry? How is that the same or different from what this creature eats?\"*\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Say: *\"Today, we're going to be animal detectives! We're going to figure out what different animals like to eat and why they need to eat. Let's wonder together: What does YOUR favorite animal eat?\"* Write student responses on chart paper (accept all ideas without judgment).\n\n**Transition:** *\"Great questions, detectives! Now let's go on an exploration to discover what animals really eat and why food is so important for their bodies.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of animals (6–8 cards: grasshopper, bird, rabbit, squirrel, cow, fish, dog, butterfly)\n- Picture cards of foods (10–12 cards: grass, seeds, leaves, flowers, worms, insects, meat, fish, carrots, apples, hay, grains)\n- Chart paper or large sorting mat divided into two columns\n- Small baskets or containers for sorting\n- Real examples (if possible): apple, carrot, seeds, or a leaf\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. *\"We have animal cards and food cards. Today, you're going to be a detective and match each animal to the foods it likes to eat. Work with a partner or small group.\"*\n\n2. *\"Pick one animal card. Look at the picture. What do you think this animal eats?\"* (Accept predictions—this is exploration, not \"getting it right.\")\n\n3. *\"Now, look through the food cards. Pick foods you think your animal would eat. Put them together in your basket or on your mat.\"*\n\n4. *\"As you make your matches, talk with your partner: Why do you think this animal eats this food? Have you seen this animal eat before?\"*\n\n5. *\"Everyone, save your matches! We'll talk about them in a minute.\"*\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** Remind students: *\"Remember the grasshopper in our picture? It was eating the flower bud. That's a plant. Let's see which other animals in our cards eat plants!\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups and listen to student reasoning without correcting.\n- Ask prompts like: *\"Tell me why you matched those two together\"* or *\"Have you seen a [animal] eat before? Where?\"*\n- Celebrate all attempts to make connections: *\"I like how you're thinking about what you've seen!\"*\n- Do NOT provide \"correct\" answers yet.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students make logical predictions about animal diets based on prior knowledge or observations.\n- Students match at least 3–4 animal-food pairs (accuracy is secondary to reasoning).\n- Students begin to notice patterns: *\"Lots of animals eat plants\"* or *\"Some animals eat other animals.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Picture cards from Explore (sorted by student groups)\n- Picture of the grasshopper photograph (reference)\n- Real object (apple, carrot, leaf, seeds, or dried insect—optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Gather students in a circle. Invite 2–3 groups to show ONE animal-food match they made. For each, ask: *\"Why did you put these together?\"* Validate reasoning: *\"Yes! You noticed that rabbits have teeth for chewing, just like that animal needs to eat!\"*\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (7–10 minutes):** Write each word on chart paper with a simple picture or icon.\n\n3. **Vocabulary:**\n\n   - **Food:** Something an animal eats to stay healthy, grow, and have energy to play and move.\n   - **Eat:** To take food into your body to give you energy and help you grow.\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n   - **Animal:** A living creature that can move, feel, and needs food and water (not a plant).\n   - **Plant:** A living thing that grows in soil and can make its own food from sun and water (like grass, flowers, trees).\n\n4. **Make connections back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - *\"Remember our grasshopper? It eats the flower—that's a plant. The grasshopper NEEDS to eat so it can grow big and jump around. Just like you need to eat so you can grow and play!\"*\n   - Hold up or point to the photograph again. *\"This grasshopper found food. It's eating because its body NEEDS food to survive.\"*\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"Thumbs up if you know what 'eat' means. Thumbs to the side if you're not sure.\"*\n   - Ask: *\"Why do YOU eat? What happens if we don't eat?\"* (Accept answers like: *\"We get hungry,\" \"We get tired,\" \"We can't grow.\"*)\n   - *\"Great thinking! Animals need food for the same reasons!\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define \"eat,\" \"food,\" \"survive,\" and \"animal\" in their own words.\n- Students understand that animals eat to survive, grow, and have energy.\n- Students recognize the connection between the photograph and the lesson concept: *\"The grasshopper is eating because it needs food to live.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Drawing paper (half-sheet or full-sheet)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Picture cards of animals (used earlier, or new ones)\n- Chart paper labeled: *\"What Do They Eat?\"*\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Animal Eating Picture Story (for most students)**\n\n1. *\"Now you're going to be an animal artist-detective!\"*\n\n2. *\"Pick your favorite animal from our cards (or think of one you know).\"*\n\n3. *\"Draw your animal on your paper. Then, draw 2–3 foods your animal likes to eat nearby.\"*\n\n4. *\"You can draw a grasshopper eating a leaf, or a bird eating seeds, or a cat eating fish—whatever you choose!\"*\n\n5. *\"While you draw, think about: Where would your animal find this food? In a garden? By water? In a tree?\"*\n\n6. **Sharing (5 minutes):** Invite 4–5 volunteers to show their drawing and say: *\"This is a [animal]. It eats [food] because [reason].\"* Add drawings to a class poster: *\"What Do Animals Eat?\"*\n\n**Option B: Habitat Hunt (for extending exploration)**\n\nIf time permits, take students on a brief (5-minute) outdoor or window observation:\n- *\"Let's go outside and look for evidence of animals eating. Can you find a leaf with bites? A bird's nest? Seeds? Tell me what you notice!\"*\n- Collect observations on a \"We Spotted\" list.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Prompt students during drawing: *\"Tell me about your animal. What does it need to eat to stay healthy?\"*\n- Celebrate effort and reasoning, not artistic skill: *\"I like how you thought about what your animal really eats in nature!\"*\n- Record student language on the poster to reinforce vocabulary.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation connecting an animal to its food.\n- Students explain (orally or in simple sentences) why their animal eats that food.\n- Students transfer learning to a new animal or scenario.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- **During Explore:** Listen to student reasoning as they match animals and foods. Note who understands the connection between animals and their food needs.\n- **During Explain:** Use thumbs-up/sideways checks and listen to student responses about why animals eat.\n- **During Elaborate:** Observe drawings and listen to student explanations. Can they name an animal and a food it eats?\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket or Closing):**\n\nUse one or both of these:\n\n**Option 1: Picture-Based Exit Task (2–3 minutes)**\nShow the grasshopper photograph again (or a new animal picture). Ask:\n- *\"What is this animal doing?\"*\n- *\"Why do you think it's eating?\"*\n- *\"What does this animal need to survive?\"*\n\n(Accept verbal or drawn responses. If drawing, ask them to draw what the animal is eating.)\n\n**Option 2: Answer These Questions (whole group or individual)**\n- *\"Name an animal and one food it eats.\"* (Success: Student names an animal and a realistic food.)\n- *\"Why do animals need to eat?\"* (Success: Student says something like: *\"To grow,\" \"To stay alive,\" \"To have energy,\" \"To get strong.\"*)\n- *\"If an animal doesn't eat, what might happen?\"* (Success: Student indicates the animal would be unhealthy or unable to survive.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting K-LS1-1:**\n✓ Student can name at least one animal and describe what it eats.\n✓ Student connects eating to survival/growth: *\"Animals eat because they need to stay alive\"* or *\"Animals eat to grow big.\"*\n✓ Student uses observations from the photograph or class activities to explain food needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can name one animal and one food it eats.\n- 70%+ of students can explain (in simple terms) why animals need to eat.\n- All students have engaged in observing, sorting, drawing, and discussing animal food needs.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Pre-sort animal-food matches:** Before Explore, pre-match 2 correct pairs (e.g., rabbit + carrot) and place them visibly. Ask: *\"Can you find another match like this one?\"* This scaffolds the concept before independent work.\n\n2. **Reduce choices:** Provide only 4 animal cards and 6 food cards instead of more. Fewer options prevent overwhelm while still allowing exploration.\n\n3. **Pair with a peer buddy:** Assign each student asking for support to a confident peer during Explore. Buddy can model reasoning: *\"I think the bird eats seeds because I've seen birds peck at seeds in the yard.\"*\n\n4. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"food\" and \"eat\" in early phases, saving \"survive\" and \"energy\" for Elaborate/Explain if student is ready.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Add a \"Why?\" layer:** Ask: *\"Why do you think this animal eats ONLY this food, not other things?\"* (Leads to discussions about teeth, habitat, digestive systems—preview for older grades.)\n\n2. **Habitat extension:** *\"Where would you find your animal eating this food? In a tree? On the ground? In water? Draw or show me.\"* This layers in ecosystem thinking.\n\n3. **Compare animals:** *\"Find two animals that eat the same food. Why might they both like it? Are they different in other ways?\"* (Introduction to comparing and contrasting.)\n\n4. **Create a food web:** Advanced students can draw arrows from food to animal to show who eats what (simplified food web concept).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Munch, Munch, Chomp\" Movement Game (indoor/outdoor, 10 minutes)**\n   - Students move like different animals (hop like a grasshopper, fly like a bird, hop like a rabbit).\n   - Call out an animal: *\"Show me how a rabbit eats grass!\"* Students mime eating while moving.\n   - Reinforces the lesson in a kinesthetic, fun way.\n\n2. **Bring in a real snack tasting (5–10 minutes)**\n   - Provide a safe, age-appropriate snack (apple slices, carrot sticks, seeds in a bowl).\n   - *\"Humans eat different foods too! Let's try a few things animals eat. Do you like these foods?\"*\n   - Connect to classroom nutrition/health: *\"We need to eat healthy foods, just like animals do!\"*\n\n3. **\"What's for Dinner?\" Book or Picture Chart (follow-up)**\n   - Create a simple class book where each page is: *\"[Animal] eats [food].\"* with a picture.\n   - Students contribute one page.\n   - Read aloud to reinforce vocabulary and celebrate student learning.\n   - Send home as a \"reading buddy\" book for practice.\n\n4. **Outdoor Scavenger Hunt: Animal Signs (10–15 minutes, outdoor)**\n   - *\"Let's go looking for signs that animals have been eating! Can you find a leaf with bites? A place where something was nibbled? Droppings? A burrow?\"*\n   - Document findings on a clipboard or in photos.\n   - Brings the lesson into the real world and deepens observation skills.\n\n5. **Guest visitor: Local gardener or zookeeper (optional, 10–15 minutes)**\n   - Invite someone to talk about what animals in a garden or zoo eat.\n   - Students ask: *\"What do you feed the [animal]?\"* *\"How much does it eat?\"*\n   - Real-world application and expert modeling.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Kindergarten consideration:** Students may confuse \"eating\" with \"tasting.\" Use phrases like *\"putting food in your mouth to eat it\"* to clarify.\n- **Safety reminder:** If using real foods, confirm no allergies. If finding outdoor examples, supervise carefully.\n- **Photograph power:** Return to the grasshopper image frequently. It's your anchor—every activity should reference it.\n- **Celebrate predictions:** Kindergarteners learn through wondering. Never shame incorrect guesses; instead, guide: *\"That's a great idea! Let's see what we discover together.\"*\n\n---\n\n**This lesson sets the foundation for understanding that all living things have basic needs. In future grades, students will expand this to water, shelter, and air—but food is the most observable and engaging starting point for K-LS1-1.**",
