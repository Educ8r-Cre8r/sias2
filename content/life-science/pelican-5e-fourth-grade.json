Identify and describe external body structures of a pelican and explain how each structure helps the pelican survive and hunt for food.\n2. Explain how a pelican uses its senses (especially eyesight) to locate and catch fish in water.\n3. Connect the pelican's physical features to its habitat and lifestyle as a water bird.\n4. Compare their own body structures to a pelican's structures and explain how differences relate to different environments and survival needs.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the pelican.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital projection of the pelican photograph (large, clear display)\n- Chart paper and markers (or whiteboard)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen without any introduction. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Initiate discussion** with these specific questions (pause after each for think-pair-share):\n   - \"What do you notice about this bird's beak compared to other birds you've seen?\" (Students may mention it's very long, has a pouch, looks unusual.)\n   - \"Why do you think this bird has such a big, long beak? What might it use it for?\" (Encourage predictions: catching food, carrying things, balance.)\n   - \"This bird lives in the ocean near water. What parts of its body do you think help it survive in that environment?\" (Guide thinking toward feet, wings, body shape, beak.)\n   - \"If you were this bird trying to catch a fish in the water, what would help you?\" (Promote thinking about eyes, speed, beak shape.)\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n   Write on chart paper: \"I think the pelican's beak helps it _____ because _____.\"\n   Have 4-5 students share predictions aloud. Do NOT correct them yet—record them as \"Our Predictions.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore how a pelican's body parts work together like a fishing machine. Let's see if we can discover why this bird looks and moves the way it does.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how body structures help animals survive through hands-on investigation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large index cards (5×8\") with drawings or printed images of pelican body parts:\n  - Long, pointed beak with pouch\n  - Large webbed feet\n  - Long, powerful wings\n  - Streamlined body shape\n  - Small, beady eye positioned on side of head\n  - Gray/white waterproof feathers\n- One set per pair of students\n- Chart: \"Pelican Body Part Detective Sheet\" (printed or on board)\n  - Columns: \"Body Part,\" \"What I Notice,\" \"How It Helps the Pelican,\" \"Prediction: Why This Matters\"\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. Pair up students. Each pair receives one set of pelican body part cards and one Detective Sheet.\n\n2. \"Your job is to be body detectives. One partner picks a body part card. Look at it carefully for 30 seconds.\"\n\n3. \"Both of you talk about: What do you notice about this body part? What does it look like? Is it big, small, pointy, flat, strong?\"\n\n4. \"Now, imagine you ARE the pelican. How would this body part help you catch fish, move in the water, or survive in your ocean home? Write or draw your ideas in the 'How It Helps' column.\"\n\n5. \"Rotate to the next body part card. Repeat steps 2-4 until you've explored all six pelican body parts.\"\n\n6. **Documentation:** Students record observations and predictions on the Detective Sheet using words and pictures.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to each pair every 5 minutes.\n- Ask guiding questions without giving answers:\n  - \"What does that shape remind you of?\"\n  - \"How might that help in water?\"\n  - \"Can you think of a time YOU used something similar?\"\n- If students are stuck, offer sentence stems: \"This helps the pelican _____ because _____ .\" or \"If I had webbed feet, I could _____.\"\n- Keep the energy collaborative—this is exploration, not right/wrong answers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will make reasonable (though not always scientifically accurate) connections between pelican body parts and survival functions.\n- Pairs will produce a filled-in Detective Sheet with observations, sketches, and predictions about each body part.\n- Students will begin recognizing that multiple body parts work together (systems thinking).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original pelican photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary definitions\n- Detective Sheets from Explore phase\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share one body part they explored and their prediction for how it helps.\n   - Affirm their thinking: \"That's a great observation! You noticed the pouch under the beak. Let me tell you the science behind that.\"\n\n2. **Formal Instruction with Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   Display the photograph again and point to features as you teach. Use simple, direct language:\n\n   - **\"External structures are the outside parts of an animal's body that you can see.\"** Point to the beak, feet, wings. \"The pelican's external structures are like tools that help it live in its habitat.\"\n   \n   - **\"The pelican's long, pointed beak is specially shaped to grab slippery fish in the water. Under the beak is a pouch that acts like a net or basket to scoop up water and fish together.\"** (Demonstrate with your hands how a pouch scoops.)\n   \n   - **\"Those webbed feet (toes connected by skin) help the pelican paddle through water, just like the flippers on a swimmer!\"** Show a picture of human feet next to webbed feet if available.\n   \n   - **\"The pelican's large, powerful wings help it fly and dive from the air into the water to catch fish. Its streamlined body—smooth and narrow—helps it move quickly through water without wasting energy.\"**\n   \n   - **\"The pelican's eyes are positioned on the sides of its head so it can see movement in the water from high up in the air. This helps it hunt successfully.\"**\n\n3. **Connect Back to Explore (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Show your predictions chart from Engage. \"Let's see if what you predicted matches the real science...\"\n   - Affirm accurate predictions and gently correct misconceptions using the photograph as evidence.\n   - Add labels to the photograph together: point and name each structure as students listen.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   Ask individual students quick questions:\n   - \"Why do you think the pelican has webbed feet and NOT regular toes like a chicken?\"\n   - \"Show me on the photograph where the pelican's pouch is. What job does it do?\"\n   - \"If a pelican's beak was short and fat instead of long and thin, would it be a good hunter? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **External structure:** The outside parts of an animal's body you can see (like skin, feathers, beak, feet, wings).\n- **Beak/Bill:** The hard, pointed mouth part birds use to pick up food and eat.\n- **Pouch:** A special stretchy pocket under the pelican's beak used to scoop up water and fish together.\n- **Webbed feet:** Toes connected by stretchy skin, perfect for swimming and paddling in water.\n- **Streamlined:** A smooth, narrow body shape that moves easily and quickly through water.\n- **Habitat:** The natural home or environment where an animal lives (like oceans, forests, or deserts).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can name and locate at least 3 external structures on a pelican.\n- Students understand that body structures serve specific survival functions (catching food, moving, sensing the environment).\n- Students recognize connections between a pelican's body design and its water/coastal habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by designing adaptations for new scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Scenario cards (printed, one per pair):\n  - **Scenario A:** \"You are a desert pelican that hunts on land instead of in water. What body parts might change? Why?\"\n  - **Scenario B:** \"Pelicans need to rest on water at night safely. What body structures keep them from sinking or getting cold?\"\n  - **Scenario C:** \"A pelican is hunting fish in murky, dark water where it can't see well. How might its other senses (hearing, touch) help it catch food?\"\n- Drawing paper and colored pencils\n- Optional: small clay or craft materials to model a \"new\" pelican\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Choice Board (Students choose ONE):**\n\n**Option 1: Adaptation Redesign (Drawing/Writing)**\n- Pairs select a scenario card.\n- They sketch or describe how a pelican's body might look different if it lived in that situation.\n- They label at least 3 body parts and explain why each changed.\n- Example: \"If a pelican lived in the desert, it might have shorter wings to stay cool and harder feet for walking on rocks.\"\n\n**Option 2: Comparative Bodies (Venn Diagram)**\n- Students create a Venn diagram:\n  - Left circle: \"Pelican Body Parts\"\n  - Right circle: \"My Body Parts\"\n  - Middle: \"Parts that do similar jobs\"\n- Students identify which pelican structures are similar to human structures and which are unique to water life.\n- Example: \"Both have eyes, but pelican's eyes are on the sides. Both have limbs, but pelican has webbed feet for water.\"\n\n**Option 3: Function Poster (Illustration with Labels)**\n- Students create a labeled diagram of the pelican showing 4-5 external structures.\n- For each structure, they write or draw a sentence showing how it helps the pelican survive.\n- Example: \"Pouch under beak = catches many fish at once so pelican has enough food.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Provide scenario cards and circulate to check understanding.\n- Ask extension questions:\n  - \"Why would that change help the pelican in that new place?\"\n  - \"What would happen if the pelican couldn't make that change?\"\n  - \"Are there other animals that have similar body parts? How do they use them?\"\n- Record standout answers to share during Evaluate phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students apply their knowledge of pelican structures to imagine new scenarios.\n- Students demonstrate deeper thinking about the **purpose** of each structure (survival, hunting, movement, protection).\n- Students make cross-connections between different animals and body systems.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of pelican structures and their survival functions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Can students describe body parts and make reasonable predictions about function?\n- Check-for-understanding questions in Explain: Can students answer quick recall and reasoning questions?\n- Monitoring during Elaborate: Are students applying concepts to new scenarios with accurate reasoning?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nDistribute an index card. Students respond to ONE of the following (differentiate by ability):\n\n**For Developing Learners:**\n1. \"Draw the pelican's beak and pouch. Label them. Write one sentence: This helps the pelican _____.\"\n2. \"Pelicans have webbed feet. True or False? Why is this helpful?\"\n\n**For Proficient Learners:**\n1. \"A pelican's beak, wings, and webbed feet all help it survive. Pick one and explain in 2-3 sentences how it helps the pelican catch fish and live in the ocean.\"\n2. \"Compare a pelican's body to a duck's body. How might they be the same? How might they be different? Why?\"\n\n**For Advanced Learners:**\n1. \"Explain how a pelican's eyesight, beak, and pouch work TOGETHER as a system to help it hunt successfully. What would happen if one of these parts didn't work well?\"\n2. \"Pelicans have external structures that help them survive in water. What internal structures (inside the body) do you think might also be important? Make a prediction and explain your thinking.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Student identifies at least 2-3 external pelican structures  \n✓ Student explains how at least one structure helps the pelican survive or hunt  \n✓ Student shows understanding that body structure and habitat are connected  \n✓ Student can compare pelican and human body structures  \n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents will demonstrate understanding through:\n- Accurate identification of pelican body structures\n- Clear explanations connecting structure to function (hunting, swimming, sensing)\n- Reasonable comparisons with other animals or human bodies\n- Application of concepts to new scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Detective Sheet:** Provide a pre-labeled Detective Sheet with pictures and word banks. Students circle the correct function or match body parts to functions using lines.\n\n2. **Paired Exploration:** Assign struggling learners to work with stronger partners during Explore, with the stronger partner reading body part cards aloud and asking guiding questions.\n\n3. **Sentence Stems for Exit Ticket:** Provide sentence frames:\n   - \"The pelican's _____ helps it _____.\"\n   - \"Webbed feet are good for _____ because _____.\"\n   - \"The beak's pouch works like a _____ for the pelican.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research Extension:** Have advanced students research a SECOND water bird (cormorant, heron, spoonbill, or albatross) and compare its body structures to the pelican's. How are they similar? Different? Why?\n\n2. **Evolution Connection:** Ask advanced students: \"How might a pelican's body structures have developed over many, many years? Why would birds with better beaks and webbed feet survive longer?\" (Introduction to natural selection, age-appropriate.)\n\n3. **Design Challenge:** \"If you had to design a NEW bird that hunts in a freshwater lake instead of the ocean, what would its body look like? Sketch and label it, explaining how each part would help it survive.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Live Observation Field Trip:** If accessible, visit a local zoo, aquarium, or wildlife center where students can observe pelicans or other diving birds in person. Have students compare real pelican behavior to what they learned about structure and function.\n\n2. **\"Fishing Game\" Simulation:** Set up a water table or bucket. Give students different \"tools\" (turkey baster=beak with pouch, slotted spoon=other bird, their hand=human) and have them try to catch floating ping-pong balls or foam fish. Reflect: \"Why was the turkey baster most successful? What does that tell us about the pelican's beak design?\"\n\n3. **Pelican Literature Connection:** Read aloud a picture book featuring pelicans (e.g., *Pelican* by Rene Colato Lainez) or a non-fiction text about water birds. Have students identify external structures mentioned in the story and connect them to survival.\n\n4. **Sketch and Label Practice:** Provide unlabeled pelican diagrams. Students label external structures and write the function of each part. Repeat with other birds to compare.\n\n5. **\"My Ideal Habitat\" Design:** Students design their own habitat for a pelican based on its body structures. They draw and label where the pelican would live (ocean, lake, food sources, nesting spots) and explain why their habitat matches the pelican's abilities.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Pacing:** This lesson works best across two class periods. Consider doing Engage and Explore on Day 1, then Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate on Day 2.\n- **Visual Learners:** Use the photograph liberally throughout. Point, trace, and highlight features with a marker or laser pointer.\n- **Kinesthetic Engagement:** During Explain, have students stand and mime diving, paddling with webbed feet, or scooping with a pouch to build motor memory for concepts.\n- **Cultural Connection:** Pelicans appear in art, stories, and flags (Louisiana state bird). Consider sharing these connections to deepen engagement.\n- **Prior Knowledge:** This lesson assumes students have basic familiarity with birds and water animals. A quick pre-assessment (\"What do birds use beaks for?\") helps gauge starting point.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly scaffolds student thinking from observation → exploration → formal understanding → application, ensuring deep comprehension of how external structures support animal survival in specific habitats.",
