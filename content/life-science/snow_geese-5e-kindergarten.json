ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about what animals need and activate prior knowledge through the photograph of geese.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Large, clear projection of the snow geese photograph (or printed copies for small groups)\n  - Chart paper or whiteboard\n  - Markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n  Display the photograph prominently where all students can see it clearly. Ask students to sit in a circle or gather close. Say: \"Look at this picture. What do you see?\" Allow 30 seconds of looking time before asking questions.\n  \n  Ask these specific discussion questions one at a time, pausing for responses:\n  1. \"What are all these white birds? Have you ever seen birds like this?\" (Listen for any prior knowledge—snow geese, ducks, geese, etc.)\n  2. \"Why do you think so many birds are sitting in this field together? What might they be doing here?\" (Accept responses like: eating, resting, staying together, looking for food)\n  3. \"What do YOU need every day to stay healthy and strong?\" (Guide toward: food, water, sleep, a safe home)\n  4. \"Do you think these geese need the same things you need?\"\n  \n  **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if all these geese fly away from here, where do you think they go? What are they looking for?\" Write the word \"SURVIVE\" on the chart and say: \"Today we're going to figure out what animals need to survive—that means to stay alive and healthy.\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Let's explore and discover what these geese need by doing an activity where we act like geese!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate animal needs through a hands-on, movement-based activity that connects directly to goose behavior.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Open classroom space or gym\n  - Picture cards of food items (seeds, corn, plants, insects) — 8-10 cards scattered on the floor\n  - Blue paper or fabric square (represents water/wetland) — place in one area\n  - Yellow or brown paper (represents shelter/safe resting area) — place in another area\n  - Optional: goose sound recording to play softly in background\n  - Chart paper for recording observations\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Student Directions:**\n  1. \"Everyone is a goose now. We're going to move around like geese do. First, squat down and waddle around the space like geese walk.\"\n  2. \"Watch—I'm putting these picture cards on the ground. These are FOOD. When I say 'find food,' waddle over and stand on or touch one of the food pictures. Geese must eat to survive!\"\n  3. Play: Call out \"Find food!\" Students waddle and touch a food card. Repeat 2-3 times, changing the food pictures each round.\n  4. \"Look—here is water (point to blue paper). Geese need water to drink and to swim in. When I say 'get water,' waddle over to the water spot. Geese must have water to survive!\"\n  5. Play: Call out \"Get water!\" Students waddle to the blue paper area. Repeat 2-3 times.\n  6. \"Here is a safe resting place (point to shelter area). Geese sleep here and hide from danger. When I say 'find shelter,' waddle over and sit down together. Geese must have a safe place to survive!\"\n  7. Play: Call out \"Find shelter!\" Students waddle and sit in the shelter area. Repeat 2-3 times.\n  8. **Final round:** Call out the three commands in random order: \"Find food! Get water! Find shelter!\" Students waddle and move to each area as called.\n  9. **Reflection:** Gather students back in a circle and ask: \"What three things did you, as geese, need to find? Point to show me: food (food cards), water (blue paper), shelter (shelter area).\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:** \n  - Model the waddling motion clearly so students understand goose movement.\n  - Use an encouraging, playful tone to keep energy high.\n  - Observe which students can identify the three needs.\n  - Ask follow-up questions: \"Why do geese need food?\" \"What would happen if a goose couldn't find water?\" \n  - Do not tell students the answers; let them infer from the activity.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  Students will physically experience and demonstrate understanding that geese (and all animals) need food, water, and a safe place to survive. They will associate these three needs with the items/areas in the exploration activity.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and solidify understanding by connecting the exploration activity back to the photograph and real geese.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Original photograph of geese\n  - Chart paper with three columns headed: \"FOOD,\" \"WATER,\" \"SHELTER\" (written with pictures/icons)\n  - Markers\n  - Picture cards or drawings of geese food, water sources, and shelter types\n  - Optional: picture book about geese (e.g., \"Geese\" from a series like National Geographic Little Kids)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Group Share-Out:** Ask students: \"In our game, you were geese. What three things did you need?\" Write their responses on chart paper under the three headings. Accept answers like: \"grass,\" \"seeds,\" \"corn\" (under FOOD); \"lake,\" \"pond,\" \"river\" (under WATER); \"field,\" \"nest,\" \"safe spot\" (under SHELTER).\n  \n  2. **Connect to Photograph:** Display the original photograph again. Point and say: \"Look at this real picture of snow geese. Let's see if we can find these three things in this photograph.\"\n     - **Food:** \"See all these geese in the field? They are in a big farm field. They find seeds and plants here to eat. That's their food!\"\n     - **Water:** \"Geese need water. Even though we can't see a lake in this picture, geese stay in places near water so they can drink and swim.\"\n     - **Shelter:** \"These geese are together in a big group in an open field. Being together helps keep them safe from animals that might hurt them. That's their shelter—a safe place!\"\n  \n  3. **Introduce Vocabulary:** Say each word clearly and have students repeat. Write or draw each term:\n  \n     - **FOOD:** Things animals eat to grow strong and have energy. (Point to food items: \"Geese eat seeds and plants.\")\n     - **WATER:** Liquid that animals drink to stay alive and healthy. (Point to the photograph: \"Geese need to drink water and swim in it.\")\n     - **SHELTER:** A safe place where animals rest, sleep, and stay safe from danger. (Point to the field: \"Being in a group in a safe place is shelter for geese.\")\n     - **SURVIVE:** To stay alive and healthy. (Say: \"All animals need food, water, and shelter to survive.\")\n     - **HABITAT:** A place where an animal lives and finds what it needs. (Point to the photograph: \"This farm field is a habitat for these geese because it has food and water nearby.\")\n  \n  4. **Check for Understanding:** Ask individual students:\n     - \"Tell me one thing geese need to survive.\" (Listen for: food, water, or shelter)\n     - \"Can geese survive without food?\" (No)\n     - \"Why do you think these geese are together in this field?\" (Guide toward: they find food here, it's safe together, they need each other)\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Food:** Something animals eat to grow big and stay healthy.\n  - **Water:** A clear liquid that animals drink to stay alive.\n  - **Shelter:** A safe, comfortable place where animals rest and hide from danger.\n  - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n  - **Habitat:** The home place where an animal finds food, water, and shelter.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  Students can name and describe the three basic needs of animals (food, water, shelter) and begin to recognize these needs in both the exploration activity and real geese in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding of animal needs to different animals and recognize that all animals need similar things to survive.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Picture cards or drawings of 4-5 different animals (cat, bird, fish, rabbit, puppy)\n  - Whiteboard or chart paper\n  - Markers\n  - Optional: video clip (2-3 minutes) of geese in their natural habitat finding food and water\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Compare Different Animals:** Show picture cards of different animals (one at a time). For each animal, ask:\n     - \"What does this animal eat?\" (food)\n     - \"Where does this animal find water?\" (water)\n     - \"Where does this animal stay safe and sleep?\" (shelter)\n  \n  2. **Create a Class Chart:** Make a simple 4-column chart on paper:\n     | Animal | Food | Water | Shelter |\n     |--------|------|-------|---------|\n     | Geese  | Seeds, plants | Lakes, ponds | Open field, group |\n     | Cat    | Meat, fish, kibble | Bowls, streams | House, box |\n     | Fish   | Small bugs, plants | Already in water | Rocks, plants |\n     | Rabbit | Vegetables, grass | Stream, dew | Burrow, bushes |\n  \n     Fill in the chart together with student input. Emphasize: \"Every animal needs food, water, and shelter—just like YOU do!\"\n  \n  3. **Real-World Connection:** If available, play a short video (2-3 minutes) of snow geese in nature, showing them eating, drinking, and resting. Ask: \"What are they doing? Where are they getting food? Is there water nearby? Are they in a safe place?\"\n  \n  4. **Personal Connection:** Ask: \"You need food, water, and shelter too. Where do you get your food? Where do you get water? What is your shelter?\" (Answers: home, kitchen, water faucet, house/bedroom). This reinforces that all animals—including humans—have the same survival needs.\n\n- **Teacher Role:** \n  - Guide thinking with open-ended questions rather than providing answers.\n  - Validate all reasonable responses.\n  - Help students see patterns across different animals.\n  - Emphasize that even though animals look different and eat different foods, they all need the same three basic things.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  Students recognize that different animals need the same three basic things to survive (food, water, shelter), even though what they eat, where they find water, and where they shelter might look different.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of what animals need to survive and their ability to observe and describe animal behaviors.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n  - Listen to student responses during the ENGAGE discussion questions. Do they mention needs like food, water, or safety?\n  - Observe the EXPLORE activity. Can students identify and move to the correct areas when you call out \"find food,\" \"get water,\" and \"find shelter\"?\n  - Check understanding during EXPLAIN. Can students name the three basic needs?\n  - Monitor the ELABORATE chart-building. Do students offer reasonable suggestions for what different animals need?\n\n  **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n  \n  Choose one of these strategies based on student readiness:\n  \n  **Option A (Drawing):** Give each student a piece of paper with a simple goose drawing or outline. Ask: \"Draw or point to three things this goose needs to survive: 1) something to eat, 2) water, and 3) a safe place to rest. You can draw pictures or point to areas on your paper.\"\n  \n  **Option B (Verbal/Interactive):** Ask each student individually or in small groups: \"Tell me three things a goose needs to stay alive.\" (Accept answers in any order: food, water, shelter/safe place)\n  \n  **Option C (Picture Sorting):** Show students four pictures: corn (food), a lake (water), a nest (shelter), and a car (not needed). Ask: \"Which of these do geese need to survive?\" Have students point to or hold up the three correct pictures.\n  \n  **Option D (Observation-Based):** Show the photograph one more time and ask: \"What do you see in this picture that geese need? Point to where they find food. Where is the water near here? Why are they all together?\"\n\n- **Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n  ✓ Student can identify at least two of the three basic animal needs (food, water, shelter)\n  ✓ Student can give an example of food a goose eats OR identify water as something geese need\n  ✓ Student recognizes that geese gather in places with these resources\n  ✓ Student can connect the exploration activity to the real geese in the photograph\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n  Most kindergarteners will be able to name and describe at least two of the three needs (food and water are easiest to understand; shelter/safe place may take more scaffolding). Students should demonstrate concrete understanding through pointing, drawing, or simple verbal descriptions rather than complex explanations.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n  1. **Reduce Language Load:** Use more gestures and fewer words. Instead of \"What do geese need to survive?\" ask: \"Geese need to eat. What do they eat?\" or simply point and say \"FOOD\" while showing a picture. Use the same words repeatedly throughout the lesson.\n  2. **Pair with Visual Supports:** Give struggling students picture cards (food, water, shelter) to hold during the EXPLAIN phase. Have them point to the card as you introduce each vocabulary word. This reinforces memory and provides a concrete reference.\n  3. **Simplify the Explore Activity:** If the full game is overwhelming, simplify to one need at a time. Play only \"Find Food,\" practice it well, then add \"Get Water\" the next day. This reduces cognitive load and builds confidence.\n\n- **Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n  1. **Deepen Observation:** Ask advanced students to look more closely at the photograph and predict: \"How do you think these geese got to this field? Where did they come from? Why do you think they come here?\" Introduce the concept of migration—geese travel to find the best places with food and water. Have them draw a simple map showing where geese might travel.\n  2. **Comparative Thinking:** Ask: \"What is DIFFERENT between what a goose needs and what a fish needs? Both need water, but in different ways—why?\" or \"A squirrel and a goose both need shelter, but their shelter looks completely different. Why?\" This builds higher-order thinking about how animals adapt to their needs.\n  3. **Problem-Solving:** Present a scenario: \"Imagine a goose arrives at a field with no water nearby, no food, and lots of foxes (predators). Can it survive here? Why or why not? What should the goose do?\" This moves beyond identification to reasoning about survival.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Habitat Diorama:** Students create a simple shoebox or paper habitat for geese (or another animal of their choice). They include pictures or drawings of: food available (seeds, plants), water source (lake, pond), and shelter (safe nesting area). This reinforces the three needs in a creative, hands-on format and can be displayed in the classroom or sent home.\n\n2. **Animal Needs Scavenger Hunt:** Take students on a short nature walk or outdoor exploration around the school grounds. Ask them to find examples of where animals might find: food (seeds, bugs, grass), water (puddles, fountains, bird baths), and shelter (bushes, trees, holes). Have them point, draw, or photograph examples. Return to class and create a class list of \"Things Animals Need in Our School Yard.\"\n\n3. **Geese Migration Timeline:** Create a simple, illustrated timeline (using pictures and one-word labels) showing how geese travel North in spring (cold winter → need to leave) and South in fall (warm summer → need to return). This introduces the concept that geese MOVE to find places where their needs are met. Use the photograph as one point on the timeline and discuss why geese stop in places like this farm field during migration.\n\n---",
