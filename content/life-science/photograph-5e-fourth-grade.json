Identify and describe external structures of plants and animals that help them survive in different habitats.\n2. Explain how the structures of living things are matched to the places where they live.\n3. Classify different habitats shown in a landscape and describe what organisms might live there.\n4. Draw and label the structures of a plant or animal suited to a specific habitat shown in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity about how living things are designed to survive in different places by examining a real-world landscape.\n\n#### Materials\n- Printed copy of the aerial landscape photograph (or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"I notice / I wonder\" graphic organizer (one per student or pair)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display and Introduction:**\n1. Show students the aerial photograph without context. Say: \"Imagine you are a bird flying high above a landscape. What do you see?\"\n2. Give students 30 seconds to look quietly and observe.\n3. Ask the following discussion questions (pause 5–10 seconds after each for thinking time):\n   - **\"What different kinds of places or homes do you see in this picture?\"** (Dense forest, open green fields, a road, water)\n   - **\"If you were a deer, where would you want to live in this landscape? Why?\"** (Expected: forest for hiding, food)\n   - **\"If you were a farmer growing crops, where would you work? What does that place look like?\"** (Open fields)\n   - **\"Why might the road be important for some living things but dangerous for others?\"** (Travel route vs. unsafe)\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\nDistribute the \"I notice / I wonder\" organizer. Have students complete:\n- *I notice...* (3 things they see in the photograph)\n- *I wonder...* (1 question about how living things survive here)\n\nCollect these—they will be referenced in the Explain phase.\n\n#### Transition\n\"Different living things need different kinds of homes, and their bodies are built in special ways to help them survive. Let's explore how that works by designing our own habitat home!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate how external structures help organisms survive in specific habitats through hands-on design and matching.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Per pair/small group:**\n  - Index cards (blank, 5–6 per pair)\n  - Pictures of 6 organisms (printed and laminated, or drawn): tree, squirrel, fish, grasshopper, mushroom, bird\n  - Pictures of 3 habitat types: forest (dark, dense), open field (sunny, sparse), water/stream\n  - Colored pencils or markers\n  - Tape or glue stick\n  - Sentence starter handout: \"This _______ lives in the _______ because it has _______.\"\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part 1: Habitat Matching (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Partner Setup:** Pair students and give each pair the organism and habitat pictures.\n2. **Matching Task:** Say: \"Look at each living thing. Match it to the habitat where it belongs. You can put the pictures on your desk or tape them onto paper.\"\n3. **Discussion Prompt:** As they work, circulate and ask: \"Why does the fish belong in water? What part of its body helps it do that? What does the tree need from the forest?\"\n4. **Record:** Students write or draw one reason why each organism matches its habitat. Encourage them to label body parts (fins, roots, wings, leaves).\n\n**Part 2: Design Your Own Organism (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce:** Say: \"Now you are going to design your own living thing. First, decide: *Where will it live?*\" (forest, field, or water—show the habitat pictures again)\n2. **Design Sheet:** Give each student one large blank card or paper.\n3. **Step-by-Step Directions:**\n   - Draw an organism (plant or animal) that lives in your chosen habitat.\n   - Label at least 3 external structures (e.g., thick bark, long roots, wings, eyes, fur).\n   - Write why each structure helps it survive in that habitat. Use the sentence starter: *\"This _______ has _______ to help it _______.\"*\n4. **Example:** If the habitat is \"open field,\" a student might draw a grasshopper with: long back legs (to jump away from predators), brown color (to hide in grass), antennae (to sense danger).\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"What does your organism need to find in this habitat? How does this body part help?\"\n- Do **not** tell students the \"right\" answers—guide them with questions.\n- Encourage effort and creativity; accuracy develops in the Explain phase.\n- Have students explain their choices aloud to a partner or small group.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students match 4–6 organisms to habitats with at least one structural reason per match.\n- Students design a plausible organism with 2–3 labeled structures and written explanations showing cause-and-effect thinking (\"It has a long tail *so it can* balance in trees\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and deepen understanding by connecting exploration discoveries to the original photograph and life science concepts.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student designs from Explore phase\n- Printed or projected close-up images of structures: bird feathers, tree bark, fish scales, root systems (optional but recommended)\n- Vocabulary poster (see below)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part 1: Debrief Exploration (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Share Aloud:** Invite 3–4 student pairs to show their organism designs and explain one structure they drew. Listen for:\n   - Correct terminology (fins, feathers, roots, etc.)\n   - Logic connecting structure to function\n   - Habitat matching\n\n2. **Positive Framing:** Affirm correct reasoning: *\"Yes! Fish have fins to push through water, just like you said.\"* Gently correct misunderstandings: *\"That's close thinking. Fish live in water, so gills help them breathe underwater—fins help them move.\"*\n\n3. **Class Chart:** Create a large chart on the board:\n   ```\n   Habitat          | Organism      | External Structure  | What It Does\n   ─────────────────┼───────────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────────\n   Forest (dense)   | Tree          | Thick bark          | Protects wood\n   Forest           | Squirrel      | Sharp claws         | Grip branches\n   Open field       | Grasshopper   | Strong back legs    | Jump away\n   Water            | Fish          | Fins                | Swim/balance\n   ```\n   Fill this in as students share. Use student language first, then introduce formal terms.\n\n**Part 2: Vocabulary Introduction (5 minutes)**\n\nDisplay and discuss these terms using examples from the chart and photograph:\n\n#### Vocabulary\n- **External structure:** A body part on the outside of an organism that you can see and touch. *\"The fins on a fish are external structures.\"*\n- **Habitat:** The place where a living thing lives and finds food, water, and shelter. *\"The forest in the photograph is a habitat for deer and trees.\"*\n- **Adaptation:** A feature or behavior of an organism that helps it survive in its habitat. *\"A tree's deep roots are an adaptation that helps it find water in the soil.\"*\n- **Function:** What a body part does; how it helps the organism. *\"The function of bird feathers is to help it fly and stay warm.\"*\n\n#### Check for Understanding\nAsk: *\"Turn to a partner. Tell them one external structure you see on yourself, and what its function is.\"* (Expected: ears to hear, eyes to see, hands to grab, legs to run)\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\nStudents use at least 2 vocabulary terms correctly when describing the connection between a structure and its function.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nApply learning by analyzing the original photograph and predicting what organisms live in different zones based on their structures.\n\n#### Materials\n- The original landscape photograph (projected or printed, one per small group)\n- \"Habitat Zones\" worksheet (see below for content)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: binoculars (play props or real) to simulate investigating the landscape\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part 1: Identify Habitats in the Real Photograph (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Redisplay the aerial photograph.** Say: \"Now let's look at this real landscape again. We can see it has different zones—different places for living things to live.\"\n\n2. **Divide the landscape into zones** by marking the image (or describing):\n   - **Zone A (Dense Forest):** The thick green area on the left\n   - **Zone B (Open Fields):** The cleared, lighter green areas in the distance\n   - **Zone C (The Road):** The white/gray line cutting through\n   - **Zone D (Water feature):** The visible stream or river\n\n3. **Small Group Task:** In groups of 2–3, assign each group one zone. Students discuss: *\"What kind of habitat is this? What structures would an animal need to live here? What plant structures help it survive?\"*\n\n**Part 2: Design an Organism for the Real Habitat (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute the \"Habitat Zones\" worksheet** (see template below). Each student completes one or two zones.\n\n2. **Directions:**\n   - Choose one zone from the photograph.\n   - Draw an organism that lives there (can be real or imaginary).\n   - Label at least 3 external structures.\n   - Write: *\"This organism lives in Zone [A/B/C/D] because it has _____ (structure) to help it _____ (function).\"*\n\n3. **Example Completions:**\n   - Zone A (Dense Forest): Draw a woodpecker with a strong beak to drill into tree bark, sharp claws to grip tree trunks, and small size to fit between branches.\n   - Zone B (Open Field): Draw a jackrabbit with large ears to cool down in sun, long legs to run fast, and brown fur to blend in.\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate and ask: \"Why would this structure help here?\" and \"What challenges does this habitat have?\"\n- Encourage cross-pollination of ideas: \"Your group has a great idea about shade—tell Group 2!\"\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students correctly match at least 1 organism to a real habitat zone from the photograph.\n- Written explanations show clear cause-and-effect: structure → function → survival.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of how external structures help organisms survive in specific habitats.\n\n#### Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson)\n- **Observe:** Circulate during Explore and Elaborate phases, noting:\n  - Do students identify external structures accurately?\n  - Can they articulate function? (\"*Why* does a fish need fins?\")\n  - Are they matching habitats correctly?\n- **Ask:** Pose follow-up questions: \"What would happen if a fish lived in a desert? Would it survive? Why or why not?\"\n\n#### Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment\n\n**Provide each student with this exit ticket (can be verbal for younger readers):**\n\n---\n\n**Name: _________________________ Date: _____________**\n\n**Structure-Function Match (Circle the correct answer)**\n\n1. **A bird's wings help it:**\n   - a) Dig in soil\n   - b) Fly and move through air ✓\n   - c) Drink water\n\n2. **A cactus's thick, waxy skin helps it:**\n   - a) Climb trees\n   - b) Store water in a dry desert ✓\n   - c) Swim in water\n\n3. **Draw and Label:** Draw a plant or animal from a forest habitat. Label one external structure and explain what it does.\n\n   *Drawing:*\n   \n   *Label:* ________________________\n   \n   *What it does:* ____________________________________________________\n\n**Reflection Question (Student-Friendly Writing):**\n\"Look at the photograph again. Pick one habitat zone. Name one living thing that could live there and one structure it would need to survive.\"\n\n*Answer:* ________________________________________________________________\n\n---\n\n#### Success Criteria\n**Students demonstrate proficiency if they:**\n- Correctly match 3 out of 3 structure-function pairs on the exit ticket.\n- Draw and label at least one external structure with an appropriate function.\n- Provide at least one example from the photograph showing a realistic habitat-organism match with a reason.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Majority of students (80%+) correctly identify that external structures help organisms survive in their habitats.\n- Students can name at least 2–3 structures and describe their functions.\n- Students apply learning to the real photograph, showing transfer of knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n1. **Provide a word bank** during design activities with pre-drawn structures (fins, roots, wings, claws, fur, scales). Students cut and paste instead of drawing from scratch, reducing fine-motor demand while maintaining conceptual focus.\n\n2. **Use a simplified sentence frame** throughout: *\"_____ lives in the _____ because it has _____.\"* Pre-fill habitat names so students only complete the structure-function portion.\n\n3. **Pair with a strong reader/communicator** during small-group work. Assign this student as \"scribe\" so partner can verbally explain while written work is captured.\n\n4. **Provide image-only exit ticket options.** Instead of writing, students point to or select pictures (multiple choice) that show correct habitat-organism matches.\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n1. **Introduce the concept of trade-offs:** \"A polar bear has thick fur to stay warm, but it can overheat if it runs too much. How does it handle this?\" Challenge students to identify 2–3 potential challenges their designed organism might face and brainstorm solutions.\n\n2. **Add a behavioral/response component:** Build on structure by asking: \"Your organism has these structures. How would it *behave* or *respond* to danger? Show how its brain and senses help it survive.\" (Connects to 4-LS1-2 for future lessons.)\n\n3. **Design a \"hybrid\" organism:** \"Imagine you are creating a living thing that must survive in TWO different zones in this photograph—the forest AND the field. What structures would it need? Why?\" This requires prioritization and deeper analysis.\n\n4. **Research extension:** Assign students to investigate one real organism from the photograph's region (specific to your location) and create a one-page informational text with labeled diagrams showing its structures and how they help it survive.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Habitat Walk & Structure Scavenger Hunt (Outdoor or Classroom):**\n   Take students on a short walk around the school grounds or local park. Provide clipboards and worksheets asking: \"Find three different plants or animals (or signs of them). For each, draw or photograph it, and label one structure you see. What habitat is it living in?\" Return to class and add findings to the class chart. This extends learning beyond the photograph to real, immediate environments.\n\n2. **\"Adapt the Organism\" Design Challenge:**\n   Show students a card with a different habitat scenario: \"A rabbit must move to a desert. Re-design the rabbit. What structures change? Why?\" or \"A desert plant gets moved to a rainy forest. What happens?\" Students draw the adaptation and justify changes. This deepens cause-effect thinking and introduces the idea that structures must match habitats.\n\n3. **Create a Habitat Diorama or Pop-Up Book:**\n   Small groups choose one zone from the photograph and build a 3D representation (shoe box, poster board) or illustrated pop-up book showing the habitat and at least 3 organisms with correctly labeled structures. This is a creative, multi-sensory consolidation of learning, ideal for visual/kinesthetic learners and for sharing with other classes.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Timing flexibility:** The 90–120 minute estimate assumes one extended block or two consecutive sessions. You can split across three 45-minute classes by doing Engage + Explore in Day 1, Explain in Day 2, and Elaborate + Evaluate in Day 3.\n- **Photograph revisiting:** Return to the photograph during each phase. This anchors learning and builds observational skills.\n- **Vocabulary support:** Post the vocabulary words with simple illustrations in your classroom for the entire unit. Reference them daily.\n- **Real-world connection:** If possible, take a field trip or virtual tour of a local ecosystem (nature preserve, forest, wetland) to connect the photograph to students' own region and habitats.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly addresses **4-LS1-1** by guiding students to construct evidence-based arguments that external structures (fins, roots, claws, feathers, fur, bark) function to support survival in specific habitats. The photograph provides an authentic, visually rich context, and the 5E progression moves students from curiosity to hands-on exploration to formal understanding to real-world application.",
