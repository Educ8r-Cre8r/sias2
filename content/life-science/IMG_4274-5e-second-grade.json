Identify the body parts of a dragonfly and explain what each part helps the dragonfly do.\n2. Describe the habitat where dragonflies live and why water is important for dragonflies.\n3. Observe and compare dragonflies to other insects and explain how dragonflies are different.\n4. Predict how a dragonfly's special body parts help it survive as a hunter.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about dragonflies by examining the photograph and activating prior knowledge about insects and water habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected photograph of dragonfly (large, clear display)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster at the front of the classroom. Give students 30 seconds to silently observe without talking.\n\n2. **Ask students to turn and talk:** \"Turn to a partner and tell them what you notice about this insect. What do you see?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate a group discussion** using these specific questions:\n   - \"What is this insect called?\" (Accept answers; confirm it's a dragonfly if not mentioned.)\n   - \"What body parts do you see? Point to them on the picture.\" (Guide them to notice wings, body, head, eyes, legs.)\n   - \"Where do you think this dragonfly lives? What does it need?\" (Accept all responses; note on chart.)\n   - \"This dragonfly is a hunter. What do you think it hunts for?\" (Record predictions.)\n\n4. **Create a \"Dragonfly Wonder Chart\"** on the board with two columns:\n   - \"What we know about dragonflies\"\n   - \"What we want to find out\"\n   - Record student contributions.\n\n5. **End with an engaging statement:** \"Today, we're going to become dragonfly explorers and discover how this insect is perfectly built to live and hunt by the water!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore a dragonfly's special body parts and see how they work together.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate dragonfly adaptations through observational drawing and physical modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photographs of dragonflies (one per pair or small group)\n- Large paper (11\" x 14\")\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Pipe cleaners (6-8 per student)\n- Straws or paper towel tubes (1 per student)\n- Tape\n- Hand lenses (optional but helpful)\n- Label cards with body parts: head, thorax, abdomen, wings, eyes, legs\n- Blu-Tack or tape for attaching labels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Close Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** to each pair/small group. Provide the printed dragonfly photograph and a hand lens.\n\n2. **Give clear student directions:**\n   - \"Look very carefully at your dragonfly picture using the hand lens.\"\n   - \"Draw the dragonfly you see on your large paper. Make it BIG so we can see all the details.\"\n   - \"Use your colored pencils to show the colors you see.\"\n   - \"Count the wings and legs. Write the numbers on your drawing.\"\n\n3. **Circulate and ask guiding questions** (don't provide answers):\n   - \"What do you notice about the wings? How many are there?\"\n   - \"Look at the eyes. Are they big or small? Why might that be important?\"\n   - \"Where are the legs? How many do you count?\"\n\n**Part 2: Build a Dragonfly Model (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute model-building materials** to each student.\n\n2. **Give clear directions:**\n   - \"Use your straw (or tube) as the body—this is the dragonfly's abdomen and thorax.\"\n   - \"Twist two pipe cleaners together to make wings. Tape them to the top of your straw.\"\n   - \"Use two more pipe cleaners for legs. Tape them to the bottom.\"\n   - \"Add a head at the top using a small piece of pipe cleaner twisted into a circle for the eyes.\"\n\n3. **Have students pose their model** in different positions and discuss:\n   - \"How would your dragonfly fly?\"\n   - \"Can your model show how fast a dragonfly can move?\"\n   - \"Where would your dragonfly need to live?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate continuously.\n- Ask open-ended questions that encourage observation.\n- Do not correct findings—let students discover through investigation.\n- Help with taping/assembly only if needed; encourage independence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce detailed drawings showing body parts.\n- Students create 3D models demonstrating dragonfly structure.\n- Students count and record body parts (wings, legs).\n- Students make connections between structure and function (e.g., \"Big eyes help it see\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain how dragonfly adaptations support survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large whiteboard\n- Student drawings and models (from Explore phase)\n- Dragonfly body parts diagram (teacher-made or printed)\n- Picture cards of dragonfly habitat (water, pond, stream)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Invite students to share** (2-3 quick share-outs):\n   - \"Show us your drawing. What did you notice about the dragonfly?\"\n   - \"Tell us about your model. How does it show how a dragonfly looks?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions. Write each on the board with a simple illustration:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Dragonfly:** An insect that lives near water and has four wings and large eyes. It is a hunter that catches other small insects to eat.\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or way of behaving that helps an animal survive in its home.\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. A dragonfly's habitat is near water.\n- **Wings:** The body parts that help a dragonfly fly very fast through the air.\n- **Eyes:** Body parts that help a dragonfly see. Dragonfly eyes are VERY large so it can see insects flying!\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph and explorations:**\n   - Point to the original photograph: \"Look at those huge eyes! Why do you think a hunter needs big eyes?\" (To see insects flying; to catch prey.)\n   - Hold up a student model: \"See these four wings? Dragonflies can fly up, down, sideways, and backward! That helps them catch insects.\"\n   - Show habitat pictures: \"Dragonflies live near water—in ponds, streams, and lakes. Why do you think they need to be near water?\" (Guide them to understand their babies hatch in water.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your hands how big a dragonfly's eyes are.\"\n   - \"Can anyone tell us one way a dragonfly is different from a butterfly?\" (Accept responses; reinforce with facts.)\n   - \"Why is it helpful for a dragonfly to have four wings?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary correctly when discussing dragonflies.\n- Students can explain why dragonflies have big eyes (to see and catch food).\n- Students understand that dragonflies live in water habitats.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply dragonfly concepts to compare insects and understand diversity in habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of various insects: butterfly, ladybug, mosquito, ant, bee, cricket (one set per pair)\n- Venn diagram template (2 large circles drawn on chart paper or printed)\n- Markers\n- Habitat scenario cards (see activity description)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Compare Insects (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display the dragonfly photograph again** and show pictures of 2-3 other insects (butterfly, ladybug, bee).\n\n2. **Create a simple comparison chart** on the board:\n\n| Insect | Number of Wings | Eyes | Where It Lives |\n|--------|-----------------|------|-----------------|\n| Dragonfly | 4 | Very large | Near water |\n| Butterfly | 4 | Small | Gardens, flowers |\n| Ladybug | 2 | Small | Plants, gardens |\n\n3. **Guide discovery questions:**\n   - \"How are dragonflies and butterflies the same?\" (Both have wings, both are insects.)\n   - \"How are they different?\" (Dragonflies have bigger eyes, live near water, are hunters.)\n   - \"Why do you think a dragonfly needs bigger eyes than a butterfly?\" (Butterflies drink nectar from flowers; dragonflies hunt flying insects in the air.)\n\n**Part 2: Habitat Scenarios (8-10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Present simple scenarios** and ask students to predict:\n   - \"If there was NO water near your home, could a dragonfly live there? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"A dragonfly's baby (called a nymph) lives in water. Why is water important?\"\n   - \"If a dragonfly lived in a dark cave with no light, would its big eyes help? Why or why not?\"\n\n2. **Record student thinking** on chart paper. Celebrate reasoning.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask follow-up questions that push thinking deeper.\n- Connect responses back to adaptations studied in Explore and Explain phases.\n- Encourage students to use vocabulary independently.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify similarities and differences between dragonflies and other insects.\n- Students explain why certain adaptations (big eyes, four wings, water habitat) are important for dragonfly survival.\n- Students apply learning to new scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of dragonfly adaptations, habitats, and diversity.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- Listen to student discussions during Engage and Explore phases.\n- Observe accuracy of body part drawings and models.\n- Note vocabulary use during Explain and Elaborate phases.\n- Ask checking questions: \"Why do dragonflies need to live near water?\" and \"Show me the biggest part of a dragonfly's body and tell me what it does.\"\n\n**Summative Assessment: Dragonfly Detective Exit Ticket**\n\nAdminister this at the end of the second session. Provide each student with a printed page containing:\n\n**Exit Ticket (Read aloud for Second Grade):**\n\n1. **Draw a dragonfly.** Show at least three body parts and label them.\n\n2. **Circle the correct answer:**\n   - Where does a dragonfly live?\n     - A) In a tree\n     - B) In a garden\n     - C) **Near water** ✓\n\n3. **Fill in the blank:**\n   - A dragonfly has ________ wings. (Answer: 4)\n\n4. **Answer in 2-3 words:**\n   - Why does a dragonfly have such big eyes?\n   - (Expected answer: To see insects / To hunt / To catch food)\n\n5. **True or False:**\n   - A dragonfly and a butterfly are exactly the same. \n   - (Answer: False; they are different.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students accurately draw and label at least 3 body parts.\n- Students answer 4 out of 5 questions correctly.\n- Students use vocabulary (wings, eyes, habitat, adaptation) in responses.\n- Students can explain one way a dragonfly's body helps it survive.\n\n**How to Determine if Learning Objectives Were Met:**\n- **Objective 1 (Body parts):** Student drawings and models show accurate structure; vocabulary is used correctly.\n- **Objective 2 (Habitat):** Students identify water as the dragonfly's habitat and explain its importance.\n- **Objective 3 (Diversity/Comparison):** Students identify differences between dragonflies and other insects.\n- **Objective 4 (Survival/Prediction):** Students link body parts to survival (e.g., \"Big eyes help catch insects\").\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide a labeled dragonfly diagram** during Explore. Students trace body parts instead of drawing from observation alone. This scaffolds fine motor demands while maintaining the core learning.\n\n2. **Offer a word bank** for the Exit Ticket exit ticket with vocabulary pre-printed. Students point or circle words instead of writing independently.\n\n3. **Use a simplified Venn diagram template** with pictures instead of words for the insect comparison activity. Students sort pictures into \"Same\" and \"Different\" circles with teacher support.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Introduce the dragonfly life cycle:** Show photos of a dragonfly nymph (aquatic baby) and adult. Ask: \"Why must dragonflies lay their eggs in water? What changes happen as they grow?\" This connects to biological cycles and habitats.\n\n2. **Extend the insect comparison:** Provide 5-6 insects and ask students to sort them by habitat type (water, air, land, plants). Then: \"Which insects can live in multiple habitats? Why?\"\n\n3. **Research and report activity:** Provide one simple fact sheet per student about different dragonfly species. Students find and report one unique adaptation of their species (e.g., \"This dragonfly is red and lives in fast streams\").\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Dragonfly Observation Walk:**\n   - If your school is near water, take students on a nature walk to observe dragonflies in their real habitat (pond, stream, or even a puddle after rain).\n   - Students sketch what they observe and compare it to classroom drawings.\n   - **Safety note:** Observe from a safe distance; do not catch insects.\n\n2. **Water Habitat Investigation:**\n   - Connect to 2-LS2-1 (water and sunlight for growth): Prepare two small containers—one with water from a natural source (pond, stream) and one with tap water.\n   - Let students observe over a week. Ask: \"What lives in the pond water? Why does a dragonfly need this habitat?\"\n   - This bridges to exploring the ecosystem that supports dragonflies.\n\n3. **Dragonfly Art and Movement Activity:**\n   - Students create larger-scale dragonfly artwork using tissue paper, watercolors, or collage materials.\n   - Lead a short movement activity: \"Show me how a dragonfly flies fast, then slow, then hovers in place.\" (This reinforces the multi-directional flight adaptation.)\n   - Display artwork in the classroom or hallway with fact labels.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Photograph Connection:** The clarity and detail in this dragonfly photograph are perfect for a Second Grade audience. The large eyes, distinct wing structure, and visible body segments are ideal for observation and discussion.\n- **Real-World Relevance:** Many students have seen dragonflies in summer. Connecting to that experience (\"Have you seen one of these by a pool or park?\") increases engagement.\n- **Safety Reminder:** If using hand lenses, remind students to handle them carefully and never point them at the sun.\n- **Habitat Extension:** Depending on your location, you may live in a dragonfly-rich area. This lesson works best if students can see dragonflies in nature during or shortly after the unit.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson plan is fully aligned to 2-LS4-1 and meets all core principles of the 5E model while maintaining age-appropriate rigor and engagement for Second Grade students.**",
