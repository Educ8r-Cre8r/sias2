ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student interest in why trees change seasonally and activate prior knowledge about plants and seasons.\n\n#### Materials\n- Printed or projected photograph of the dock and autumn forest (one large display and/or individual copies for each student pair)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: 3-4 real fallen autumn leaves (fresh or pressed)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Introduction (Display the photograph):**\n- Gather students in a circle or at a viewing area where all can see the photograph clearly.\n- Say: \"Look at this beautiful scene. I want you to notice something special about the trees. What do you see that's different from the trees you see in spring or summer?\"\n- Allow 30 seconds of silent observation, then open discussion.\n\n**Discussion Questions (calibrated for Fifth Grade):**\n\n1. **\"Why do you think the leaves have changed from green to orange, yellow, and red? What do you think is happening to the tree?\"**\n   - *Expected responses:* The tree is dying, the tree is getting ready for winter, the tree is sick, the leaves are getting cold.\n   - *Teacher role:* Accept all ideas without judgment; write them on chart paper labeled \"Our Ideas About Falling Leaves.\"\n\n2. **\"If you were a tree, and winter was coming where it would be very cold and snowy, what might you need to do to stay alive? What would be hard about winter for a tree?\"**\n   - *Expected responses:* Get more water, move to a warm place, sleep, find food, close up, rest.\n   - *Teacher role:* Validate thinking; introduce idea that trees can't move, so they must change instead.\n\n3. **\"Look at the water in the picture. Do you think the tree can drink water easily in winter when it's frozen or very cold? Why or why not?\"**\n   - *Expected responses:* No, because ice is frozen; yes, the tree can drink cold water; no, because the ground is frozen.\n   - *Teacher role:* Affirm that frozen water is harder for trees to use, connecting to survival strategy.\n\n4. **\"What do you think happens to all those fallen leaves on the ground? Do they just stay there forever, or does something happen to them?\"**\n   - *Expected responses:* They rot, bugs eat them, they turn into dirt, they disappear, they break down.\n   - *Teacher role:* Highlight that leaves don't disappear—they change form.\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n- Hold up real fallen leaves (if available) and say: \"I wonder... if trees lose all their leaves in fall, how do they survive the winter? And what happens to all these leaves? Let's investigate these questions together.\"\n\n#### Transition\n\"Today, we're going to become scientists and explore why trees lose their leaves and what happens to those leaves. You'll discover secrets about how trees survive winter!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate the structure of leaves and simulate how water moves through them, discovering why trees benefit from losing leaves in cold seasons.\n\n#### Materials\n\n**Per student pair:**\n- 1 fresh green leaf (or leaf printout template if fresh leaves unavailable)\n- 1 container of water\n- Paper towel\n- Magnifying glass (1 per pair or group)\n- 1 small piece of celery with leaves still attached (alternative: can use the stem of a kale leaf)\n- Food coloring (red or blue)\n- 1 glass or clear cup\n- 1 observation sheet (template provided below)\n- Ruler\n\n**Setup (do this before lesson):**\n- Prepare containers with water + food coloring at each station\n- Place celery stems or leaf stems in colored water 10-15 minutes before Explore begins (students will observe the colored water moving up the stem)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part A: Leaf Structure Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. \"With your partner, examine your fresh leaf closely using the magnifying glass. Draw what you see in the leaf on your observation sheet.\"\n2. \"Look at the veins (the thin lines in the leaf). These are like tiny tubes. What do you think moves through these tubes?\"\n   - *Students predict:* Water, nutrients, food, energy.\n3. \"Gently touch the leaf. Does it feel smooth or bumpy? Rub it gently between your fingers. What do you notice?\"\n   - *Students should notice:* It feels papery, has a waxy coating, feels dry or slightly oily.\n4. \"Now, place your leaf in a container of water for 2 minutes. Observe what happens. Does it stay the same or change? Record your observations.\"\n   - *Expected observation:* Leaf may become less wilted if it was dry, or remain relatively stable. Emphasize the waxy coating that protects it.\n\n**Part B: Water Movement Demonstration (8 minutes)**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. \"Look at the celery stem (or leaf stem) that has been sitting in colored water. What do you observe?\"\n   - *Expected observation:* The water has traveled up the stem; the veins or inner parts show the color.\n2. \"With your scissors, carefully cut the stem in half lengthwise so you can see inside. What color do you see? Where did the colored water travel?\"\n   - *Expected observation:* The inner parts of the stem are colored, showing that water traveled from the roots up through the veins.\n3. \"Think about this: If it's winter and the ground is frozen, the roots of the tree can't get water easily. What might happen to the leaves if they tried to keep using all the water the tree has?\"\n   - *Expected prediction:* The leaves would dry out, the tree would lose all its water, the tree would die.\n4. \"Record on your observation sheet: 'If a tree keeps its leaves in winter with frozen soil, what might happen?'\"\n\n#### Teacher Role\n\n- **Circulate among pairs.** Ask guiding questions: \"What do the veins remind you of?\" \"Why do you think the water could travel up the stem?\" \"If the tree had no leaves in winter, what wouldn't happen?\"\n- **Do not explain the answers.** Let students observe and make their own connections.\n- **Encourage recording.** Remind students to draw and write what they see, not what they think they should see.\n- **Manage time.** Give 2-minute and 1-minute warnings before moving to next part.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students observe that leaves have veins (vessels) that transport water.\n- Students discover that water moves up through plant stems from roots.\n- Students begin to reason that if a tree can't get water from frozen soil, keeping many leaves would be a problem.\n- Students record observations (drawings and writing) that show they noticed leaf structure and water transport.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and scientific explanation for why trees lose leaves in autumn, connecting to students' discoveries.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of autumn forest (for reference)\n- Picture chart showing: deciduous tree in spring/summer/fall/winter (or create simple line drawings)\n- Vocabulary cards with images (printed or written)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n- Invite 3-4 pairs to share one observation from their Explore activity using a document camera, poster board, or simply by holding up their leaf or drawing.\n- Ask: \"What did you discover about how water moves in plants?\"\n- Record key student observations on chart paper under \"What We Discovered.\"\n\n**Mini-Lesson: Introducing Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\nUsing the photograph and students' discoveries, teach these five vocabulary terms:\n\n#### Vocabulary\n\n1. **Deciduous Tree:** A tree that loses all its leaves in fall to rest and save water during winter.\n   - *Student-friendly explanation:* \"Deciduous trees are like bears that hibernate—they rest in winter by losing their leaves. It helps them survive.\"\n   - *Connect to photo:* \"The trees in our picture are deciduous trees. See how they've lost their bright colored leaves?\"\n\n2. **Adaptation:** A trait (body part or behavior) that helps a living thing survive in its environment.\n   - *Student-friendly explanation:* \"An adaptation is like a superpower that nature gave to animals and plants to help them survive. Losing leaves is a tree's adaptation.\"\n   - *Connect to photo:* \"Losing leaves is the tree's adaptation to survive winter.\"\n\n3. **Transpiration:** The process where plants release water through their leaves as vapor.\n   - *Student-friendly explanation:* \"Transpiration is like plants sweating! When leaves are open and sunny, plants lose water through tiny holes in their leaves. In winter, if the soil is frozen and the plant is losing water, it will dry out and die.\"\n   - *Connect to activity:* \"Remember the colored water that moved up the celery stem? In summer, that water comes out of the leaves as vapor. But in winter, if the soil is frozen, there's a problem!\"\n\n4. **Dormancy:** A resting state where plants slow down all their activities to survive harsh conditions.\n   - *Student-friendly explanation:* \"Dormancy is when a plant takes a long sleep. The tree is still alive, but it's not growing, and it doesn't need much food or water.\"\n   - *Connect to photo:* \"In fall and winter, deciduous trees go dormant. They look dead, but they're just sleeping!\"\n\n5. **Decomposer:** A living thing (like bacteria, fungi, or earthworms) that breaks down dead material and returns it to the soil as nutrients.\n   - *Student-friendly explanation:* \"Decomposers are nature's recyclers! They break down dead leaves and turn them into food for new plants.\"\n   - *Connect to photo:* \"All those fallen leaves you see will be broken down by decomposers in the soil, and the nutrients will help next year's trees grow.\"\n\n**Connection to NGSS Standards (3 minutes):**\n\nDisplay the photo again and explain:\n- **5-LS1-1 connection:** \"These trees get the materials they need—water from the soil and air from the atmosphere. In winter, they can't get water from frozen soil, so they drop their leaves to survive. This is smart adaptation!\"\n- **5-LS2-1 connection:** \"The fallen leaves don't disappear. Decomposers break them down, and the nutrients go back into the soil. Then, the tree roots take those nutrients back up, and the cycle continues. Matter moves in a circle!\"\n\n**Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n\nAsk quick recall questions:\n1. \"What do we call a tree that loses its leaves in fall?\" *(Deciduous tree)*\n2. \"Why do trees lose their leaves?\" *(So they don't lose water when the soil is frozen; to adapt to winter)*\n3. \"What happens to the fallen leaves?\" *(Decomposers break them down; they return nutrients to soil)*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students can explain that deciduous trees lose leaves as an adaptation to winter conditions.\n- Students understand that losing leaves prevents water loss when water is unavailable from frozen soil.\n- Students recognize that fallen leaves are recycled by decomposers.\n- Students begin to see trees as living systems that respond to their environment.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply their understanding by modeling the cycle of matter in a forest ecosystem and predicting what would happen in different scenarios.\n\n#### Materials\n\n**Per small group (3-4 students):**\n- Large paper plate or poster board (12\" × 12\")\n- Colored markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Pre-cut pictures or student drawings of: tree, leaves, soil, decomposer (worm/fungi), nutrients, water, sun\n- Glue stick\n- Arrows (pre-cut or made from string/yarn)\n- Optional: sentence strips for labels\n\n**Alternative (if cutting not feasible):**\n- Printed \"Matter Movement\" template showing empty circles for tree, soil, decomposer, and arrows\n- Students label and draw in each section\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part A: Create a \"Matter Movement\" Model (12 minutes)**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"You are going to create a model showing how matter (water, nutrients, food, oxygen) moves between the tree, fallen leaves, decomposers, and soil. This shows how the forest ecosystem stays alive.\"\n\n2. \"On your poster, do the following:\n   - Draw or glue a picture of a **deciduous tree** in the center.\n   - Draw or glue **fallen leaves** below the tree.\n   - Draw or glue a **decomposer** (earthworm, fungus, or bacteria) in the soil.\n   - Draw the **sun** and add a label 'Water from soil and air.'\n   - Draw or glue a picture of **new growth** (baby tree or green leaves).\n\n3. \"Using arrows, show how each of these connects to the others. For example:\n   - Arrow from tree to fallen leaves (leaves fall)\n   - Arrow from fallen leaves to decomposer (decomposer breaks leaves down)\n   - Arrow from decomposer to soil (nutrients return to soil)\n   - Arrow from soil to tree (tree roots take up nutrients and water)\n   - Arrow from sun to tree (tree uses sunlight)\n\n4. \"Write one sentence explaining ONE arrow connection. Example: 'When leaves fall, decomposers break them down into nutrients.'\"\n\n**Teacher Facilitation:**\n- Circulate with guiding questions: \"Where do nutrients go after the decomposer breaks down the leaf?\" \"What does the tree need from the soil?\" \"Can the tree grow without decomposers?\"\n- Encourage students to use different colors for different materials (blue for water, brown for nutrients, green for growth).\n- Ensure arrows show direction of matter movement.\n\n**Part B: Predict and Explain Scenario (5 minutes)**\n\n**Scenario Discussion:**\nSay: \"Imagine a forest where scientists removed all the decomposers (killed all the worms, fungi, and bacteria in the soil). What would happen to the trees over time?\"\n\n**Student Task:**\n- As a group, discuss and write or draw your prediction.\n- Explain your reasoning using what you learned about decomposers and matter movement.\n- Expected answer: \"The fallen leaves wouldn't break down. Nutrients wouldn't return to soil. Trees wouldn't have enough nutrients to grow. They would get weaker and eventually die.\"\n\n**Alternative Scenario (if time permits):**\n\"What if it never got cold in fall, and trees kept their leaves all winter? What might happen?\"\n- Expected answer: \"Trees would lose water through transpiration, but the soil would be frozen, so roots couldn't get new water. The tree would dry out and die.\"\n\n#### Teacher Role\n\n- **Circulate actively.** Ask: \"Why is the decomposer important?\" \"What would happen without it?\" \"Can you add another arrow to show a second connection?\"\n- **Validate effort.** Emphasize that accurate arrows and labels matter; artistic quality is secondary.\n- **Challenge thinking.** Ask advanced students: \"What other organisms might be part of this cycle?\" or \"How does temperature affect this cycle?\"\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students create a visual model showing the cycle of matter in a forest ecosystem.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that decomposers play a critical role in returning nutrients to soil.\n- Students can explain (orally or in writing) at least one connection in the matter cycle.\n- Students apply learning to a new scenario by predicting consequences of ecosystem changes.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of why trees lose leaves, how water and matter move in ecosystems, and how trees adapt to seasons.\n\n#### Assessment Strategy: Multi-Modal Approach\n\n**Formative Assessments (used during lesson):**\n1. **Observe Explore activity:** Were students able to describe what they observed about leaf structure and water movement? Did their drawings and notes reflect understanding?\n2. **Listen during group discussions:** Can students explain why trees lose leaves using evidence from the photograph or their activity?\n3. **Review Elaborate models:** Do arrows show correct direction of matter flow? Do labels demonstrate vocabulary understanding?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (can be printed, written on index card, or digital). Students respond to **ALL three questions**:\n\n---\n\n**EXIT TICKET: \"Why Do Trees Say Goodbye to Their Leaves?\"**\n\n**Name: ________________     Date: ___________**\n\n**Question 1: Explain WHY (Understanding)**\n*Why do deciduous trees lose their leaves in fall? Use at least TWO reasons from what you learned.*\n\n*[Acceptable responses should include ideas like:*\n- *To stop losing water when the soil is frozen*\n- *To adapt and survive winter*\n- *Because they can't get water from frozen soil*\n- *To go dormant and rest*]*\n\n---\n\n**Question 2: Describe WHAT HAPPENS (Modeling Matter Movement)**\n*After leaves fall to the ground, what happens to them? Use the word \"decomposer\" in your answer.*\n\n*[Acceptable responses should include:*\n- *Decomposers break them down into nutrients*\n- *The nutrients go back into the soil*\n- *The tree can use those nutrients again next spring*]*\n\n---\n\n**Question 3: Picture Task (Observation & Vocabulary)**\n*Look at the photograph of the autumn forest. Label or point out:*\n- *At least one deciduous tree*\n- *Fallen leaves*\n- *The water (river/lake) that trees need*\n\n*Write one sentence: \"The trees get water from _________________ but in winter they cannot get water easily because _________________________.\"*\n\n*[Acceptable response: \"The trees get water from **soil/rain** but in winter they cannot get water easily because **the ground/soil is frozen**.\"]*\n\n---\n\n#### Success Criteria for Student Understanding\n\n**All students should demonstrate:**\n✓ Understanding that deciduous trees lose leaves as an adaptation to winter  \n✓ Recognition that frozen soil prevents water uptake  \n✓ Knowledge that fallen leaves are decomposed and recycled into nutrients  \n✓ Use of at least 2-3 vocabulary terms correctly (deciduous, adaptation, decomposer, dormancy, or transpiration)\n\n**Most students should:**\n✓ Explain the matter cycle with at least two connections between tree, leaves, decomposer, and soil  \n✓ Apply learning to a new scenario (the \"what if\" questions)\n\n**Some students may:**\n✓ Create additional arrows or connections in their model  \n✓ Explain transpiration and how temperature affects water movement  \n✓ Identify multiple decomposers or ecosystem members\n\n#### How to Determine If Students Met Learning Objectives\n\n- **5-LS1-1 (Materials plants need):** Students can explain that trees need water and air, and that frozen soil limits water availability, triggering leaf loss. *(Evidenced in exit ticket Q1 and Q3, Elaborate scenario discussions)*\n- **5-LS2-1 (Movement of matter):** Students create a model showing matter movement and can describe the decomposer's role. *(Evidenced in Elaborate poster/model and exit ticket Q2)*\n- **General Learning Objectives:** Students use vocabulary, explain seasonal adaptations, and make predictions based on ecosystem relationships. *(Evidenced across all phases and exit ticket)*\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Provide a vocabulary anchor chart** that remains visible throughout all phases. Include a picture for each term (deciduous tree, adaptation, decomposer, etc.). Students can reference and point to terms instead of recalling from memory.\n\n2. **Pre-cut and pre-label materials for Elaborate activity.** Instead of creating a model from scratch, provide a partially completed cycle template with some components already labeled. Students add missing arrows and complete 1-2 labels. Reduce writing requirement: students can draw an arrow and point to a word, or dictate explanation to a partner who writes it.\n\n3. **Pair with a stronger reader.** During Explain phase, pair a struggling reader with a peer who can read vocabulary definitions aloud. In small groups during Elaborate, assign the student a specific role (e.g., \"You hold the arrows\" or \"You draw the sun\") to ensure participation.\n\n4. **Simplify exit ticket.** Reduce to 2 questions instead of 3. Allow verbal response to teacher/aide instead of written, or provide multiple-choice options for Q1: \"Trees lose leaves because: a) to adapt and survive winter, b) because they're sick, c) for fun.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Expand ecosystem model.** Ask: \"What other living things depend on this tree and fallen leaves? (Insects, deer, birds, mushrooms) How do they fit into the matter cycle? Can you add them to your model and show new arrows?\" Students can create a more complex ecosystem cycle including food chains/webs.\n\n2. **Investigate transpiration rate.** Provide two potted plants (or stems in water). Keep one in a warm, sunny location and one in a cool, dark location. Students measure water loss over 3-5 days and hypothesize: \"How does temperature and light affect how much water a plant loses? What does this tell us about why trees need to lose leaves in winter?\"\n\n3. **Research evergreen trees.** Challenge students to research why some trees (evergreens like pine and spruce) DON'T lose their leaves. Provide guiding questions: \"How are evergreen leaves different from deciduous leaves? How do evergreens stay alive in winter without dropping leaves?\" Students present findings to the class.\n\n4. **Model decomposition.** Set up a closed-system decomposition jar (or use a pre-made one): layer soil, dead leaves, and a sealed lid. Over 2-3 weeks, observe how leaves break down. Students draw/photograph progress and explain what decomposers are doing. Create a time-lapse sequence.\n\n5. **Extended writing:** Ask students to write a \"Day in the Life\" narrative from a tree's perspective across the four seasons, explaining what happens to matter (water, nutrients, oxygen) as the tree adapts each season.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### 1. **Leaf Collection and Classification**\nHave students collect leaves from around the school grounds (or provide pre-collected leaves). Classify them by:\n- Color (yellow, orange, red, brown)\n- Size (small, medium, large)\n- Tree type (oak, maple, elm—if identifiable)\n- Condition (fresh, brittle, already decomposed)\n\nCreate a data chart or poster showing the diversity of leaves. **Connection to lesson:** Discuss why different trees lose leaves at different rates and why leaf colors are different. This deepens understanding of adaptation and seasonal variation.\n\n**Time:** 20-30 minutes  \n**Materials:** Collection bags, poster board, colored markers, magnifying glasses\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Create a \"Seasons Wheel\" for Deciduous Trees**\nStudents create a circular diagram divided into four sections (spring, summer, fall, winter). In each section, they:\n- Draw or glue a picture of the tree in that season\n- Label what the tree looks like (full of green leaves, flowers, colorful leaves, bare branches)\n- Write what the tree is doing (growing, making fruit, going dormant, resting)\n- Write what the tree needs (water, sunlight, nutrients)\n\n**Connection to lesson:** Reinforces the idea that trees are living things that change throughout the year as they adapt to their environment. Extends understanding of the full life cycle across seasons.\n\n**Time:** 30-40 minutes (can be done individually or in pairs)  \n**Materials:** Poster board, markers, pictures/clipart, glue, brads (to make wheel spin, optional)\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Decomposer Detective: Leaf Litter Investigation**\nTake students outside to a shaded area with leaf litter (dead leaves on the ground). Gently lift leaves and observe what's underneath and living within:\n- Earthworms, millipedes, beetles\n- Fungi (mushrooms, mold)\n- Decomposed leaves turning into soil\n\nStudents draw or photograph what they find and answer questions:\n- \"What creatures did you find? What do you think they're doing?\"\n- \"How does the leaf change from fresh (top) to decomposed (bottom) in the pile?\"\n- \"Why are decomposers important to the forest?\"\n\n**Connection to lesson:** Brings the abstract concept of decomposition into concrete, observable reality. Students see actual decomposers at work.\n\n**Time:** 20-30 minutes (plus 10 min. debriefing)  \n**Materials:** Small cups or containers, hand lenses, field guides (optional), observation sheets, cameras or drawing supplies\n\n---\n\n### Homework / Family Engagement Extension\n\n**\"Tree Watching Over Time\"**\n\nSend home an assignment where students and their families observe a tree (in their yard, neighborhood, or park) over 2-3 weeks and track:\n- What the tree looks like (draw or photograph)\n- What's on the ground around it (leaves, seeds, fallen branches)\n- Signs of decomposition or insects\n- Temperature and weather that day\n- Prediction: \"Will this tree drop all its leaves? When?\"\n\nStudents return a simple log or poster showing their observations. **Bonus:** Discuss with the class how different students' trees changed at different rates based on their location and local conditions.\n\n**Time:** Ongoing (homework assigned at end of unit, collected after 2-3 weeks)\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Summary\n\n**NGSS 5-LS1-1:** Students understand that deciduous trees need water and air (materials) to grow, and that seasonal water unavailability triggers leaf loss as an adaptation—evidence gathered through Explore activity and explained in EXPLAIN phase. Exit ticket Q3 directly assesses this standard.\n\n**NGSS 5-LS2-1:** Students develop a model (Elaborate poster) showing matter movement among trees, fallen leaves, decomposers, soil, and environment. They describe how decomposers break down dead material and return it as nutrients—directly aligned with standard language.\n\n**Fifth Grade Appropriate:** All vocabulary, activities, and questions use language and concepts suitable for 10-11-year-olds. Hands-on investigation, visual models, and real-world connections (the photograph, collected leaves, outdoor observations) support the concrete operational thinking typical of this age.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is ready to teach. Print the exit ticket, gather materials, and start with that beautiful photograph!**",
