ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the wildflower garden ecosystem and activate prior knowledge about what plants need.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the pollinator waystation displayed on an interactive board or projected on a screen\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Small cut flowers (cosmos or daisies) to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Observe:** Show the photograph of the wildflower garden. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation. Then ask them to turn to a partner and describe what they see.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the different flowers in this garden? What colors, shapes, and sizes do you see?\"\n   - \"Why do you think someone planted so many different kinds of flowers close together in one spot? What purpose might this garden serve?\"\n   - \"Look carefully at the green parts of the plants. What do you think the plants are doing to stay alive and grow so well in this garden?\"\n   - \"If you were a small insect visiting this flower garden, what would you find to eat or drink? Where would it come from?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder how the flowers in this garden help insects, and how those insects help the flowers? Let's figure out where the energy and materials come from that keep both the plants and the visiting animals alive.\"\n\n4. **Record Initial Ideas:** Create a class \"Wonder Wall\" on chart paper listing student predictions about what plants need and how they connect to animals.\n\n**Transition:** \"To answer our questions, we're going to become garden detectives and investigate what plants really need to grow and thrive.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant growth requirements and begin to understand the exchange of materials and energy between plants and their environment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Four small potted bean or sunflower seedlings (identical, same age, same size)\n- Water (in spray bottles or measuring cups)\n- Plastic bags (for creating sealed containers)\n- Four labels and markers\n- Four locations with different conditions:\n  - Location A: By a sunny window (light + air + room temperature)\n  - Location B: In a dark closet or cabinet (no light, but air + water available)\n  - Location C: In a sealed plastic bag (light but limited air exchange)\n  - Location D: Dry windowsill (light + air, but NO water)\n- Observation sheets (one per student or per pair)\n- Ruler for measuring height\n- Optional: Magnifying glasses\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set Up the Investigation (5 minutes):**\n   - Divide students into four groups, assigning each group one plant and a different growing condition.\n   - Explain that all plants started identical, but each group will provide different materials.\n   - **Group A (Control):** Regular sunlight, air, and water daily.\n   - **Group B:** Water and air, but NO sunlight (dark location).\n   - **Group C:** Sunlight and air, but limited air exchange (sealed bag—water once, then seal).\n   - **Group D:** Sunlight and air, but NO water after initial planting.\n\n2. **Daily Observations (perform over 2 weeks, but introduce the method now):**\n   - Each day, students measure plant height with a ruler, record observations about color, leaf appearance, and soil moisture.\n   - They sketch the plant and note any changes.\n   - Students answer guiding questions on their observation sheet:\n     - \"Is your plant growing? How do you know?\"\n     - \"What has changed since yesterday?\"\n     - \"What materials do you think your plant is using or missing?\"\n\n3. **Connection to the Photograph:**\n   - Display the photograph again and ask: \"The flowers in this garden look healthy and colorful. Based on what we know about the conditions our plants need, what do you think this garden must be providing?\"\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Students create an observation table with columns for Date, Plant Height, Leaf Color, Leaf Appearance, Soil Moisture, and Notes.\n   - Sketch plant appearance at the start and after 1 week.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"What is different about your plant's environment compared to Group A's? What material is missing? Why do you think your plant looks different?\"\n- Do **not** explain outcomes; let students discover through observation.\n- Ensure water is provided or withheld according to the condition.\n- Keep the dark closet truly dark and monitor the sealed bag for condensation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that plants with sunlight, water, and air grow best.\n- Plants without water will wilt.\n- Plants in darkness will become pale/yellow and weak.\n- Plants in sealed bags may show condensation (evidence of water cycling from plant).\n- Students will begin to recognize that multiple materials are needed for plant growth.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect plant requirements to ecosystem matter and energy cycles.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Diagram showing plant structure (roots, stem, leaves, flowers)\n- Ecosystem model (simple diagram showing plant, animal, decomposer, and sun)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Student handout with vocabulary and concept map (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Out from Explore (6 minutes):**\n   - Ask each group: \"What happened to your plant? Which materials did you provide or withhold?\"\n   - Create a class comparison chart showing all four conditions and outcomes.\n   - Highlight the pattern: Plants with sunlight, water, AND air grew best.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Display each term with a visual aid or demonstration:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Photosynthesis:** The process where plants use sunlight, water, and air (carbon dioxide) to make food and energy for growth. *Student-friendly: \"Plants use sunshine, water, and air to make their own food so they can grow big and strong.\"*\n   - **Matter:** Anything that takes up space and has weight; includes air, water, soil, and living things. *\"All the 'stuff' we can see or touch—like water, soil, leaves—and even things we can't see easily, like air.\"*\n   - **Energy:** The ability to do work or make things move and change. Sunlight is an energy source. *\"Sunlight gives plants power to grow, and animals get energy by eating plants.\"*\n   - **Pollinator:** An animal (like a bee, butterfly, or hummingbird) that visits flowers to drink nectar and carries pollen from one flower to another. *\"Helper insects that eat from flowers and help flowers make seeds.\"*\n   - **Ecosystem:** A community of living things and their non-living environment all interacting together. *\"All the plants, animals, and environment in one place working together.\"*\n\n3. **Concept Connection (5 minutes):**\n   - Draw a simple model on the board:\n     - **SUN** → provides energy\n     - **PLANT** (needs: sunlight, water, air) → grows, makes flowers and nectar\n     - **POLLINATOR** (bee, butterfly) → eats nectar, drinks water through the plant\n     - **MATTER CYCLES** → Plant takes water from soil, releases water vapor; takes air; pollinator moves pollen (plant matter) between flowers\n   \n   - Refer back to the photograph: \"The healthy flowers we see were able to get sunlight, water, and air. The bright colors and nectar attract pollinators. The pollinators get food, and the flowers get help spreading their pollen to make seeds. This is how matter and energy move in the ecosystem.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Turn to your neighbor and explain: Where does a plant get the materials it needs to grow? What would happen to the flowers in our photograph if they didn't get water?\"\n   - Listen for student responses; clarify misconceptions (e.g., plants don't \"eat\" from soil; they absorb water and nutrients).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify three main materials plants need: sunlight, water, and air.\n- Students understand that energy from the sun powers plant growth.\n- Students recognize that pollinators and plants have a dependent relationship.\n- Students can construct a simple model showing energy and matter movement in an ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by creating a model of an ecosystem and predicting how changes affect the system.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or poster board (one per pair or small group)\n- Colored pencils, markers, colored paper\n- Scissors\n- Glue sticks\n- Picture cards or printed images of plants, pollinators, sun, soil, water, air\n- Optional: Magazine cutouts or student-drawn illustrations\n- **\"What If\" scenario cards** (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Ecosystem Model Creation (10 minutes):**\n   - Students work in pairs or small groups to create a labeled model of the wildflower garden ecosystem.\n   - Model must include:\n     - **At least 3 plants** (label with names or draw flowers from the photograph)\n     - **At least 2 pollinators** (bee, butterfly, hummingbird, etc.)\n     - **Sun** (showing energy coming in)\n     - **Soil and water** (showing what plants take in)\n     - **Arrows showing the movement of energy and matter** (from sun to plant, from plant to pollinator, etc.)\n   \n   - Encourage students to add labels explaining what each organism needs and what it provides to others.\n\n2. **\"What If\" Scenario Discussion (8 minutes):**\n   - Present scenario cards one at a time. Students discuss in their group and predict outcomes:\n     - *\"What if there is a drought and no rain falls for three months? What happens to the flowers? What happens to the pollinators?\"*\n     - *\"What if we cover the garden with shade cloth so no sunlight reaches the plants? What would happen to growth?\"*\n     - *\"What if we remove all the bees and butterflies from the garden? Can the flowers still survive?\"*\n   \n   - Have students modify their ecosystem model to show the impact of one scenario (e.g., draw wilted flowers if water is gone, show fewer pollinators if there's no food).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"How does this change affect your model? Where does the energy or matter stop flowing?\"\n- Prompt students to justify their predictions using what they learned about plant needs.\n- Encourage detailed labels and clear arrows showing cause and effect.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a labeled ecosystem model showing interdependence.\n- Students can predict and explain how environmental changes affect plants and animals.\n- Students understand that removing any key material (water, sunlight, air) or organism (pollinators) disrupts the ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant materials and ecosystem matter movement.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment (Ongoing):**\n   - Observe student models and discussions for evidence of understanding.\n   - Use a checklist during Elaborate:\n     - ☐ Student identifies three materials plants need (sunlight, water, air).\n     - ☐ Student explains why each material is important.\n     - ☐ Student shows the relationship between plants and pollinators.\n     - ☐ Student uses arrows or labels to show energy/matter movement.\n     - ☐ Student can predict effects of environmental changes.\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Provide each student with a printed exit ticket (or display on screen) with these questions:\n\n   **Exit Ticket Questions:**\n   1. \"Name three materials that plants in the wildflower garden need to grow. Where does each one come from?\" \n   2. \"Draw a simple arrow diagram showing how energy from the sun moves to a plant and then to a pollinator.\"\n   3. \"If the soil in the garden had no water, what would happen to the flowers? Explain why.\"\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n   - **Developing:** Student names 1-2 plant materials; makes an incomplete diagram; explanation is vague.\n   - **Proficient:** Student names all 3 materials and identifies their sources; diagram shows sun → plant → pollinator; explanation mentions plant wilting and loss of pollinator food.\n   - **Advanced:** Student explains how water is transported in the plant; diagram includes decomposers or cycling; explanation discusses ecosystem collapse.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate that plants need sunlight, water, and air for growth.\n- Students create and explain a model of matter and energy movement in an ecosystem.\n- Students understand the interdependence of plants and animals (pollinators) in the garden.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a visual chart with pictures and simple definitions of key terms (plant materials, pollinator, energy) posted in the classroom. Struggling students can reference this during all phases.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Sheets:** Provide sentence frames for recording observations during the plant growth investigation:\n   - \"My plant is _____ tall.\"\n   - \"The leaves look _____.\"\n   - \"I think the plant needs _____ to grow.\"\n\n3. **Partner with Strong Readers:** Pair students who struggle with reading comprehension with strong readers during exit ticket and \"What If\" scenario discussions so they can access the content through oral explanation.\n\n### Challenge\n1. **Extended Research:** Challenge advanced students to research and explain the **specific structures** plants use to obtain each material (roots absorb water and nutrients, leaves capture sunlight, stomata on leaves take in air/CO₂). Have them label a detailed plant diagram.\n\n2. **Decomposer Addition:** Ask students to add a decomposer (fungus, bacteria, earthworm) to their ecosystem model and explain how it returns matter back to the soil for plants to use again. This extends understanding of cycling matter.\n\n3. **Real-World Application:** Have students research a **local pollinator in decline** (e.g., monarch butterflies) and create a presentation on how loss of wildflower gardens affects the pollinator's survival. Connect to ecosystem disruption.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Create a Classroom Pollinator Garden:** If your school has outdoor space, work with students to plant wildflowers in a small garden or containers. Students can maintain it, observe which pollinators visit, and monitor plant health over weeks. This creates a living laboratory for testing hypotheses from the lesson.\n\n2. **Pollinator Observation Journal:** On sunny days, take students outside to observe a garden, park, or green space. Have them sketch and record which insects visit flowers, how long they stay, and what parts of the flower they interact with. Create a class chart of pollinators observed and their behaviors.\n\n3. **Model Refinement Project:** Have students create a **more complex ecosystem model** that includes multiple food chains (e.g., plant → bee → bird; flower seeds → mouse → hawk). Students can use yarn or strings to show energy transfer and create a \"food web\" that demonstrates how many pathways exist for energy and matter movement in an ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
