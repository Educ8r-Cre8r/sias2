  "content": "# NGSS Engineering Design Process Challenge\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n- A backyard koi pond with dark water and visible orange and white koi fish\n- Large, irregularly shaped tan and brown flat stones arranged around the pond's edge\n- White and tan gravel/pebbles filling gaps between stones\n- Living plants (red and yellow flowers, green foliage) surrounding the pond\n- A decorative turtle figurine positioned near the water's edge\n- A concrete pathway visible in the upper left corner\n\n---\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n1. **From stone arrangement**: The flat stones serve as a border/walkway to prevent erosion and provide safe access around the pond without stepping into landscaping or water.\n2. **From water and fish presence**: The pond requires ongoing water circulation and filtration to keep the fish healthy and water clear—suggesting a pump or filtration system exists (not visible but functional).\n3. **From plant placement**: Plants are positioned to provide shade and shelter for the pond ecosystem while adding visual appeal.\n\n---\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n#### **K-2: Build a Safe Stone Path Around a Pond**\nYour job is to design a **path made of stones and small rocks** that keeps people safe and dry when they walk around a pretend pond. The stones should:\n- Be flat and easy to step on\n- Stay in place so they don't slide\n- Keep water out of the garden nearby\n\nUse rocks, pebbles, and a toy pond to build your path. Test it by walking your finger along it. Does it feel safe? Are the rocks loose?\n\n---\n\n#### **3-5: Design a Pond Border System**\nDesign and build a **border system** for a backyard pond that meets these criteria:\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Must prevent soil and mulch from washing into the pond during rain\n- Must be safe for people to walk on without slipping\n- Must allow water to drain away from planted areas\n- Must be built using at least 2 different materials (large flat stones + small gravel/pebbles)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Border stays stable when tested with water flow (simulating rain)\n- At least 3 flat stepping stones in a row, each 6+ inches across\n- Gravel layer is 2+ inches deep and covers gaps\n- Water drains away from the planting area, not pooling\n\n**Measurement**: Track how much water drains away vs. pools over 1 minute.\n\n---\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThe visible ecosystem (pond + plants + erosion risk + safety need) directly shows a real-world problem: *How do we protect a pond environment while keeping it accessible and functional?* This authentic context invites students to identify constraints (drainage, safety, durability) before designing, making the \"Ask\" phase the natural entry point.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Materials\n1. Flat stones or slate tiles (various sizes)\n2. Small gravel, pebbles, or river rocks\n3. Water (for testing drainage and stability)\n4. Soil or potting mix (to simulate landscaping/planting beds)\n5. Shallow tray or container (to represent the pond)\n6. Measuring tape or ruler\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Time\n- **K-2**: 25–35 minutes (design, build, test once)\n- **3-5**: 45–60 minutes (design, build, test multiple times, measure results, adjust)\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.A** (Define design problems that include criteria and constraints) by asking students to balance competing needs—drainage, safety, and ecosystem protection—using visible real-world evidence from the photo.",
