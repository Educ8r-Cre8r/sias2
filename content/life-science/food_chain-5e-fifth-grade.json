ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about soil organisms and decomposition.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the lizard and earthworm in soil (displayed on projector or printed copies)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: actual soil sample in a clear container\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the screen or distribute printed copies to small groups. Ask students to look closely for 30 seconds without talking—just observe.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this photograph? What organisms are living here?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this earthworm is in the soil? What do you think it's doing?\"\n   - \"Have you ever wondered where dead leaves, insects, and other things that fall on the ground go? Where do they disappear to?\"\n   - \"If all the dead plants and animals stayed on Earth and never broke down, what would happen to our planet?\"\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** Display a dead leaf. Say: *\"This leaf has fallen from a tree and landed on the ground. In six months, it will look completely different—maybe it won't even be recognizable. What do you think happens to it? Who or what is responsible for changing it?\"*\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper without correcting them. This activates their prior knowledge and captures misconceptions.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate the hidden workers beneath our feet—the organisms that do the important job of breaking down dead things and recycling materials so that new plants can grow.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate decomposition and the role of soil organisms through a hands-on decomposition observation activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic cups or jars (2-3 per group of 3-4 students)\n- Soil (enough to fill cups halfway)\n- Dead leaves, grass clippings, food scraps (apple peels, vegetable scraps—no meat)\n- Water spray bottle or measuring cup\n- Magnifying glasses\n- Observation worksheets (provided below)\n- Paper towels\n- Optional: live earthworms (1-2 per cup, if available and ethically sourced)\n- Labels and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Layer your decomposition cup:** Fill each cup with soil about halfway. Add a layer of dead leaves and grass clippings (about 1 inch). Add food scraps (small pieces). Cover with another inch of soil.\n\n2. **Observe closely:** Use a magnifying glass to look at the soil before sealing. Record:\n   - What organisms do you see? (earthworms, millipedes, insects, etc.)\n   - What does the soil look like?\n   - What does the organic material look like?\n\n3. **Create the right conditions:** Lightly spray the soil with water so it's moist like a garden (not soggy). Seal the cup loosely with plastic wrap or a lid with holes poked in it for air circulation.\n\n4. **Make predictions:** Before you put your cup away, predict:\n   - What do you think will happen to the leaves and food scraps over the next week?\n   - What organisms do you think will help break down this material?\n   - What will the soil look like in one week? Two weeks?\n\n5. **Record observations** in your observation worksheet. You'll observe these cups over the next 1-2 weeks, recording changes every 2-3 days.\n\n6. **Optional—Live Earthworm Investigation:** If live earthworms are available, place 1-2 in a separate cup with the same setup. Observe how the earthworm moves through the soil and interacts with the organic material. Discuss: Why might earthworms be important decomposers?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: *\"What do you notice about the soil? What's happening to the leaves? Why do you think organisms are important in this process?\"*\n- Do **not** give the answer about decomposition—guide students to discover it.\n- Help students handle materials safely, especially if using live organisms.\n- Ensure cups are placed in a safe, warm location (not in direct sunlight or cold).\n- Remind students that live organisms should be treated with respect and care.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe visible changes in decomposing material over time (material breaking apart, darkening, changing texture).\n- Students will identify soil organisms and hypothesize their roles.\n- Students will record detailed observations and predictions that will later be explained scientifically.\n- Students will begin to understand that something \"happens\" to dead matter in soil, and organisms are involved.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after students have observed decomposition.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph from the ENGAGE phase\n- Observation data from student cups (if visible changes are apparent)\n- Digital presentation, poster, or read-aloud about decomposers and nutrient cycling\n- Diagram of nutrient cycle (see vocabulary section)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** Ask 3-4 groups to share what they observed in their decomposition cups.\n   - *\"What changes did you notice?\"*\n   - *\"What do you think caused these changes?\"*\n   - *\"Which organisms did you see, and what were they doing?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions written on chart paper:\n\n   **Decomposers:** Living things (like earthworms, millipedes, beetles, and fungi) that break down dead plants and animals into smaller and smaller pieces. They eat the dead material and help it become part of the soil again.\n\n   **Decomposition:** The process of breaking down dead organisms and waste materials into simpler materials that can be used again by plants and other living things.\n\n   **Nutrients:** Special materials that living things need to grow and stay healthy. Plants get nutrients from soil and water. Animals get nutrients from the food they eat.\n\n   **Nutrient Cycle:** The never-ending path that materials (nutrients, water, carbon) take as they move from the environment to plants, to animals, to decomposers, and back to the environment again.\n\n   **Organic Matter:** Dead plant and animal material, such as fallen leaves, dead insects, and food scraps.\n\n3. **Make Connections Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Point to the earthworm in the soil image. *\"This earthworm is a decomposer. Its job is to tunnel through soil, eat dead plants and organic matter, and break it down into pieces so small that plants can absorb it as nutrients.\"*\n   - *\"The dead leaves and roots around the earthworm in this soil are organic matter waiting to be decomposed.\"*\n\n4. **Explain the Nutrient Cycle Simply:**\n   - Create a circular diagram on the board showing:\n     1. Plants grow in soil (using nutrients from decomposed matter + water + air)\n     2. Animals eat plants\n     3. Plants and animals die\n     4. Decomposers break down the dead material\n     5. Nutrients return to soil → plants grow again (cycle repeats)\n   - *\"This cycle never stops! It's how Earth recycles materials so nothing is wasted.\"*\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask comprehension questions:\n     - *\"If we had no decomposers, what would happen to all the dead leaves that fall?\"*\n     - *\"Where do plants get the nutrients they need to grow big and strong?\"* (Answer: from soil nutrients created by decomposers, plus water and air)\n     - *\"Can you name one decomposer you've learned about?\"*\n   - Have students turn and talk to a partner: *\"Why do you think earthworms are called 'underground heroes'?\"*\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Decomposers:** Living organisms (earthworms, fungi, millipedes, beetles) that break down dead matter\n- **Decomposition:** The process of breaking down dead organisms into simpler materials\n- **Nutrients:** Materials that living things need to grow and survive\n- **Nutrient Cycle:** The continuous movement of materials between the environment, plants, animals, and decomposers\n- **Organic Matter:** Dead plant and animal material\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define decomposers and explain their role in breaking down dead matter.\n- Students understand that decomposition returns nutrients to soil.\n- Students can describe a simple nutrient cycle.\n- Students recognize that the earthworm in the photograph is performing a vital ecological function.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by creating a nutrient cycle model and exploring real-world decomposition scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster board or chart paper (one per group)\n- Markers, colored pencils, or colored paper\n- Scissors and glue\n- Images of organisms (plants, animals, decomposers) – printed or drawn by students\n- Index cards for labels\n- Real soil sample, compost, or finished compost from a garden (if available)\n- Optional: video clip (2-3 min) of decomposition time-lapse or earthworm habitat\n\n**Activity Option 1: Nutrient Cycle Model (Group Project)**\n\n1. **Assign groups of 3-4 students.** Each group creates a visual model of the nutrient cycle.\n\n2. **Model Requirements:**\n   - Show at least three parts: plants, animals, and decomposers\n   - Use arrows to show how matter moves between each part\n   - Include soil and the environment\n   - Label each part and use color to make it clear and attractive\n\n3. **Student Process:**\n   - Groups sketch and plan their cycle on scrap paper first\n   - Then create final poster using markers, colored paper, or images\n   - Write a caption explaining each step of the cycle\n\n4. **Gallery Walk:** Post finished models around the room. Students do a silent gallery walk and place sticky notes on models with one thing they learned or one question they have.\n\n**Activity Option 2: Decomposer Detective (Real-World Application)**\n\n1. **Present a scenario:** *\"Your grandmother has a garden where she grows tomatoes. The tomatoes are growing beautifully in her rich, dark soil. But years ago, that same spot was bare, rocky ground. What changed? How did the soil become rich and dark?\"*\n\n2. **Investigation:** Show students samples of:\n   - Fresh compost (partially decomposed)\n   - Finished compost (dark, crumbly, nutrient-rich)\n   - Raw soil from the garden\n   - Ask: *\"What decomposers worked to transform the raw compost into finished compost? How long might that take?\"*\n\n3. **Application:** Students write or draw to explain:\n   - Where do the nutrients in garden soil come from?\n   - What role did decomposers play?\n   - Why is compost \"black gold\" for gardeners?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group work by asking questions that guide thinking: *\"What do you think happens after the animal dies? Who takes over?\"*\n- Challenge students: *\"If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around, does it still decompose? How do you know?\"*\n- Validate student thinking and push them toward deeper understanding of the cycle's continuous nature.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create an accurate visual or written model of the nutrient cycle.\n- Students can apply nutrient cycle concepts to real-world scenarios (gardens, compost, forest floors).\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding that decomposition is continuous, essential, and connects all living things.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of decomposers and nutrient cycling through formative and summative assessment.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** During EXPLORE and ELABORATE phases, use a checklist to observe whether students:\n  - Make detailed observations of decomposing material\n  - Ask questions about decomposer roles\n  - Identify organisms correctly\n  - Use vocabulary appropriately (decomposer, decomposition, nutrient, cycle)\n\n- **Turn-and-Talk Responses:** Listen to partner discussions during the EXPLAIN phase to gauge comprehension of key concepts.\n\n- **Vocabulary Checks:** During the EXPLAIN phase, ask individual students to define key terms in their own words.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 2)**\n\n**Provide each student with an Exit Ticket containing these prompts:**\n\n1. **Draw or describe:** What happens to a dead leaf after it falls on the ground?\n\n2. **Answer these questions:**\n   - Who are the decomposers in an ecosystem? Name one.\n   - Why are decomposers important?\n   - Where do plants get the nutrients they need to grow?\n\n3. **Support Your Argument (with evidence):**\n   - Write one sentence explaining why decomposers are \"underground heroes.\" Use evidence from what you observed or learned.\n\n**Example Strong Response:**\n*\"Decomposers are underground heroes because they break down dead plants and animals and turn them into nutrients that go back into the soil. Without decomposers, the nutrients would stay locked up in dead things and plants couldn't get what they need to grow. I saw earthworms in the soil breaking down leaves in my decomposition cup.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery if they:\n- ✓ Identify at least one decomposer and describe its role\n- ✓ Explain that decomposers break down dead matter into nutrients\n- ✓ Connect decomposition to plant growth and nutrient cycling\n- ✓ Provide evidence from observations or the lesson to support their thinking\n- ✓ Use appropriate vocabulary (decomposer, nutrients, cycle, organic matter)\n\n**Scoring Rubric (Simple 4-Point Scale):**\n- **4 (Advanced):** Explains nutrient cycle with detail; identifies multiple decomposers; supports argument with clear evidence\n- **3 (Proficient):** Identifies decomposers and their basic role; explains simple nutrient cycle; mentions evidence\n- **2 (Developing):** Identifies a decomposer; limited explanation of its role; incomplete nutrient cycle understanding\n- **1 (Beginning):** Minimal understanding of decomposers or their role; no evidence of nutrient cycle understanding\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that decomposers break down dead matter into nutrients plants need.\n- Students can describe or model a nutrient cycle.\n- Students provide evidence-based arguments about the importance of decomposers.\n- Students transition from observational thinking to conceptual understanding of ecosystem function.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary and Sentence Frames:**\n   - Provide pre-written sentence frames for exit tickets:\n     - *\"Decomposers are _____ that break down _____.\"*\n     - *\"Nutrients come from _____ and go to _____.\"*\n   - Use visual vocabulary cards with pictures and simple definitions to reference during lessons.\n\n2. **Buddy System for EXPLORE Phase:**\n   - Pair struggling students with strong observers during the decomposition cup activity.\n   - Provide a simplified observation sheet with labeled drawings and yes/no/sometimes questions instead of open-ended prompts.\n\n3. **Pre-Teaching and Reduced Complexity in Models:**\n   - Before ELABORATE, meet with small group to preview nutrient cycle using a simplified 3-step cycle (dead matter → decomposer → soil nutrients).\n   - Provide pre-drawn cycle diagram templates to fill in rather than requiring creation from scratch.\n   - Reduce the number of organisms required in models to three key ones (plant, animal, decomposer).\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper Nutrient Cycle Exploration:**\n   - Introduce the carbon cycle or water cycle as extensions of the nutrient cycle.\n   - Challenge: *\"Decomposers break down matter into nutrients, but what happens to those nutrients after plants absorb them? Trace what happens to one carbon atom from a dead leaf through the full cycle.\"*\n   - Have students research and present on specialized decomposers (fungi, bacteria, wood-eating insects) and their unique roles.\n\n2. **Real-World Problem-Solving:**\n   - Propose a scenario: *\"A city wants to reduce the waste sent to landfills. How could they use decomposers and nutrient cycling to solve this problem?\"*\n   - Have students design a home composting system or school compost bin and explain how decomposers would work in their design.\n   - Research and present on municipal composting programs or how restaurants use composting.\n\n3. **Extended Investigation:**\n   - Create a long-term decomposition study (2-4 weeks) with multiple variables: Does temperature affect decomposition speed? Does moisture? Does the type of material matter?\n   - Have students predict, test, measure, and graph their findings.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Class Compost Bin Project:**\n   - Start a small compost bin in the classroom or school garden.\n   - Students take turns adding organic waste (plant scraps, shredded paper), monitoring moisture and temperature, and documenting decomposition over weeks.\n   - Finished compost can be used to enrich a school garden bed. This extends the cycle to a real, visible outcome and deepens understanding of decomposition timelines and conditions.\n\n2. **Local Soil and Ecosystem Investigation:**\n   - Take students on a nature walk to observe decomposition in real soil (forest floor, garden, park).\n   - Have students collect soil samples from different locations and observe decomposers using magnifying glasses.\n   - Compare soil from different habitats: Which has more decomposers and organic matter? Why?\n   - Create a class poster showing the variety of decomposers found in local soil.\n\n3. **Decomposer Life Cycle Research and Presentation:**\n   - Assign small groups a specific decomposer (earthworms, millipedes, fungi, beetles, pillbugs).\n   - Students research and create a poster or digital presentation about:\n     - What the organism eats\n     - Where it lives\n     - How it helps the ecosystem\n     - Interesting adaptations it has for decomposition\n   - Groups present findings to the class, creating a comprehensive \"Who's Who\" of local decomposers.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes for Teachers\n\n**Safety Reminders:**\n- If using live earthworms, source them ethically (classroom worm suppliers or collected gently from soil).\n- Remind students to wash hands after handling soil and organisms.\n- Ensure decomposition cups remain moist but not soggy to prevent mold growth that poses respiratory risks.\n- After the investigation, return earthworms to an appropriate outdoor habitat or school garden.\n\n**Timing Flexibility:**\n- If decomposition changes aren't visible in the first week, extend observations into week two.\n- Alternatively, prepare a \"head start\" decomposition cup before the lesson begins so students can observe more advanced stages if time is limited.\n\n**Connection to Real Life:**\n- Invite a local gardener, soil scientist, or composting program manager to speak to the class.\n- Visit a municipal composting facility or school garden if possible.\n- Have students interview family members about composting or gardening practices related to soil health.\n\nThis 5E lesson transforms a simple photograph of a soil organism into deep, lasting understanding of ecosystem function and the vital role decomposers play in supporting all life on Earth.",
