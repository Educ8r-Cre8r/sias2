ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the mourning dove photograph (display size: 11\" × 14\" or larger, OR digital projection)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: binoculars or magnifying glasses (to create excitement)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Do NOT explain what students are looking at. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** in this sequence:\n   - *\"What do you see in this picture? Tell me everything you notice.\"* (Pause for multiple responses; students may say: bird, plants, dirt, pot, flowers, rocks.)\n   - *\"Where do you think this picture was taken? How do you know?\"* (Guide them to recognize it's a garden or outdoor space.)\n   - *\"What living things can you find? What is not living?\"* (Separate organisms from non-living objects.)\n   - *\"If you were this little bird, would this be a good home? What does it have that the bird might need?\"* (Elicit ideas about shelter, food sources, water.)\n\n3. **Record student responses** on chart paper under the heading \"What We Wonder About Garden Habitats.\"\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** *\"I wonder if a bird, a bee, and a plant could all live happily in this same garden. Let's explore and find out!\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Now we're going to become garden detectives and explore what we can find in a real garden habitat.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **For classroom garden visit (preferred):** Clipboards, pencils, hand lenses (1 per pair), small collection containers (paper cups), field guides or plant/insect identification cards\n- **For indoor alternative:** Pre-collected garden materials in labeled containers (soil samples, leaves, flower petals, small rocks, seeds, twigs), hand lenses, observation sheets (printed template)\n- A-frame or outdoor observation area (if garden visit is possible)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1:** Divide students into pairs. Provide each pair with a clipboard and **Habitat Observation Sheet** (see below template):\n\n---\n\n**HABITAT OBSERVATION SHEET**\n*Names: _________________ & _________________*\n\n**What plants do you see?** (Draw or list)\n□ Flowers  □ Grass  □ Bushes  □ Herbs\nOther: _______________________\n\n**What animals do you see or find?** (Draw or list)\n□ Insects  □ Birds  □ Worms  □ Bugs\nOther: _______________________\n\n**What does the ground look like?** (Check one)\n□ Wet  □ Dry  □ Dark soil  □ Rocky\n\n**What else helps animals live here?**\n□ Hiding spots  □ Water  □ Food  □ Shade\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 (Garden Visit):** If possible, take students to the school garden or outdoor area. Instruct pairs to:\n- Use hand lenses to closely examine 2–3 plants\n- Listen for sounds of animals\n- Look under leaves, around stems, and in the soil\n- Gently move aside a small section of mulch or leaf litter to observe what lives underneath\n- Sketch or note what they find on their observation sheet\n- **Do NOT disturb habitats significantly; only look and observe.**\n\n**Step 2 (Indoor Alternative):** Provide pre-collected garden materials in labeled containers. Students:\n- Use hand lenses to examine each item\n- Sort items by \"living\" vs. \"not living\"\n- Sketch 2–3 observations on their sheet\n- Predict what animal might use each plant or object\n\n**Step 3:** After 15 minutes, gather students in a circle. Ask each pair to share ONE thing they found. Record on chart paper under \"Garden Discoveries.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate with students. Ask guiding questions: *\"What do you think this plant needs to grow?\"* *\"Do you see any animals hiding here?\"*\n- Avoid confirming/correcting observations yet; accept all findings.\n- Model respectful observation: handle plants gently, replace mulch, avoid stepping on organisms.\n- Encourage use of hand lenses to discover small organisms (ants, beetles, spiders).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students document observations of multiple plants and at least 2–3 animals or animal evidence (burrows, droppings, webs).\n- Students recognize that gardens contain living and non-living things.\n- Students develop a preliminary understanding that animals and plants are found together in this space.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with \"Garden Discoveries\" from Explore phase\n- Habitat poster or diagram (create beforehand or use a simple hand-drawn illustration showing a garden with labels)\n- Vocabulary cards with images (printed or hand-drawn, 8.5\" × 11\")\n- The original mourning dove photograph (redisplay)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Revisit the photograph.** *\"Now we know more about gardens. Let's look at this picture again and find what we discovered.\"* Point to visible elements: the plants, the bird, the soil.\n\n2. **Share discoveries.** Ask: *\"What did your group find in the garden? Which of these things did we find are in THIS picture too?\"* Create connections between their discoveries and the photograph.\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary** using student-friendly definitions and visual support:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Habitat** | The place where a plant or animal lives. It has everything the living thing needs to survive. |\n| **Shelter** | A safe, protected place where an animal can hide, rest, or raise babies (example: under a plant, in a hole). |\n| **Food source** | Plants or other living things that an animal eats to stay healthy and strong. |\n| **Community** | All the plants and animals living together in the same habitat. |\n| **Diversity** | Many different types of living things in one place. |\n\n4. **Point to vocabulary card images** that show each concept. Examples:\n   - **Habitat:** Image of a garden or pond\n   - **Shelter:** Image of a bird under leaves or in a bush\n   - **Food source:** Image of seeds, berries, or insects\n   - **Community:** Image of multiple animals and plants together\n   - **Diversity:** Image showing different colors, shapes, sizes of organisms\n\n5. **Check for understanding** using a quick response activity:\n   - *\"If I point to a plant in our habitat, point to a body part. Which part gives it shelter?\"* (Students point to under leaves or roots.)\n   - *\"Show me with your hands—is a bird's habitat big or small?\"* (Students respond with gesture; clarify that habitats can be different sizes.)\n   - *\"Is a worm part of a garden community? How do you know?\"* (Yes; it lives in the soil and eats dead plants.)\n\n6. **Reinforce connection:** *\"The dove in this picture has a habitat—the garden! It has food (seeds from plants), shelter (the bushes), and other creatures around it. That's why it chose this place to live.\"*\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Habitat:** The place where a plant or animal lives and finds everything it needs\n- **Shelter:** A safe, protected space where an animal can hide or rest\n- **Food source:** Something a living thing eats to survive\n- **Community:** All the plants and animals living together in one place\n- **Diversity:** Many different kinds of living things in the same area\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use the word \"habitat\" to describe where animals and plants live.\n- Students can name at least 3 things an animal needs in its habitat (food, water, shelter, space).\n- Students connect their observations to the vocabulary and the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large poster board (1 per small group)\n- Markers, colored pencils, crayons\n- Pre-printed images of garden animals (dove, bee, earthworm, ladybug, butterfly) and plants (herb, flower, grass, shrub) – OR students draw their own\n- Scissors and glue sticks\n- Optional: picture books showing different habitats (rainforest, desert, forest, ocean) with images of those habitats\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Design Task:**\n\nOrganize students into small groups (3–4 students). Present this scenario:\n\n*\"A dove, a bee, and an earthworm all want to move into the school garden. BUT first, they need to make sure the garden has everything they need. Your job is to CREATE A HABITAT PLAN for the garden to keep all three animals happy and healthy.\"*\n\n**Step 1:** Each group receives a large sheet of paper labeled \"Our Garden Habitat Plan.\" \n\n**Step 2:** Students cut out (or draw) images of:\n- The three animals (dove, bee, earthworm)\n- Plants and other features that each animal needs (seeds, flowers, shelter, water, soil)\n\n**Step 3:** Students glue/draw these onto their poster to create a labeled diagram showing:\n- Where the dove would hide (shelter)\n- Where the bee would find flowers (food)\n- Where the earthworm would live (soil/shelter)\n- Other features that help all three (water, varied plants)\n\n**Step 4:** Groups add labels or simple sentences explaining WHY they placed each item:\n- *\"We put flowers here because bees need nectar.\"*\n- *\"We have bushes for the dove to hide and make a nest.\"*\n- *\"Dark soil is where earthworms live.\"*\n\n**Step 5 (Optional Challenge):** Show images of other habitats (forest, desert, ocean). Ask: *\"Would the dove, bee, and earthworm be happy in a desert? Why or why not?\"* (This introduces the concept that different habitats support different communities.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between groups. Ask probing questions: *\"What does this animal eat?\"* *\"Where would it sleep?\"*\n- Help students think about WHY each animal needs specific features (not just WHERE to place them).\n- Encourage groups to explain their choices to each other.\n- Provide sentence starters: *\"We put ___ here because ___.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation of a habitat that meets the needs of multiple animals.\n- Students articulate reasons for placement (connecting to animal needs).\n- Students demonstrate understanding that different organisms within a habitat depend on different resources.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitats and the diversity of life.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation notes:** During Explore, note which students correctly identify plants vs. animals, use hand lenses safely, and make detailed observations.\n- **Vocabulary checks:** During Explain, listen for students using words like \"habitat,\" \"shelter,\" and \"community\" correctly.\n- **Group discussion:** During Elaborate, listen to group conversations to determine if students understand animal needs.\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket):**\n\nPrint or write on the board the following three questions. Students may draw, write, or dictate responses:\n\n---\n\n**HABITAT EXIT TICKET**\n\n**Name: _________________ Date: _________________**\n\n**1. What is a habitat?**\n□ A place where animals live\n□ A place where plants grow\n□ A place where plants AND animals live together\n✓ *Correct answer: All three, but especially the last one!*\n\n**2. Draw or write: What do animals need to live in a habitat?**\n(Look for: food, water, shelter, safe space—at least 2)\n\n**3. The dove in the picture lives in a garden. Name ONE plant or thing in that garden that helps the dove.**\n(Acceptable answers: bushes for shelter, seeds for food, soil, etc.)\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Students meet expectations if they:**\n1. Correctly identify at least 2 elements a habitat must have (shelter, food, water, or safe space).\n2. Name at least one plant or feature visible in the photograph and explain how it helps the dove.\n3. Use the word \"habitat\" appropriately to describe the garden.\n4. Show evidence of observing and comparing multiple living things in the habitat.\n\n✓ **Advanced students (exceeding expectations) may:**\n1. Explain why different animals need different habitats.\n2. Predict what would happen if a key plant (like the herb) was removed.\n3. Compare the garden habitat to another habitat they know about (forest, pond, desert).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary** with picture-heavy cards the day before. Use consistent repetition and physical gestures (e.g., crouch down to show \"shelter,\" mime eating for \"food source\").\n\n2. **Pair with strong language model.** During Explore, pair students who need support with more fluent speakers. Assign one student the role of \"recorder\" (drawing) and the other the role of \"finder\" (pointing out organisms).\n\n3. **Provide a word bank** on their Observation Sheet with checkboxes instead of requiring independent writing. Example:\n   - □ Flowers\n   - □ Grass\n   - □ Bugs\n   - □ Dark soil\n\n4. **Simplify the Elaborate task.** Instead of creating a plan, students sort pre-printed pictures into \"Things the bird needs\" vs. \"Things the bee needs\" on a two-column chart.\n\n5. **Use visual supports throughout.** Display the habitat vocabulary cards during all discussions and activities so students can point to visuals instead of relying solely on words.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deepen observation.** Provide hand lenses and challenge students to find the SMALLEST living thing in the habitat, or to count how many different types of plants they can identify. Introduce simple classification (plants with flowers vs. without, insects vs. other animals).\n\n2. **Comparative habitats.** Provide images of 2–3 different habitats (garden, forest, pond). Ask: *\"Which habitat would the dove prefer? Why?\"* and *\"What animals might live in a forest that don't live in a garden?\"*\n\n3. **Food web introduction.** For Elaborate, challenge students to draw arrows showing what eats what: *\"The dove eats seeds. Where do seeds come from? What eats the dove?\"* (Introduce basic food chains: plant → insect → bird.)\n\n4. **Design a new habitat.** Instead of planning an existing garden, ask advanced students to: *\"Design a habitat for THREE animals that have never met before. What would you need? Draw it and label it.\"* (Encourages systems thinking and application.)\n\n5. **Habitat requirements research.** Provide a simple fact sheet about mourning doves (3–4 sentences). Ask: *\"Does this garden have everything a real dove needs?\"* (Connects to research and critical thinking.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Habitat in a Jar\" Terrarium Project**\n   - Over 1–2 weeks, students build a small terrarium in a clear jar using soil, seeds, small plants, rocks, and water.\n   - They observe and sketch changes daily, recording whether their \"mini habitat\" supports living things.\n   - *Connects to:* 2-LS2-1 (investigating plant growth needs) and deeper understanding of habitat requirements.\n\n2. **Animal Habitat Research Posters**\n   - Assign each student or pair a different animal (bee, earthworm, bird, butterfly, ladybug).\n   - Using books and pictures, students create a poster showing: \"Where does [animal] live?\" and \"What does [animal] need?\"\n   - Display posters around the room and compare habitats (introduces diversity of habitats).\n   - *Connects to:* 2-LS4-1 (comparing diversity across habitats).\n\n3. **\"Habitat Changes\" Dramatic Play**\n   - In a designated garden area, students role-play as different animals and plants.\n   - Introduce scenarios: *\"What happens if the sun disappears for a week?\"* or *\"What if all the flowers are picked?\"*\n   - Students discuss and demonstrate how habitat changes affect animals.\n   - *Connects to:* Understanding cause-and-effect in ecosystems and deepening habitat knowledge.\n\n4. **Community Walk and Habitat Mapping**\n   - Take students on a nature walk around the school campus (garden, playground, near trees).\n   - At each stop, mark it on a simple map and list the animals and plants seen there.\n   - Create a \"Habitats Around Our School\" poster showing all the different places where living things thrive.\n   - *Connects to:* 2-LS4-1 (comparing diversity in different habitats).\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **If a school garden is unavailable,** this lesson works equally well with a designated outdoor patch, potted plants and containers in the classroom, or even detailed photographs of gardens (local parks, botanical gardens).\n- **Time flexibility:** The Explore phase can be extended if students are highly engaged; compress Explain if needed.\n- **Safety reminder:** Ensure students wash hands after outdoor exploration and never taste plants or pick flowers without permission.\n- **Documentation:** Take photos of student work (Elaborate posters and Exit Tickets) for portfolios and parent communication.\n\n---\n\n**Happy teaching! This lesson builds critical observation skills, vocabulary, and an appreciation for how living things depend on each other in shared spaces.**",
