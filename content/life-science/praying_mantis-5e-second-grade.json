Make detailed observations of a praying mantis (or photographs/videos) and identify its unique body parts and physical features.\n2. Compare how the praying mantis is different from and similar to other insects and animals.\n3. Explain how the praying mantis's special body parts help it survive in garden habitats.\n4. Describe why gardens are important habitats that support many different kinds of animals and plants.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the praying mantis and activate prior knowledge about insects and habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the praying mantis photograph (large and clear on screen or printed poster)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student observation journals or paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the interactive board or as a large printed image. Do not explain what the insect is yet. Let the image remain visible for 10-15 seconds of silent looking.\n\n2. **Pose discovery questions** to spark wonder (calibrated for Grade 2):\n   - \"What do you notice about this creature? Describe what you see.\"\n   - \"What parts of its body look different or unusual compared to other bugs you've seen?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this insect's color is green? What might that help it do?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this animal lives? What clues in the picture tell you?\"\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder prompt:** \"This insect is called a praying mantis. Why do you think someone might have given it that name? What do you wonder about how it lives in the garden?\"\n\n4. **Record student observations** on chart paper as they share. Highlight observations about body parts, color, and where the mantis is positioned.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be insect detectives and learn all about this amazing garden hunter. Let's explore how the praying mantis's special body parts help it survive in its habitat.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the praying mantis's adaptations and its role in a garden habitat through hands-on exploration and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Live praying mantis (in a clear container with air holes) OR high-quality photos/video clips of mantises\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (one per pair of students)\n- Pre-drawn \"Mantis Body Parts\" observation sheet with labeled diagram (head, eyes, front legs, middle legs, back legs, abdomen)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Small objects to observe: stick, leaf, flower petal\n- Chart: \"What Animals Live in Gardens?\" (pre-made)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**If using a live mantis:**\n1. Divide students into pairs. Explain that they will observe the mantis carefully and respectfully without touching it.\n2. Distribute hand lenses and observation sheets.\n3. Direct students to: \"Look at the mantis's head. What shape is it? Look at its eyes—how many do you see? Where are they looking?\" (Students draw and label what they observe.)\n4. Continue: \"Now look at the front legs. What do they look like? How are they different from the other legs?\" (Students notice the folded, raptorial position.)\n5. Have pairs compare: \"How many legs does the mantis have? Are they all the same size?\" (Students count and note the three pairs of legs with different sizes and functions.)\n6. Ask: \"What color is the mantis? Why might being green help it in a garden?\" (Students make predictions about camouflage.)\n\n**Alternative (if live specimen unavailable):**\n1. Display a high-quality close-up photograph or short video of a mantis.\n2. Pause the video at key moments and have students observe specific body parts.\n3. Use the same observation sheet and guide students through the same questions.\n4. Show a short clip of a mantis hunting to illustrate how its body parts work together.\n\n**Garden habitat exploration:**\n1. Show the original photograph again and have students identify: \"What plants do you see? What other animals might live here?\" (bee, butterfly, flower—visible or inferred)\n2. Distribute the pre-made \"What Animals Live in Gardens?\" chart and have students brainstorm together: \"Name animals that live in or visit gardens.\" Record their responses.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Ask guiding questions without giving answers: \"What do you notice? How is that part helpful? Where would it use that?\"\n- Use student observations to introduce functional connections: \"You noticed the front legs are folded—what might the mantis use those for?\"\n- Encourage careful observation and respectful behavior around the live specimen.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify and label key body parts (head, eyes, legs, abdomen).\n- Students observe that the mantis is green and relates this to its environment.\n- Students generate a list of animals and plants that share the garden habitat.\n- Students make initial inferences about how body parts are useful for survival.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and clarify concepts about animal adaptations and habitats using the exploration data.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with photographs of mantis body parts (labeled)\n- Vocabulary cards with images\n- Picture cards showing different habitats (garden, forest, desert, pond)\n- Student science journals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations from Explore phase:**\n   - Ask volunteers to share one thing they observed about the mantis's body.\n   - Create a class \"Praying Mantis Feature Chart\" on large paper, listing all observed parts and their descriptions.\n\n2. **Introduce and define key vocabulary** (write each on a chart with a picture):\n\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its habitat. Example: \"The mantis's green color is an adaptation that helps it hide in plants.\"\n   - **Camouflage:** When an animal's color or shape helps it blend in with its surroundings so other animals don't see it. Example: \"The mantis uses camouflage to hide from insects it wants to catch.\"\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives that has the food, water, shelter, and space it needs. Example: \"A garden is a habitat for the praying mantis.\"\n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts other animals for food. Example: \"The praying mantis is a predator of smaller insects.\"\n   - **Diversity:** The variety of different plants and animals living in one place. Example: \"Gardens have diversity because many different organisms live there together.\"\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph and Explore activity:**\n   - Point to the original photograph: \"Look at the praying mantis in this garden. Its green color is an **adaptation** that works like **camouflage**—it blends in with the flower stems and leaves. This helps the mantis hide while it hunts. The garden is its **habitat**.\"\n   - Reference student observations: \"Remember when you noticed the folded front legs? Those are adapted for grabbing insects. The mantis is a **predator**—it catches other insects to eat.\"\n   - Connect to garden list: \"The garden has **diversity**—it's home to flowers, bees, butterflies, and the mantis. All these living things share the same space.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we moved a green praying mantis to a white snowfield, would its camouflage still help it hide? Why or why not?\" (Students explain that color adaptation works only in certain habitats.)\n   - Ask: \"Is a praying mantis a predator or prey?\" (Guide students to understand it is a predator of small insects, but could be prey for birds.)\n   - Show picture cards of different habitats and ask: \"Which of these habitats would be a good home for a praying mantis? Why?\" (Students justify answers using habitat and adaptation concepts.)\n\n**Vocabulary List:**\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part or way of behaving that helps an animal live in its environment.\n- **Camouflage:** Colors or patterns that make an animal hard to see because it matches its surroundings.\n- **Habitat:** The home of an animal—the place that has everything it needs to live.\n- **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals.\n- **Diversity:** Many different kinds of animals and plants living together in one place.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand and use vocabulary terms correctly in simple sentences.\n- Students can explain how the mantis's body parts are adaptations for hunting.\n- Students connect the mantis's camouflage to its specific garden habitat.\n- Students recognize that gardens support many different organisms (diversity).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by comparing the praying mantis to other garden animals and exploring habitat diversity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of garden animals (bee, butterfly, spider, ladybug, earthworm, bird, rabbit)\n- \"Compare and Contrast\" chart (template with two columns)\n- Large paper for creating a \"Garden Habitat Map\"\n- Colored pencils, markers\n- Optional: short video clip showing a mantis hunting or other garden insects\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option 1: Animal Comparison Activity**\n1. Show picture cards of different garden animals (bee, butterfly, spider, etc.).\n2. Distribute one animal card per pair or small group.\n3. Direct students: \"Compare your animal to the praying mantis. How are they the same? How are they different?\" (Use a simple two-column chart.)\n4. Focus comparisons on:\n   - Body parts (legs, eyes, wings, etc.)\n   - What they eat\n   - How they move\n   - How they hide or survive\n5. Have pairs share their comparisons with the class. Record key differences and similarities on a class chart.\n6. Conclude: \"Even though all these animals live in gardens, they have different adaptations. Some have wings, some have different numbers of legs. These differences help each animal survive in its own way.\"\n\n**Option 2: Garden Habitat Map Activity**\n1. Provide large paper and ask students to draw a garden scene with multiple plants and animals.\n2. Direct: \"Draw the garden habitat. Include the praying mantis, at least three other animals, and several plants. Label or write about how each animal is adapted to live there.\"\n3. As students work, ask: \"Why did you put the mantis on that leaf? Is that a good place for it to hide? What other animals might visit the flowers?\"\n4. Display completed maps and discuss the diversity they show.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussions without correcting students' first attempts—encourage refinement through questioning.\n- Ask: \"What would happen to the praying mantis if all the plants disappeared from the garden?\" (Students think about how habitats provide necessary resources.)\n- Encourage students to make connections: \"You said the bee pollinates flowers—does that help the mantis? How are all the garden animals connected?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify similarities and differences between the mantis and other garden animals.\n- Students recognize that different animals have different adaptations suited to their roles in the habitat.\n- Students create a visual representation of habitat diversity and relationships.\n- Students deepen understanding that habitats support multiple, interdependent organisms.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of praying mantis adaptations, habitats, and garden diversity.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- Observe student observations and sketches during the Explore phase for accuracy and detail.\n- Listen to student responses during Explain phase to check vocabulary use and concept understanding.\n- Review Compare-and-Contrast charts or habitat maps for evidence of adaptation and habitat thinking.\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (written or verbal, depending on reading level). Ask students to respond to 2-3 of the following prompts:\n\n1. **Draw and label** the praying mantis's three most important body parts. Write one sentence about how each part helps it survive.\n\n2. **Complete this sentence:** \"The praying mantis is a good hunter in the garden because ________________ (its color/shape/legs help it by________________).\"\n\n3. **True or False and Explain:**\n   - A praying mantis would be a good predator in a white, snowy place. Why or why not?\n   - Gardens are good habitats because they have only one kind of animal. True or false? Explain.\n\n4. **Quick write:** \"Name two animals that live in gardens. Tell how they are different from the praying mantis.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies and labels at least two body parts and explains their function.\n- ✓ Student uses the word \"adaptation\" or \"camouflage\" correctly when explaining why the mantis is successful.\n- ✓ Student recognizes that the mantis's green color helps it in a garden habitat (connection between adaptation and habitat).\n- ✓ Student can name at least two other garden animals and describe a difference from the mantis.\n- ✓ Student understands that gardens support diversity (multiple animals and plants).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- All students demonstrate understanding of at least one mantis adaptation and its purpose.\n- Most students use vocabulary terms (habitat, predator, camouflage, adaptation) with reasonable accuracy.\n- Most students make a connection between the mantis's body features and its garden habitat.\n- Most students recognize that gardens contain diverse organisms.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visuals:** Provide picture-based vocabulary cards with one-word labels and clear images. During explanation, focus on just two terms: \"camouflage\" and \"habitat.\" Use repetition and multi-sensory input (show pictures, act out concepts).\n\n2. **Guided observation with a script:** Provide a sentence starter sheet during Explore phase:\n   - \"I see _______ legs on the mantis.\"\n   - \"The mantis is _______ (color). That helps it _______ (hide/hunt).\"\n   - \"A garden habitat has _______ (plants, animals, flowers).\"\n   \n   Students fill in blanks rather than free-write, reducing cognitive load.\n\n3. **Peer partnerships:** Pair struggling learners with attentive peers during Explore and Elaborate activities. The peer model observation and vocabulary use while the struggling learner benefits from modeling and scaffolded talk.\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Instead of writing, offer a verbal exit ticket where a teacher or aide asks one simple question: \"Tell me one thing the mantis's green color helps it do.\" Student may point to a picture, use one word, or speak simply.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper adaptation inquiry:** Ask advanced students to research or think about: \"What other animals in nature use camouflage? How are their adaptations similar to and different from the mantis's? Draw and compare.\" Students can create a \"Camouflage Adaptations\" poster showing multiple animals.\n\n2. **Food web exploration:** Introduce a simple food chain concept: \"What does the praying mantis eat? What eats the praying mantis?\" Have advanced students create a simple food chain diagram showing the mantis and at least two other garden organisms. Discuss: \"If all the mantises disappeared, what would happen to the insects it eats?\"\n\n3. **Habitat problem-solving:** Present scenarios: \"A gardener wants to plant a vegetable garden but doesn't want praying mantises there (thinks they'll eat beneficial insects too). What could the gardener do to make the habitat less attractive to mantises while still growing vegetables?\" Students brainstorm solutions that show understanding of how adaptations connect to habitat preferences (e.g., remove certain plants, plant only vegetables insects dislike, provide alternative hunting grounds nearby).\n\n4. **Extended observation project:** If a live mantis is available, have advanced students create a detailed observation log over several days, noting behaviors, movements, and interactions. They document: What time of day is the mantis most active? Does it stay in one place or move around? How often does it hunt?\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Garden Diversity Walk:** If possible, take students on a short outdoor walk to a garden, park, or natural area on the school grounds. Have them search for insects and plants, photograph or sketch them, and then create a \"Real Garden Habitat Chart\" comparing what they found to the photograph. Discuss: \"Is this garden more or less diverse than the one in our picture? Why?\"\n\n2. **Mantis Life Cycle Research:** Introduce the concept that all animals are born, grow, and change. Show pictures of mantis eggs (ootheca), nymphs, and adults. Have students create a simple life cycle wheel or timeline. Discuss: \"Why might it be important for a garden to have baby mantises growing up?\" (Control pests naturally, maintain diversity.)\n\n3. **Design a Perfect Habitat:** Provide students with a blank \"habitat design\" sheet or poster space. Direct: \"Draw and label a perfect garden habitat for a praying mantis. Include everything it needs: plants for hiding, places to hunt, water, and shelter. Explain your design choices.\" Students present their habitats and discuss which design would support the most diverse community of animals.\n\n---",
