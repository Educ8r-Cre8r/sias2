Identify and name at least three external body parts of a lizard and explain what each part helps the lizard do.\n2. Observe the lizard's colors and patterns and describe how they might help the lizard survive in a rocky or wooded environment.\n3. Use materials to create a lizard model that shows how body parts help an animal survive.\n4. Compare their own body parts to a lizard's body parts and explain how they are the same and different.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the colorful lizard.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of the lizard (enlarged 8.5\" × 11\" or displayed on a document camera/projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student observation journals or drawing paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around printed copies. Give students 30-45 seconds of silent looking time before speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (one at a time, allowing brief think-and-share):\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? How do you know it's a lizard?\"\n   - \"What colors do you see on this lizard? Which color surprised you the most?\"\n   - \"Look closely at the lizard's belly. What do you notice about the red part? Why do you think it's red? Could it be important?\"\n   - \"If this lizard was sitting on a rock in the sun, would other animals be able to see it easily? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what those bumpy parts on the lizard's skin do. Let's think about what special body parts this lizard has and what jobs those parts do.\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper (use pictures and simple words) under the heading \"What We Think Lizard Body Parts Do.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore lizard bodies and discover what makes them so special. We'll learn how animals use their body parts to stay safe and healthy.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how lizard body parts help with survival through hands-on exploration and comparison.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the lizard (one per pair or small group)\n- Index cards with pictures of lizard body parts (head, legs, tail, skin, eyes, belly flap) — one set per pair\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but recommended)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Chart titled \"What Does Each Part Do?\" with rows for body part names\n- Picture cards showing different environments: sunny rocks, dead leaves, green plants, under logs\n- Student observation journals or clipboards with paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Hands-On Body Part Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs.** Give each pair a large copy of the lizard photograph and a set of 6 index cards labeled with body parts: head, legs, tail, skin, eyes, belly flap.\n\n2. **Provide these student directions:**\n   - \"Look at your lizard picture carefully. Find each body part on the card and find it on the lizard in your picture.\"\n   - \"Point to each part. Use a magnifying glass if you have one.\"\n   - \"Draw a circle around one body part. Think: 'What could this part help the lizard do?' You might draw what the lizard does with that part.\"\n   - \"On your observation sheet, draw or write what you think that body part does. For example: 'The legs help the lizard run away.'\"\n\n3. **Circulate among pairs.** Ask probing questions without giving answers:\n   - \"What do you notice about the legs? How could they help the lizard move?\"\n   - \"Why is the tail long? What could the lizard do with it?\"\n   - \"The skin is bumpy. How might that help in a rocky place?\"\n   - \"The eyes are big and dark. What do you think the lizard sees with those eyes?\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:** Listen to student thinking. Record 2-3 interesting observations on a sticky note to share during Explain phase. Do not correct misconceptions yet.\n\n**Part 2: Environment Matching (8 minutes)**\n\n5. **Show the environment picture cards** one at a time (sunny rocks, dead leaves, green plants, under logs).\n\n6. **Ask:** \"Where might we find a lizard like this? Why would this lizard's colors help it here?\"\n\n7. **Record observations:** Have students point to or circle which environment they think matches the lizard's coloring. \"The lizard's back is gray and brown like the rocks, so predators might not see it. But why is the belly red? Let's think about that...\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 3-5 body parts of the lizard.\n- Students make initial connections between body parts and survival (legs for running, eyes for seeing, skin for protection, tail for balance).\n- Students recognize that the lizard's color helps it hide.\n- Students produce drawings or written labels showing at least 2 body parts and a simple explanation of function.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to life science concepts about how animals use external body parts to survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart from Engage phase (\"What We Think Lizard Body Parts Do\")\n- Enlarged lizard photograph\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n- Picture chart showing a lizard using each body part (optional: simple illustrations or actual photos)\n- Whiteboard or chart for recording vocabulary\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Invite pairs to share one discovery** from their exploration. Ask: \"What body part did you pick? What does it do?\" Record responses on chart, grouping similar ideas.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** using student-friendly language and **point to the photograph** as you define each term:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **External parts (or \"outside parts\"):** The body parts you can see on the outside of an animal — like legs, tail, skin, eyes, and head. \"These are the parts that stick out or you can touch.\"\n   - **Camouflage (or \"hiding colors\"):** When an animal's colors and patterns help it blend in with rocks, trees, or dirt so predators can't see it easily. *Point to the lizard's gray-brown back.* \"Look how the lizard's back looks like the rocks it sits on!\"\n   - **Adapt or **adaptation** (use \"special body part\" instead for First Grade):** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive. \"The lizard's bumpy skin is an adaptation — it helps the lizard feel things and maybe protects it.\"\n   - **Communicate:** To send a message to another animal. \"The red belly might be a message. It could say 'stay away!' or help a boy and girl lizard find each other.\"\n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals. \"The lizard's big eyes help it watch for predators to stay safe.\"\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph using a think-aloud:**\n   - \"The lizard in our picture has a gray and brown back. That is camouflage! When the lizard sits on a rock or dead wood, it's hard to see. But look at the bright red belly! Why would the lizard have a bright belly if it wants to hide? Maybe the red belly is for communicating. If another lizard comes near, this lizard can flash its red belly to say 'This is my space!'\"\n\n4. **Ask for evidence from their observations:**\n   - \"Who found that the legs help the lizard run? Show me in the picture how those strong legs help.\"\n   - \"Who noticed the long tail? The tail helps with balance, kind of like when you hold your arms out to balance on a line!\"\n   - \"What about the eyes? Those big eyes help the lizard see predators coming so it can escape.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding** using hand signals or thumbs:\n   - \"Show me thumbs up if you think camouflage helps the lizard hide.\"\n   - \"Point to the lizard's back if you can find the camouflage colors.\"\n   - \"Can you draw in the air how a lizard's legs help it run?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that external body parts have specific jobs related to survival.\n- Students use the term \"camouflage\" or \"hiding colors\" to describe the lizard's gray-brown back.\n- Students recognize that the red belly may have a different purpose (communication or warning).\n- Students make connections between body parts and survival behaviors (running away, watching for danger, hiding).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by using materials to design a model lizard and explain how its body parts help it survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Construction paper, felt, or craft foam in various colors (gray, brown, red, yellow, black)\n- Pipe cleaners or popsicle sticks for legs and tail\n- Googly eyes or markers to draw eyes\n- Glue sticks and scissors (or pre-cut shapes for safety)\n- Real sticks/twigs or pictures of rocky environments\n- Student design sheets with prompts (see below)\n- Chart titled \"Our Lizard Designs\" for displaying work\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Design and Build (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:** \"Now YOU are going to design a lizard! Your lizard needs body parts that help it survive. Let's build a model lizard and explain why each part is important.\"\n\n2. **Distribute materials.** Show students the rock/twig \"environment\" where their lizard will live.\n\n3. **Give these student directions:**\n   - \"Choose colors for your lizard. Remember: the back should blend in with rocks or wood. The belly can be bright!\"\n   - \"Make a head, body, four legs, and a tail using the materials.\"\n   - \"Add eyes. Make them big so your lizard can watch for danger.\"\n   - \"Think about what your lizard needs to survive here. Does it need strong legs to climb? Does it need a long tail for balance?\"\n\n4. **Provide a simple design sheet** for each student to complete:\n   - Draw or glue a picture of your lizard\n   - Write or say one body part: _________\n   - What does it do? It helps the lizard _________\n\n5. **Teacher Role:** Circulate and ask:\n   - \"Tell me about the legs on your lizard. What do they help your lizard do?\"\n   - \"Why did you choose those colors?\"\n   - \"How is your lizard's body part like the real lizard's?\"\n\n**Part 2: Share and Explain (5-8 minutes)**\n\n6. **Invite 4-5 students** to hold up their lizard and say one thing about how a body part helps their lizard survive.\n\n7. **Display all lizards** on a classroom \"Lizard Habitat\" bulletin board or shelf.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a model lizard with identifiable body parts (head, legs, tail, eyes).\n- Students explain at least one way their lizard's body helps it survive.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that body parts have specific functions.\n- Students make choices about colors and structure that show thinking about camouflage or other survival needs.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how external body parts help animals survive using formative and summative assessment strategies.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Exit ticket template (paper or digital)\n- Observation checklist for teacher use\n- Student journals or assessment sheets\n- Photograph of the lizard (for reference)\n- Chart showing body parts from Explain phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n\n1. **Observation checklist** (teacher uses during Explore and Elaborate phases):\n   - ☐ Student identifies at least 3 lizard body parts correctly.\n   - ☐ Student describes at least 2 functions of body parts (e.g., legs for running, eyes for seeing).\n   - ☐ Student uses the term \"camouflage\" or \"hiding colors\" appropriately.\n   - ☐ Student creates a model with recognizable body parts.\n   - ☐ Student can explain one way a body part helps survive.\n\n2. **Questioning checks** (ask during group discussions):\n   - \"Show me the lizard's legs. What do they do?\"\n   - \"Why is the lizard's back gray and brown?\"\n   - \"If you were a lizard, which body part would help you stay safe? Why?\"\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (End of Day 2):**\n\n**Provide each student with one of these assessment options:**\n\n**Option 1 (Drawing with Labels):**\n- Display the lizard photograph.\n- \"Draw a lizard. Label at least 3 body parts. Write or tell me what one part does to help the lizard survive.\"\n- Success Criteria: Student draws a lizard with at least 3 labeled body parts and provides one accurate explanation.\n\n**Option 2 (Oral Response):**\n- Ask individual students:\n  1. \"Point to the lizard's legs. Why does a lizard need strong legs?\"\n  2. \"Look at the lizard's colors. How do the gray and brown colors help it?\"\n  3. \"What does the lizard's tail do?\"\n- Success Criteria: Student answers at least 2 of 3 questions accurately, showing understanding that body parts have survival functions.\n\n**Option 3 (Comparison):**\n- \"How is a lizard's body like your body? How is it different? Show me or tell me one thing.\"\n  - Expected Response: \"We both have eyes to see and legs to move, but the lizard has a tail and bumpy skin.\"\n- Success Criteria: Student identifies at least one similarity and one difference.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery when they:\n- Correctly identify 3+ external body parts of a lizard.\n- Explain at least 2 functions of body parts related to survival (movement, sensing danger, camouflage, communication).\n- Use vocabulary such as \"camouflage,\" \"legs,\" \"tail,\" \"eyes,\" and \"predator\" appropriately.\n- Apply understanding by designing a model lizard or comparing lizards to humans.\n- Recognize that external body parts help animals survive in their environment.\n\n**Data Recording:**\n- Collect student drawings, journals, and exit tickets.\n- Use the observation checklist to note which students need additional support or enrichment.\n- Keep one example of student work showing strong understanding and one showing misconceptions for guided small-group instruction.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for students who are struggling):**\n\n1. **Reduce complexity during Explore:** Provide pre-labeled body part cards and have students match them to the photograph rather than generating their own explanations. Ask yes/no questions: \"Do legs help the lizard move? Yes or no?\"\n\n2. **Provide sentence stems:** During the Elaborate phase, give students sentence starters:\n   - \"This body part is _______. It helps the lizard _______.\"\n   - \"The lizard's _______ helps it hide because _______.\"\n   - Support students in finding just one or two words to complete the sentence.\n\n3. **Use peer partnerships:** Pair struggling learners with stronger communicators. Have the peer model explaining a body part while the struggling student points or draws.\n\n4. **Reduce the number of body parts:** Instead of 6 body parts, focus on 3 (legs, eyes, tail). Build confidence with fewer concepts.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deepen camouflage thinking:** Ask, \"What if this lizard lived in a green forest instead of on gray rocks? How would its colors be different? Draw a forest lizard and explain your choices.\"\n\n2. **Extend to other animals:** \"Find a picture of a different desert or woodland animal. What body parts does it have that help it survive? How are its adaptations like or different from the lizard's?\"\n\n3. **Design a solution:** Introduce a problem-solving scenario: \"A lizard needs to escape from a snake quickly. Design or draw an extra-special body part that would help it get away even faster. Explain how it works.\"\n\n4. **Research and present:** Provide picture books or curated websites about different lizard species. Have students find a different lizard and compare its body parts and colors to the one in our lesson.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n**Activity 1: Lizard Camouflage Game**\n- Place colored paper (gray, brown, red, yellow, green) on a table or the floor.\n- Cut out small lizard shapes in different colors.\n- Have students hide their lizards on the colored paper and see which ones are hardest to find.\n- Discuss: \"Which lizards were easiest to hide? Why? Which were the hardest to hide? Why?\" (Connects to natural selection and survival.)\n\n**Activity 2: Create a Lizard Habitat**\n- Set up a classroom \"lizard environment\" using a large box, rocks, wood, sand, and plants.\n- Have students place their model lizards in the habitat and photograph or draw the scene.\n- Create a classroom book: \"Where Do Lizards Hide?\" with each student's contribution.\n- Discuss how different body parts help the lizard survive in this specific place.\n\n**Activity 3: Lizard Life Cycle and Parent-Offspring Comparison** *(Connects to 1-LS1-2 and 1-LS3-1)*\n- Read a simple picture book about lizard babies (e.g., *The Tiny Seed* adapted for reptiles, or age-appropriate reptile books).\n- Show pictures of baby lizards and adult lizards side by side.\n- Have students draw a baby lizard and an adult lizard and label ways they are the same and different.\n- Discussion: \"Baby lizards have the same body parts as adult lizards. Why? What might be different?\" (Size, color, behavior.)\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n**Pacing:** This lesson can be taught in two 40-minute sessions or spread across four 20-minute sessions within a week, depending on your schedule and student needs.\n\n**Safety:** Ensure all scissors are safety scissors. Supervise hot glue gun use if applicable (or pre-cut shapes). No live lizards are required for this lesson, though if your school has a classroom lizard, a brief observation visit after the lesson would be highly engaging!\n\n**Differentiation in practice:** Monitor student responses during each phase. Flexible grouping allows you to provide small-group re-teaching of vocabulary or one-on-one questioning to deepen advanced learners' thinking.\n\n**Connection to home:** Send home a family letter asking caregivers to look for lizards (or pictures of lizards) and help their child describe one body part and its job. This reinforces learning and builds family engagement.",
