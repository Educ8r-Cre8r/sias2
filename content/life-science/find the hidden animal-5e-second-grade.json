Observe and identify an animal in a photograph and describe where it is hiding.\n2. Explain how an animal's colors and body shape help it survive in its habitat.\n3. Make observations of how living things are adapted to their environment.\n4. Compare how different animals' appearances match their habitats.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (one per pair or displayed on screen/whiteboard)\n- Optional: magnifying glasses (one per student or pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or give each pair a printed copy. Do NOT tell students what animal is in the picture yet.\n\n2. **Give students 2 minutes of quiet time** to search for something living in the photograph. Encourage them to use their eyes like detectives looking for clues.\n\n3. **Ask these discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing 30 seconds of think time before calling on students):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture?\" (Students will likely say rocks, pebbles, dirt.)\n   - \"Do you think anything that is *alive* might be hiding here? Why or why not?\" (Encourage them to think about where animals might live.)\n   - \"If an animal lived in this rocky place, what color do you think it might be to hide?\" (Guide them to think about matching colors.)\n   - \"Can you spot any animal? Look very carefully—it might look like the rocks around it.\"\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"I'm thinking of an animal that is hiding in this picture right now. It blends in so well that it's hard to see. Can you predict what kind of animal it might be? Why would an animal want to hide like this?\"\n\n5. **After 1-2 minutes, reveal the answer:** \"There's a lizard hiding in this picture! Let's find it together and figure out why it's so hard to see.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now you're going to become animal detectives and do your own investigation to understand how animals hide in nature.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per pair or group of 3):**\n- One printed copy of the photograph (or access to view it on a device)\n- Paper and colored pencils or crayons (brown, tan, gray, orange)\n- Optional: magnifying glasses\n- \"Animal Detective Observation Sheet\" (simple template with: drawing space, color checklist, and simple questions)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Finding the Hidden Animal (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute the photograph** and tell students: \"Your job is to be animal detectives. Look very carefully at this picture and find the lizard hiding in the rocks.\"\n\n2. **Give them 5-6 minutes** to search. Circulate and offer hints if needed: \"Look for something that isn't a rock. Does it have eyes? Can you see a tail?\"\n\n3. **Once a student or pair finds it**, have them mark it with a small post-it or circle (using pencil lightly on a photocopy). Do NOT tell others where it is yet.\n\n4. **Celebrate:** \"Great detective work! Now let's figure out WHY this animal is so hard to see.\"\n\n**Part B: Investigating Camouflage (14 minutes)**\n\n5. **Ask:** \"What colors do you see in this rocky place?\" (Tan, brown, gray, orange, white.) Record answers on the board.\n\n6. **Ask:** \"What colors is the lizard? Let's look closely.\" (It should match the rocks—browns, tans, grays.)\n\n7. **Hands-On Discovery:** Give each pair colored pencils and their \"Animal Detective Observation Sheet.\"\n   - **Task 1 (5 min):** Draw the lizard's colors. Use the same colors you see in the rocks around it.\n   - **Task 2 (5 min):** Circle or color the rocks that look the same color as the lizard.\n   - **Task 3 (4 min):** Answer: \"Why is this lizard hard to find?\" and \"What would happen if the lizard were bright red instead of brown?\"\n\n8. **Students record their observations** by drawing, circling colors, and answering in simple sentences or pictures.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What color is that rock? Does the lizard match it?\" \n- Avoid telling students answers—let them discover the color match.\n- Listen for emerging understanding of camouflage.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify the lizard's location in the photo.\n- Students match the lizard's colors to the surrounding rocks.\n- Students begin to understand that matching colors helps animals hide.\n- Students produce a drawing and written/visual responses showing this understanding.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Poster board or large paper with vocabulary words\n- The original photograph (still displayed)\n- Optional: picture cards of other camouflaged animals (owl in tree, frog on leaf, snowshoe hare in snow)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (6 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share where they found the lizard and what colors they noticed.\n   - Display a few students' drawings side by side.\n   - Ask: \"What do all these drawings show about the lizard's colors?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   \n   Write and define these terms using student-friendly language:\n\n   - **Camouflage:** The way an animal's colors or patterns look like its surroundings so it's hard to see. (Show the photograph and point out the match.)\n   \n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. (In this picture, it's a rocky area. The lizard lives here.)\n   \n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or color that helps an animal survive. (The lizard's brown color is an adaptation—it helps the lizard stay safe.)\n   \n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts other animals. (Ask: What animals might hunt lizards? Birds, snakes. The lizard's camouflage helps it hide from them.)\n   \n   - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy. (The lizard's camouflage helps it survive because predators can't see it.)\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photo (3 minutes):**\n   - Point to the lizard in the photograph.\n   - \"This lizard has an adaptation—brown and tan colors—that matches its habitat. This camouflage helps it survive because predators have a hard time seeing it. This is how the lizard adapted to life in this rocky place.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can anyone point to the lizard again?\" (Visual confirmation.)\n   - Ask: \"Why are the colors of this lizard brown instead of bright blue?\" (Elicit: to hide, to match rocks, to survive.)\n   - Ask: \"What is the name for how the lizard blends in?\" (Camouflage.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Camouflage:** Colors or patterns that help an animal blend in with its surroundings.\n- **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives.\n- **Adaptation:** A special body part, color, or behavior that helps an animal survive.\n- **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals.\n- **Survive:** To stay alive.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that camouflage is an adaptation that helps animals survive.\n- Students can use vocabulary in simple sentences: \"The lizard uses camouflage to hide in its rocky habitat.\"\n- Students recognize that an animal's colors match its habitat for a reason.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or images of 3-4 other camouflaged animals (tree frog, owl, snowshoe hare, moth on bark)\n- \"Camouflage Matching Game\" cards or chart\n- Colored paper (various colors: green, white, brown, gray, orange)\n- Optional: magazines for cutting\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Camouflage Matching Game (9 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show picture cards** of other camouflaged animals one at a time (without labeling the habitat yet):\n   - White snowshoe hare (in snow)\n   - Green tree frog (on a leaf)\n   - Brown owl (on a tree branch)\n   - Gray moth (on gray bark)\n\n2. **Ask for each animal:** \"Where does this animal live? What colors are in that place?\" Have students match the animal to its habitat based on color.\n\n3. **Discuss:** \"Just like our lizard, these animals have camouflage that matches their habitats. Why do you think that is?\"\n\n**Part B: Design Your Own Camouflaged Animal (9 minutes)**\n\n4. **Explain the task:** \"Now YOU are going to be an animal designer. You will choose a habitat and design an animal that would hide there.\"\n\n5. **Give students these choices of habitats:**\n   - A sandy desert (yellows, tans, browns)\n   - A snowy place (whites, light blues)\n   - A grassy field (greens, browns)\n   - A forest (browns, greens, grays)\n\n6. **Have each student:**\n   - Choose ONE habitat.\n   - Draw or cut out a simple animal shape (provided template: lizard, frog, bird, rabbit).\n   - Color it to match the habitat using colored pencils or colored paper.\n   - Label their habitat: \"My animal lives in a _____ and is colored _____ to hide.\"\n\n7. **Gallery Walk:** Post all designs around the room. Have students walk and observe, then share: \"Whose animal has the best camouflage? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide habitat selection without deciding for students.\n- Ask questions: \"What colors would an animal need in a snowy place?\"\n- Encourage creative application of camouflage concept.\n- Celebrate diverse designs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design an animal with colors that match a chosen habitat.\n- Students understand that camouflage works in different habitats.\n- Students demonstrate transfer of concept from lizard example to new animals.\n- Students can explain: \"My animal is _____ colored because it lives in a _____ and needs to hide.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of camouflage and adaptation.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Listen to student language during Engage and Explore (Are they using \"hide,\" \"match,\" \"colors\"?).\n- Observe Explore recordings: Can students identify matching colors?\n- Monitor explanations during Explain phase: Do students understand the WHY (survival)?\n- Watch Elaborate designs: Do colors match habitat?\n\n**Exit Ticket Assessment (5 minutes):**\n\nGive each student a simple exit ticket with 2-3 questions (use pictures + simple text for access):\n\n1. **Draw or circle:** \"Show me the lizard's camouflage. What color is it?\" \n   - ✓ Student correctly identifies the lizard and names color(s).\n\n2. **Answer (can be picture or words):** \"Why does the lizard's brown color help it survive?\"\n   - ✓ Student responds with: \"It hides,\" \"It blends in,\" \"Predators can't see it,\" or similar idea.\n\n3. **Think of a new animal:** \"If a frog lives on a green leaf, what color should it be? Why?\"\n   - ✓ Student answers: \"Green\" and explains: \"To hide\" or \"To match the leaf.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Emerging:** Student can find the lizard and name one color; explanation is vague.\n- **Developing:** Student identifies lizard, matches colors, and gives a partial reason (e.g., \"to hide\").\n- **Proficient:** Student identifies lizard, matches colors to habitat, and explains camouflage helps with survival or hiding from predators.\n- **Advanced:** Student applies camouflage concept to a new animal/habitat with clear explanation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify the lizard's location.\n- 75% of students can match the lizard's colors to surrounding rocks.\n- 70% of students can explain that camouflage helps an animal hide or survive.\n- All students show evidence of understanding that animals adapt to their habitats.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplify Vocabulary:** Use only \"hide,\" \"color,\" and \"match\" for students not ready for \"camouflage\" and \"adaptation.\" Add these terms later.\n\n2. **Provide a Labeled Photo:** Give some students a version with the lizard outlined or circled so they can focus on color observation without the finding challenge.\n\n3. **Use Picture Cards Instead of Writing:** For students not yet writing confidently, have them point to or paste pictures to show understanding (e.g., paste brown color squares next to the lizard picture).\n\n4. **Pair with a Stronger Reader/Observer:** During Explore, pair struggling students with peers who can help guide the search and observation.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Research Other Adaptations:** \"Besides camouflage, what other ways do animals adapt to survive? Can you find an animal that changes color or has special body parts?\" (Introduce seasonal camouflage, mimicry, or body armor.)\n\n2. **Design a Multi-Habitat Animal:** \"Design an animal that needs to survive in TWO different habitats (forest and desert, for example). What colors would it need? Can one color work for both?\"\n\n3. **Predict and Explain:** \"What if this lizard lived on a white sandy beach instead of rocks? How would its colors need to change? What would happen if it didn't change?\"\n\n4. **Create a Food Chain Diagram:** \"Draw the lizard, its predator, and what the lizard eats. Label how camouflage helps the lizard in this chain.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Outdoor Camouflage Hunt:** Take students outside (garden, playground, or field) and challenge them to find real camouflaged animals or insects. Have them draw and describe what they find: color, habitat, how it hides.\n\n2. **Camouflage in Different Seasons:** Bring in photos of the same habitat in different seasons (spring/green, summer/full green, fall/brown, winter/white). Discuss: \"How would an animal need to change its camouflage to survive in each season? Do you know any animals that do this?\" (Snowshoe hare, ptarmigan.)\n\n3. **Camouflage Art Activity:** Create a class \"camouflage collage\" where students hide paper cutouts of animals in images of habitats using only matching colors and patterns. Display as a \"Can You Find the Animals?\" bulletin board for other classrooms to solve.\n\n4. **Story Writing:** \"Write or draw a story about the lizard in the photograph. What does it do all day? What is it hiding from? Why did it choose this rocky habitat?\" (Combine with ELA standards for narrative writing.)\n\n5. **Predator-Prey Game:** Play a physical game where some students are \"predators\" trying to tag \"prey\" (lizards) that must stay in a designated \"habitat\" area with colors matching their clothing. Discuss why it's harder to tag students in matching environments.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\n- This lesson emphasizes observation skills and inductive reasoning—students discover the camouflage concept rather than being told about it.\n- The photograph is intentionally challenging; the \"aha moment\" when students find the lizard is motivating and memorable.\n- All vocabulary and explanations use concrete, observable evidence from the photo to support understanding.\n- The lesson naturally connects to 2-LS4-1 by having students observe an animal (the lizard) in its specific habitat and compare its adaptations to other animals' habitats in the Elaborate phase.",
