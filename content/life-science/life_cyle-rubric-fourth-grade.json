        "exceeds": "Student identifies multiple nutrients/resources from soil (such as nitrogen, minerals, or nutrients) and explains how at least two of them help the plant grow larger and stronger.",
        "meets": "Student identifies at least two things seedlings need from soil (such as nutrients, minerals, or food) and provides a basic explanation of how they help the plant grow.",
        "approaching": "Student identifies one thing seedlings need from soil (such as nutrients or food) but explanation is vague or incomplete about how it helps growth.",

      "dokLevel": 2,
      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student explains that eggshells are biodegradable/will break down in soil and connects this to reducing waste or helping the environment; also predicts that the shell will decompose and become part of the soil to feed the plant.",
        "meets": "Student explains that the eggshell will break down or decompose over time and identifies at least one advantage (such as being natural, compostable, or safe for plants).",
        "approaching": "Student recognizes that the eggshell will change or break down but explanation lacks detail about decomposition or connection to environmental benefit.",
        "beginning": "Student provides a vague answer such as 'it will break' or 'it goes away' without explaining the process or why this matters for the plant."

      "dokLevel": 2,
      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student predicts the sprout would die or wilt and explains that water is essential for plants to transport nutrients, keep cells firm, and carry out life processes needed for growth.",
        "meets": "Student predicts the sprout would die, wilt, or stop growing and explains that plants need water to survive and grow.",
        "approaching": "Student predicts something negative would happen to the sprout (die or wilt) but provides only a partial explanation of why water is important.",

        "exceeds": "Student identifies multiple parallels such as both starting small and growing bigger, both needing food/nutrients and water, both need time to develop, and both follow a life cycle from birth to maturity.",
        "meets": "Student identifies at least two similarities between plant and human growth, such as both start small and grow bigger, or both need food and water to grow.",
        "approaching": "Student identifies one similarity between plant and human growth but lacks depth or makes only a surface-level connection.",
        "beginning": "Student provides a vague response such as 'they both grow' with little detail or understanding of growth processes."
