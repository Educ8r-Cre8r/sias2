This demonstrates that seeds develop within the fruit structure of plants and are essential for plant reproduction.\n- **Seeds have specific structures:** Seeds are visible as distinct objects with their own shape, size, and arrangement. Students can observe that seeds are different from the rest of the plant fruit.\n- **Plants need resources to grow:** The image shows grass and soil alongside the squash, revealing the environment where plants live and the resources (soil, water, sunlight) they require for survival.\n- **Different parts of plants serve different purposes:** The fruit protects seeds, the flesh provides nutrients, and the green skin shows how plants develop protective layers—all necessary for seed survival and plant growth.\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Seeds Inside: What Do Plants Need to Grow?**\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90 minutes (two 45-minute sessions, or three 30-minute sessions across a week)\n- **NGSS Standards:** K-LS1-1\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to...\n- Use observations to identify what seeds are and where they come from in plants.\n- Describe at least two things that plants need to survive and grow (water, sunlight, soil).\n- Observe and draw patterns showing what plants need based on their own observations.\n- Explain why seeds are important for new plants to grow.\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of squash seeds.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed image of the cut squash showing seeds\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or print it as a poster. Gather students on the carpet in a circle where all can see clearly.\n\n2. **Introduce with wonder:** Say, \"Look at this picture! Someone cut open a squash. What do you see inside? Turn to the person next to you and whisper what you notice.\"\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (allow 5-10 seconds of think time before calling on students):\n   - \"What are those tiny things inside the squash? Have you ever seen anything like them?\" (Guide toward understanding these are seeds.)\n   - \"Where do you think these seeds came from? Did someone put them there?\"\n   - \"What else do you see in this picture? Why is there grass next to the squash?\" (Introduce idea that plants grow in soil/grass areas.)\n   - \"Do you think plants need anything to grow? What might they need?\" (Record student ideas on chart paper—water, sun, dirt, etc.)\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"I have a question: If we planted one of these seeds in dirt and gave it water and sunshine, what do you think would happen? Turn and tell a friend your idea.\"\n\n5. **Record a few predictions** on the chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Today we're going to be plant scientists. We're going to explore seeds and discover what plants really need to survive and grow. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate seeds and observe what plants need through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- Real squash or pumpkin cut in half (or other large seeds like sunflower seeds)\n- Small paper plates or trays\n- Hand lenses (1 per group)\n- Dried beans or pumpkin seeds (2-3 per student)\n- Picture cards showing: water droplet, sun, soil/plant pot, plant seedling (printed or drawn)\n- Small containers or cups with soil\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Chart paper titled \"What Do Plants Need?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute materials.** Give each small group a cut squash half (if available), a paper plate, and a hand lens.\n\n2. **Direct student exploration with these steps:**\n   - \"Look carefully at your squash. Use the hand lens. What do you see inside? Are the seeds all the same? Are they smooth or bumpy? What color are they?\"\n   - Allow 5 minutes of free observation. Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What does that feel like? Why do you think the seeds are inside the squash and not on the outside?\"\n   - Give each student 2-3 seeds to hold and examine: \"Describe your seed using words like big, small, smooth, bumpy, hard, soft.\"\n\n3. **Connect to plant needs:**\n   - Hold up picture cards (one at a time): water, sun, soil, seedling.\n   - \"These are things plants need to grow. Let's match them together.\" \n   - Ask: \"Do you think seeds need water? Sunshine? Soil?\" Point to the grass in the original photo.\n   - **Action:** If time permits and setup is ready, place a seed in a small cup of moist soil and water it lightly. Say, \"We're going to keep this seed in a warm, sunny spot. Let's watch what happens over the next week!\"\n\n4. **Record observations:**\n   - Provide a simple worksheet or drawing paper where students sketch or draw the seed they observed.\n   - Students dictate 1-2 words describing their seed to an adult who writes it down (e.g., \"hard,\" \"brown,\" \"round\").\n   - On the \"What Do Plants Need?\" chart, have students place the picture cards (water, sun, soil) and count together: \"How many of us think plants need water?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate rather than explain. Use questions: \"What do you notice? What else? Why do you think that?\"\n- Validate observations: \"You have great eyes! Yes, those seeds are bumpy.\"\n- Guide without giving answers: \"What happens to plants when they don't get water? Let's think about that together.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and describe seed structures (color, texture, size).\n- Students identify and discuss at least two plant needs (water, sunlight, soil) using picture cards.\n- Students create a simple drawing or representation of a seed.\n- Students begin to understand that seeds contain new plants and come from fruits/vegetables.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with \"What Do Plants Need?\" title (started in Explore)\n- Anchor chart with vocabulary words and simple pictures\n- Picture book: *From Seed to Plant* by Gail Gibbons (or similar K-appropriate plant life cycle book)\n- Whiteboard and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore phase (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 student volunteers to hold up their seed drawings and share one thing they noticed.\n   - Ask the class: \"Did anyone notice something different about their seed than what [student name] noticed?\"\n   - Celebrate observations: \"Scientists notice little details just like you did!\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (8 minutes) with visual supports:**\n\n   - **Seed:** \"A seed is a tiny package with a baby plant inside. The hard outside protects the baby plant, kind of like your skin protects you.\"\n   - **Fruit:** \"The squash we looked at is a fruit. Fruits hold seeds and keep them safe. Seeds grow inside fruits.\"\n   - **Soil:** \"Soil is dirt. Plants need soil to grow roots (show picture of roots). Roots drink water and hold the plant up.\"\n   - **Sunlight:** \"Plants need sunlight (point to window or sun). Sunlight helps plants grow big and strong, just like healthy food helps you grow.\"\n   - **Water:** \"Plants drink water through their roots (point to roots in picture). Water helps plants live and grow.\"\n\n3. **Read aloud a short picture book** (3-4 minutes) showing the plant life cycle: seed → sprout → seedling → plant. Pause to ask, \"What does the plant need here?\" for each stage.\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph and Explore activity (2-3 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember the squash we looked at? Now we know those seeds inside can grow into new squash plants. The fruit protected them and kept them safe.\"\n   - \"The grass and soil we saw in the photo are where plants grow. They need soil, water, and sunlight—just like we discovered!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Quick visual check: Hold up pictures and ask, \"Do plants need this? Thumbs up or thumbs down.\"\n   - Ask 2-3 students: \"What does a seed need to grow into a plant?\" (Accept answers: water, sun, soil.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Seed:** A small living package with a baby plant inside; protected by a hard shell.\n- **Fruit:** The part of a plant that holds and protects seeds (like squash, apple, or pumpkin).\n- **Soil:** The dirt or growing material where plants' roots grow and drink water.\n- **Sunlight:** Light from the sun that helps plants make food and grow.\n- **Water:** Liquid that plants drink through their roots to live and stay healthy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that seeds are baby plants protected by a seed coat.\n- Students can name at least two things plants need to survive: water and sunlight (some may also say soil).\n- Students understand that seeds grow inside fruit.\n- Students can use the new vocabulary terms in simple sentences with prompting.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by predicting what happens to seeds with and without resources.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Two clear plastic cups per pair of students\n- Soil\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Bean seeds (2-3 per cup)\n- Plant labels or stickers\n- Chart titled \"Prediction: What Will Happen to Our Seeds?\"\n- Optional: thermometer, sunny window location, dark closet location\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up a simple seed-growing experiment (10 minutes):**\n   - Explain: \"We're going to be plant scientists and test what seeds need. We'll plant seeds and watch them grow.\"\n   - Demonstrate planting one seed: Fill a clear cup halfway with soil, place a seed about 1 inch deep, spray lightly with water.\n   - Give each pair two cups. Label one \"Sunny Spot + Water\" and one \"Dark Spot + Water\" (or \"Sunny + Water\" vs. \"Sunny, No Water\" depending on your setup).\n   - Have students: Fill cups with soil, plant seeds, spray gently with water.\n\n2. **Make predictions (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Which seeds do you think will grow? Why?\"\n   - Point to the two cups: \"This one will be in the sunny window. This one will be in the dark closet (or covered).\"\n   - Have students place a sticker or draw a picture on the chart predicting which will grow better and why.\n   - Record: \"Most of us think the sunny seed will grow. That's because plants need sunlight!\"\n\n3. **Care and observation plan:**\n   - Assign \"seed scientists\" to water seeds once a day (light spray—not soaked).\n   - Plan to observe the cups each day for 1-2 weeks. Students draw or mark observations on a simple picture chart.\n   - Key observation prompt: \"Are the seeds changing? Do you see a sprout? What does the seed that got sunlight look like compared to the one that didn't?\"\n\n4. **Discussion tie-back:**\n   - \"Now we're testing what we learned. Seeds need water, sunlight, and soil. Let's see if the real seeds prove this.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Model proper watering technique so seeds don't rot.\n- Facilitate observation and data collection without revealing results too quickly.\n- Ask: \"What do you notice today? Is it the same as yesterday? What changed?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students plant seeds and understand that they are performing a scientific investigation.\n- Students make predictions about which seeds will grow based on their learning.\n- Students begin daily observation skills and simple record-keeping.\n- Over 1-2 weeks, students observe firsthand that seeds need sunlight, water, and soil to sprout and grow.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what plants need and the role of seeds.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore: Can they identify seeds? Do they use descriptive language?\n- Listen to student responses in Explain: Can they name at least two plant needs?\n- Check predictions in Elaborate: Do predictions show understanding of plant needs?\n- Review drawings and dictations from Explore for evidence of observation skills.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\nUse one of the following based on your class level:\n\n**Option A (Picture Response):**\nShow three pictures: a seed in soil with water and sun, a seed in dark with no water, a seed in dirt with no sun.\nAsk: \"Which seed will grow into a plant? Why?\"\nStudents point or circle the correct picture and say or dictate one reason.\n\n**Option B (Oral Questions):**\nAsk each student individually:\n1. \"Where do seeds come from?\" (Accept: \"Inside fruits/squash\" or \"Inside plants\")\n2. \"What do plants need to grow?\" (Students should name at least 2 of: water, sunlight, soil)\n3. \"Why are seeds important?\" (Accept: \"They make new plants\" or \"They help plants grow\")\n\n**Option C (Drawing with Label):**\nStudents draw a seed growing and label or dictate:\n- \"This is a seed.\"\n- \"It needs _____ to grow.\" (water/sun/soil)\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Students can identify seeds as baby plants.\n- ✓ Students can name at least two things plants need to survive (water, sunlight, soil).\n- ✓ Students understand that seeds come from inside fruits/plants.\n- ✓ Students show curiosity about their planted seeds and observe changes over time.\n- ✓ Students use observation words (bumpy, hard, round, brown) to describe seeds.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most kindergarteners will be able to name water and sunlight as plant needs.\n- Students will show understanding through drawing, pointing, and simple verbal responses.\n- The planted seeds will provide real-world evidence that validates student learning over the following weeks.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on three key words only: **seed, water, sunlight**. Use repetition and visuals (point to pictures) rather than written labels.\n\n2. **Hands-on manipulation:** Provide real seeds of various sizes to manipulate and sort by size/color. Use sensory exploration (smooth vs. bumpy) rather than complex analysis.\n\n3. **Yes/no questioning:** Use simpler questions: \"Do plants need water? Yes or no?\" with visual supports (picture of plant with water drop vs. without).\n\n4. **Partner with peer:** Pair with a stronger learner during Explore so student can observe and listen to peer language while handling materials.\n\n5. **Simplified exit ticket:** Ask only one question: \"What do plants need?\" with three picture choices (water, sun, soil) and student points to one or two.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper investigation:** Have students predict what happens if a seed gets water but NO sunlight, or sunlight but NO water. Create a three-variable experiment (Sunny + Water, Sunny + No Water, Dark + Water, Dark + No Water) and observe differences daily.\n\n2. **Research extension:** Ask, \"Where do different seeds come from?\" Provide picture cards of various fruits (apple, watermelon, pepper, bean pod) and have students match seeds to their original fruit sources.\n\n3. **Written predictions:** Have students write or dictate detailed predictions for the seed experiment using because statements: \"I think the sunny seed will grow because plants need sunlight to be healthy.\"\n\n4. **Seed anatomy:** If using large seeds like pumpkin or bean, carefully cut one in half for advanced students to see the baby plant (embryo) inside the seed coat. Discuss the protective structures.\n\n5. **Compare and contrast:** Provide seeds of different sizes and types. Have students describe how seeds are alike and different and hypothesize why.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Sorting and Classification:**\n   Collect various seeds from home (beans, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, apple seeds, corn kernels). Set up a sorting station where students classify seeds by size, color, texture, or \"came from a fruit we eat\" vs. \"other plants.\" Create a pictograph showing which seeds are biggest, smallest, smoothest, etc.\n\n2. **Plant a Classroom Garden Window:**\n   Expand the Elaborate experiment into a month-long classroom garden project. Plant multiple seeds in individual cups in a sunny window. Have students water together each day, track growth with simple measurements (height marker stickers), and celebrate when sprouts emerge. Create a time-lapse photo display or growth chart showing changes week by week.\n\n3. **Read-Aloud and Art Integration:**\n   Read *The Tiny Seed* by Eric Carle or *From Seed to Plant* by Gail Gibbons over several days. After each reading, students create their own seed-to-plant visual story using colored paper cutouts, collage, or painting. Display these alongside your classroom planted seeds for a multi-sensory learning wall.\n\n4. **Family Seed Hunt:**\n   Send home a note inviting families to find seeds in their kitchen (fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains). Students bring seeds to class to create a collaborative classroom seed collection. Sort by type, count, and graph which seeds families found most often. This connects home and school learning.\n\n5. **Sensory Seed Exploration Tray:**\n   Create a sensory bin or tray with various textured seeds (smooth pumpkin seeds, rough sunflower seeds, tiny poppy seeds, larger beans). Add magnifying glasses, small cups, and scoops. Let students explore and describe seeds using all their senses (except taste, unless sunflower seeds). Record descriptive words on a word wall.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- Begin planting seeds in the Elaborate phase early in your school year or choose a time when you'll have 1-2 weeks for visible sprouting. Winter or very hot summer may slow germination.\n- If live squash is unavailable, use high-quality photos or purchase pre-cut squash from the grocery store deli counter (often cheaper and fresher than whole).\n- Real seeds provide the most authentic learning. Students are naturally curious about seeds and will engage deeply with this concrete, observable topic.\n- Return to the planted seeds daily for brief observations. This consistency reinforces the concepts and maintains student excitement.",
