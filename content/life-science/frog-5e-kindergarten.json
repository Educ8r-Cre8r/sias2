Identify and name at least two things a frog needs to live (food, water, shelter, air).\n2. Describe where frogs live and why that place is important for their survival.\n3. Use observations to explain how a frog's body helps it survive in its home.\n4. Match pictures of animals to what they need to survive (food, water, home, air).\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the frog in the photograph and activate prior knowledge about animal needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digitally projected photograph of the tree frog on the leaf\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: small green toy frog or stuffed frog to hold up\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph**\n   - Project or show the frog photograph on a large screen or hold up a printed copy. Keep it covered initially with a piece of paper.\n\n2. **Dramatic Reveal**\n   - Say: \"I have a special secret hiding under this paper. This is a living thing that lives on trees. Are you ready to see what it is?\" Slowly uncover the frog photograph.\n\n3. **Guided Discussion Questions (one at a time, allowing 5–10 seconds of thinking time per question)**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about the animal.\"\n   - \"Where is this frog sitting? Why do you think it's on a leaf?\"\n   - \"What color is the frog? Why might being green help it?\"\n   - \"What do you think this frog needs to stay alive and healthy? What do *you* need? Does the frog need those things too?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt**\n   - Record student responses on chart paper titled \"What Do Frogs Need?\" Write or draw their ideas (e.g., water, bugs to eat, a tree home).\n   - Say: \"I wonder... how does a frog get what it needs when it lives so high up in a tree? Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become frog explorers and build a special home where a frog could find everything it needs to live!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what frogs need to survive by building and exploring a model frog habitat.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic containers or shoeboxes (one per 2–3 students, or one per group of 4–5 for larger classes)\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Live or artificial leaves, small branches, or twigs\n- Soil or potting mix\n- Small rocks or pebbles\n- Pictures of frog food (insects like flies, beetles, mosquitoes) — printed and laminated if possible\n- Optional: small toy insects or foam insects\n- Chart paper titled \"What Did We Add to Our Habitat?\"\n- Markers or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduction (2 minutes)**\n   - Show students the empty container: \"This is an empty home. It has nothing in it. A frog couldn't live here. Why not? What's missing?\"\n   - Let students call out ideas (water, plants, food, etc.).\n\n2. **Guided Build-Out (15–20 minutes)**\n   - **Step 1 (3–4 minutes):** Students add soil to the bottom of the container. Say: \"Frogs need soil because they sometimes rest on the ground. Gently add soil—you're building the floor of the frog's home.\"\n   - **Step 2 (3–4 minutes):** Students add leaves and small branches. Say: \"Frogs live in trees and plants. These leaves are like the frog's bed and hiding spot. Where will you place your leaves?\"\n   - **Step 3 (3–4 minutes):** Teacher sprays water lightly into each container using the spray bottle. Say: \"Frogs need water to drink and to keep their skin wet. Watch as I add water. What do you notice?\"\n   - **Step 4 (3–4 minutes):** Students add rocks. Say: \"Rocks give the frog places to sit and rest. They're like little chairs in the frog's home.\"\n   - **Step 5 (2–3 minutes):** Teacher places pictures of insects or toy insects into the habitat. Say: \"Frogs are hungry! They eat bugs like flies and beetles. We're putting food into the home. Now the frog has food, water, shelter, and a place to rest.\"\n\n3. **Observation & Recording**\n   - Point to each item in the habitat and ask: \"What did we put in? Why did we put it in?\" \n   - Record student responses on chart paper: \"Leaves = shelter,\" \"Water = drink,\" \"Bugs = food,\" \"Soil = rest place,\" etc.\n   - Have students draw or dictate one thing their frog habitat has in it.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without giving all answers. Ask guiding questions: \"Does your frog need to drink? Where would it get water?\" \"What would a frog eat?\"\n- Help younger or struggling students by offering choices: \"Should we add leaves OR rocks first? Which does your frog need more?\"\n- Observe which students understand the connection between the needs (food, water, shelter) and the items in the habitat.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will build a model habitat containing basic frog needs: soil, plants/leaves, water, insects (or pictures of insects), and shelter.\n- Students will describe orally why each item was added.\n- Students will recognize that frogs, like all animals, need multiple things to survive.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase (\"What Do Frogs Need?\") and Explore phase (\"What Did We Add to Our Habitat?\")\n- Picture cards showing: food, water, shelter, air (laminated or printed)\n- The frog photograph (again)\n- Poster-sized or large paper with the word \"HABITAT\" written at the top, divided into four sections labeled: FOOD, WATER, SHELTER, AIR\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes)**\n   - Gather students in a circle where they can see the habitats and charts.\n   - Ask: \"Tell me one thing you put in your frog's home. Why did you choose it?\"\n   - Listen to 4–5 student responses, affirming each one.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8–10 minutes)**\n   - Hold up the frog photograph again. Say: \"This frog is a *living thing*. All living things need certain things to stay alive.\"\n   - Use picture cards and point to each as you say:\n     - **\"FOOD\"** — Point to pictures of bugs. \"Frogs eat insects like flies and beetles. Food gives them energy to hop and play.\"\n     - **\"WATER\"** — Point to the water bottle or show the wet habitat. \"Frogs need water to drink and to keep their skin wet. Frog skin is special—it helps them breathe!\"\n     - **\"SHELTER\"** — Point to leaves and trees in the photograph. \"A shelter is a safe home. The frog's shelter is in trees and plants where it's safe from big animals and where it can hide.\"\n     - **\"AIR\"** — Point upward or breathe deeply. \"Frogs need air to breathe, just like we do. That's why the frog lives outside where there's lots of fresh air.\"\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph & Explore Activity (3–4 minutes)**\n   - Look at the photograph together: \"See how the frog is on a green leaf? That leaf is part of its *habitat*. A habitat is the place where an animal lives. It has everything the animal needs.\"\n   - Point to each item in a student's habitat: \"This is YOUR frog's habitat. Just like the real frog on the leaf, your frog has food, water, shelter, and air. Everything it needs!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes)**\n   - Quick thumbs check: \"Thumbs up if you think frogs need water. Thumbs sideways if you're not sure. Thumbs down if you think they don't.\"\n   - Ask 2–3 students: \"What's ONE thing in a frog's habitat?\" Accept any correct answer (food, water, shelter, leaf, etc.).\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Living thing** | Something that grows, moves, eats, and needs things to stay alive (like animals and plants). |\n| **Habitat** | The home of a plant or animal; the place where it finds everything it needs to live. |\n| **Food** | Something an animal eats to give it energy and help it grow. |\n| **Shelter** | A safe, protected home where an animal can rest and hide. |\n| **Adaptation** | A special body part or color that helps an animal survive in its home. (The frog's green color helps it hide.) |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the words \"food,\" \"water,\" \"shelter,\" and \"habitat\" in context.\n- Students will explain that frogs (and other animals) need these things to live.\n- Students will connect the photograph to the concept of habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by exploring what other animals need to survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of 4–5 different animals (bird, fish, bear, dog, butterfly) — printed and laminated if possible\n- Pre-made \"Needs Match\" cards or worksheet showing pictures of: food, water, shelter, air\n- Chart paper divided into four columns: FOOD, WATER, SHELTER, AIR\n- Crayons and paper for drawing\n- Optional: small toy animals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: \"What Do Other Animals Need?\" (Comparison Game)**\n\n1. Show students a picture of a different animal (e.g., a bird, fish, or bear).\n2. Ask: \"This animal is different from a frog. But does it need food? Water? Shelter? Air? Like the frog?\"\n3. Guide students to recognize that ALL animals need the same basic things.\n4. Create a class chart:\n\n   | Animal | Food | Water | Shelter | Air |\n   |--------|------|-------|---------|-----|\n   | Frog | ✓ (bugs) | ✓ | ✓ (leaves) | ✓ |\n   | Bird | ✓ (seeds) | ✓ | ✓ (nest) | ✓ |\n   | Fish | ✓ (small bugs) | ✓ (lives in it!) | ✓ (plants, rocks) | ✓ (from water) |\n\n5. **Debrief:** \"Every animal needs the same four things! The TYPE of food is different, but every animal needs FOOD. The TYPE of shelter is different, but every animal needs a SHELTER. Isn't that cool?\"\n\n**Option B: \"Draw Your Own Frog Habitat\"**\n\n1. Provide each student with paper and crayons.\n2. Say: \"Draw a frog home. Make sure your drawing shows the frog finding food, water, shelter, and air. You can draw bugs, leaves, water, and the frog in its tree.\"\n3. Students draw and label (or you label for them) what the frog needs.\n4. Display drawings on a \"Frog Homes\" bulletin board with the caption: \"All frogs need food, water, shelter, and air to live!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"What is the frog eating in your picture?\" \"Where is the water?\" \"Is your frog safe in its shelter?\"\n- Facilitate peer sharing: Have students show a neighbor their work and explain one thing their frog needs.\n- Provide sentence stems: \"This frog needs ___ because ___.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will recognize that different animals have the same basic needs (food, water, shelter, air).\n- Students will be able to identify what various animals eat, where they live, and where they find water.\n- Students will create or describe a complete frog habitat with all four needs represented.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal needs and habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation checklists during Explore: Did students correctly add habitat items? Could they explain why?\n- Listening during Explain: Did students use vocabulary (food, water, shelter, habitat) appropriately?\n- Questioning during Elaborate: Could students identify needs in other animals?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5–10 minutes at lesson end):**\n\nChoose ONE of the following based on your students' abilities:\n\n**Option 1: Verbal Exit Ticket (One-on-One or Small Group)**\n- Show the frog photograph again.\n- Ask three quick questions (accept verbal responses):\n  1. \"What is this animal?\" (Frog)\n  2. \"Name ONE thing this frog needs to live.\" (Food, water, shelter, or air)\n  3. \"Why does the frog live on a leaf?\" (To find food, shelter, water; to be safe; to stay near water, etc.)\n\n**Option 2: Picture Sort (Cut & Paste or Pointing)**\n- Display four picture cards: food, water, shelter, air.\n- Read each aloud: \"Show me FOOD. Show me WATER. Show me where a frog LIVES (shelter).\"\n- Students point to or touch the correct picture.\n\n**Option 3: Draw & Label**\n- Provide a simple outline of a frog habitat (tree with leaf, ground).\n- Students draw or point to: one thing the frog eats, water, a shelter, and air.\n- Teacher or aide labels as needed.\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Learning Objective | What Success Looks Like |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Identify at least two things a frog needs to live | Student names or points to two of: food, water, shelter, air |\n| Describe where frogs live and why | Student says: \"In trees/on leaves\" and gives a reason (safe, find food, find water) |\n| Explain how a frog's body helps it survive | Student notices frog's color (green = hide), eyes, or body shape with teacher prompting |\n| Match animals/things to what they need | Student correctly sorts or matches 3 of 4 needs to a frog or animal |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify at least two things a frog needs to survive.\n- Most students will understand that all animals need food, water, shelter, and air.\n- Students will make simple connections between the frog's habitat (the leaf, the tree) and its survival.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners or Younger Kindergarteners)\n\n1. **Reduce Vocabulary Load**\n   - Use only two key words initially: \"FOOD\" and \"WATER.\"\n   - Introduce \"shelter\" and \"air\" after mastery of the first two.\n   - Use picture labels more than words; point and repeat.\n\n2. **Hands-On Habitat Simplification**\n   - Pre-fill containers with soil and water; students only add leaves and toy insects.\n   - Provide 2–3 pre-selected items rather than open choice.\n   - Use larger, easier-to-handle items (bigger leaves, larger rocks).\n\n3. **Verbal Scaffolding**\n   - Use sentence stems: \"A frog needs ___ to ___.\"\n   - Offer yes/no questions: \"Does a frog need water?\" instead of open-ended \"What does a frog need?\"\n   - Repeat and affirm all responses, then model correct vocabulary.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Habitat Depth**\n   - Ask: \"What ELSE could a frog find in this habitat? Where does the frog hide? Where does it sleep? How is this tree a safe place?\"\n   - Challenge students to add details: \"Can you create a place in the habitat where the frog lays eggs?\"\n\n2. **Cross-Animal Comparison**\n   - Extend the comparison: \"A frog needs these things. A fish needs these things. How are they the same? How are they different? Where does a fish get water? Does a fish need to breathe air?\"\n   - Introduce the word \"adaptation\": \"Why is the frog GREEN? Why is a polar bear WHITE?\"\n\n3. **Open-Ended Investigation**\n   - Provide additional habitat materials (more leaves, twigs, water, soil) and ask: \"Design the BEST frog habitat. What would make it perfect for a frog?\"\n   - Encourage students to think about problems: \"What if there's no shelter? What if there's no water?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### 1. **\"Frog Life Cycle\" Picture Walk (Follow-Up Lesson)**\n   - Show pictures of a frog's life cycle: eggs → tadpole → froglet → adult frog.\n   - Focus on NEEDS at each stage: \"What does a tadpole need? Does it need shelter too? Where does a tadpole find food?\"\n   - This naturally extends the lesson and connects to life cycles (LS domain).\n\n### 2. **Classroom \"Habitat Zones\" Walk**\n   - Set up different classroom corners labeled: \"Frog Habitat,\" \"Bird Habitat,\" \"Fish Habitat,\" \"Bear Habitat.\"\n   - Each station has pictures and items representing that animal's needs.\n   - Students rotate through stations and observe: \"Do ALL habitats have water? Do ALL have shelter?\"\n   - Solidifies the concept that every animal needs food, water, shelter, and air—just in different forms.\n\n### 3. **\"If I Were a Frog\" Creative Activity**\n   - Provide frog masks or headbands (optional craft component).\n   - Ask: \"If you were a frog, where would you build your home? What would you eat? Why?\"\n   - Students draw or dictate: \"My frog home has ___ because ___.\"\n   - Share stories as a class: \"I built my frog home in a big tree with lots of leaves because...\"\n   - Connects to empathy and observation skills while reinforcing habitat concepts.\n\n### 4. **\"Needs Match\" Memory Game (Homework or Center Activity)**\n   - Create pairs of cards: one showing an animal, one showing what it needs.\n   - Students flip cards and match \"Frog\" to \"Lives on leaves,\" \"Eats bugs,\" etc.\n   - Reinforce vocabulary and concepts in a game format.\n\n### 5. **Parent Letter & Home Activity**\n   - Send home a simple letter: \"We learned that frogs need food, water, shelter, and air. Can you find these things in YOUR home? Does your pet/family need these things too?\"\n   - Include a drawing activity: \"Draw your home. Show where you get food, water, and shelter.\"\n\n---\n\n## Closure & Reflection\n\nEnd the lesson with a brief reflection circle:\n\n- \"Today we learned that frogs need ___.\" (Pause; let students fill in.)\n- \"Everything that's alive needs ___.\" (Pause.)\n- \"You need the same things a frog needs! We all need food, water, a safe home, and air. Isn't that amazing?\"\n- \"If you could have your own frog for a pet, what would you build for its habitat? Why?\"\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Real-World Connection:** If possible, arrange a virtual tour or video of a real frog habitat (rainforest, pond, tree canopy) to show students an authentic frog home.\n- **Safety:** Ensure no real frogs are harmed; use toy/model frogs or focus only on pictures if live specimens are not available. Always prioritize animal welfare.\n- **Accessibility:** Use large, clear pictures. Provide tactile materials (soft leaves, smooth rocks) for students who benefit from sensory input.\n- **Pacing:** Kindergarten students work at varied speeds. Break the lesson into two shorter sessions if needed (Engage + Explore on Day 1; Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2).",
