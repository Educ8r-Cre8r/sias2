Growing Plants from the Ground Up**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90-110 minutes across two sessions (Session 1: 45-50 minutes for Engage and Explore; Session 2: 45-60 minutes for Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - **K-LS1-1:** Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Observe and describe** the basic parts of a seed and what a seed needs to grow (water, soil, warmth).\n2. **Predict and test** what will happen when seeds are planted in soil with water and sunlight.\n3. **Explain** why plants need soil, water, and light to grow, using words and simple drawings.\n4. **Record observations** about seed growth over time and share what they discover about how plants change.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about seeds and growth by connecting the photograph to their natural wonder about plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital display of the germinating seed photograph (at least 8\" × 10\")\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording questions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display Setup:** Project or hold up the photograph where all students can see it clearly. Tell students: *\"Today we're going to be plant detectives. Look at this special picture. What do you see?\"*\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (calibrated for Kindergarten):**\n   - *\"What do you notice at the bottom of the picture? What color is it?\"* (Guide them to see the brown seed.)\n   - *\"What is the green part? Have you seen anything like this before in a garden or at home?\"*\n   - *\"Where do you think this seed came from? Who put it in the soil?\"*\n   - *\"What do you think is happening to this seed right now? Is it sleeping or waking up?\"*\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Say, *\"I wonder what's inside that brown seed? I wonder what the seed needs to keep growing? Let's find out together!\"* Write these wonderings on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n4. **Personal Connection:** Ask, *\"Has anyone ever planted a seed or seen a plant grow? What did it need?\"* Allow 2-3 brief responses.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Now you're going to be plant scientists and grow your own seeds so we can watch what happens!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate seed germination through a hands-on planting activity, directly connecting their exploration to the photograph.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Small paper or plastic cup (4-6 oz)\n- Potting soil or seed-starting mix\n- 2-3 large seeds (dried beans, sunflower seeds, or pumpkin seeds—avoid small seeds like carrot)\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Newspaper or paper towels (to protect tables)\n- Popsicle stick or wooden spoon for digging a small hole\n- Optional: Pre-prepared \"seed observation cards\" (laminated half-sheet with a picture of a seed and blank lines for drawings)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup (5 minutes):** Cover each table with newspaper. Give each student/pair a cup, soil, seeds, and tools. Show students your model cup with pre-moistened soil and say, *\"We're making a home for our seeds, just like the seed in the photograph!\"*\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n   - *\"Fill your cup about 3/4 full with soil. Feel it! Is it dry or damp? We'll add water in a moment.\"*\n   - *\"Look at your seed. Touch it. What does it feel like? Is it hard or soft? Draw what you see on your observation card.\"*\n   - *\"Use your stick to poke a hole about as deep as your thumb into the soil.\"*\n   - *\"Put your seed in the hole and cover it gently with soil.\"*\n   - *\"Spray water on the soil until it's damp—not soaking wet, like the soil in our picture. Ask yourself, 'Would a seed like this much water?'\"*\n   - *\"Put your cup in a sunny spot. Our seed will stay warm and get light, just like it needs.\"*\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:** Ask students, *\"Look at the picture again. Do you see how the seed is already in soil and getting water? Our seeds will do the same thing!\"*\n\n4. **Documentation:** Students draw or dictate on their observation card:\n   - What their seed looks like\n   - Where they placed their cup\n   - One thing they think their seed needs\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: *\"What do you notice about the soil?\"* *\"Do you think your seed is happy here?\"*\n- Avoid telling students what will happen; instead, ask them to predict: *\"What do you think will come out of the soil first?\"*\n- Support students with soil management and watering—this is tactile and exploratory, not a \"perfect\" result.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each student has planted a seed in appropriate conditions (moist soil, sunlight access).\n- Students have observed a seed's basic appearance and texture.\n- Students begin to recognize that seeds are planted in soil and need water and light.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Build shared understanding using observations from Explore and connect to formal vocabulary about plant needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original photograph (enlarged)\n- Chart paper divided into three sections labeled: \"Seeds,\" \"What Seeds Need,\" and \"How Seeds Grow\"\n- Picture cards of soil, water, sunlight (pre-made or drawn during this phase)\n- Student observation cards from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Ask students to share one thing they observed about their seed (texture, size, color, where they planted it).\n   - Facilitate: *\"I heard that your seeds are hard. Yes! That hard covering protects the seed inside. Who else noticed that?\"*\n   - Record observations on the \"Seeds\" section of the chart.\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Explanation with the Photograph (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph and point: *\"This seed already has water in the soil. See how the soil looks dark and damp? That's good for seeds.\"*\n   - Point to the green stem: *\"Look! Something is starting to grow out of the seed! This is the baby plant. It's waking up because the seed has water, warm soil, and sunlight.\"*\n   - Point to the brown seed coat: *\"The seed coat is like a blanket. It keeps the baby plant safe until the baby plant is ready to grow.\"*\n\n3. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (with Kindergarten-friendly definitions):**\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Seed** | A small thing that can grow into a plant. It has a baby plant inside with a hard cover. |\n| **Soil** | The dark, crumbly stuff in the ground where plants grow their roots. It gives food and water to seeds. |\n| **Water** | The clear liquid that plants drink to grow, just like you drink water to grow. |\n| **Sunlight (or Light)** | Energy from the sun that helps plants grow big and green. |\n| **Sprout** | A new baby plant that grows from a seed when it has water, soil, and sunlight. |\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Hold up the photograph and ask: *\"What does this seed need to grow? Turn to a friend and tell them one thing.\"*\n   - Listen to 2-3 pairs respond. If a student says something incorrect (e.g., *\"It needs rocks\"*), ask gently: *\"Let's look at the picture. Do you see rocks helping the seed? What else might help?\"*\n\n5. **Connection Back to Explore:** *\"You planted seeds just like the one in this picture! Your seeds are now waiting for water, soil, and sunlight to help them wake up and grow!\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name 3 things seeds need: water, soil, and sunlight/light.\n- Students use the word \"sprout\" or \"baby plant\" to describe early growth.\n- Students understand that seeds rest inside the seed coat until conditions are right.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by predicting and sequencing the growth process, and by extending their thinking to real-world plant scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture sequence cards (3-4 images showing seed → sprouted seedling → young plant with leaves → larger plant; use drawings or simple printed images)\n- Chart paper with title \"What Happens Next?\"\n- Optional: Access to a class plant or a fresh sprout in progress to observe\n- Drawing paper and colored pencils/crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Sequencing Activity (8-10 minutes):**\n   - Display the picture sequence cards out of order.\n   - Say: *\"These pictures show what happens to a seed as it grows. But they're all mixed up! Can you help me put them in the right order?\"*\n   - Have students come up and physically arrange the cards or point to the correct order.\n   - Ask: *\"Why does the seed come first? Why does the sprout come after? What has to happen in between?\"*\n   - Emphasize: *\"First, the seed needs water and warmth. Then, the baby plant wakes up and grows down (roots) and up (sprout). With more water, light, and time, it gets bigger and bigger!\"*\n\n2. **Real-World Application (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Show students a real plant in the classroom or a fresh photograph of a vegetable garden.\n   - Ask: *\"Where do tomatoes/carrots/corn come from? They all started as seeds!\"* or *\"Do all plants start as seeds? Let's think...\"*\n   - Connect to their lives: *\"When you eat an apple with seeds in it, or corn with kernels, those are seeds! They could grow into new trees or plants.\"*\n\n3. **Personal Prediction Drawing (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Give each student a half-sheet of paper divided into two sections: \"My seed today\" and \"My seed in 2 weeks.\"\n   - Ask them to draw what they think their seed looks like now and what they think it will look like in two weeks.\n   - Encourage simple drawings with labels or dictated sentences: *\"My seed will have a sprout\" or \"My seed will grow roots.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Validate all attempts at sequencing and prediction—the goal is reasoning, not correct answers.\n- Ask: *\"Why do you think that comes next? What does a plant need to do that?\"*\n- Support students who need help by pointing to the photograph again: *\"Look at the picture. Is the sprout coming out of the top or the bottom?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can sequence basic plant growth stages (seed → sprout → growing plant).\n- Students can explain at least one reason why each stage happens (e.g., *\"First water comes, then the seed wakes up\"*).\n- Students recognize that seeds are found in foods and everyday life.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students understand that plants need soil, water, and sunlight to survive and grow from seeds.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n   - **Observation Checklist** (used throughout all phases):\n     - Does the student describe at least 2 things a seed needs? ☐\n     - Can the student point to and name a seed, soil, water, and sunlight in the photograph? ☐\n     - Does the student sequence growth stages correctly (with support)? ☐\n     - Does the student participate in predictions about their planted seed? ☐\n\n2. **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes):**\n\n   Display the original photograph and ask students to respond (verbally or with drawing) to these prompts:\n\n   - **Question 1:** *\"What does this seed need to grow? Name or draw one thing.\"* \n     - ✓ Success: Student names/draws water, soil, or sunlight\n   \n   - **Question 2:** *\"You planted a seed today. What will happen to your seed now that it's in soil with water and light?\"*\n     - ✓ Success: Student responds with a prediction like \"It will grow,\" \"A sprout will come,\" or \"It will wake up\"\n   \n   - **Question 3:** *\"Why do plants need water to grow?\"* (optional, for advanced learners)\n     - ✓ Success: Student responds \"Plants drink water\" or \"It helps them grow\"\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n   - **Mastery (K-LS1-1):** Student can identify 2 or more things seeds/plants need to survive and uses observations from the photograph or their planted seed to support their answer.\n   - **Developing:** Student can identify 1 thing seeds need with prompting and makes a simple connection to the photograph.\n   - **Beginning:** Student identifies a plant need but cannot yet explain or connect to observations.\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Collect student observation cards from Explore and prediction drawings from Elaborate.\n   - Take a photo of each student's planted seed to document starting state.\n   - Photograph student responses to exit ticket questions.\n   - These artifacts show growth over the 2-week period as seeds sprout.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that seeds need water, soil, and sunlight to grow.\n- Students can make predictions about their own seed's growth using the photograph and lesson discussions.\n- Students will observe real growth in their planted seeds over the following 2 weeks, providing ongoing evidence of understanding.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Focus:** Work with 2-3 key words instead of 5 (seed, water, soil, grow). Use picture cards paired with words throughout activities. Repeat key terms consistently.\n\n2. **Scaffolded Observations:** Provide a sentence frame for observation cards: *\"My seed is ___. It needs ___.\"* or allow drawing-only responses with adult scribing of student dictation.\n\n3. **Hands-On Manipulatives:** Use a pre-planted demonstration cup where the seed is already visible near the soil surface so students can see the sprout emerging without waiting weeks. Refer back to it frequently: *\"See how water helped this seed start to grow?\"*\n\n4. **Buddy System:** Pair students with peers or an aide during Explore phase to co-plant seeds. Peer modeling and support reduce anxiety and increase engagement.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Comparative Investigations:** Give advanced students two seeds to plant under different conditions (one with light/one in darkness, or one with water/one without water). Ask: *\"What do you think will happen differently? Why?\"* This bridges to understanding variables and experimental design.\n\n2. **Extended Research Questions:** Pose deeper questions: *\"What other plants grow from seeds? Can you find a seed in an apple or a pumpkin? How many seeds are inside?\"* Provide picture books or classroom plants to explore.\n\n3. **Sequencing with Reasoning:** Ask advanced students to sequence 5-6 growth stages and explain WHY each step happens: *\"Why does the root grow down first? Why does the shoot grow up?\"* Encourage them to think about the seed's \"needs\" at each stage.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Observation Journal (2 weeks):** Students draw and dictate observations of their planted seed each week. Create a class poster: *\"Our Seeds Are Growing!\"* with photos documenting weekly changes. Revisit the original photograph to compare: *\"Our seed looks like the picture now! What's different?\"*\n\n2. **Seed Collection Walk:** Take students on a nature walk (or virtual walk via images) to find different seeds (pinecones, acorns, dandelion puffs, milkweed pods). Discuss: *\"How are these seeds different? Where do they come from? What do they all need to grow?\"* Create a seed collage or display.\n\n3. **\"From Seed to Plate\" Picture Book Activity:** Read an age-appropriate book like *\"The Seed\" by Joseph Low* or *\"From Seed to Plant\" by Gail Gibbons* (adapted sections). Discuss where familiar foods come from (apples, carrots, corn). Taste a food that grew from a seed (apple slice, sunflower seed snack) and reflect: *\"A plant grew from a tiny seed to make this food for us!\"*\n\n4. **Parent Take-Home Packet:** Send families a copy of the observation card template and instructions to plant a seed at home. Include the photograph and ask parents to discuss: *\"What does our seed need? Let's observe together.\"* Students bring observations back to share with the class.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Success\n\n- **Timing:** Space the two sessions by 1-2 days to allow discussion of the Engage and Explore activities without overloading students in one day.\n- **Ongoing Observation:** Check planted seeds every 2-3 days. Most large seeds germinate in 5-10 days, allowing students to observe real change by the end of the unit.\n- **Classroom Community:** Document growth with photos and celebrate milestones: *\"Jamal's sprout is up! It pushed through the soil just like in the picture!\"*\n- **Sensory Engagement:** Kindergarteners thrive with tactile, visual, and verbal input. Encourage touching soil, seeds, and their growing plants throughout the unit.\n- **Realia (Real Objects):** Keep the original photograph displayed throughout the unit. Reference it repeatedly to anchor vocabulary and reinforce that their seeds are going through the same process.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly aligns with **K-LS1-1** by having students observe a real plant (seed/sprout) and describe patterns of what it needs to survive (water, soil, sunlight). The photograph serves as the anchor point, and students' hands-on investigations provide concrete evidence for their reasoning.",
