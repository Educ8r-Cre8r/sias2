ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about plant growth and recycled materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image (or printed color copies) of the photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Container of water\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board without explanation. Show it for 30 seconds in silence. Ask students to look carefully at what they see.\n\n2. **Pose discovery questions** (one at a time, allowing 1-2 minutes of think-pair-share between questions):\n   - \"What do you notice about this bottle? What is inside it, and what is growing out of it?\"\n   - \"Why do you think someone put a plant inside an old plastic bottle instead than in a regular pot?\"\n   - \"What things do you think this growing plant needs to survive and get bigger?\"\n   - \"Where do you think the plant gets the stuff it needs to grow—from the bottle, the soil, the air, or somewhere else?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder if we could prove that a plant gets most of what it needs to grow from air and water, not just from the soil. How could we find out?\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper. Accept all responses without judgment; these become the basis for testing in Explore.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become plant scientists and create our own bottle gardens. Then we'll investigate exactly where plants get what they need to grow.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant growth by constructing and observing a plant-in-a-bottle system.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clean 2-liter plastic bottles (1 per student or small group; can be provided cut in half or whole)\n- Potting soil or garden soil (approximately 2-3 cups per bottle)\n- Small bean seeds or seedlings (bean or pea plants work best; can be pre-germinated to save time)\n- Spray bottles filled with water (1-2 per group)\n- Labels and permanent markers\n- Rulers or measuring tapes\n- Observation journals or data sheets (printed or digital)\n- Optional: Plastic wrap or clear tape to seal bottles partially (for advanced groups)\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Prepare your bottle:** If using whole bottles, carefully cut the top 1/3 off with scissors (or teacher pre-cuts for safety). If using pre-cut bottle halves, skip this step.\n\n2. **Add soil:** Pour potting soil into your bottle until it reaches about 2/3 full. Gently pat it down but don't pack it tightly. Leave 1-2 inches of space at the top.\n\n3. **Plant your seed:** Make a small hole about 1 inch deep in the soil. Place your bean seed or seedling into the hole. Gently cover with soil.\n\n4. **Water lightly:** Use a spray bottle to mist the soil until it feels slightly damp—not soaking wet. Record the date and time.\n\n5. **Label your bottle:** Write your name, the date, and \"Plant Bottle Garden\" on a label and attach it to your bottle.\n\n6. **Place in sunlight:** Set your bottle on a windowsill or in a well-lit spot. Do not seal the bottle completely; it needs air circulation.\n\n7. **Observe daily:** Each day for 7-10 days, record observations in your journal:\n   - Has the plant grown? (Measure the height of any sprouts with a ruler.)\n   - What color are the leaves?\n   - How does the soil look? (Is it wet, dry, or medium?)\n   - Did you water today? How much?\n   - What else do you notice?\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** \"Just like the plant in the photograph that's growing in a recycled bottle, your plant will use the soil, water, air, and sunlight in your system. Keep track of what your plant needs to stay healthy.\"\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Daily measurements of plant height\n- Sketches of plant growth stages\n- Water dates and amounts added\n- Observations about changes in color, leaf shape, and stem growth\n- A hypothesis about where the plant is getting its materials to grow\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you think your plant needed to grow taller? Where did those materials come from?\" \n- Avoid telling students the answer; instead, prompt them to observe and infer.\n- Ensure bottles are in adequate light and not overwatered.\n- Help students measure accurately and record data consistently.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe visible plant growth over several days.\n- Students notice that the plant grew taller even though they only added water (not new soil), suggesting growth comes from sources beyond the soil.\n- Students begin to recognize patterns (e.g., plants grow more when watered regularly and placed in sunlight).\n- Students accumulate data to support evidence in later phases.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts based on student observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student observation journals from Explore phase\n- Diagram or poster showing plant parts (roots, stem, leaves) and their functions\n- Optional: Simple diagram of photosynthesis (visual only, no complex chemistry)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 volunteers to share their observations: \"What did you notice your plant doing? How did it grow?\"\n   - Record observations on chart paper. Look for common patterns (e.g., \"Plants grew taller,\" \"They needed water,\" \"They grew more in the sun\").\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   Use the observation data to anchor each definition. Point back to the photograph and students' bottle gardens.\n\n   - **Growth:** When a living thing gets bigger or taller. (Point to student plant measurements.) \"Your plants grew taller because they used water and nutrients from the soil and air.\"\n   \n   - **Photosynthesis:** The process where plants use sunlight, air, and water to make food and energy so they can grow. (Visual: Show a simple diagram of a plant with arrows pointing to sun, air, and water.) \"Plants are like little factories—they take in water through their roots, air through tiny holes in their leaves called stomata, and sunlight, then they make their own food.\"\n   \n   - **Nutrients:** Special materials in soil that plants need to be healthy and strong. (Hold up soil sample.) \"Nutrients are like vitamins for plants. They come from broken-down plants and animals in the soil.\"\n   \n   - **Decompose/Decomposer:** When dead plants and animals break down into tiny pieces and mix back into the soil. (Reference the dark soil in the photograph.) \"That dark, rich soil started as dead leaves and plants. Tiny creatures and fungi broke it down, and now it's full of nutrients for your new plant.\"\n\n3. **Connect back to the big question (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember our question: Where does a plant get the stuff it needs to grow? Now we have evidence!\"\n   - Point to chart paper observations: \"Your plants grew mostly taller (height increased), and you only added water. You didn't add new soil. So where did the plant get its materials?\"\n   - Guide students to infer: \"Most of the plant's growth came from **water, air, and sunlight**—not from the soil alone.\"\n   - Reference the photograph: \"The plant in the bottle is doing the same thing—it's using air, water, and soil to grow in that recycled bottle.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   Ask: \"If I covered one of your plants completely with a dark box so no light could get in, what do you predict would happen? Why?\" \n   (Listen for responses mentioning sunlight, photosynthesis, or energy. Accept reasonable predictions.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Growth** | When a living thing gets bigger or taller over time. |\n| **Photosynthesis** | The special way plants use sunlight, water, and air to make their own food so they can grow strong. |\n| **Nutrients** | Tiny, important pieces in soil that plants need to be healthy, kind of like vitamins for plants. |\n| **Decompose** | When dead things (like old leaves) break down into smaller and smaller pieces and become part of the soil. |\n| **Roots** | The part of the plant underground that soaks up water and nutrients from the soil. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and explain at least 3 materials plants need to grow (water, air, sunlight).\n- Students understand that most plant growth comes from air and water, not just soil.\n- Students can point to evidence from their own plant observations to support this.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by predicting plant growth under different conditions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student bottle gardens from Explore\n- Additional seeds or seedlings\n- Craft supplies: black paper, plastic wrap, cardboard, string\n- Observation journals\n- Optional: Additional bottles for \"test\" plants\n\n**Activity Option 1: Variable Testing (Recommended)**\n\n1. **Design a test:** \"Now that we know plants need water, air, and sunlight, let's test what happens when we change ONE thing.\"\n\n2. **Guide students to choose one variable to test:** \n   - \"What if we didn't water one plant? What would happen?\"\n   - \"What if we covered one plant so it got no light? What would happen?\"\n   - \"What if we limited the air around the plant?\"\n\n3. **Set up test plants:** \n   - Have students (in pairs or small groups) prepare 2-3 additional bottle gardens with fresh seeds.\n   - One bottle is the **control** (normal care: water, light, air).\n   - One bottle is the **test** (one variable changed, e.g., no light, no water, limited air).\n\n4. **Predict:** \"Before we start, write down what you think will happen. Why do you think that?\"\n\n5. **Observe over 5-7 days:** \n   - Compare the control plant to the test plant daily.\n   - Record which plant looks healthier and why.\n   - Measure and compare heights.\n\n6. **Conclude:** \"What did your test show us about what plants need?\"\n\n**Activity Option 2: Recycled Planter Design Challenge (If time is limited)**\n\n1. **Challenge:** \"Design a label or poster for a recycled bottle planter that explains what a plant needs to grow and how to take care of it.\"\n\n2. **Students create:**\n   - A labeled diagram of their bottle garden showing where the plant gets water, air, and sunlight.\n   - A care instruction card listing the 3 things the plant needs most.\n   - Drawings or descriptions of what would happen if one of these things was missing.\n\n3. **Share and explain:** Students present their designs, explaining their thinking.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate predictions and hypothesis writing without leading answers.\n- Help students set up fair tests (change only one variable).\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why do you think that happened?\" \"What does this tell us about what plants really need?\"\n- Encourage students to compare their test results to their predictions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design a testable prediction about plant growth.\n- Students collect evidence that demonstrates the importance of water, light, and air.\n- Students can explain cause-and-effect relationships: *If* light is removed, *then* the plant stops growing or becomes pale.\n- Students deepened their argument with new evidence.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of where plants get materials for growth.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Used throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation of Explore activities:** Listen to student conversations and check journals. Can students explain *why* their plant grew without adding new soil?\n- **Exit Ticket (administered at end of Explain phase):**\n  - Show a simple diagram of a plant with arrows. Ask: \"Draw or label where this plant gets the three most important things it needs to grow. Write one sentence for each.\"\n  - Correct answer should include: roots absorbing water from soil, leaves taking in air/sunlight from above.\n\n**Summative Assessment (End of lesson):**\n\n**\"Plant Growth Argument\" Writing Prompt:**\n\n*\"Look at the photograph of the plant growing in the recycled bottle. Use what you learned from growing your own plant to answer this question: Where does a plant get the materials it needs to grow? Explain your answer using at least two pieces of evidence from your observations.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies **at least 2-3 materials** plants need (water, air, sunlight, soil nutrients).\n- ✓ Student provides **at least 2 pieces of evidence** from their bottle garden observations (e.g., \"My plant grew taller even though I didn't add new soil, only water,\" \"The plant grew more in sunlight\").\n- ✓ Student explains that **air and water are the main sources**, not soil alone.\n- ✓ Student uses at least **one vocabulary word** from the lesson correctly (growth, photosynthesis, nutrients, decompose).\n- ✓ Answer shows **clear connection** between observations and conclusion.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met the Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Objective | Evidence |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Identify and explain materials plants need | Exit ticket diagram + argument writing; listening to observations during Explore |\n| Design a plant growth system | Bottle garden quality + observation journals showing consistent data |\n| Describe how water moves through a plant | Vocabulary check + explanation of root/leaf function during Explain phase |\n| Argue that plants get most materials from air/water | Summative writing prompt + ability to cite evidence from their own data |\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Sentence starters for writing and speaking:**\n   - \"Plants need _____________ to grow.\"\n   - \"I know this because my plant ______________.\"\n   - \"The soil gives the plant _____________, and the _____________ gives the plant _____________.\"\n   \n2. **Simplified observation sheet:**\n   - Provide a template with drawings (plant, water drop, sun, air) that students check off or circle each day, rather than open-ended journaling.\n   - Use pictures and labels instead of requiring independent writing.\n\n3. **Partner with a peer or aide:**\n   - Pair struggling students with a strong observer who helps them measure accurately and record data consistently.\n   - Provide a pre-recorded or read-aloud video explaining photosynthesis in simple terms.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Design multiple controlled tests:**\n   - Challenge students to test 2-3 variables at once (e.g., one plant with no light, one with no water, one with limited air; compare all three to a control).\n   - Have them create a data table comparing results and draw conclusions about *which* element is most critical.\n\n2. **Research plant adaptation:**\n   - Ask: \"Some plants live in very dry deserts. How do you think they get enough water? Research and sketch a desert plant adaptation.\"\n   - Or: \"Some plants live in dark caves. How do they survive without much light?\"\n\n3. **Design a larger closed ecosystem:**\n   - Provide a sealed terrarium or larger clear container. Challenge students to create a closed system where plants cycle their own water (through condensation) and air.\n   - Predict what will happen and observe weekly.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Create a \"How to Grow a Plant\" how-to guide or infographic:**\n   - Students design a poster or digital infographic for younger students explaining what plants need to grow, using their bottle garden as an example.\n   - Include illustrations, labels, and simple steps for planting a seed.\n\n2. **Investigate decomposition directly:**\n   - Set up a \"decomposition jar\" with layered soil, dead leaves, and food scraps (in a sealed, monitored container outdoors).\n   - Observe over 2-3 weeks how materials break down.\n   - Connect back to how nutrients return to soil, supporting the cycle shown in 5-LS2-1.\n\n3. **Interview a gardener or florist:**\n   - Arrange for a local gardener, greenhouse worker, or school grounds keeper to visit and talk about what plants need, how they choose plants for different environments, and how they recycle materials (compost, rainwater, mulch).\n   - Students prepare questions in advance based on their learning.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Timing:** The Explore phase (growing plants) extends beyond the 2-session window. Conduct observations over 7-10 days, but transition to Explain after 3-4 days of visible growth so learning doesn't stall. Students can continue observing during the transition.\n- **Material sourcing:** Partner with families to collect clean plastic bottles 1-2 weeks before the lesson. Ask for donations of seeds (beans, peas, sunflower seeds germinate quickly and are visible).\n- **Safety:** Supervise cutting of bottles or provide pre-cut bottles. Ensure soil and water are clean and handled hygienically.\n- **Real-world connection:** Display the lesson photograph prominently throughout. Periodically refer back to it: \"Just like this plant in the bottle, your plant is doing the same thing.\"",
