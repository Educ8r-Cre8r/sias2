ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity and wonder about the unusual yellow organism in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of the slime mold (8.5\" × 11\" or larger, or displayed via projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: A small real slime mold specimen in a sealed container (if available in your region)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or document camera without context. Let students look silently for 10-15 seconds, then ask:\n\n   *\"What do you see? What do you notice?\"* (Invite 5-6 responses; accept all answers.)\n\n2. **Pose these wonder questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"Is this alive or not alive? Why do you think that?\"\n   - \"What color is it? Have you ever seen something this color before?\"\n   - \"What do you think this bumpy, squishy-looking thing is used for?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this creature lives, and why is it in all those leaves?\"\n\n3. **Create a class \"Wonder Wall\":** Write student predictions and questions on chart paper. Examples:\n   - \"Is it a plant?\"\n   - \"Does it move?\"\n   - \"What does it eat?\"\n   - \"Why is it so yellow?\"\n\n4. **Make a prediction prompt:** \"Today, we're going to discover what this mystery creature is. I wonder if you can guess: Is it a plant, an animal, or something totally different?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an experiment where we make our own stretchy, spreading creature—like this one—and see how it moves and grows!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how organisms grow and spread by creating a model that mimics slime mold behavior.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 cup of cornstarch\n- ½ cup of water (in a small bowl)\n- 1 plastic plate or shallow tray\n- Yellow food coloring (or use natural yellow materials like torn yellow paper)\n- Spoons for mixing\n- Paper towels\n- Printed observation sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Teacher Prep:** Mix batches ahead of time if time is limited. Alternatively, have students mix their own.\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Pour the cornstarch onto your plate, making a small pile in the center.\"\n\n2. \"Add one drop of water. What happens? Use your spoon to mix slowly.\"\n\n3. \"Keep adding water one drop at a time. Mix carefully. Describe what you see and feel.\"\n\n4. \"Once your mixture looks like thick, gooey slime, use your spoon to push it and stretch it across the plate. Watch how it moves and spreads!\"\n\n5. \"Now, imagine your slime is hunting for food. Make 3-4 'finger' shapes like the yellow blob in our photograph. Push and stretch your slime to reach different corners of the plate.\"\n\n6. **Record observations:** Students draw or write (with teacher support) answers to:\n   - \"What color is your slime?\"\n   - \"What does it feel like? Is it bumpy, smooth, sticky, stretchy?\"\n   - \"How did your slime move when you pushed it?\"\n   - \"Did it spread out like the yellow creature in our photo?\"\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** \n- \"The real yellow slime mold spreads and stretches just like your gooey mixture! It spreads to find food and water in the soil.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: *\"What happens when you add more water?\" \"Can you make your slime stretch like the photograph?\" \"Does it stick together or fall apart?\"*\n- Resist answering directly; instead, guide: *\"What do you notice when you do that?\"*\n- Help students record observations through drawing or verbal description.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a physical model that shows spreading/stretching behavior.\n- Students observe that their \"slime\" changes texture and shape as water is added.\n- Students make connections between their model and the organism in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and clarify what a slime mold is, using evidence from the Explore activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of slime mold (displayed again)\n- Simple diagram of a habitat (leaf litter, soil, water)\n- Optional: Picture cards of other living things (plant, animal, fungus) for comparison\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 4-5 groups: \"How did your slime move and spread?\"\n   - Record key observations on chart paper: *stretches, spreads, gets stickier with water, reaches out like fingers.*\n   - Say: \"The real yellow slime mold in our photograph does exactly this!\"\n\n2. **Introduce the Organism (8 minutes):**\n\n   Use this script:\n   \n   *\"The yellow thing in our picture is called a **slime mold**. It's alive, but it's not a plant and not an animal—it's something special called a fungus. Slime molds are very, very tiny creatures stuck together in a group. When they group together, they look like this yellow blob!\"*\n\n   *\"Why is it yellow? Why is it so bumpy? Those bumps are actually teeny-tiny slime mold bodies. The yellow color helps us see it, but in nature, slime molds can be white, orange, or even red!\"*\n\n   *\"The slime mold spreads across the forest floor, looking for food in dead leaves and sticks. As it moves and spreads, it eats tiny bits of plants and stuff in the soil. Its stretchy, spreading shape helps it reach more food!\"*\n\n3. **Check for Understanding (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Is the slime mold alive? Why?\" (Listen for: moves, grows, spreads, eats, changes.)\n   - Ask: \"How is the slime mold like your gooey slime?\" (Spreads, stretches, changes shape.)\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the slime mold spreads out like fingers?\" (To find food and water.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Slime Mold:** A tiny living organism that spreads across forest floors to find food. It looks like a colorful, bumpy blob.\n- **Living Organism:** Something that is alive and can grow, move, eat, and change.\n- **Habitat:** The place where a living thing lives (like soil, forest floor, or under leaves).\n- **Fungus:** A special kind of living thing that is not a plant or animal; it eats dead stuff to grow.\n- **Spread:** To grow bigger and reach out in different directions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that the slime mold is alive and eats decomposing matter.\n- Students can explain (in simple words) that the stretchy, spreading shape helps the slime mold find food.\n- Students recognize that slime molds are different from animals and plants.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students deepen understanding by designing a structure that mimics the slime mold's spreading adaptation for a specific purpose.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Yellow yarn or string (cut into 6-8 inch pieces)\n- Pipe cleaners (yellow preferred)\n- Playdough or modeling clay (yellow or any color)\n- Paper plate\n- Markers\n- Optional: yellow tissue paper, sponges, craft materials\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario (Teacher presents):**\n*\"Imagine you are a tiny slime mold living in the forest. You need to find water hidden under the leaves and soil. How would you spread your body to reach as much wet soil as possible? Let's design a slime mold body that spreads like the one in our picture!\"*\n\n**Student Task:**\n1. **Design a spreading structure** using craft materials that shows:\n   - A main body (made from clay or crumpled paper)\n   - 4-5 \"fingers\" or branches spreading outward (using yarn, pipe cleaners, or paper strips)\n   - A label explaining: *\"This is how my slime mold spreads to find food and water.\"*\n\n2. **Explain choices:** Students tell a partner or the teacher:\n   - \"Why did you make your slime mold spread in that direction?\"\n   - \"How does spreading help the slime mold survive?\"\n\n3. **Display:** Create a classroom \"Forest Floor\" exhibit by laying student designs on a large sheet of brown paper with drawn soil, leaves, and water spots.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"If your slime mold spreads this way, can it reach more food?\" \"What would happen if it didn't spread?\"*\n- Encourage students to explain their design choices using evidence from the Explore activity.\n- Connect designs back to the photograph: *\"Look at how the real slime mold spreads. Does your design look similar?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a model showing how external structures (spreading \"fingers\") help an organism survive.\n- Students articulate a connection between the organism's shape and its survival need (finding food/water).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of slime molds as living organisms and their adaptation to their habitat.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **During Engage:** Listen to student predictions and questions to gauge prior knowledge.\n- **During Explore:** Observe students' descriptions and drawings of their slime mixture. Do they notice spreading and texture changes?\n- **During Explain:** Ask comprehension questions. Do students identify the slime mold as alive? Can they name its habitat?\n- **During Elaborate:** Review student designs. Do they show understanding that spreading helps the organism survive?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with a simple one-page exit ticket (can be oral, drawn, or written with teacher support):\n\n**Option A (Drawing-Based for Struggling Readers):**\n- \"Draw the yellow slime mold from our photograph.\"\n- \"Draw one way the slime mold's stretchy shape helps it survive.\"\n- \"Is the slime mold alive? Draw or tell me why.\"\n\n**Option B (Oral for All Learners):**\nAsk each student individually (or in small groups):\n1. \"Tell me one thing you learned about the slime mold today.\"\n2. \"How was the slime mold like your gooey slime in the Explore activity?\"\n3. \"Why do you think the slime mold spreads across the forest floor?\"\n\n**Option C (Writing/Drawing Combo for Advanced Learners):**\n- \"Write or draw: The slime mold is alive because...\"\n- \"Explain: How does the slime mold's shape help it find food?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Identify the slime mold as a living organism (evidence: they describe it moving, growing, or eating).\n- ✓ Explain that its spreading shape helps it find food or water.\n- ✓ Draw or describe a connection between the slime mold's body structure and its survival in the forest floor habitat.\n- ✓ Show that they can apply the concept by creating a model with similar spreading characteristics.\n\n**How to Determine if Objectives Were Met:**\n- Collect exit tickets and designs; look for evidence of understanding in drawings, writing, and verbal explanations.\n- Use a simple checklist: Does the student understand (1) what a slime mold is, (2) that it's alive, and (3) how its shape helps it survive?\n- A student \"meets the standard\" if they can explain any two of these concepts clearly.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Introduce only 2-3 key terms (slime mold, alive, spreading) and repeat them throughout the lesson. Provide picture cards to reinforce.\n\n2. **Guided Exploration:** Pair the student with a strong partner during the Explore phase. The teacher pre-mixes one batch of cornstarch slime and walks the student through each step with hand-over-hand support if needed.\n\n3. **Modified Exit Ticket:** Accept one-word or pointing responses. Ask: \"Is this alive?\" \"Does it spread?\" \"Do you see it in the photo?\" Student can simply nod or point instead of drawing.\n\n4. **Concrete Manipulatives:** Provide a pre-made yellow slime mold model (clay blob with pipe cleaner fingers) for the student to touch and examine while you explain concepts.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research Extension:** Provide picture books or digital images of other slime molds in different colors (red, white, orange). Ask: \"Can slime molds be different colors? What do you think?\" Students sort pictures and create a color chart.\n\n2. **Ecosystem Inquiry:** Expand the Elaborate task by asking: \"What other creatures live in the forest floor with the slime mold? Could the slime mold's spreading help or hurt them?\" Students research or hypothesize about forest floor food webs.\n\n3. **Engineering Challenge:** \"Design a tool or structure that could help a slime mold spread even farther to find more food. Draw or build your invention.\" This pushes students toward NGSS 1-LS1-1 (mimicking organism structures to solve problems).\n\n4. **Comparative Life Cycles:** Introduce the question: \"Does a baby slime mold look like its parent?\" Students observe images of slime molds in different growth stages and create a \"before and after\" poster (connecting to 1-LS3-1).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Forest Floor Habitat Box:** Students create a small terrarium or display using a shoe box, moist soil, dead leaves, and a hand-drawn slime mold on yellow paper. They label the habitat with words and pictures: soil, leaves, water, slime mold. This reinforces habitat concepts and can be sent home for family exploration.\n\n2. **Real Slime Mold Observation (If Available):** Contact a local university or nature center to borrow a live slime mold specimen (safely contained). Students observe it over 3-5 days, drawing how its shape changes as it spreads. This extends observation skills and provides authentic science inquiry.\n\n3. **Slime Mold Story/Drama:** Students retell the \"life\" of a slime mold through movement and storytelling: \"First, I am small and hungry. I spread across the forest floor looking for food. I move my fingers this way and that way to find dead leaves. I eat and grow bigger!\" This combines literacy with kinesthetic learning and reinforces the organism's lifecycle and behaviors.\n\n4. **Comparison Chart: Is It Alive?** Create a class chart comparing the slime mold to a plant, an animal, and a rock. Students vote on characteristics: Does it move? Does it eat? Does it grow? Does it live in a habitat? This builds critical thinking and reinforces what \"alive\" means.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** The cornstarch slime is non-toxic, but ensure students do not ingest it and wash hands after the activity.\n- **Sourcing Real Slime Molds:** If you'd like to show students a real specimen (highly recommended), search for \"slime mold cultures\" available through biological supply companies (e.g., Carolina Biological Supply) or contact a local mycology society or university.\n- **Accessibility:** All activities can be adapted for students with fine motor challenges by providing pre-mixed slime and larger craft materials, or by allowing verbal responses instead of drawing.\n- **Connections Across the Week:** Consider spreading this lesson across 2-3 days (one 5E phase per day) to deepen processing time, especially for younger or slower-paced learners.\n- **Family Engagement:** Send home the \"Forest Floor Habitat Box\" with a note inviting families to observe the drawing and discuss: \"Where do you think slime molds live? Have you ever seen one?\" This builds home-school connections.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
