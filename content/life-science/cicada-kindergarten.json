It looks like it is resting in the sun.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image shows a **cicada emergence phenomenon** - when cicadas come out of the ground after living underground for years. The cicada has recently emerged from its nymph shell and is now an adult with wings. This happens because the cicada has completed its life cycle transformation (metamorphosis) from a ground-dwelling nymph to a flying adult. The timing is triggered by soil temperature and the cicada's internal biological clock.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Life Cycles:** Animals go through different stages as they grow and change\n2. **Animal Habitats:** Some animals live underground, others live on trees and in the air\n3. **Animal Body Parts:** Different animals have different body parts that help them survive (wings for flying, strong legs for digging)\n4. **Seasonal Changes:** Some animals appear at certain times of year\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use concrete, hands-on experiences when teaching about life cycles. Having students act out the different stages of a cicada's life (underground nymph, climbing up, adult with wings) helps make abstract concepts tangible for kindergarteners.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to explore this concept: tactile experiences with toy insects, visual life cycle charts with pictures, and audio recordings of actual cicada sounds to engage different learning preferences and abilities.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** Inside the cicada's body are special muscles that make the wings move very fast and create loud buzzing sounds that we can hear from far away.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** Cicadas are part of a big forest community where they provide food for birds, and their empty shells add nutrients to the soil when they decompose.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"The cicada is a butterfly because it has wings\"\n   **Clarification:** Cicadas are different from butterflies - they have clear wings and make buzzing sounds, while butterflies have colorful wings and are silent.\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"Cicadas are scary and will hurt me\"\n   **Clarification:** Cicadas are gentle insects that don't bite or sting people - they only eat tree sap.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** K-LS1-1 Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals need to survive\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:K-LS1.C]] Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms\n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you notice about this bug's body parts? (Bloom's: Observe | DOK: 1)\n2. How do you think this cicada uses its wings? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n3. Why might the cicada choose to sit on this tree branch? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n4. What would happen if there were no trees for cicadas to live on? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Cicada:** A large insect that lives underground and comes out to fly and make loud buzzing sounds\n* **Wings:** Body parts that help insects and birds fly through the air\n* **Insect:** A small animal with six legs and three body parts\n* **Underground:** Below the ground where we walk\n* **Life cycle:** The different stages an animal goes through as it grows up\n\n## 🔗 Cross-Curricular Ideas\n\n1. **Math - Counting and Patterns:** Count the legs on the cicada (6 legs), the wings (2 wings), and the eyes. Create simple patterns using cicada pictures: cicada-tree-cicada-tree. Sort insects by number of legs or wings.\n\n2. **ELA - Storytelling and Sound Words:** Read stories about cicadas and use onomatopoeia to describe cicada sounds (buzz, chirp, hum). Have students create their own short stories about \"A Day in the Life of a Cicada\" with pictures they draw.\n\n3. **Art - Nature Collage and Color Mixing:** Use real leaves, twigs, and colored paper to create a cicada habitat collage. Mix orange, brown, and green paint to match the cicada's natural colors. Trace and paint cicada silhouettes on large paper.\n\n4. **Social Studies - Community Helpers:** Discuss how scientists who study insects (entomologists) help us learn about nature. Talk about how cicadas are part of our natural community and neighborhoods, and why it's important to observe and respect them.\n\n## 🚀 STEM Career Connection\n\n1. **Entomologist (Bug Scientist):** An entomologist studies insects like cicadas to learn how they live, grow, and change. They go outside to find bugs, watch them carefully, and use special tools like magnifying glasses to see tiny details. They help us understand why cicadas are important to nature. \n   **Average Salary:** $65,000 USD per year\n\n2. **Wildlife Photographer:** A wildlife photographer takes beautiful pictures of animals like cicadas in nature. They use special cameras and wait patiently to capture insects doing interesting things. These photos help teach people about animals and nature.\n   **Average Salary:** $48,000 USD per year\n\n3. **Naturalist or Nature Teacher:** A naturalist teaches people about plants and animals in forests and outdoor spaces. They lead nature walks, show people cicadas and other insects, and help everyone learn why it's important to protect nature and habitats.\n   **Average Salary:** $52,000 USD per year\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- Cicadas!
