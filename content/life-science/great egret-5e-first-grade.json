ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity about the egret and activate prior knowledge about birds and their bodies.\n\n#### Materials\n- Printed or projected photograph of the great egret (large enough for all students to see clearly)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Picture cards of different bird beaks (optional, for additional visual reference)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display and Introduce:**\n1. Show the photograph on a large screen or print it poster-sized. Do not explain what you see yet.\n2. Give students 30 seconds of silent looking time. Say: \"Look carefully. What do you see? Just look—don't talk yet.\"\n3. After the quiet time, ask these guiding questions one at a time, allowing 5–10 seconds of think time before taking responses:\n\n   - **\"What animal do you see in this picture? How do you know it's a bird?\"** (Accept: It has wings, a beak, feathers, two legs)\n   - **\"Look at the bird's legs. Why do you think they are so long and skinny? What job might they do?\"** (Students may notice it's standing in or near water; long legs help it walk through water)\n   - **\"See the bird's beak. It looks sharp and pointy. What do you think the bird uses that beak for?\"** (Fishing, catching food)\n   - **\"Where is this bird living? What do you see around it?\"** (Water, plants, rocks, garden, a frog statue) **\"Why do you think the bird likes this place?\"**\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** Say: *\"I'm wondering... if you were a bird with long, skinny legs and a pointy beak, how would those body parts help you find food and stay safe?\"* Write student wonderings on chart paper.\n\n#### Transition\n\"Today, we're going to explore how the egret's body parts—its legs, beak, and neck—help it survive and find food. Let's become bird scientists!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate how an animal's body parts help it survive by mimicking the egret's actions with hands-on materials.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Per student or pair:**\n  - 1 plastic straw or paper tube (to represent the egret's beak/neck)\n  - 1 small cup of water or shallow water tray\n  - 5–8 small pom-poms, pasta pieces, or foam beads (to represent fish or food)\n  - 1 small net, slotted spoon, or child-safe kitchen tongs (to represent different beaks/tools)\n  - 1 piece of chart paper or whiteboard to record observations\n  - Pencil or crayon\n- **Shared materials:**\n  - Aprons or old shirts (optional, but water play can be messy)\n  - Paper towels for cleanup\n\n#### Activity: \"Fishing Like an Egret\"\n\n**Setup (5 minutes):**\n1. Arrange water trays or cups at tables with materials nearby. Explain that each table will have a \"pretend pond.\"\n2. Show students the straw and ask: *\"This straw is like the egret's long, pointy beak. This cup of water is like the pond where the egret hunts. Can you use the straw to catch the fish?\"*\n\n**Student Exploration (12–15 minutes):**\n\nProvide these simple directions:\n\n1. **Look at your straw (beak).** How is it shaped? Why is it long and pointy?\n2. **Try Experiment 1:** Put your straw in the water and try to pick up a pom-pom (pretend fish) by sucking gently or using it like a spear. What happens? Did the straw work well? Record: Draw what you did or write \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n3. **Try Experiment 2:** Now use the spoon or tongs (different \"beaks\") to try catching the same pom-poms. Which tool was easier? Why?\n4. **Try Experiment 3:** Stand on one leg for 10 seconds (like the egret's long legs keep it balanced while hunting). Can you do it? How does standing on long legs help a bird stay balanced in water?\n5. **Record:** On your chart, draw or write which \"beak\" worked best for catching fish and why.\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: *\"What's working? What's hard? Why did that tool work better?\"*\n- Encourage students to try multiple times and compare results.\n- Do NOT tell students the \"right answer\"—let them discover through trial.\n- Guide with questions like: *\"The straw is skinny and pointy like the egret's beak. Does a pointy shape help pick up slippery food?\"*\n- Ensure water stays contained; provide towels as needed.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students discover that different tools work differently for different tasks.\n- They observe that a pointy, long beak is good for fishing but may work differently than a scoop.\n- They notice that the egret's body parts (long legs, pointy beak) are designed specifically for catching fish in water.\n- They document their findings with drawings or simple words.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to how the egret actually survives.\n\n#### Materials\n- Photograph of the great egret (same as Engage)\n- Chart paper\n- Prepared vocabulary cards with images (optional)\n- Picture books: *\"Birds\"* by Kevin Henkes or *\"All Kinds of Animal Feet\"* by Mary R. Dunn (age-appropriate bird books available in most school libraries)\n\n#### Activity: Group Share and Vocabulary Building\n\n**Share Student Findings (5 minutes):**\n1. Ask 3–4 pairs to share what they discovered: *\"Which tool caught fish the best? Why?\"*\n2. Write responses on chart paper, grouping similar observations.\n3. Highlight: *\"Many of you found that the pointy tool—just like the egret's beak—worked best. The egret's body is designed perfectly for fishing!\"*\n\n**Introduce Vocabulary (8–10 minutes):**\n\nPresent each term using the photograph and student discoveries:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **External body parts** | The outside parts of an animal's body that you can see, like legs, wings, beak, and feathers. |\n| **Beak** | The hard, pointed mouth part of a bird. The egret's beak is long and sharp for catching slippery fish. |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives that has everything it needs—water, plants, food, and shelter. This egret's habitat is a garden with water and plants. |\n| **Adapt / Adapted** | When a body part or behavior helps an animal survive in its home. The egret's long, skinny legs are adapted for walking through water. |\n| **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy by finding food, water, and a safe place to live. |\n\n**Connect Back to the Photograph (5–7 minutes):**\n1. Point to the egret's beak in the photo: *\"See this beak? It's long and pointy—just like the tool that worked best in your fishing game! The egret uses it to catch real fish.\"*\n2. Point to its long legs: *\"These legs are long and skinny. Why? So the egret can walk through water without falling over, and it can wade deep to find fish.\"*\n3. Point to the water and plants: *\"This is the egret's habitat—its home. It has water for fishing, plants for hiding, and a safe place to rest.\"*\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\nAsk quick comprehension questions:\n- *\"Show me with your fingers how long the egret's legs are. Why does it need such long legs?\"*\n- *\"If the egret lived in a desert with no water, would its beak and legs still help it? Why or why not?\"* (Plant the seed that animals are suited to their habitats.)\n\n#### Vocabulary\nSee table above.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students can name and point to the egret's external body parts (beak, legs, wings, neck).\n- They understand that each part has a job that helps the egret survive.\n- They connect their hands-on exploration to how the real egret hunts and lives.\n- They use new vocabulary in simple sentences: *\"The egret's beak is long and pointy to catch fish.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply their understanding by designing their own bird-like tool or by exploring how other birds use different body parts to survive.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Option A (Design Challenge):**\n  - Straws, popsicle sticks, pipe cleaners, tape, string\n  - Water trays with pom-poms (from Explore)\n  - Chart paper to sketch designs\n- **Option B (Comparison Activity):**\n  - Picture cards of 4–6 different birds (hummingbird, woodpecker, duck, eagle, parrot, penguin)\n  - Chart with columns: Bird name | Beak shape | Legs | What it eats | Where it lives\n  - Crayons and paper\n\n#### Activity: Choose One\n\n**Option A: \"Design Your Own Egret Tool\"**\n\n1. **Challenge:** *\"Using these materials, can you design a tool that's even better at catching fish than our straw? What would you change?\"*\n2. **Student Steps:**\n   - Sketch a design on paper: *\"Draw your new beak. What shape is it? Long? Curved? Flat?\"*\n   - Build it using straws, sticks, tape, and string.\n   - Test it in the water tray. Does it catch pom-poms?\n   - Modify if needed: *\"If it didn't work, what would you change?\"*\n3. **Share:** Each student shows their design and explains why it works (or doesn't).\n\n**Option B: \"All Kinds of Bird Beaks\"**\n\n1. **Explore:** Show pictures of different birds. Ask: *\"Why do different birds have different beak shapes?\"*\n2. **Match:** Fill in a simple chart together:\n   - Hummingbird: long, thin beak → drinks nectar from flowers\n   - Woodpecker: strong, pointed beak → pecks at tree bark for bugs\n   - Duck: flat, wide beak → scoops water and plants\n   - Eagle: big, curved beak → tears meat\n3. **Discover:** *\"Each bird's beak is designed for the food it eats! The egret's sharp beak is perfect for fish, but a duck's flat beak is better for plants.\"*\n4. **Draw:** Students draw their favorite bird and label its special body parts.\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate and ask: *\"Why did you choose that shape? How does it help the bird?\"*\n- Encourage iteration and testing.\n- Celebrate designs that don't work: *\"What did you learn? How could we fix it?\"*\n- For Option B, guide observations with questions like: *\"Look at the hummingbird's beak. It's tiny and thin. Why would that help it drink from a flower?\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- **Option A:** Students create functional or creative designs and explain the connection between shape and function.\n- **Option B:** Students recognize that different birds have different body parts suited to their food and habitat.\n- Both options deepen understanding of adaptation: *\"Body parts match what an animal needs to survive.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of how animals' external body parts help them survive.\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n- Circulate during Explore and Elaborate; listen and record student explanations.\n- Ask probing questions: *\"Tell me why the egret needs a long beak.\"* (Listen for: catching fish, reaching into water, sharp for gripping.)\n- Review student drawings and charts from Explore for evidence of understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5–10 minutes):**\n\nAdminister one of these (choose based on student readiness):\n\n**Option 1: Draw and Label (All students)**\n- Provide a simple outline drawing of an egret.\n- Students label: beak, legs, wing, and then draw or write one thing each part does.\n- **Success Criteria:** \n  - At least 2 body parts labeled correctly.\n  - 1–2 sensible descriptions of what each part does (e.g., \"beak catches fish,\" \"legs walk in water\").\n\n**Option 2: Answer Three Questions**\n1. *\"What does the egret's beak look like? Why is it shaped that way?\"*\n2. *\"The egret lives in a garden with water and plants. Why is this a good home for it?\"*\n3. *\"If you were an egret, which body part would you use to catch your dinner? Why?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student responses show understanding that body parts are designed for survival.\n- Answers reference the photograph or Explore activities.\n- Language is simple but accurate (e.g., *\"The beak is pointy. It catches fish.\"*).\n\n**Option 3: Picture Sort (For students needing visual support)**\n- Show 4–5 cards: egret with fish, duck in pond, woodpecker on tree, hummingbird at flower, eagle in sky.\n- Ask: *\"Which bird do you think uses its beak to catch fish? Point to it. Why?\"*\n- **Success Criteria:** Student correctly identifies egret and gives a reason related to body parts or habitat.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- **Meets Expectations:** Student identifies egret body parts, describes at least one function (e.g., beak catches fish), and makes a simple connection to survival.\n- **Approaches:** Student identifies 1–2 body parts and describes a function with prompting.\n- **Below:** Student needs additional support; revisit vocabulary and photograph together one-on-one.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n1. **Reduce Explore task:** Simplify to one water tray and one \"beak\" tool per pair. Pre-cut all materials; eliminate building step.\n2. **Visual supports:** Use a labeled photograph of the egret; point to each body part as you name it. Use real pictures of birds, not drawings.\n3. **Sentence frame for explanation:** Provide: *\"The egret's ______ helps it ______.\"* Students fill in the blanks with vocabulary cards or your guidance.\n4. **One-on-one check-in:** During Elaborate, sit with student; ask simpler questions: *\"Is this beak long or short? Do you see legs?\"* Affirm correct observations.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n1. **Deeper design challenge:** *\"What if the egret had to catch fish in muddy water where it can't see? How would you change its beak to feel the fish instead?\"* Students design and explain adaptations.\n2. **Research task:** Assign a different bird (heron, crane, stork). Student finds a picture, identifies body parts, and shares: *\"How is this bird like the egret? How is it different?\"*\n3. **Habitat mismatch:** Show a photo of an egret in a desert or forest. Ask: *\"Would this habitat work for the egret? Why or why not? What would the egret need?\"*\n4. **Compare two parents and offspring:** Read a simple book (e.g., *\"Click, Clack, Moo\"* or nature text) showing baby and adult birds. Ask: *\"How are the baby egret's legs and beak similar to or different from its parent?\"* (Anticipates 1-LS1-2.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Beaks Around the World:** Create a classroom display of pictures of 8–10 different bird beaks (pelican, parrot, hummingbird, toucan, owl, penguin). Students sort them by shape (long, short, curved, flat, strong) and predict what each bird eats. Later, reveal the correct food. Discussion: *\"Our prediction about beak shape helped us guess what birds eat!\"*\n\n2. **Design a Bird House for the Egret:** Students design and draw a bird house or habitat for an egret. What must it have? (Water, tall plants for hiding, rocks or shallow ground to stand on.) Build one from a shoebox, adding water, plants, and sand. Place a plastic egret figure inside. Discuss: *\"Does this habitat have everything the egret needs to survive?\"*\n\n3. **Bird Behavior Observation:** If possible, visit a local pond, park, or outdoor space to observe real birds (ducks, herons, robins). Students record: What does the bird's beak do? How does it use its legs? What is it eating? Return to class and compare observations to the egret. Reading connection: Pair with *\"Listening Walk\"* by Paul Showers or simple field guides to local birds.\n\n---\n\n**Lesson created with First Grade developmental readiness and NGSS 1-LS1-1 and 1-LS1-2 standards in mind. All activities are hands-on, language is concrete, and connections to the photograph are explicit throughout.**",
