Identify and label the major reproductive parts of a flower (stamen, pistil, pollen) and explain the function of each part.\n2. Construct an argument explaining how flowers depend on materials from air and water for reproduction and growth.\n3. Develop a model showing how pollen moves from one flower to another and why this is important for plant survival.\n4. Analyze how flower structures and colors are adaptations that help plants reproduce by attracting pollinators.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about flower structures and spark questions about how flowers make new plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large projection of the photograph (flower_parts.jpg) or printed copies (one per 2-3 students)\n- Sticky notes or index cards\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around printed copies. Ask students to observe in silence for 30 seconds without speaking.\n\n2. **Pose opening discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about this flower? What parts can you see?\"\n   - \"Those tiny yellow things on the stamen — what do you think they are, and why might they be important?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this flower is bright pink? What might that bright color be 'trying to do'?\"\n   - \"If flowers are the part of a plant that makes seeds, what structures inside the flower might help make seeds?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder how this flower gets turned into a fruit with seeds inside. What do you think has to happen?\" Encourage students to write or draw their predictions on sticky notes and post them on a class \"Wonder Wall.\"\n\n4. **Acknowledge and validate all predictions** — tell students that today they will be scientists discovering exactly what happens inside flowers.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore real flowers up close and discover what each part does and why it matters for making new plants.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate flower structures firsthand and observe pollen, discovering the connection between flower parts and reproduction.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Fresh flowers (carnations, lilies, hibiscus, or other large flowers with visible stamens and pistils) — one per pair of students\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- White paper or paper towels\n- Pencils and colored pencils\n- Observation recording sheets (provided below)\n- Optional: microscopes with slides (if available)\n- Small containers for pollen collection\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Obtain your flower.** With your partner, place it on white paper. Do NOT eat any part or put it in your mouth.\n\n2. **Examine the outside.** Use your hand lens to look closely at the petals. Draw what you see. Notice the color and texture.\n\n3. **Look inside the flower.** Gently pull back or bend the petals to see inside. Locate the tall structures in the center — these are called the pistil (the female part) and the stamen (the male parts).\n\n4. **Investigate the stamen.** Look at the tips of the stamen using your hand lens. These tips produce pollen. **Carefully** rub your finger or a piece of paper on the stamen tips and observe what comes off. This yellow/orange powder is pollen.\n\n5. **Collect and observe pollen.** If using a microscope, place a tiny bit of pollen on a slide and observe under magnification. Draw what you see.\n\n6. **Locate the pistil.** Find the tall, club-shaped structure in the very center. This is where seeds will form. At the top is the stigma — a sticky part designed to catch pollen.\n\n7. **Record your observations.** On your observation sheet, label and draw each flower part you found. Write a sentence about what each part looks like and what you think it does.\n\n**Recording Sheet Template (provide to students):**\n```\nMy Flower Observations\n\nFlower type: ________________\n\nPart Name | What It Looks Like | What I Think It Does\nPetals    |                    |\nStamen    |                    |\nPollen    |                    |\nPistil    |                    |\nStigma    |                    |\n```\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What color is the pollen? Where exactly did you find it? What does the stigma feel like when you touch it gently?\"\n- Encourage students to use hand lenses and magnifying tools to see detail.\n- Gently redirect if students are rough with flowers — remind them that they're scientists handling delicate research materials.\n- Take photos of student observations for discussion in the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and document flower structures with sketches and descriptions.\n- Students collect pollen and observe it, noting its color and texture.\n- Students predict or hypothesize the function of each part based on structure (e.g., \"The sticky stigma catches things\").\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific explanations of flower reproduction; connect observations to how flowers help plants survive and grow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Diagram of flower parts (prepared in advance or co-created with students)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: Cross-section diagrams of flowers showing internal seed development\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Invite sharing from Explore.** Ask 2-3 student pairs to show their observations and describe what they found. Display photos taken during exploration.\n\n2. **Co-construct a labeled flower diagram** on chart paper as students share. As each part is named, add the vocabulary term and a brief description of its function.\n\n3. **Introduce and define key vocabulary:**\n\n   - **Stamen:** The male reproductive part of a flower that produces pollen. (Point to the structures with the yellow powder on your diagram.)\n   - **Pistil:** The female reproductive part of a flower where seeds develop. It has three main sections: the stigma (sticky tip), style (tube), and ovary (base).\n   - **Pollen:** Tiny yellow or orange powder produced by the stamen that contains male cells. It must travel to the pistil to make seeds.\n   - **Pollination:** The process of pollen traveling from the stamen of one flower to the stigma of another flower (or the same flower). Insects, wind, and water help move pollen.\n   - **Stigma:** The sticky tip of the pistil designed to catch and hold pollen.\n\n4. **Explain the connection to plant survival and growth:**\n   - \"For plants to make seeds and new plants, pollen must move from the stamen to the stigma. This is called pollination.\"\n   - \"Once pollen lands on the stigma, it travels down to the ovary, where seeds form.\"\n   - \"Flowers have bright colors and sweet smells to attract bees, butterflies, and other insects. These animals move pollen from flower to flower as they collect nectar and pollen. This is an example of how plants, animals, and the environment work together — a community!\"\n   - \"Without pollination, flowers cannot make seeds, and without seeds, new plants cannot grow.\"\n\n5. **Connect to NGSS 5-LS1-1:** Ask students: \"A flower needs materials to grow. We know plants get water from soil and air through their leaves. But how does a flower get the 'stuff' it needs to make seeds? The answer is that pollen from another flower brings genetic information. But the flower also needs water and nutrients to build seeds. These come from water and air through the plant's roots, stems, and leaves. So even though we can't see it, air and water are helping the flower create new seeds.\"\n\n6. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Can anyone explain why the stamen and pistil are inside the flower?\" (They're the reproductive parts that make seeds.)\n   - \"Why do you think pollen is sticky or has a texture to it?\" (So it sticks to insects and moves to other flowers.)\n   - \"What would happen if flowers didn't have bright colors?\" (Insects might not notice them, pollen wouldn't move, and seeds wouldn't form.)\n\n**Vocabulary Chart (Display and keep posted):**\n| Term | Definition | What It Does |\n|------|-----------|--------------|\n| **Stamen** | Male reproductive part | Produces pollen |\n| **Pistil** | Female reproductive part | Receives pollen and develops seeds |\n| **Pollen** | Tiny powder from stamen | Carries male cells for reproduction |\n| **Stigma** | Sticky top of pistil | Catches pollen |\n| **Pollination** | Movement of pollen between flowers | Enables seed and fruit formation |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can label and identify flower parts on a diagram.\n- Students understand that flowers reproduce through pollination.\n- Students can explain that plants need air and water to grow, and that pollination connects plants to animals and the environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by modeling pollination and analyzing how flower traits help plants survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small bowls or cups (one per pair)\n- Powdered sugar or baby powder (as pollen substitute)\n- Paintbrushes or cotton swabs\n- Index cards (cut to represent flowers with stigmas)\n- Craft flowers or pictures of various flowers\n- Chart showing flower colors and pollinators\n- Video clip: \"How Pollination Works\" (optional: 3-5 minute animated video available on YouTube or Khan Academy Kids)\n\n**Activity Option 1: Pollination Model (Hands-On)**\n\n1. **Set up the activity:** Each pair receives bowls of powdered sugar (simulating pollen), paintbrushes (simulating insect legs), and index cards with small circles drawn on them (simulating stigmas).\n\n2. **Simulate pollination:** Students dip the paintbrush into the powder, then brush it onto the circles on the index cards, transferring the \"pollen\" as an insect would.\n\n3. **Observe and count:** Students count how many \"pollen grains\" (powder particles) transferred in each attempt. They record whether the stigma was successfully \"pollinated.\"\n\n4. **Variation:** Students try different methods — some use an actual flower's stamen, some use different brushes, some try with wet vs. dry stigma circles. Discuss which method transfers the most pollen and why.\n\n5. **Reflect:** \"What does this model show us about how insects help flowers? If there were no insects, how might pollen travel differently?\" (Wind, water, or self-pollination.)\n\n**Activity Option 2: Flower Trait Analysis (Critical Thinking)**\n\n1. **Show a chart of different flowers** with various colors, sizes, shapes, and scents.\n\n2. **Provide information cards** describing which pollinators visit each flower (e.g., \"Bright red flowers attract hummingbirds,\" \"Flowers that smell like rotten meat attract flies\").\n\n3. **Ask students:** \"Why do you think different flowers have different colors and smells? How does this help the plant survive?\" Students work in pairs to match flowers to their pollinators and explain their reasoning in writing.\n\n4. **Group discussion:** Emphasize that flower color, size, and scent are **adaptations** — traits that help plants survive by attracting the right pollinators to move their pollen.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- For the pollination model: Ask probing questions like \"Did all the pollen transfer? What surprised you? How is this like what a real bee does?\"\n- For the trait analysis: Guide students to make connections between structure and function — \"What's the advantage of being bright red if hummingbirds like red?\" (Hummingbirds visit, move pollen, seeds form, plant survives.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a working model showing how pollen transfers from one flower to another.\n- Students can explain how flower adaptations (color, scent, shape) serve the function of attracting pollinators.\n- Students articulate the connection: flower traits → pollinator attraction → pollen transfer → seed formation → plant survival.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of flower structures, pollination, and plant-pollinator relationships.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student sketches and labels during Explore phase.\n- Listen to student explanations during group share-outs.\n- Monitor responses during vocabulary introduction and check-for-understanding questions.\n- Observe student reasoning during Elaborate activities.\n\n**Exit Ticket Assessment (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket. Read questions aloud for students who need support. Students may draw, write, or use a combination.\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Label the Diagram:** Provide a simple unlabeled diagram of a flower. Students label: petals, stamen, pollen, pistil, stigma. (Assess: Vocabulary and part identification)\n\n2. **Function Match:** \n   - Match the flower part to what it does:\n   - Stamen _____ makes seeds\n   - Pistil _____ produces pollen\n   - Pollen _____ travels to other flowers\n   - Stigma _____ catches pollen\n\n   (Assess: Understanding of function)\n\n3. **Short Answer (with visual support if needed):**\n   - \"Why is it important for pollen to move from one flower to another?\" \n   - Expected response: \"So the flower can make seeds and new plants can grow\" or \"Because the pistil needs pollen to make seeds.\"\n\n   (Assess: Understanding of pollination's role in reproduction)\n\n4. **Critical Thinking:**\n   - \"A flower is bright red and has a sweet smell. Why might these traits help the plant survive?\"\n   - Expected response: References to attracting pollinators (insects, bees, hummingbirds) who move pollen.\n\n   (Assess: Connection between adaptation and survival)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Proficient:** Student labels all flower parts correctly, matches functions accurately, and explains pollination's role in seed formation and plant survival. Student makes a connection between flower traits and pollinator attraction.\n- **Developing:** Student labels most flower parts, matches most functions, and provides a basic explanation of pollination. May need additional support with the adaptation connection.\n- **Beginning:** Student identifies some flower parts but needs support with vocabulary and function. Explanation of pollination is unclear or incomplete.\n\n**Summative Assessment Option (End of Unit):**\n\n**Pollination Explanation Task:** \n- Students write or verbally explain: \"A bee visits a yellow flower to collect nectar. Pollen sticks to the bee's legs. The bee flies to another yellow flower. Use what you know about flower parts to explain what happens next and why it's important for plants.\"\n- Students include labeled diagrams or sketches.\n- Success: Explanation includes stamen, pistil, pollen, pollination, and reference to seed formation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 80% of students correctly identify and label flower parts.\n- At least 75% of students explain the role of pollination in reproduction.\n- At least 70% of students connect flower adaptations to pollinator attraction and plant survival.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a chart with just the 3 most essential terms (stamen, pollen, pistil) with illustrations and simplified definitions. Reduce the number of terms students must master; focus on core concepts.\n\n2. **Structured Observation Guide:** Provide a partially completed observation sheet with labeled diagrams and fill-in-the-blank sentences (e.g., \"The stamen makes _____.\"). Students complete rather than create from scratch.\n\n3. **Pre-Teaching with Real Flowers:** Before the full lesson, show struggling learners an actual flower with parts clearly visible and talk through each part using concrete, simple language. Practice identifying parts in advance so they feel confident during Explore.\n\n4. **Buddy System:** Pair struggling learners with advanced peers during Explore and Elaborate activities. Assign specific roles (e.g., one student observes and draws while the other records; one student manipulates the flower while the other watches and asks questions).\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Deep Dive into Specific Pollinators:** Provide research resources (books, websites) about a specific pollinator (bees, butterflies, hummingbirds, bats). Students investigate: How does this animal's body match flower structures? How has the flower evolved to match the pollinator? Create a detailed poster or presentation.\n\n2. **Comparative Flower Study:** Challenge students to obtain 3-4 different types of flowers and compare their structures. Create a data table identifying differences (number of stamens, color, scent, size) and hypothesize which pollinators visit each. Support hypothesis with evidence from research.\n\n3. **Self-Pollination vs. Cross-Pollination:** Introduce the concept that some plants pollinate themselves while others require pollen from a different plant. Challenge students to research examples and explain the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy.\n\n4. **Model Refinement:** After the basic pollination model, ask advanced learners to redesign it to show a specific scenario: \"Create a model showing how wind pollination works differently than insect pollination\" or \"Design a model showing what happens to pollen after it reaches the stigma.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Flower Dissection Journal (Follow-Up Lab):**\n   - Provide students with fresh flowers they can carefully dissect over multiple days.\n   - Challenge them to locate and identify seeds developing inside the ovary (if fruit has already begun forming).\n   - Have students create a detailed scientific journal with labeled diagrams, descriptions, and predictions about seed formation.\n   - **NGSS Connection:** Supports 5-LS2-1 by showing the movement of materials from flower structures into developing seeds.\n\n2. **Seed Saving Project:**\n   - Help students collect mature seeds from flowers in the school garden or local area.\n   - Students plant seeds and monitor germination and growth over several weeks.\n   - Create a data table tracking growth and relating it back to the water and air the seedling receives.\n   - **NGSS Connection:** Directly supports 5-LS1-1 by allowing students to observe how plants use air and water for growth.\n\n3. **Pollinator Field Study or Virtual Investigation:**\n   - If possible, take students outside to observe pollinators visiting flowers in a school garden or local park.\n   - Students sketch pollinators, observe which flowers they visit, and collect data on pollinator-flower interactions.\n   - If field study isn't possible, use video clips or virtual resources (iNaturalist, nature webcams) to observe pollinator behavior.\n   - Students create a chart or infographic showing pollinator-flower relationships they observed.\n   - **NGSS Connection:** Provides evidence for 5-LS2-1 by demonstrating how energy and matter move between plants, animals, and the environment through pollination.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
