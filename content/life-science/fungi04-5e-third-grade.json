Identify fungi as living organisms that have their own life cycles including growth and reproduction.\n2. Explain that fungi need specific habitat conditions (moisture, darkness, dead organic matter) to survive and grow.\n3. Describe the role of fungi in breaking down dead plant and animal matter and returning nutrients to soil.\n4. Construct an argument that fungi are important to forest ecosystems because they help other living things survive.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the mysterious pink structures in the forest and activate thinking about living things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of the fungi (or displayed on projector/screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"I Notice, I Wonder\" graphic organizer (teacher-prepared, one per student OR projected)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen without any context. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (write student responses on chart paper):\n   - \"What do you notice about these pink, bumpy things in the picture? What do they look like?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this picture was taken? What clues tell you that?\"\n   - \"Are these plants, animals, or something else? How do you know?\"\n   - \"What do you wonder about these strange-looking things?\"\n\n3. **Complete an \"I Notice, I Wonder\" chart together:**\n   - Left column: Students share observations they see (color, texture, shape, where it's growing)\n   - Right column: Students share questions they have (Is it alive? Can it move? Does it grow? What eats it?)\n\n4. **Make a prediction:** \"Today we're going to discover that these mysterious things are actually living organisms called fungi. Fungi are all around us, even in places we can't see them! Can you guess what fungi might do in the forest?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now it's time to get hands-on and do some detective work to figure out what these organisms are and why they matter to the forest.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the structure, habitat needs, and role of fungi through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (reference copy for each group or visible on screen)\n- Pre-made \"Decomposition Detective Kit\" for each group (contains):\n  - Dead leaves and twigs (collected beforehand)\n  - A dark, damp cloth or paper towel\n  - A small container or plate\n  - Hand lenses (magnifying glasses)\n- Exploration Recording Sheet (teacher-prepared with boxes for sketches and observations)\n- Pencils\n- Optional: Real mushroom or fungus specimen in a clear container (if safely available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Observation of Fungal Structures (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Provide each group with a hand lens and a reference image of the photograph.\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Look very carefully at the photograph with your magnifying glass. What shapes do you see? Are they all the same size?\"\n   - \"Some fungi grow in bumpy clusters like in the picture. Some look like umbrellas (mushrooms). Some look like jelly or warts. Sketch what you see on your recording sheet.\"\n   - \"Notice: What is growing on? Is it on dead wood? Is it in soil?\"\n   - Record: \"Does the fungus appear wet or dry? Where is it growing—in a dark, damp place?\"\n\n3. **Teacher Role:** Circulate with questions like: \"What texture do you think this would feel like if you could touch it?\" \"Why might fungi grow on dead wood instead of living trees?\" (Don't answer—just prompt thinking.)\n\n**Part 2: Simulating Fungal Habitat (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up Decomposition Detective Kit:** Each group arranges their dead leaves and twigs on a plate, covers them with the damp cloth, and places them in a dark corner of the classroom (under a desk, in a box, or in a dimly lit space).\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Fungi love moisture and darkness. We're going to create the perfect home for fungi by keeping our leaves damp and dark.\"\n   - \"Over the next week, we'll keep these leaves moist and observe where fungi might begin to grow, just like in the photograph.\"\n   - \"Each day, peek at your leaves and sketch any changes on your recording sheet. Do you see any fuzzy growth? Any color changes? Any moisture?\"\n\n3. **Record Observations:** Students draw and label what they observe on Day 1 (should show dead leaves, moisture). They'll add sketches on Days 3, 5, and 7.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify that fungi grow on dead organic matter (leaves, twigs, wood)\n- Students recognize that fungi need moisture and darkness\n- Students begin to see evidence that fungi are living things that grow and change\n- Over one week, students may observe mold or fungal growth, providing real evidence\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and ecological concepts about fungi, connecting to Explore discoveries.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms pre-written\n- Reference photograph (visible to all)\n- Picture cards or simple drawings showing: decomposer, spore, mycelium, habitat\n- Student science journals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out from Explore Phase (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their observations and sketches from the Decomposition Detective Kit.\n   - Ask: \"What did you notice about where fungi like to grow? What conditions did we give them?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary** (using the photograph as a visual anchor):\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n   - **Fungi (or Fungus):** A living organism that is not a plant or animal. Fungi can't make their own food like plants do, but they can grow and reproduce. The pink bumpy things in the photo are fungi!\n   \n   - **Decomposer:** A living thing that breaks down dead plants and animals and turns them into nutrients that go back into the soil. Fungi are decomposers—they eat dead things!\n   \n   - **Habitat:** The special place where an organism lives and finds everything it needs to survive. For fungi, the habitat is damp, dark, and has dead leaves or wood.\n   \n   - **Spores:** Tiny, tiny pieces that fungi release to make new fungi, kind of like seeds. They float through the air and land on dead wood or leaves.\n   \n   - **Mycelium:** The invisible threads of the fungus that spread through soil and dead wood, breaking it down from the inside. We can't see the mycelium, but the bumpy fungi we see in the photo are just the fruit that the mycelium makes!\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - \"Look at the photo again. Those pink, bumpy clusters? Those are the fruiting bodies that the fungus makes. Underneath the wood, invisible threads called mycelium are breaking down the dead wood into nutrients.\"\n   - Point to the dark wood in the photo: \"That's the fungus's habitat—wet, dark, and full of dead material to break down.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"If fungi need moisture and darkness to grow, why would they grow well in a forest instead of in a sunny, dry desert?\"\n   - \"Fungi break down dead leaves. Where do those nutrients go? Who might use them?\" (Plants, other organisms in the soil)\n   - Show a quick picture of a mushroom or mold and ask: \"Is this a fungus? How do you know?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define fungi as decomposers\n- Students understand that fungi have specific habitat needs\n- Students recognize that fungi play a role in nutrient cycling\n- Students can identify fungi as living things with their own life cycles\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of fungi to ecosystems and deepen thinking about fungal roles in nature.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper (11\" x 14\") or poster board\n- Markers, colored pencils, crayons\n- Pre-drawn Forest Ecosystem Diagram (teacher-prepared, showing: soil, dead log, living plants, animals, sun, moisture)\n- Index cards with organism names (tree, deer, fungus, bacteria, earthworm, plant roots)\n- Glue sticks\n- Reference chart from Explain phase (visible)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: \"Fungi Role in the Forest\" Poster (recommended for deeper engagement)**\n\n1. **Present a Scenario:** \"Imagine a big oak tree falls down in the forest. Without fungi, what would happen to that dead tree? Would it stay there forever? Let's think about what fungi do for the forest!\"\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"You're going to create a picture showing how fungi help the forest by breaking down a dead log.\"\n   - \"Draw a dead tree or log as the center of your poster.\"\n   - \"Add fungi growing on or near the log (use pink and red like in our photo!).\"\n   - \"Around the log, draw or paste pictures of other living things that benefit from the fungi breaking down the wood: earthworms, plants growing in rich soil, insects, etc.\"\n   - \"Use arrows to show how nutrients from the dead wood go into the soil and help other organisms.\"\n   - \"Write a label: 'Fungi are nature's recyclers!'\"\n\n3. **Teacher Role:** \n   - Circulate with prompts: \"Why do you think the earthworm would be near where fungi are breaking down the log?\" \"Where does the nutrient-rich soil go after the fungi break down the wood?\"\n   - Affirm connections between fungi and forest health\n\n4. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Visual representation showing fungi as decomposers\n   - Evidence of understanding that fungi's work benefits other organisms\n   - Use of vocabulary from Explain phase\n\n**Option B: \"Fungi Habitat Comparison\" Chart (for shorter time frame)**\n\n1. Create a T-chart on poster board labeled: \"Where Fungi Grow Well\" / \"Where Fungi Don't Grow Well\"\n\n2. Students brainstorm and draw/write examples:\n   - **Grows Well:** Wet forest, under a log, in soil with dead leaves, dark basement, moldy bread left in a sealed bag\n   - **Don't Grow Well:** Sunny windowsill, dry desert, inside a freezer, dry wood in the sun\n\n3. Students explain their reasoning using habitat vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fungi as living organisms, their habitats, and their ecological role.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Exit Ticket template (teacher-prepared)\n- Student science journals\n- Observation notes from Explore phase\n- Posters/charts from Elaborate phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage discussion\n- Listen to reasoning during Explore (\"Why are we keeping the leaves moist?\")\n- Monitor vocabulary use and comprehension during Explain vocabulary check\n- Review Elaborate poster sketches and labels for evidence of understanding\n\n**Exit Ticket Assessment (End of Lesson Day 1 or 2):**\n\nProvide each student with this Exit Ticket. They can draw, write, or dictate:\n\n**Question 1:** \"Look at this picture of a dead log in the forest. Draw or write: What is one thing fungi do to help the forest?\"\n\n**Question 2:** \"Fungi need three things to grow: moisture, darkness, and dead material. Which of these three things can you find in a forest? Circle them.\"\n\n**Question 3:** \"Is fungi a living thing? How do you know? Draw or write your answer.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student correctly identifies fungi as living decomposers; explains that fungi break down dead material; identifies habitat needs (moisture, darkness, dead matter); makes connection to forest ecosystem (nutrients returned to soil).\n\n✓ **Approaching:** Student identifies fungi as a living thing; describes one or two functions of fungi; identifies one or two habitat needs with prompting.\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student can point to fungi in a photo; needs significant support to explain what fungi do or where they live.\n\n**Evidence Gathering:**\n- Collect Exit Tickets\n- Review sketches from Decomposition Detective Kit (especially observations over Week 1)\n- Take photos of Elaborate posters\n- Listen to student explanations during discussions\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Cards:** Provide picture + word cards with one-sentence definitions that students can reference during all phases. Pair students with stronger readers to discuss vocabulary.\n\n2. **Structured Sentence Frames:** Provide sentence starters for Exit Ticket and discussions:\n   - \"Fungi are living things because they __________.\"\n   - \"Fungi like to grow in places that are __________ and __________.\"\n   - \"Fungi help the forest by __________.\"\n\n3. **Small Group Explore:** Conduct Explore phase with small group, using real fungus specimen (if available) or larger reference images so students can see details with hand lens support. Provide one-on-one scribing help for recording sheets.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research Extension:** Have students investigate \"Good Fungi vs. Bad Fungi\"—research one beneficial fungus (mushroom for food, fungi that help tree roots) and one that causes problems (mold that spoils food, fungal disease on plants). Create a comparison poster with drawings and facts.\n\n2. **Ecosystem Cycle Diagram:** Challenge students to create a more detailed cycle diagram showing how fungi fit into the carbon/nutrient cycle—starting with a dead organism, through fungal decomposition, to nutrients in soil, to plant growth. Use arrows and labels to show each step.\n\n3. **Prediction & Observation Task:** Ask: \"What would happen to a forest if there were no fungi?\" Have students predict and explain in writing, then check their predictions against observations from the Decomposition Detective Kit over one week. Revise explanations based on actual fungal growth they observe.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Mold Investigation Lab (1 week observation):**\n   - Place identical pieces of bread, fruit, or cheese in four different environments: sunny windowsill (dry), sunny windowsill (moist), dark cabinet (dry), dark cabinet (moist).\n   - Students predict which will grow mold first, then observe daily.\n   - Results reinforce that fungi need moisture AND darkness.\n   - Create a graph showing which condition grew mold fastest; discuss why.\n\n2. **Fungal Fruiting Bodies Field Exploration:**\n   - After a rainy day, take students on a outdoor walk around school or nature area to search for mushrooms, toadstools, or fungi.\n   - Students photograph or sketch fungi they find and note the location (on dead log, in grass, near tree roots, etc.).\n   - Return to classroom and match observations to habitat requirements learned in lesson (\"Why did we find that mushroom in that spot?\").\n\n3. **Decomposition Time-Lapse Project (2-3 week extension):**\n   - Set up the Decomposition Detective Kits from Explore as permanent classroom observation stations.\n   - Students take photos or sketches every 2-3 days for 3 weeks.\n   - Create a time-lapse slideshow or poster showing progression from fresh leaves → visible fungal growth → nutrient-rich soil.\n   - Write captions explaining each stage using vocabulary from the lesson.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Safety:** If using real fungal specimens or allowing students to handle decomposing materials, ensure hand-washing after activities. Do not allow students to eat any mushrooms or fungi, even edible varieties, without expert identification and explicit permission.\n  \n- **Timing:** The Decomposition Detective Kit observations extend over one week, so plan accordingly. Days 3, 5, and 7 observations can happen during morning meetings or designated observation time.\n\n- **Connection to Weather:** This lesson works beautifully after rain, when fungi may naturally appear on school grounds or in provided habitat kits. Plan it for fall or spring when conditions are naturally damp.\n\n- **Real Specimens:** If you can find a safe fungus specimen (puffball, shelf fungus, or store-bought mushroom), allow students to observe it safely with a hand lens. Seeing the real structure reinforces the lesson.",
