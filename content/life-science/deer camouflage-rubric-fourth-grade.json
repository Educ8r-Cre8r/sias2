        "exceeds": "Student predicts that summer fur would be lighter (reddish-brown) to match green plants and winter fur would be darker/thicker to match snow or bare branches, explaining that camouflage changes with seasonal habitat changes.",

        "exceeds": "Student names multiple animals with camouflage (e.g., rabbits, squirrels, snakes) and explains specific similarities and differences, such as how a rabbit's brown fur blends like the deer's or how a snake's patterns differ from solid colors.",
        "meets": "Student names at least one other animal that uses camouflage and identifies a reasonable similarity or difference, such as both using brown colors or one using patterns while the other uses solid colors.",
