Identify and describe external structures of animals that help them survive in their environments (camouflage, coloring, patterns).\n2. Construct an argument with evidence explaining how an animal's color and pattern serve as adaptations for survival.\n3. Recognize that animals use their senses to detect their surroundings and respond to environmental conditions (such as hiding when threatened).\n4. Apply their understanding of camouflage by predicting whether an organism would be successful in different habitats based on its appearance.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about how animals blend into environments using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the camouflaged moth on bark with fallen leaves\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the screen or as a printed image visible to all students. Do NOT identify what the animal is yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (record student responses on chart paper):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me everything you notice.\"\n   - \"Is there an animal here? Where do you think it might be hiding?\"\n   - \"Why would an animal want to look like its surroundings?\"\n   - \"What color is the animal, and why do you think it has that color instead of being bright red or blue?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder if this animal is trying to hide from something... What might be chasing it, and how does looking like the tree bark help it survive?\"\n\n4. **Reveal the animal slowly** by pointing out the moth's wings, antennae, and body shape. Ask: \"Why is this coloring a superpower for this animal?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to discover how animals' colors and patterns help them stay safe in the wild, and we'll become detectives finding hidden animals!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate camouflage through hands-on observation and simulation, discovering how external structures help animals survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-prepared \"camouflage cards\" (small colored paper cutouts: 10 brown, 10 gray, 5 bright red, 5 neon green; laminated or sturdy)\n- Natural environments in containers or photos (one with brown/gray bark and leaves, one with green grass, one with colorful flowers)\n- Stopwatch or timer\n- Data recording sheet (see below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Predator-Prey Simulation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide the class into pairs. One student is a \"predator,\" the other is an \"ecologist\" (observer).\n\n2. **Setup:** Display one natural environment image on the board (e.g., forest floor with bark and leaves).\n\n3. **Distribute camouflage cards:** Scatter 8-10 cards of various colors across the environment image or physical space.\n\n4. **First Round:** Say, \"Predators, you have 30 seconds to 'catch' as many animals as possible by pointing to or collecting the cards you can see.\" Start the timer.\n\n5. After 30 seconds, count which colors were caught most frequently and record on the board.\n\n6. **Repeat with different environment settings** (grassland, flower garden).\n\n7. **Record observations:** Students fill in a simple data sheet:\n   - Which colors were easiest to find in each environment?\n   - Which colors were hardest to find?\n   - Why do you think some colors survived better?\n\n**Part 2: Observation Connection (10 minutes)**\n\n8. Return to the original moth photograph. Ask:\n   - \"Why was this moth's color helpful in a forest environment?\"\n   - \"Would this moth survive as well in a bright green grassland? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"If this moth lived in a place with snow and ice, what color would help it survive?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** Facilitate without giving answers. Ask guiding questions like \"What do you notice about which cards disappeared first?\" and \"What do you think that tells us about how the environment affects survival?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students discover that animals matching their environment's colors are harder to spot, and therefore more likely to survive. They record data showing this pattern and make connections to the real moth in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after exploration; help students understand the relationship between camouflage, external structures, and survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Whiteboard or chart paper\n- Vocabulary cards with images\n- The original photograph of the camouflaged moth\n- Picture examples of other camouflaged animals (leaf insect, snow hare, stick bug)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):** Ask several pairs to share one discovery from their Explore activity. Write key phrases on the board (e.g., \"brown moth hid best in the leaves,\" \"bright colors got caught first\").\n\n2. **Introduce and Define Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   - **Camouflage:** The color, pattern, or shape of an animal's body that helps it hide from predators or sneak up on prey. When an animal blends in with its environment, it has good camouflage.\n   \n   - **Adaptation:** A special feature or behavior of an animal (or plant) that helps it survive in its environment. Camouflage is one type of adaptation.\n   \n   - **External structure:** The outside parts of an animal's body that you can see, like fur, scales, skin color, wings, and patterns. These structures help animals survive.\n   \n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals.\n   \n   - **Prey:** An animal that is hunted and eaten by a predator.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph and exploration (4 minutes):**\n   - \"The moth in our photo has an external structure—its brown and gray color and striped pattern. This is an adaptation that helps it survive because it camouflages the moth against tree bark.\"\n   - \"Why did we catch more red and green cards than brown cards in our activity? Because those colors don't match the forest, so they're easy to spot—like easy prey for a predator.\"\n   - \"The moth's color keeps it safe from birds and other predators that hunt by sight.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (1 minute):** Ask: \"Can someone use the word 'camouflage' or 'adaptation' to explain why this moth looks like tree bark?\" Call on 2-3 students for quick responses.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Camouflage:** Color, pattern, or shape that helps an animal hide by blending in with its surroundings.\n- **Adaptation:** A trait or behavior that helps an organism survive in its environment.\n- **External structure:** The outside parts of an animal's body (skin, fur, scales, color, patterns) that can be seen.\n- **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals to survive.\n- **Prey:** An animal that is hunted and eaten by a predator.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students can define and use the term \"camouflage\" to describe the moth's brown and gray coloring. They understand that external structures like color are adaptations that help animals survive by hiding from predators.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing camouflaged animals for new environments and defending their designs with evidence.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of different environments (desert, arctic tundra, tropical rainforest, ocean coral reef)\n- Colored paper, markers, colored pencils, and pastels\n- Scissors\n- Glue sticks\n- Large white paper (one per group)\n- \"Design Challenge\" worksheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the Challenge:** \"You are animal designers. Your job is to create a new animal AND design its camouflage for a specific environment so it can survive.\"\n\n2. **Divide students into small groups** (3-4 students per group). Assign each group a different environment (desert, arctic, rainforest, or coral reef).\n\n3. **Task:** Each group designs and draws a fictional animal that:\n   - Has a body shape and size appropriate for that habitat\n   - Uses camouflage coloring and patterns that match the environment\n   - Has features that help it survive (e.g., legs to run, wings to fly, fins to swim)\n\n4. **Provide the design framework:**\n   - What colors and patterns are in your environment?\n   - What external structures does your animal have?\n   - How does your animal's camouflage help it hide from predators?\n   - What does your animal eat, and does its camouflage help it sneak up on prey?\n\n5. **Students create their animal** on large paper using colored pencils, markers, and paper. Encourage creativity while staying grounded in the adaptation concept.\n\n6. **Gallery Walk (5 minutes):** Groups post their designs. Students view each design and place sticky notes with predictions: \"This animal would survive in its habitat because...\"\n\n7. **Presentation (10 minutes):** Each group presents their animal in 1-2 minutes, explaining their design choices using vocabulary from the Explain phase (camouflage, adaptation, external structures).\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate and ask probing questions: \"How does that color help your animal hide?\" \"Would this animal survive if its environment changed colors?\" \"What predators might hunt your animal?\" Push students to justify their design choices with evidence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students create a camouflaged animal and can explain how its external structures (color, pattern, body shape) are adaptations that help it survive in a specific environment. They demonstrate deeper understanding by applying the concept to a new context.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of camouflage, adaptations, and the relationship between external structures and survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during the lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage discussion questions.\n- Monitor data recording during Explore to see if students correctly identify which colors were camouflaged vs. visible.\n- Listen to vocabulary use during group share-outs in Explain phase.\n- Assess reasoning during Elaborate presentations.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper and ask them to answer:\n\n1. **Look at this picture of a green grasshopper** (show image). \"Explain how the grasshopper's green color is an adaptation that helps it survive. Use the word 'camouflage' in your answer.\"\n\n2. **True or False: A white polar bear has camouflage in a snowy Arctic habitat because its color matches the snow.** Explain why you chose true or false.\n\n3. **Draw a quick picture of an animal you would design to hide in a sandy desert.** Label the colors and patterns you would give it.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies camouflage as an adaptation that helps an animal hide.\n- ✓ Student uses proper vocabulary (camouflage, adaptation, external structure, survival).\n- ✓ Student provides reasoning connecting the animal's color/pattern to its environment.\n- ✓ Student can predict whether an organism would survive in a different environment based on its appearance.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students who meet expectations can define camouflage, identify it in multiple organisms, and explain how it serves as a survival adaptation.\n- Students who exceed expectations can predict how a camouflaged animal might struggle in a different habitat and design new camouflage for alternative environments.\n- Students needing support may need to use vocabulary reference cards or draw pictures instead of writing longer explanations.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n- Provide a **vocabulary reference sheet** with pictures and simple definitions of camouflage, adaptation, and predator that students can reference during activities and exit ticket.\n- During Elaborate, **assign a pre-drawn animal outline** that students only need to color and pattern to match an environment, rather than designing from scratch.\n- Offer **sentence starters** for exit ticket responses: \"This animal's color helps it survive because...\" or \"Camouflage is...\"\n- Pair these students with a stronger reader/writer during group presentations to help articulate their thinking.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n- Ask students to consider **mimicry vs. camouflage:** \"Some animals don't just hide by blending in—they look like something dangerous or poisonous. Why would this be an adaptation?\" (Example: viceroy butterfly mimics monarch butterfly).\n- Have advanced students **predict and explain** what would happen to a camouflaged animal if its environment changed (e.g., forest burned, habitat cleared for a city).\n- Challenge them to design a **two-environment animal:** \"Create an animal that has camouflage for two different seasons or habitats. How does it change?\" (Example: Arctic hare that's white in winter and brown in summer).\n- Invite research: \"Find another animal with camouflage and create a presentation explaining why its coloring matters for survival.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Camouflage in Nature Walk:** Take students on a school grounds or nearby nature walk searching for real camouflaged animals or plants (insects on bark, birds in trees, flowers hidden in grass). Photograph findings and create a class poster: \"Camouflage We Found!\" with explanations of why each organism's coloring helps it survive.\n\n2. **Design a Habitat Diorama:** Students create a shoebox diorama of an environment (forest, desert, ocean, grassland) and place small camouflaged toys, clay animals, or paper cutouts inside. They write cards explaining each animal's camouflage and how it survives. Display in classroom and have peer presentations.\n\n3. **Camouflage Art Project – \"Hide the Creature\":** Students create an artwork where they paint or color a creature that is intentionally camouflaged into a background. Trade with a partner and challenge them to find the hidden animal. Display with titles like \"Can You Spot the Desert Fox?\" This combines art and science while reinforcing the concept through creative expression.\n\n---",
