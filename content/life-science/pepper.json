The pepper is still developing - it's not yet full-sized. Behind the plant you can see more garden plants and a wooden fence. The leaves look healthy and the plant is clearly thriving in the garden environment.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates fruit development and plant reproduction. That green pepper is actually a fruit! In plant science, a fruit is any structure that grows from a flower and contains seeds. The pepper started as a white flower that was pollinated (likely by bees). After pollination, the flower's ovary began growing and swelling into the pepper we see. Inside are seeds that can grow into new pepper plants. As the pepper matures, it might turn red, yellow, or orange depending on the variety - the color change signals that seeds are mature and ready.\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Fruit Development**: Fruits develop from flowers after pollination, growing to protect seeds and help them spread.\n\n2. **Botanical vs. Culinary Fruits**: In science, peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers are fruits because they have seeds; in cooking, we call them vegetables!\n\n3. **Ripening**: As fruits mature, they often change color, become sweeter, and soften - these changes attract animals that eat the fruit and spread the seeds.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate a \"Fruit Detective\" investigation! Give students various \"vegetables\" (bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, green beans, corn, lettuce) and have them cut them open (with supervision) to look for seeds. If it has seeds, it's scientifically a fruit! Create a two-column chart: \"Botanical Fruits\" vs. \"True Vegetables\" (like lettuce, carrots - plant parts without seeds).
