Identify different habitats and ecosystems visible in an aerial landscape photograph and explain what organisms might live in each.\n2. Describe the two main materials (air and water) that plants need to grow and explain where plants get these materials in a forest ecosystem.\n3. Create a labeled diagram showing how matter (water, nutrients, air) moves between plants, animals, soil, and the atmosphere in a forest ecosystem.\n4. Predict how changes to one part of an ecosystem (like removing trees or adding water) would affect other organisms living there.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by examining an aerial view of a real landscape.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color copy of the photograph (or display via projector)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** in the center of the room or on the board. Tell students: \"A photographer took this picture from a helicopter or airplane high above the ground. This is what our world looks like from way up in the sky.\"\n\n2. **Invite students to turn and talk** (30 seconds) with a partner: *\"What do you notice about all the green in this picture? What might be alive in what you see?\"*\n\n3. **Guide whole-group discussion** with these specific questions:\n   - *\"What different environments can you see from this high-up view? Can you point to them?\"* (Expected: forests, fields, roads, some cleared areas)\n   - *\"Why do you think the forest areas are so green and thick with trees?\"* (Expected: plants are growing; they're healthy; they have what they need)\n   - *\"Look at the forest compared to the open fields. Why might the forest have so many more plants living close together?\"* (Expected: more shade; more soil; more water; more animals to help spread seeds)\n   - *\"If you were a small animal like a rabbit or bird, where would you want to live in this picture, and why?\"* (Expected: forest for shelter; fields for food; near water)\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today, we're going to figure out how all these plants in the forest stay so healthy and green. We're going to discover where plants actually get the things they need to grow. Make a guess: Does a plant get most of what it needs from the soil, the air, or somewhere else? Write your prediction and we'll test it!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an investigation to discover where plants really get their food and energy.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate plant growth requirements through hands-on observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small potted plant (bean plant, spider plant, or similar) for each group of 3–4 students (alternatively, use pre-grown seedlings)\n- Clear plastic bags or clear containers (zip-lock bags work well)\n- Water (in spray bottles or cups)\n- Soil samples in labeled cups (potting soil, sand, clay)\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Observation notebooks or data sheets\n- Hand lenses (optional, but helpful)\n- Markers for labeling\n\n**Activity – Part A: Plant Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute one potted plant to each group.** Ask students: *\"Without taking the plant apart, what can you observe about it? Touch the soil. Look at the leaves. What do you notice?\"*\n\n2. **Guide observation** with prompts:\n   - Where are the roots? (in the soil)\n   - What color are the leaves? (green)\n   - Is the soil wet or dry?\n   - Do you see any water on the leaves?\n\n3. **Record observations** in notebooks. Groups draw and label the plant, noting soil condition and leaf color.\n\n**Activity – Part B: Testing Where Plants Get Materials (12–15 minutes)**\n\n4. **Introduce the investigation:** \"We're going to trap air around our plant for a few minutes and see what happens. We think plants need air AND water to grow. Let's observe carefully.\"\n\n5. **Student steps:**\n   - **Step 1:** Measure and record the height of your plant using a ruler.\n   - **Step 2:** Water your plant lightly (if soil is dry). Feel the soil—is it moist?\n   - **Step 3:** Gently place the clear plastic bag over the plant (without damaging leaves) for **exactly 5 minutes**. This traps air around the plant.\n   - **Step 4:** Remove the bag and observe. *\"Did anything change? Do you see water droplets on the inside of the bag or on the leaves? Where did that water come from?\"*\n   - **Step 5:** Record what you observed. Draw or describe what you saw.\n\n6. **Guiding questions for recording:**\n   - *\"If water appeared, where do you think it came from?\"* (from the plant; from the leaves; from the soil water that the plant used)\n   - *\"Why do you think the plant gave off water?\"* (it's using water to grow and stay alive; the water is leaving through the leaves)\n   - *\"We trapped the air around the plant. Do you think the plant was using that air?\"* (yes, they breathe; yes, they need air to live)\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate among groups. Ask follow-up questions rather than giving answers: *\"What are you noticing? Where could that water have come from? Why might a plant need air?\"* Do not directly state the answer. Encourage groups to make predictions and observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students observe and record that water is present in the air around the plant (condensation on the bag).\n- Students begin to infer that plants use both water (from soil) and air to survive and grow.\n- Students produce labeled drawings and written observations in their notebooks.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after hands-on discovery.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or interactive whiteboard\n- Colored markers\n- Visual diagram/poster showing plant parts (optional; see below)\n- Image of the original photograph (for reference)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (8 minutes):** \n   - Ask 2–3 groups to share their observations: *\"What did you see happen when you covered the plant with the bag?\"*\n   - Chart their responses on large paper. Validate observations: \"Yes! Plants do give off water. Yes, they do use air!\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (7 minutes)** using Fifth Grade-friendly language:\n\n   - **Photosynthesis** (in simple terms): \"The way plants make their own food. Plants take in sunlight, air, and water, and they turn it into energy to grow. It's like the plant is cooking its own meal!\"\n   \n   - **Transpiration**: \"When water moves from the roots (in the soil) up through the plant and out through tiny holes in the leaves into the air. It's like the plant is breathing out water.\"\n   \n   - **Ecosystem**: \"A community of living things (plants, animals, bugs) all living together and depending on each other in one place, like a forest or meadow.\"\n   \n   - **Matter**: \"Anything that takes up space and has weight. In ecosystems, matter includes water, air, soil, and all the living things.\"\n   \n   - **Decomposer**: \"A living thing (like mushrooms or bacteria in soil) that breaks down dead plants and animals and returns nutrients to the soil so new plants can use them.\"\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Show the aerial photograph again.\n   - Point to the forest area: *\"Look at how thick and green the forest is. Why do you think it's so healthy? It has lots of sunlight coming down. It probably has water (maybe from rain or rivers—look, you can see a road but forests need water). And the trees are giving off oxygen and water into the air.\"*\n   - Point to the cleared/field areas: *\"These areas have less forest. Why might fewer plants be growing there? Maybe less water, or the trees were cut down.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students to hold up fingers (1–5) to show: *\"On a scale of 1–5, how confident are you that you know the TWO main materials plants need to grow?\"*\n   - Reinforce: \"Plants need **air** and **water** most of all. The soil gives them water and nutrients, but the air and water are the main ingredients.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Photosynthesis** | The way plants make food from sunlight, air, and water. |\n| **Transpiration** | Water moving from plant roots through the leaves into the air. |\n| **Ecosystem** | All the living things in an area and how they depend on each other and their environment. |\n| **Matter** | Anything that takes up space; includes water, air, soil, and living things. |\n| **Decomposer** | A living thing (like fungi or bacteria) that breaks down dead stuff and returns nutrients to soil. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students can name and explain the two main materials plants need: **air and water**.\n- Students understand that water moves through plants and into the air (transpiration).\n- Students can connect the concept to the photograph, explaining why the forest is healthy and green.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to model matter movement in an ecosystem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheet of poster paper or cardboard (per group)\n- Colored pencils, markers, or colored paper\n- Scissors\n- Glue stick\n- Printed images or cutouts of: tree, animal (deer/bird), sun, cloud, soil/ground, decomposer (mushroom icon)\n- Index cards with labels (air, water, sunlight, nutrients, soil)\n- Copy of the original photograph (reference)\n\n**Activity: Build an Ecosystem Diagram**\n\n1. **Set the context (2 minutes):** \n   *\"Now we're going to create a diagram showing how a forest ecosystem works. You'll show where water comes from, where plants get air, and how everything is connected. Use what you learned from your investigation AND what we see in the photograph.\"*\n\n2. **Student instructions (15–16 minutes):**\n\n   - **Step 1:** On your poster, draw or place cutouts of: the **sun** (top), **clouds/sky** (for rain and air), **trees** (in the middle), **animals** (forest creatures), **soil** (bottom), and a **decomposer** (mushroom or fungus in soil).\n   \n   - **Step 2:** Use arrows to show the movement of **water**:\n     - Where does rain come from? (clouds)\n     - Where does it go? (into soil and roots)\n     - What happens to water in the plant? (transpiration—it goes back up and out through leaves into the air)\n   \n   - **Step 3:** Use a different color arrows to show **air and oxygen**:\n     - Where does air come from? (atmosphere)\n     - How do plants use it? (photosynthesis; through tiny holes in leaves)\n     - What do plants give back to the air? (oxygen)\n   \n   - **Step 4:** Show how **matter from dead things** returns to soil:\n     - When a plant or animal dies, what happens? (decomposer breaks it down)\n     - What does the decomposer return to the soil? (nutrients)\n     - What do growing plants need from soil? (water and nutrients)\n   \n   - **Step 5:** Add labels and a title. Title ideas: \"How Forest Matter Moves,\" \"A Forest Ecosystem,\" \"Where Plants Get What They Need.\"\n\n3. **Visual example:** You may provide a simple reference diagram on the board showing one possible model (sun → tree; tree → animal; cloud → soil → root, etc.) to scaffold. Emphasize: *\"Your diagram should show how matter moves in a loop—nothing is wasted; it just changes form!\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"Where does that water come from next? What happens after the plant uses the water? Show me how air gets into the plant.\"*\n- Offer sentence frames if needed: \"Water moves from the _____ to the _____ because _____.\"\n- Do not correct diagrams; instead ask: \"How does that work in your model?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students produce a labeled diagram showing water cycle (rain → soil → plant → air).\n- Students show how air/oxygen is part of photosynthesis and plant survival.\n- Students indicate decomposers' role in returning nutrients to soil.\n- Diagram demonstrates understanding that matter cycles through the ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant growth requirements and ecosystem matter movement.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- During Explore: Observe whether students can articulate observations and make inferences about where plants get materials.\n- During Explain: Use finger-vote confidence check and listen to group discussions to gauge understanding.\n- During Elaborate: Review diagrams for evidence of water and air movement through ecosystems.\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5–7 minutes):**\n\nGive each student a slip of paper or digital form with these two questions:\n\n1. **\"Plants need two main materials to grow. Name them and explain where plants get each one.\"**\n   - Expected answer: Air (from atmosphere/around them; they breathe it in through leaves) and water (from soil through roots).\n   - **Success criterion:** Student names both air and water AND provides at least one location/source for each.\n\n2. **\"Look at the forest photo again. Explain why the forest has so many trees and plants growing close together. What are they all sharing from their environment?\"**\n   - Expected answer: They all have air, water, and sunlight available; the environment provides these; decomposers in the soil help return nutrients.\n   - **Success criterion:** Student mentions at least two of the following: air, water, sunlight, nutrients in soil.\n\n**Optional 3rd question (to assess ecosystem thinking):**\n- *\"If a forest fire burned down many trees, how would it affect the animals living there? Explain using what you learned about ecosystems.\"*\n- Expected answer: Animals would lose homes and food; less water cycling; less decomposition happening; less oxygen produced.\n- **Success criterion:** Student makes a logical cause-and-effect connection.\n\n**Grading Rubric (simple):**\n- **Proficient:** Answers name both air and water, provide locations, and show understanding of ecosystem connections.\n- **Developing:** Answers name one or both materials but lack clear location/source details.\n- **Beginning:** Answers are incomplete or show misconceptions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- 80%+ of students can name air and water as materials plants need and provide at least one source.\n- 70%+ of students can explain why forests support many organisms (ecosystem has required materials).\n- Diagrams from Elaborate phase show visible understanding of matter cycling.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide a partially labeled diagram template** during Elaborate with blanks to fill in (e.g., \"Water comes from _____ and moves to the _____\"). This reduces cognitive load while keeping the core task the same.\n\n2. **Partner with a peer mentor** during Explore. Assign a student who showed strong observation skills to work alongside a struggling learner, allowing the mentor to model thinking aloud: *\"I noticed water droplets—I think that's water from the plant escaping.\"*\n\n3. **Simplify vocabulary check** during Explain. Use only 3 vocabulary terms (photosynthesis, ecosystem, decomposer) instead of 5. Provide picture cards alongside definitions and repeat them multiple times.\n\n4. **Offer sentence frames** for exit ticket: \"Plants need _____ and _____. They get water from the _____. They get air from the _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Investigate a second variable:** \"Grow two identical plants—one in a sunny spot, one in shade. Record observations weekly. What does this tell us about what plants need?\" This extends thinking about photosynthesis and light requirements.\n\n2. **Model a forest food chain or food web:** \"Create a diagram showing who eats whom in a forest. Trace the matter and energy backward: the deer eats the plant; the plant made food from sunlight; where did the energy come from?\" This connects to producer-consumer relationships.\n\n3. **Analyze the human impact:** \"The photograph shows roads and cleared fields. Research and write about what happens to an ecosystem when forests are cut down. Use your matter-movement diagram to explain the changes.\"\n\n4. **Conduct transpiration rate experiments:** \"What factors affect how much water a plant transpires? Test variables like leaf area, light level, or humidity using the bag method over several days and graph results.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Water Cycle in a Bag (3–5 days follow-up):**\n   - Create a sealed terrarium (jar with soil, plant, water, sealed with tape). Observe condensation and water droplets for several days.\n   - Students predict: *\"Will the plant survive with no new water added? Why or why not?\"*\n   - Connect to transpiration and the water cycle: The water isn't being lost—it's cycling within the closed system.\n   - Documentation: Daily sketches or photos of the terrarium and predictions.\n\n2. **Local Ecosystem Field Exploration (1–2 hours, outdoor):**\n   - Take students to a nearby park, garden, or green space (or use street trees/grassy areas if a full forest isn't accessible).\n   - Task: Identify three different habitats (under a tree, in grass, near water if available). For each, list: plants you see, animals you might find there, and what materials (air, water, soil) are available.\n   - Have students take photos or sketch and bring back leaves, twigs, or soil samples (ethically—do not damage living plants).\n   - Back in class: Compare the local ecosystem to the aerial photograph's forest. Similarities and differences?\n\n3. **Design Your Own Ecosystem (creative extension or STEM connection):**\n   - Students design a miniature ecosystem in a shoebox or plastic container using soil, moss, small plants, stones, and toy animals.\n   - Prompt: \"Create a habitat where plants and animals can survive. Show where air, water, and nutrients come from.\"\n   - Challenge: \"What would happen if you added too much water? Not enough sunlight? How would you fix it?\"\n   - Display and peer-teach: Students explain their ecosystem to classmates.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of 5E Flow\n\nThis lesson leverages the powerful visual of an aerial landscape to ground abstract concepts (matter movement, photosynthesis, ecosystems) in something tangible. Students **engage** by wondering why the forest is so lush, **explore** through a simple but effective plant investigation, **explain** vocabulary in connection to their observations and the photograph, **elaborate** by modeling the entire ecosystem, and **evaluate** their understanding through exit tickets and diagrams. The lesson honors the 5E model by ensuring students construct meaning first through observation and inquiry before being told formal vocabulary and concepts.",
