Observe and describe the physical features of a tree frog shown in the photograph.\n2. Explain how a tree frog's color helps it hide and stay safe in its forest habitat.\n3. Compare the tree frog's adaptations to other animals they observe or research.\n4. Identify how different animals have different features that help them survive in different places.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about camouflage and animal adaptations through visual mystery and guided questioning.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph of the tree frog on a leaf (large enough for the class to see clearly, or projected on a screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without explanation. Ask students to look carefully for 15-20 seconds in silence.\n\n2. **Pose the mystery:** \"I'm hiding something in this picture. Can you find the animal? What do you see?\"\n\n3. **Guide observation with specific questions:**\n   - \"What color is this animal? What do you notice about the leaf?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the frog is this color? Could it help the frog?\"\n   - \"If you were a hungry bird looking for food, would you see this frog easily? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this frog lives? What clues help you know?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... if a tree frog was red or yellow instead of green, would it still be safe on a green leaf?\"\n\n5. **Record student ideas** on chart paper (sketch a frog, record color words, write \"safe/hidden\" observations).\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore how animals use colors and shapes to hide. You'll become scientists and test this idea!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate camouflage through hands-on color-matching and habitat simulation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **For each pair/small group:**\n  - 1 sheet of green paper (8.5\" × 11\")\n  - 1 sheet of brown paper (8.5\" × 11\")\n  - Small paper frogs in multiple colors (pre-cut: 5 green frogs, 5 red frogs, 5 yellow frogs per group—approx. 2\" long, simple shapes)\n  - Resealable plastic bag\n  - 1 minute timer or stopwatch\n  - Pencil and observation sheet (provided below)\n- Teacher: chart paper for recording group data\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Color Matching (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Setup:** Give each group a bag with 15 paper frogs (mixed colors).\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Pour your frogs on the green paper. Now look carefully. Which frogs blend in best with the green? Which ones stand out?\"\n   - \"Count how many GREEN frogs you can find easily in 30 seconds. Write the number on your paper.\"\n   - \"Count how many RED frogs you can find in 30 seconds. Write the number.\"\n   - \"Count how many YELLOW frogs you can find in 30 seconds. Write the number.\"\n\n3. **Repeat with brown paper.** \"Now mix all your frogs and place them on the brown paper. Count each color again in 30 seconds.\"\n\n4. **Record observations** on a simple data sheet:\n   - **Green paper:** Green frogs found: ___ | Red frogs found: ___ | Yellow frogs found: ___\n   - **Brown paper:** Green frogs found: ___ | Red frogs found: ___ | Yellow frogs found: ___\n\n**Part B: Habitat Connection (10 minutes)**\n\n5. **Whole-group synthesis:** Collect data from 2-3 groups on chart paper. Create a simple bar graph showing which color frogs were \"found\" most/least on each background.\n\n6. **Guided question:** \"Look at our graph. On the green paper, which frogs were hardest to find? Why do you think tree frogs are green?\"\n\n7. **Connection back to photograph:** Display the tree frog photo again. \"See? This real tree frog is green, just like the green frogs you found easily on green paper. It hides in a forest with lots of green leaves!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate to clarify the counting task; don't give answers, but prompt: \"Can you see that one? What color is it?\"\n- Record data without judgment; let patterns emerge from student observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that green frogs blend in on green paper (fewer found).\n- Students discover that red and yellow frogs stand out (more found).\n- Students make the connection: green helps frogs hide.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and deepen understanding of adaptation and camouflage.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of tree frog (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Index cards with vocabulary words (printed in large font)\n- Habitat illustration or simple drawing of a forest (teacher-drawn or printed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** \n   - \"What did you discover with your colored frogs? What happened on the green paper vs. the brown paper?\"\n   - Record key discoveries on a new chart titled \"How Tree Frogs Hide.\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - **Camouflage (KAM-uh-flahj):** Colors or patterns on an animal's body that help it hide in its environment so other animals don't see it easily.\n   - **Adaptation (ad-ap-TAY-shun):** A special feature of an animal's body that helps it survive and stay safe in its home.\n   - **Habitat (HAB-i-tat):** The place where an animal lives, like a forest or desert.\n   - **Forest:** A large area covered with many trees and plants.\n   - **Predator (PRED-uh-tor):** An animal that hunts other animals for food.\n\n   *Teacher strategy:* Write each word on an index card. Show students an image or real example. For \"camouflage,\" point to the photograph again: \"This tree frog's green color IS camouflage. It hides the frog so predators don't see it.\"\n\n3. **Connect back to photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - \"The tree frog in this photo lives in a forest. The forest has lots of green leaves. The frog's green color is an adaptation—it's a special feature that helps the frog hide from animals that want to eat it. This is camouflage!\"\n   - \"Just like your green frogs were hard to find on green paper, this real frog is hard to find on real green leaves. That's how it stays safe.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to your partner. Point to the tree frog in the photo. Tell your partner: What color is it? Why does it need to be green?\"\n   - Listen to 2-3 partner conversations; clarify misunderstandings.\n   - Ask: \"If a frog had bright red skin, would it be safe in a green forest? Why not?\"\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Chart (display and leave up):**\n| Word | Means | Example |\n|------|-------|---------|\n| **Camouflage** | Colors that help hide an animal | Green tree frog on leaves |\n| **Adaptation** | Special body feature that helps an animal survive | The frog's green color |\n| **Habitat** | Where an animal lives | A forest with trees and leaves |\n| **Predator** | An animal that hunts other animals | A bird or snake |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and use the term \"camouflage\" in context.\n- Students understand that the tree frog's green color is an adaptation.\n- Students can explain why camouflage helps animals survive.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply camouflage and adaptation concepts to compare different animals in different habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **For each student:**\n  - Picture cards of 4-5 animals in their habitats (8-10 cards total for the class; include: arctic fox in snow, brown bear in forest, zebra in grassland, tree frog in trees, penguin in ice; simple colored drawings or printed photos)\n  - 1 \"Adaptation Detective\" worksheet (provided below)\n- Chart paper for final display\n- Markers or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Adaptation Detective Hunt (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:** \"Different animals live in different places. Each animal has special colors and features that help it hide or survive in its habitat. You are adaptation detectives!\"\n\n2. **Distribute animal cards and worksheet.** Model the first one together:\n   - Show a picture of a tree frog in a tree (same environment as the lesson photo).\n   - Complete the worksheet together:\n     - *What animal is this?* Tree frog\n     - *Where does it live?* In trees in a forest\n     - *What color is it?* Green\n     - *Why is this color a good adaptation?* It helps the frog hide on green leaves so predators don't find it.\n\n3. **Students work in pairs:** Give each pair 2-3 different animal cards. They complete a simple worksheet for each:\n   - *What animal is this?*\n   - *Where does it live?*\n   - *What color(s) is it?*\n   - *How does its color or body shape help it stay safe?* (Provide sentence starter: \"This animal is ___ because...\")\n\n4. **Examples of animal cards to include:**\n   - **Arctic fox:** White fur in snowy habitat → blends with snow\n   - **Brown bear:** Brown fur in forest habitat → blends with trees and ground\n   - **Zebra:** Black and white stripes in grassland → confuses predators, blends with other zebras\n   - **Penguin:** Black and white in ice/ocean → blends with water and ice\n   - **Green tree frog:** Green on trees → blends with leaves (reinforce from lesson)\n\n**Part B: Class Gallery Walk (6 minutes)**\n\n5. **Create a visual display:** Have each pair post their completed worksheet with the animal picture on a class chart titled \"How Animals Adapt to Their Habitats.\"\n\n6. **Gallery walk:** Students walk around and read 2-3 other pairs' work. This builds appreciation for adaptation diversity.\n\n7. **Whole-group reflection (2 minutes):** \n   - \"What did you notice? Did all animals have the same color?\"\n   - \"Why do you think a white arctic fox would NOT be good at hiding in a green forest?\"\n   - \"Each animal's color matches its home. That's a smart adaptation!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate during pair work; prompt with questions rather than answers: \"What color is that animal? Where does it live? Do you see the same color in that place?\"\n- Help students make the connection between habitat and camouflage without telling them the answer.\n- Ensure all pairs complete at least one animal card.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different animals have different adaptations suited to different habitats.\n- Students can explain how an animal's color helps it survive in its specific home.\n- Students see the broader pattern: camouflage is a strategy used by many animals, not just tree frogs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of adaptation, camouflage, and habitat connections.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Observe student counting accuracy and note which students understand the color-matching concept vs. those confused.\n- **During Explain:** Listen to partner conversations; note if students use vocabulary correctly or need reteaching.\n- **During Elaborate:** Review completed adaptation detective worksheets; check if students make logical connections between animal color and habitat.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\n*Administer this individually or in small groups. Students can respond verbally or draw.*\n\n**Question 1 (Understanding camouflage):**\n\"Look at this tree frog again. Why is the frog green instead of red?\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student says something like: \"It hides from animals that want to eat it\" OR \"It blends in with green leaves\" OR \"Predators can't see it as easily.\"\n\n**Question 2 (Applying the concept):**\n\"Imagine a zebra lives on brown dirt, not grass. Would its black and white stripes be a good adaptation? Why or why not?\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student recognizes it would NOT be a good adaptation and gives a reason: \"It would stand out\" OR \"Predators would see it\" OR \"It doesn't match the brown.\"\n\n**Question 3 (Habitat connection):**\n\"What habitat does the tree frog live in? How do you know?\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student says \"forest\" or \"trees\" and references the green color or green leaves in the photo.\n\n**Recording Exit Ticket:**\n- For verbal responses: Teacher checks a box (✓ = meets criteria, ~ = developing, ✗ = not yet) on a checklist with all students' names.\n- For drawing responses: Students draw a tree frog in its forest and label one part that helps it hide.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 80% of students demonstrate understanding that green color helps the tree frog hide.\n- Most students (70%+) can name the forest habitat and explain why it matters.\n- Students show growing understanding that adaptations match habitats (some may still be developing this).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only **camouflage** and **habitat** in the main lesson; introduce other terms in follow-up lessons. Provide picture + word cards students can reference during activities.\n\n2. **Shorter response expectations:** During Elaborate, allow struggling students to complete only 1 animal card instead of 2-3, with teacher or aide support asking guiding questions: \"What color is it? Can you find that color in this picture of its home?\"\n\n3. **Concrete, visual-heavy tasks:** Provide laminated photo cards during Elaborate so students can physically place animal pictures on colored paper to see if they blend in (concrete version of the color-matching task). This reinforces the concept kinesthetically.\n\n4. **Buddy support:** Pair struggling students with stronger readers/observers during Explore and Elaborate. Assign clear roles: one counts, one records; then switch.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Deeper adaptation analysis:** Provide pictures of more complex animal adaptations (e.g., walking stick insect, leaf-tailed gecko, snow hare). Ask: \"What parts of this animal help it hide—just color, or shape too?\" Introduce the term **camouflage** plus **mimicry** (looking like something else) for curious students.\n\n2. **Habitat comparison research:** Have advanced students research and compare two habitats (forest vs. grassland). Ask: \"What adaptations would an animal need to survive in BOTH places? Why would that be hard?\" This opens discussion of specialized vs. generalized adaptations.\n\n3. **Predator perspective:** Challenge students to role-play: \"You are a predator looking for a meal. You see 5 frogs of different colors on a green leaf. Which one can you catch the fastest? Why?\" This shifts perspective and deepens understanding of predator-prey relationships.\n\n4. **Design activity:** \"Design a new animal for a specific habitat. What color would it be? What shape? Why?\" Students sketch and explain their design, applying adaptation logic independently.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n**For early finishers, homework, or follow-up lessons:**\n\n1. **Camouflage Hunt in the Classroom or Outdoors (20 minutes)**\n   - Hide colored paper cutouts of animals (green frogs, brown bears, white rabbits) around the classroom or schoolyard.\n   - Students search for \"hidden\" animals and record where they find each one.\n   - Discussion: \"Was the green frog easy to find outside? Was the white rabbit easier in some places?\" This extends the abstract lesson to real-world observation and reinforces that habitat color matters.\n\n2. **Create-a-Creature Adaptation Project (art + science, 30 minutes)**\n   - Students design an animal for an imaginary habitat (e.g., \"a purple planet with purple plants,\" \"an underwater cave with orange rocks\").\n   - They color, cut, and label their creature with an adaptation explanation: \"This animal is purple because it lives on a purple planet. This helps it hide from...\"\n   - Display in a class \"Alien Habitat Gallery\" with habitat descriptions.\n   - This applies the camouflage concept to creative thinking while reinforcing why adaptations matter.\n\n3. **Animal Adaptation Photo Book (homework or center activity, 15-20 minutes, ongoing)**\n   - Provide a simple booklet template (6-8 pages, pre-made or printed).\n   - Each page has one animal picture and a sentence frame: \"___ lives in a ___ and it is ___ because ___.\"\n   - Students fill in the blanks and illustrate (or cut and paste pictures).\n   - Families can extend this at home: \"Find pictures of animals. Do you think their colors match their homes?\"\n   - This reinforces vocabulary and habitat connections through a take-home product.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Photograph access:** Ensure you have a clear, large color image of the tree frog. If projecting, test the color clarity beforehand.\n- **Paper frog prep:** Pre-cut colored frogs before the lesson (or recruit parent volunteers). Laminate for durability across multiple years.\n- **Pacing:** The two-session structure allows for a natural break. Session 1 = Engage & Explore; Session 2 = Explain, Elaborate, & Evaluate.\n- **Real frogs:** If your school has a nature center or outdoor area, consider a follow-up outdoor observation walk to spot real insects, tree frogs, or other animals in their natural habitats (with supervision).\n- **Inclusive language:** Refer to the animal in the photo as \"a tree frog\" (not \"a cute frog\" or \"a pretty frog\") to keep focus on science; avoid anthropomorphizing.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson brings Second Grade students from wonder (\"How can I find this frog?\") to deeper understanding (different animals need different adaptations for different places) while staying grounded in the vivid, real-world image of the tree frog. The 5E sequence ensures students explore before they explain, making vocabulary and concepts meaningful and sticky.",
