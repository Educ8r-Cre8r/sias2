  "content": "# Engineering Design Challenge: Bumble Bee Photo\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n\n- A large bumble bee with fuzzy yellow and black body segments landing on or resting on a bright pink/magenta flower\n- A flower with vibrant pink/magenta petals and yellow-red center stamens\n- Blue-gray translucent wings folded against the bee's body\n- Green plant stems or leaves visible around the flower edges\n- Pollen (yellow dust) visible on the bee's legs and body\n\n---\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n\n1. **From wing structure** – The bee's wings are delicate and must be strong enough to support the bee's heavy, fuzzy body during flight and landing on flowers, suggesting a need for lightweight yet durable wing design.\n2. **From pollen accumulation** – The bee's hairy body is designed to collect pollen as it moves between flowers, which requires surface texture and shape that hold particles without letting them fall off immediately.\n3. **From flower size relative to bee** – The flower must be sturdy enough to support the bee's weight while the bee accesses nectar, suggesting flowers need structural support for visiting insects.\n\n---\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n#### **K-2 Version**\n**\"Design a Landing Pad for Bees\"**\n\nBees need a safe, sturdy place to land and drink from flowers. Build a flower landing pad using paper, straws, and a small cup of water (as \"nectar\"). Your landing pad must:\n- Be tall enough to stand on a table\n- Have a flat or cup-shaped top where a toy bee (small block or figure) can rest without tipping over\n- Support the bee for at least 5 seconds\n\nHow would you make it strong? What shape helps the bee land safely?\n\n---\n\n#### **3-5 Version**\n**\"Design a Pollinator-Friendly Flower Structure\"**\n\nEngineers need to design a synthetic flower that attracts and safely supports bumble bees while allowing pollen transfer. Your flower model must:\n- Stand 15 cm tall with a stable base that won't tip over when a 50g mass (bean bag) lands on the flower head\n- Have a textured landing surface (petals or platforms) at least 5 cm wide\n- Include a \"pollen collection zone\" (colored sand or powder sprinkled on petals) that sticks to the model bee (small fuzzy object) as it lands\n- Use only biodegradable or recyclable materials (paper, fabric scraps, natural fibers, wire)\n\n**Success criteria:** The flower remains upright after 3 landings, transfers visible pollen to your model bee, and uses no plastic.\n\n---\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis photo shows a real need in nature: flowers must support visiting insects while insects must access pollen and nectar. Students observe the problem firsthand (bumble bee landing on a flower) and can identify constraints (delicate wings, need for grip, pollen transfer). This naturally leads to asking \"How can we design a structure that works for both the flower and the bee?\"\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Materials\n\n- Pipe cleaners or fuzzy craft wire (to model bee structure and texture)\n- Paper cups, paper towel tubes, or rolled construction paper (flower stem and base)\n- Tissue paper or crepe paper in pink, yellow, red (petals)\n- Colored sand, craft glitter, or crushed chalk (pollen simulation)\n- Small bean bags or washers (to simulate bee weight during testing)\n- Tape, glue stick, or hot glue gun (assembly)\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Time\n\n**45–60 minutes** for 3-5; **30–40 minutes** for K-2.\n\n*Breakdown:* 5 min introduction & observation, 15–20 min planning/sketching, 15–20 min building, 10 min testing & iteration, 5 min reflection.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.A (Defining Engineering Problems)** by asking students to identify constraints (bee weight, flower strength, pollen adhesion) and criteria (stability, texture, height) from a real biological interaction, bridging life science and engineering design.",
