ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about what lives in water and what they need to survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of the pond habitat (or display on screen/projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pointer or hand to indicate areas of the photo\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Show students the pond habitat image. Ask them to sit in a semicircle where everyone can see clearly. Say: \"Look carefully at this special place. What do you see?\"\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Guiding Questions:**\n   - \"What plants can you spot in this picture? Point to them!\"\n   - \"Do you see any animals? Where are they hiding?\"\n   - \"Why do you think plants and animals like to live here by the water?\"\n   - \"What does this place have that the playground or classroom doesn't have?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if we took away the water (or the flowers, or the trees), would all these living things still want to live here? Why or why not?\"\n\n4. **Record Student Ideas:** Write student observations on chart paper as they share. Use words and simple drawings.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore what plants and animals really need to survive by looking at a pond up close!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover what plants and animals need through hands-on investigation and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small container water station (basin or tub with water)\n- Potted plant (small, hardy houseplant)\n- Animal picture cards or toy animals (birds, fish, insects)\n- Chart paper labeled: \"What Plants Need\" and \"What Animals Need\"\n- Markers (various colors)\n- Hand lenses (optional, for closer observation)\n- Printed or laminated copies of the pond photo for small group exploration (1 per 2-3 students)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Plant Investigation (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. Show students the potted plant. Ask: \"What does this plant have? What does it need?\"\n\n2. Have students touch the soil gently. Observe the water in a cup. Point out the plant getting sunlight from the window.\n\n3. Guide them to notice: \"The plant has water in the soil. The plant has light from the sun. The plant has space to grow. These are things plants need!\"\n\n4. Ask: \"Look at the pond picture again. Do you see water? Do you see sunlight? Do you see space for plants to grow?\"\n\n5. Students point to lily pads, flowers, and trees in the photograph. Record observations on the \"What Plants Need\" chart with pictures.\n\n**Part B: Animal Investigation (10-13 minutes)**\n\n1. Show toy or picture animals (bird, fish, insect). Ask: \"What does this animal need to live?\"\n\n2. Guide discussion:\n   - \"Animals need *food*—what would a fish eat? A bird?\" (Point to plants in the photo—seeds, insects)\n   - \"Animals need *water*—do we see water in the pond?\" (Yes!)\n   - \"Animals need *shelter*—a safe place to hide. Where could a frog hide?\" (Under lily pads, in tall plants, trees)\n   - \"Animals need *space*—room to move and live.\" (The pond is big!)\n\n3. Have students mime animal movements in the pond habitat (swimming, flying, hopping) to show animals need space.\n\n4. Record on the \"What Animals Need\" chart with pictures and words.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Ask guiding questions rather than giving answers\n- Point to specific locations in the photograph to help students make connections\n- Affirm observations with phrases like \"Yes! You noticed that...\"\n- Encourage students to use their senses (looking, listening, touching)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify multiple survival needs (water, food, light, shelter, space)\n- Students connect items in the photograph to specific needs\n- Students understand that both plants and animals have similar basic needs\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize student learning with vocabulary and concept connections.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Completed charts from Explore phase\n- Picture cards or printed images of: water, sunlight, food, shelter, soil\n- Pond habitat photograph (for reference)\n- Chart paper with title: \"Living Things Need...\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Gather students to review the \"What Plants Need\" and \"What Animals Need\" charts from Explore\n   - Have 2-3 students share one thing they discovered\n   - Point back to the photograph: \"Can you show us in the picture where plants get water? Where animals find shelter?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n   \n   Use simple, concrete language. Hold up picture cards as you introduce each term:\n\n   - **Habitat:** \"A habitat is a home for plants and animals. It has everything they need to live. The pond is a habitat!\"\n   - **Survive:** \"Survive means to stay alive and healthy. Plants and animals need certain things to survive.\"\n   - **Water:** \"Water is something all living things need. Plants drink it from soil. Animals drink it or live in it.\"\n   - **Sunlight:** \"Sunlight helps plants grow. Plants need light from the sun.\"\n   - **Shelter:** \"Shelter is a safe place to rest or hide. Trees and plants give shelter to animals.\"\n\n3. **Check for Understanding (2-3 minutes):**\n   - \"Who can point to water in the pond picture?\"\n   - \"What animal might hide under a lily pad for shelter?\"\n   - \"Why do plants need sunlight?\"\n   - Use thumbs up/middle/down to gauge understanding\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Habitat:** A place where plants and animals live that has everything they need to survive\n- **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy\n- **Water:** A liquid that all living things need to drink or live in\n- **Sunlight:** Light from the sun that plants need to grow\n- **Shelter:** A safe place where animals can rest, hide, or stay protected\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary terms in context (\"The pond is a habitat\")\n- Students explain at least two things plants need to survive\n- Students explain at least two things animals need to survive\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing or describing a habitat for a chosen organism.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large paper (1 per pair/small group)\n- Colored markers, crayons, colored pencils\n- Magazines for cutting pictures (optional)\n- Glue sticks (if using pictures)\n- Images of different animals (frog, bird, fish, butterfly, etc.)\n- Index cards with animal names\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**\"Create a Home\" Design Challenge:**\n\n1. **Introduce the Challenge:** \"We learned what plants and animals need to survive. Now, let's design a habitat for an animal we choose!\"\n\n2. **Assign or Allow Students to Choose** an animal from the cards provided (frog, bird, fish, butterfly, squirrel, etc.)\n\n3. **Guided Planning:** Ask students to think:\n   - \"What does your animal eat?\" (Draw or find food)\n   - \"Where will your animal drink water?\" (Draw water)\n   - \"Where will your animal hide?\" (Draw shelter)\n   - \"What will your animal have room to do?\" (Draw space)\n\n4. **Create the Habitat:** Students draw or create their habitat on paper, including:\n   - The animal\n   - Water\n   - Food source\n   - A shelter or hiding place\n   - Space to move\n\n5. **Share & Explain:** Each student or pair shows their habitat and explains one thing their animal needs and where they put it in their drawing.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask prompting questions: \"Where is the water your fish needs?\" \"What does your bird eat?\"\n- Help students label their drawings with key words (water, food, shelter, space)\n- Affirm connections to the pond habitat: \"Your design has water, just like the pond photo!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a habitat design that includes at least 2-3 survival needs\n- Students verbally explain where their animal's needs are met\n- Students connect their design back to the pond habitat concept\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what plants and animals need to survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Observe students during Explore phase: Can they point to water, sunlight, and shelter in the photograph?\n- Listen to student explanations during group share-outs: Do they use vocabulary correctly?\n- Review student drawings from Elaborate phase: Do habitats include necessary survival needs?\n\n**Exit Ticket Assessment (5-10 minutes):**\n\nGather students and ask them to respond to the following prompts. Accept verbal responses, drawings, or simple one-word answers appropriate to kindergarten level:\n\n1. **\"Point to something in the pond picture that a plant needs to survive.\"** (Accept: water, sunlight, soil, space)\n\n2. **\"Tell me one thing an animal needs to live.\"** (Accept: water, food, shelter, space)\n\n3. **\"Why is the pond a good home for plants and animals?\"** (Accept: has water, has plants, has sunlight, has places to hide, etc.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies at least one plant survival need from the photograph\n- ✓ Student names at least one animal survival need\n- ✓ Student explains that a habitat provides what living things need to survive\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Kindergarteners demonstrate understanding through pointing, naming items, and simple sentences\n- Most students can identify water and sunlight as plant needs\n- Most students can name food or shelter as animal needs\n- Students understand that a habitat is a place with what living things need\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Question Prompts:** Use yes/no or either/or questions instead of open-ended questions. \"Does the plant need water or rocks? Yes! It needs water!\"\n\n2. **Paired Observation:** Pair students with a partner or assign a peer buddy to help identify plants and animals in the photograph together.\n\n3. **Pre-taught Vocabulary with Pictures:** Show picture cards of water, sunlight, food, and shelter before the lesson so students have visual anchors for vocabulary.\n\n4. **Reduced Elaborate Task:** For the habitat design, offer a simplified template with pre-drawn animal silhouettes and spaces labeled \"water,\" \"food,\" \"shelter\" that students fill in or color rather than draw from scratch.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Multiple Habitats Comparison:** Ask: \"What if we had a desert instead? What would animals need there? How is it different from a pond?\" Have students compare pond vs. woodland vs. desert habitats using picture sets.\n\n2. **Food Chain Introduction:** Guide students to trace where food comes from in the pond. \"The plant gets sunlight and water. A fish eats the plant. A bird eats the fish. How are they all connected?\"\n\n3. **Problem-Solving:** \"What would happen if the pond dried up and had no water? What animals would have to leave? Why?\" Have students predict and explain.\n\n4. **Detailed Habitat Design:** Challenge advanced students to include multiple animals in their habitat design and explain how the habitat meets each animal's needs differently.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Virtual Pond Exploration:** Use an online resource or video to explore different types of ponds (lily pad ponds, bog habitats, etc.) in various regions. Ask: \"What's the same? What's different from our picture?\"\n\n2. **Class Terrarium or Aquarium Project:** If possible, create a small water habitat in the classroom (aquarium or water table ecosystem). Observe daily, record changes, and discuss what plants and animals need. This extends the lesson into ongoing observation and care.\n\n3. **\"Pond Detective\" Nature Walk:** Take students on a nature walk to a local pond, stream, or water area (with appropriate safety precautions and supervision). Have students hunt for evidence of plants and animals and collect observations in a nature journal or through photos. Return to classroom and compare to the lesson photograph.\n\n4. **Habitat Diorama:** Have students create a 3D pond habitat diorama in a shoebox using craft materials (blue paper for water, clay, real or paper plants, toy animals). Label the survival needs visible in their diorama.\n\n5. **Story/Song Creation:** Have students create a simple song or repeated chant about pond habitat needs. Example: \"Water, water, in the pond / Food and shelter, here so strong / Sunlight shining from above / This is where the animals love!\"\n\n---",
