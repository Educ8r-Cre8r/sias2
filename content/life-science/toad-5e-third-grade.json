Identify and describe the physical features of a toad that help it survive in its habitat.\n2. Explain how a toad's bumpy skin and body shape are adaptations that help it survive.\n3. Construct evidence-based explanations about why toads live in certain habitats and not others.\n4. Compare and contrast how different animals' body features help them survive in their environments.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the toad (large format for whole-class viewing)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Real toad (if available from local naturalist or science resource; otherwise, a stuffed toy toad)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the toad photograph on the board. Give students 30 seconds to look silently and observe without talking.\n\n2. **Think-Pair-Share:** Ask students to turn to a partner and complete these prompts:\n   - *Think:* What do you notice about this animal's body?\n   - *Pair:* Tell your partner one thing you see. (Give 1 minute for partners to share.)\n   - *Share:* Ask 3-4 volunteers to share one observation with the class. Record observations on chart paper (e.g., \"bumpy skin,\" \"big eyes,\" \"sitting on ground\").\n\n3. **Curiosity-Driving Questions:**\n   - \"Why do you think this animal has bumpy skin instead of smooth skin like a frog?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this animal lives, and why?\"\n   - \"What do you think this animal eats?\" (Point out the insect near the toad's mouth if visible.)\n   - \"How do you think those bumps help this animal survive?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if this toad's bumpy skin is just for looks, or if it actually helps the toad survive. Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore how a toad's special body features help it survive. Let's do some hands-on activities to discover the answers.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how physical adaptations help animals survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Bumpy textured objects (e.g., sandpaper, textured fabric, pinecone, plastic bumpy sheet, sponge)\n- Smooth textured objects (e.g., smooth plastic, silk cloth, glass, paper)\n- Small cups of water\n- Spray bottles or droppers\n- Paper towels\n- Hand lenses (magnifying glasses)\n- Student observation sheets (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station 1: Skin Texture Investigation**\n1. Give each student or pair a hand lens and examples of bumpy and smooth textures.\n2. **Student Directions:** \n   - \"Use your hand lens to look closely at the bumpy surface and the smooth surface.\"\n   - \"Touch both surfaces gently. How do they feel different?\"\n   - \"Which surface is easier to grip or hold? Which one might help an animal hold on to things?\"\n3. Students record observations: \"The bumpy surface feels _____. The smooth surface feels _____.\"\n\n**Station 2: Water and Skin Test**\n1. Set up small cups with water and spray bottles/droppers.\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Sprinkle water drops on the bumpy surface. What happens?\"\n   - \"Sprinkle water drops on the smooth surface. What happens?\"\n   - \"Which surface holds water better? Which surface lets water run off?\"\n   - \"What do you think this means for an animal living in a damp garden?\"\n3. Students record: \"Water on bumpy surface: _____. Water on smooth surface: _____.\"\n\n**Station 3: Camouflage Observation**\n1. Display the toad photograph alongside a picture of a smooth-skinned frog and a grass/garden background image.\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Look at the toad's bumpy, colored skin. Now look at the ground where it sits.\"\n   - \"Can you spot the toad easily, or does it blend in?\"\n   - \"Would a smooth, bright-colored animal hide as well in this garden?\"\n3. Students sketch or label: \"The toad blends in because _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate to each station and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Why do you think that happens?\" \"How might this help a real toad?\"\n- Listen for student reasoning but do not provide answers—let them discover.\n- Encourage students to make predictions before testing (e.g., \"What do you think will happen when we spray water on the bumpy surface?\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that bumpy surfaces provide grip, retain water, and blend into environments.\n- Students record observations connecting texture to function.\n- Students make connections between what they observe and how a toad survives.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts to deepen understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Toad photograph (display again)\n- Vocabulary cards (optional: with pictures)\n- Picture of a toad's habitat (garden, soil, plants, insects)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 students from each station to share what they discovered.\n   - Record key findings on a new chart titled \"How Toads Survive.\"\n   - Connect each discovery to the toad: \"When we found that bumpy surfaces grip better, we learned that a toad's bumpy skin helps it climb and hold on!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n   - **Adaptation:** A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive in its home. (Example: A toad's bumpy skin is an adaptation.)\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter. (Example: A toad's habitat is a garden with soil, plants, and insects.)\n   - **Camouflage:** Colors and patterns on an animal's body that help it blend into its surroundings so predators don't see it. (Example: The toad's bumpy, brown skin looks like dirt and rocks.)\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive by finding food, water, and protection from danger. (Example: The toad survives by eating insects and hiding in dark spots.)\n   - **Predator:** An animal that hunts and eats other animals. (Example: A snake or bird is a predator that might hunt a toad.)\n\n3. **Connection Back to Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the toad's features in the photograph.\n   - \"The bumpy skin is an **adaptation** that helps this toad survive in its **habitat** because it provides **camouflage** and helps the toad grip wet surfaces.\"\n   - \"Do you remember the insect near the toad's mouth? That's what toads eat to survive!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can anyone point to an adaptation on this toad?\" (Students identify bumpy skin, eyes, squat body.)\n   - Ask: \"Why is camouflage helpful to a toad?\" (So predators can't see it; so it can sneak up on insects.)\n   - Ask: \"What does a toad need in its habitat to survive?\" (Food—insects; water; shelter—places to hide.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary terms correctly in simple sentences.\n- Students explain how at least two toad features help it survive.\n- Students identify camouflage as a survival strategy.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding to new contexts and deepen learning.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of different animals (bird, fish, snake, squirrel, desert lizard, polar bear, etc.)\n- Picture cards of different habitats (forest, desert, pond, garden, arctic, ocean)\n- Large paper and markers for each group\n- Comparison chart template (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Adaptation Matching & Explanation Game:**\n\n1. **Divide students into small groups (3-4 students per group).**\n\n2. **Distribute picture cards:** Each group receives 2-3 animal cards and 2-3 habitat cards.\n\n3. **Student Task:**\n   - \"Match each animal to a habitat where it could survive well.\"\n   - \"Talk with your group: What adaptations does this animal have that help it survive in that habitat?\"\n   - \"Draw or write one adaptation the animal has. Write or say why it helps the animal survive there.\"\n\n   **Example:** Group matches a polar bear to an arctic habitat.\n   - \"The polar bear has thick white fur. The white fur is camouflage in the snow. The thick fur keeps the bear warm in cold weather. These adaptations help the polar bear survive in the arctic.\"\n\n4. **Gallery Walk (Optional):**\n   - Post each group's work around the room.\n   - Students walk around to view other groups' matches and explanations.\n   - Ask: \"Do you agree with this match? Why or why not?\"\n\n5. **Class Discussion:**\n   - Bring groups together. Ask: \"Which animals could survive in a garden like the toad? Which animals could NOT? Why?\"\n   - Build understanding that different animals have different adaptations for different habitats.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Listen to group discussions and ask follow-up questions: \"Why did you match that animal to that habitat?\" \"What adaptation helps it live there?\"\n- Provide sentence starters if needed: \"This animal could survive there because _____.\" \"The _____ adaptation helps it because _____.\"\n- Validate all reasonable matches with scientific reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students match animals to habitats with logical reasoning.\n- Students identify and explain at least one adaptation per animal.\n- Students begin to understand that adaptations are specific to habitats.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of adaptations and survival.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** During Explore and Elaborate, observe whether students:\n  - Correctly identify bumpy skin and other toad features (✓ or note)\n  - Use vocabulary terms (adaptation, habitat, camouflage, survive) appropriately (✓ or note)\n  - Make logical connections between features and survival (✓ or note)\n- **Discussion Responses:** Note whether students can explain how toads survive in their habitats.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with this written or oral exit ticket:\n\n**Choice 1: Draw & Label**\n- \"Draw a toad and label at least two adaptations that help it survive.\"\n- \"Write or tell me: How does each adaptation help the toad?\"\n\n**Choice 2: Short Answer**\n1. \"What is one adaptation a toad has?\" (E.g., bumpy skin, big eyes, squat body)\n2. \"How does this adaptation help the toad survive?\" (E.g., helps it hide, grip wet surfaces, jump away from danger)\n3. \"Could a smooth-skinned animal survive as well as a toad in a damp garden? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Identifies at least one toad adaptation correctly.\n- ✓ Explains how the adaptation helps the toad survive.\n- ✓ Uses at least one vocabulary term (adaptation, habitat, camouflage, or survive) correctly.\n- ✓ Recognizes that different animals are suited to different habitats.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students identify and explain one adaptation with correct reasoning.\n- 70% of students use vocabulary terms appropriately.\n- All students demonstrate understanding that adaptations help animals survive in specific habitats.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Sentence Starters & Word Banks:**\n   - Provide sentence frames for all written/verbal responses:\n     - \"The toad's _____ is an adaptation because it helps the toad _____.\"\n     - \"The toad could survive in _____ but NOT in _____ because _____.\"\n   - Create a word bank with pictures: adaptation, habitat, camouflage, survive, predator.\n\n2. **Simplified Explore Stations:**\n   - Reduce choices to essential comparisons (bumpy vs. smooth only).\n   - Pair struggling students with supportive peers for hands-on activities.\n   - Use real toad if available (tactile learners benefit from touching actual texture).\n\n3. **One-on-One Check-Ins:**\n   - During Explain phase, ask simplified versions: \"What does the bumpy skin do?\" \"Where does the toad live?\"\n   - Use the photograph as a visual anchor throughout; point to features as you discuss them.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Investigation of Trade-Offs:**\n   - Ask: \"If bumpy skin helps a toad hide, does it have any disadvantages? What if a toad needs to move quickly?\"\n   - Challenge: \"Design a new adaptation for a toad that must survive in a HOT, DRY desert instead of a damp garden. What would it look like?\"\n\n2. **Research Extension:**\n   - Provide books or images of different toad species from different habitats (cane toad, spadefoot toad, midwife toad, etc.).\n   - Ask: \"How are the adaptations of these different toads different from the one in our photograph? Why?\"\n\n3. **Ecosystem Connections:**\n   - Ask: \"What animals hunt toads? What does the toad hunt? How are they connected?\"\n   - Create a food chain or web showing the toad's role in its habitat.\n   - Challenge: \"If all the insects in the toad's habitat disappeared, how would the toad survive?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Toad Life Cycle Illustration:**\n   - Research or read aloud about toad life cycles (eggs in jelly strings → tadpoles → toadlets → adults).\n   - Students create a four-stage life cycle poster showing birth, growth, reproduction, and death (connects to 3-LS1-1).\n   - Label each stage and write what the toad needs to survive at each stage.\n\n2. **Habitat Diorama:**\n   - Students build a shoebox diorama of a toad's habitat including soil, plants, insects, shelter spots, and water.\n   - Include a toad figure (drawn, clay, or toy) positioned in a camouflaged spot.\n   - Write or present: \"Three things my toad needs to survive in this habitat are _____.\"\n\n3. **Compare Toad & Frog:**\n   - Use images to compare toads and frogs (both amphibians but different adaptations).\n   - Create a Venn diagram: Same (both hop, lay eggs, live near water), Different (toad has bumpy skin vs. frog has smooth skin; toad lives more on land vs. frog more in water).\n   - Discuss: \"Why are their adaptations different?\" (Different habitats require different features—connects to 3-LS4-2.)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** If using a real toad, remind students to handle gently (if at all) and wash hands afterward. Never squeeze or drop the toad.\n- **Photography Strength:** The photograph is exceptional because it shows the toad in its natural habitat with visible insects—this directly supports understanding of predator-prey relationships and adaptations.\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Post vocabulary cards in the room for the entire unit. Refer back frequently.\n- **Real-World Connection:** If possible, take students on a brief outdoor search for toads or other garden animals. Observation in the field deepens learning far more than images alone.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson builds from concrete observation (Engage/Explore) to formal vocabulary and explanation (Explain) to application and synthesis (Elaborate/Evaluate). Third graders will develop a strong understanding that adaptations are not random but directly related to where and how an animal survives.",
