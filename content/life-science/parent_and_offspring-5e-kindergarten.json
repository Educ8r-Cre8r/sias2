Observe and identify a parent bird and a baby bird in a photograph and describe how they look similar and different.\n2. Describe at least two things that birds need to survive (food, water, shelter, a safe place to stay).\n3. Explain why baby animals need their parents to help them survive.\n4. Use pictures and words to show one thing a bird needs to stay alive.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about parent and baby animals using the photograph and personal connections.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy of the photograph (large enough for the group to see clearly) or projected on a screen\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: stuffed bird toys or bird figurines\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** where all students can see it clearly. Do not explain it yet—let them observe.\n\n2. **Ask opening discussion questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about the birds.\"\n   - \"Which bird do you think is the parent? Which one is the baby? How do you know?\"\n   - \"What are the birds doing? Can you show me with your body what that bird is doing with its wings?\" (Have students act out the wing movement.)\n   - \"Why do you think the baby bird's mouth is so wide open?\"\n\n3. **Make a personal connection:**\n   - \"Babies need their parents to help them, right? Who takes care of you when you need food or a safe place to sleep?\"\n   - \"Do you think baby birds need their parents too? What might a baby bird need?\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper as they share. Use pictures and simple words.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore what baby birds and their parents need to stay healthy and safe. Let's act like bird scientists and discover more!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate animal needs through hands-on exploration and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards (printed ahead of time) showing:\n  - A bird eating seeds\n  - A bird drinking water\n  - A bird in a nest (shelter)\n  - A bird perched on a fence or branch (safe resting place)\n  - A parent bird feeding a baby bird\n- Chart or poster labeled \"What Birds Need\" with four columns (Food, Water, Home/Shelter, Safety)\n- Colored counters, stickers, or small objects for sorting\n- Student observation worksheet (simple pictures with checkboxes or blank spaces to draw)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Picture Sorting (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Lay out the four picture cards around the room or on a table where students can see them.\n\n2. **Give student directions:**\n   - \"I'm going to show you pictures of birds doing different things.\"\n   - \"We're going to sort them into groups for things birds NEED to survive.\"\n   - \"Look at each picture. Where do you think it goes? On the Food pile? Water pile? Home pile? Safe place pile?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate the sorting:**\n   - Show one picture at a time. Ask: \"What is this bird doing?\" and \"What does it need?\"\n   - Have students physically move a counter to the correct category or point to where it belongs.\n   - Accept all responses; guide thinking with questions: \"Does that picture show the bird eating or drinking? Is it in a safe place?\"\n\n4. **Repeat with 2-3 pictures** so students understand the categories.\n\n**Part 2: Observation and Recording (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Return to the original photograph (parent and baby bird on the fence).\n\n2. **Ask investigation questions:**\n   - \"Point to the baby bird. Point to the parent. What does the baby bird need from its parent?\"\n   - \"The parent bird brought the baby to this fence. Why do you think the fence is a good place to be?\"\n   - \"What do you think this baby bird needs to eat? Drink? Where does it sleep?\"\n\n3. **Have students record observations** on their worksheet:\n   - Draw or point to one thing the baby bird needs.\n   - Use a simple checklist: \"Baby bird needs: ☐ Food ☐ Water ☐ A safe place ☐ Parent's help\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and listen to student conversations without immediately correcting.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What makes you think that?\" \"Where do you see that in the picture?\"\n- Record student observations and interesting phrases to share later.\n- Encourage all attempts at sorting and reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can identify at least 2-3 things birds need to survive.\n- Students can point to or name where baby birds get help from parents.\n- Students show growing understanding of survival needs through their choices and explanations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and reinforce concepts discovered during exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Picture cards used in Explore phase\n- Poster or chart labeled \"Baby Birds Need...\"\n- Optional: bird puppets or stuffed animals to demonstrate concepts\n- Sentence strips with key vocabulary\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students together** in a meeting area where they can all see the photograph and chart.\n\n2. **Review the Explore activity:**\n   - \"Let's look at what you discovered! You sorted pictures into groups. What were our groups?\"\n   - Point to each category on the chart: Food, Water, Home/Shelter, Safe Place\n   - Invite 3-4 students to share what they recorded: \"Who found that baby birds need food? Show us your picture!\"\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** (use pictures and gestures with each term):\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Parent** | A grown-up animal that takes care of a baby animal and teaches it how to survive. |\n   | **Offspring** (or \"Baby Animal\") | A young animal that needs its parent to help it grow big and stay safe. |\n   | **Survive** | To stay alive and healthy; to get what you need to live. |\n   | **Shelter** | A safe place where an animal rests, sleeps, and is protected from bad weather or danger. |\n   | **Needs** | Things an animal must have to stay alive, like food, water, air, and a safe place to live. |\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Look at this picture again. This is a parent bird and a baby bird. The baby bird's mouth is OPEN because it's hungry. What is the baby asking for?\"\n   - \"The parent bird brought the baby to this fence. This is a safe place. Why? Because the fence is high up, and the baby won't fall. It's in a safe spot!\"\n   - \"What else do you see the baby bird might need?\" (Point to shelter—the nest, water nearby, food from the parent.)\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show a picture of one bird. Ask: \"Is this a parent or a baby? How do you know?\" (Guide with size, appearance.)\n   - Ask: \"What is one thing this bird needs to survive?\" (Have students hold up fingers, draw, or say answers.)\n   - Sing or chant (to a familiar tune like \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\"):\n     > *\"Birds need food and birds need water,*\n     > *Birds need parents, moms and fathers.*\n     > *Shelter keeps them safe and warm,*\n     > *That's what birds need to transform!\"*\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Parent:** A grown-up animal that takes care of a baby animal.\n- **Offspring:** A baby animal.\n- **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy.\n- **Shelter:** A safe place where an animal rests and is protected.\n- **Needs:** Things an animal must have to stay alive.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can name at least 2-3 things birds need to survive.\n- Students can explain, with prompting, why baby birds need their parents.\n- Students use vocabulary words (parent, baby, needs, shelter) in simple sentences or with teacher support.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of animal needs to a new context or create a representation of learning.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large construction paper\n- Magazines with animal pictures (pre-cut or available for students to cut)\n- Glue sticks, scissors, crayons, markers\n- Picture cards of different animals (bird, puppy, kitten, baby human, etc.)\n- Optional: real or pretend props (water bottle, food container, blanket for \"shelter\")\n\n**Activity: \"Make a Home for a Baby Bird\"**\n\n1. **Explain the task:**\n   - \"You're going to show me what a baby bird needs to survive!\"\n   - \"We're going to make a picture or poster that shows at least ONE thing a baby bird needs.\"\n   - \"You can draw it, cut and glue pictures, or use words and pictures together.\"\n\n2. **Model one example:**\n   - On chart paper, draw or cut a simple picture showing a baby bird with FOOD (seeds, worms).\n   - Write or say: \"Baby birds need FOOD. Their parent brings them food.\"\n   - Show how to glue, draw, or use markers.\n\n3. **Provide student choices:**\n   - **Option A (Drawing):** Students draw a baby bird and label one thing it needs (teacher scribes or students attempt writing).\n   - **Option B (Cut and Glue):** Students cut pictures from magazines or use pre-cut cards to show a baby bird with food, water, shelter, or a parent.\n   - **Option C (Role Play):** Students use props or their bodies to show what a baby bird needs. (\"Show me how a baby bird drinks water.\" \"Show me where a baby bird sleeps.\")\n\n4. **Provide sentence frames for students who are ready:**\n   - \"Baby birds need ___________.\"\n   - \"A parent bird helps by ___________.\"\n   - \"My baby bird is safe because ___________.\"\n\n5. **Display student work** on a classroom board titled \"What Birds Need to Survive.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask: \"Tell me about your picture. What does the baby bird need?\"\n- Write down student explanations (even if just a few words) to post next to their work.\n- Encourage students to share with a partner before moving to the next activity.\n- Support cutting, gluing, and fine motor skills as needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students create or show understanding of at least one animal need (food, water, shelter, safety, or parent care).\n- Students can explain their choice: \"I drew food because baby birds are hungry.\"\n- Students recognize that different animals may have similar needs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of animal needs and parent-offspring relationships.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Listen to student responses during Engage discussion questions.\n- Observe how students sort pictures and choose categories in Explore.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"Why did you put that picture there?\" \"What does the bird need?\"\n- Review student worksheets and drawings for evidence of understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket (individual or small group check, 5 minutes):**\n\nShow the original photograph and ask each student to respond to ONE of these (teacher can ask verbally and scribe, or students can draw/point):\n\n1. **\"Point to the baby bird. Point to the parent bird. Tell me one thing the baby bird needs.\"**\n2. **\"Look at this picture. Why does the baby bird need its parent?\"**\n3. **\"What is ONE thing this bird needs to stay alive and healthy?\"** (Accept: food, water, shelter, a safe place, parent help)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student can identify a parent and baby bird and name ONE thing they need (with prompting or visual support).\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student can identify parent and baby, name at least TWO things birds need, and explain one reason why (e.g., \"The baby bird needs food because it's hungry\").\n\n✓ **Advanced:** Student names 3+ needs, connects to personal experience (\"My baby brother needs food, too!\"), and explains how parent helps.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most students can identify at least one survival need for birds.\n- Students show emerging understanding of parent-offspring relationships.\n- Students demonstrate ability to observe and describe patterns in what animals need.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Use only 2 main categories (Food & Water, Home & Safe) instead of four. Use consistent visual symbols with each word.\n\n2. **Provide visual support cards:** Create simple picture cards with checkboxes. Read aloud or point, and have students place stickers on their needs (no writing required).\n\n3. **Use one-to-one pairing:** Assign a peer buddy or aid to sit with the student. Use hand-over-hand guidance for cutting/gluing activities. Offer sentence starters: \"The baby bird needs ______\" with picture choices.\n\n4. **Simplify the Elaborate task:** Let students choose from pre-cut pictures (already labeled) and paste them onto a template showing a bird. No drawing or writing required; just matching and placement.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Expand to different animals:** Show pictures of a baby puppy, kitten, rabbit, and human baby. Ask: \"What do ALL babies need? What needs are the SAME? What needs are DIFFERENT?\" Have them create a Venn diagram or compare chart.\n\n2. **Introduce the role of parents:** Ask: \"HOW does the parent help the baby survive? Can you show me THREE ways?\" (feeding, keeping warm, teaching to fly, finding shelter). Have students draw or write all three.\n\n3. **Connect to personal experience:** \"What do YOU need to survive? Draw your own needs (food, water, shelter, parent care). How is a baby bird's needs like YOUR needs?\"\n\n4. **Research extension:** Provide books or pictures of different bird babies (robins, penguins, chickens). Ask: \"Do different baby birds have different needs? Why or why not?\" Record observations on a chart.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bird Feeder Observation Project:** Create a simple bird feeder from a paper plate with birdseed. Place it outside the window. Over one week, observe and record: \"How many birds visit? What do they eat? What time of day?\" Bring observations back to the lesson: \"Birds need FOOD. We saw them eating!\"\n\n2. **Baby Animal Matching Game:** Create a memory or matching game with pictures of parent and baby animals (bird with chick, dog with puppy, cat with kitten, human parent with baby). Play in small groups or stations. Ask after each match: \"What does this baby need? Who takes care of it?\"\n\n3. **\"Nests and Homes\" Build Activity:** Provide twigs, grass, string, and small containers. Have students design a safe shelter for a toy bird or baby figure. Ask: \"Does your shelter protect the baby? What would keep it warm, dry, and safe?\" This extends learning to shelter and protection needs.\n\n4. **Story Extension:** Read a book about baby birds (such as *Are You My Mother?* by P.D. Eastman or *Little Blue and Little Yellow* by Leo Lionni). After reading, ask: \"What does this baby bird need? Who helps?\" and reconnect to the lesson concepts.\n\n5. **Family Interview:** Send home a simple sheet asking families to draw or write about what babies (human or animal) need to survive. Students share responses in a circle. Create a class book: \"What All Babies Need.\"\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
