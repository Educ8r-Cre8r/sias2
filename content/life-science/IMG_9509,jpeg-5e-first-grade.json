ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the seedling emerging from mulch.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (printed or projected on whiteboard/screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: real seedlings in pots (one or two to pass around)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Ask students to sit in a circle where they can all see it clearly.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions** (allow 1-2 minute wait time for each; call on various students):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is it?\"\n   - \"Is this plant big or little? How can you tell?\"\n   - \"What dark stuff is all around the green plant? Why might it be there?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this green plant came from? Did it start this way?\"\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n   - \"This little plant is called a seedling. It came from a tiny seed that was planted in that dark stuff called mulch. Right now, I want you to **wonder with me**: How did this tiny seedling get so big? What does it need to keep growing? Turn to a partner and share your ideas.\"\n   - Record student ideas on chart paper under \"What We Wonder About Plants.\" Affirm all responses without judgment.\n\n4. **Pass around a real seedling** (if available) so students can gently touch and observe the leaves and stem.\n\n**Transition:** \"You had lots of great ideas! Today, we're going to become plant detectives. We'll grow our own seedlings and watch them closely to learn what plants really need to grow big and strong.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate what seedlings need to grow through hands-on observation and a simple growing experiment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4-6 clear cups or small clear plastic containers (so roots are visible)\n- Potting soil or seed-starting mix\n- Bean seeds (kidney beans or lima beans work well—fast germinating)\n- Water in spray bottles or small watering cans\n- Newspaper to protect work surface\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per pair/group)\n- Observation journals (can be simple paper with lines and space for drawings)\n- Pencils and colored pencils\n- Labels and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Teacher Preparation (do this before class):**\n- Plant 3-4 bean seeds in clear cups with soil 2-3 days before this lesson, so seedlings are just beginning to emerge during the ENGAGE phase. This gives students something fresh to observe in EXPLORE.\n- Alternatively, use pre-sprouted beans (soak seeds overnight, place on damp paper towel in container).\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Observation Round 1 (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Gather around the table where I have some seedlings that are just starting to grow. What do you see? Use the hand lens to look very closely.\"\n   - Have students point out: green leaves, small stem, dark soil, moisture/water in the cup.\n   - Ask: \"Can you see roots? They might be tiny. Where do you think roots are?\" (Below the soil.)\n\n2. **Planting Activity (10 minutes):**\n   - Divide students into 4-5 small groups (3-4 students per group).\n   - **Give each group:** one clear cup, soil, one bean seed, water.\n   - **Directions:** \"Fill your cup about three-quarters full with soil. Make a small hole about one finger-deep in the soil. Put your bean seed in the hole. Cover it gently. Spray the soil with water until it feels damp. What do you think will happen? Draw a picture in your journal of what you just did.\"\n   - Emphasize: \"We're planting seeds just like the farmer did to grow the seedling in our picture!\"\n\n3. **Prediction and Recording (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at your planted seed in the cup. You can't see it anymore because it's covered with soil. What do you think will happen? Will a green plant pop out? When? What will it need?\"\n   - Students draw and/or dictate their predictions: \"My seed will grow into ___. It will have ___. It will need ___.\"\n   - Pairs or individuals can label their cups with their names.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups; ask prompting questions: \"Why did you add water? What do plants need from water?\" \"Do you think your seed is alive right now?\"\n- Do NOT give the answer. Instead, redirect: \"That's a great question! Let's keep watching your seed to find out.\"\n- Help with fine motor tasks (opening seed packets, pouring soil) but let students do the planting.\n- Reinforce vocabulary naturally: \"You're being a plant scientist! You're making an observation.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will have planted seeds in clear cups, making them their own \"experiment.\"\n- Students will have made and recorded predictions about growth.\n- Students will have observed that soil and water are involved in seed growth.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain plant structures and needs using the photograph and student exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original photograph (still displayed)\n- Chart paper and markers (or whiteboard)\n- A real seedling or plant cut-up diagram showing roots, stem, and leaves\n- Picture cards of seedlings vs. adult plants\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Let's talk about what you discovered when you planted your seeds. What did you do first? What did you add to your cup? Why?\"\n   - Highlight student language: planting, soil, water, seed, growing.\n   - Affirm predictions: \"Some of you think the seed will sprout in a few days. Let's see if you were right!\"\n\n2. **Teacher Mini-Lesson (8-10 minutes):**\n\n   **Display the original photograph again and introduce plant vocabulary:**\n\n   - **\"Seedling\"** — A seedling is a very young plant that just started growing from a seed. Look at this picture. See the tiny green leaves? That's a seedling. It's the baby plant.\n   \n   - **Point to and name plant parts (using the photograph and/or a real plant):**\n     - **\"Leaves\"** (the green parts) — Leaves catch sunlight. Sunlight helps the plant make food and grow. That's why plants need light!\n     - **\"Stem\"** (the green stick holding the leaves) — The stem is like the plant's backbone. It holds the leaves up to the sun and carries water up from the roots.\n     - **\"Roots\"** (under the soil, not visible but infer from the photo) — Roots grow down into the soil. They drink water and hold the plant in the ground. Roots help the plant stay healthy.\n   \n   - **\"Soil\"** — The dark material around the plant is soil (or mulch). Soil gives the plant water and nutrients (food). Plants grow in soil.\n\n   - **\"Seedling vs. Plant\"** — Show picture card or point: \"Look at our seedling. It has leaves, a stem, and roots. But it's teeny tiny! When it grows bigger and older, it will look like this [show picture of adult plant]. It will have MORE leaves, a THICKER stem, and LONGER roots. The baby plant and the big plant have the SAME parts—but the baby is much smaller. It looks like its parent plant, but not exactly the same yet!\"\n\n3. **Check for Understanding (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Use **Thumbs Up/Sideways/Down** assessment:\n     - \"Plants have leaves that catch light. Thumbs up if you got it!\"\n     - \"A seedling is a baby plant. Thumbs up if you think that's right!\"\n     - \"Roots grow up into the air. Thumbs up, sideways, or down?\"\n   - **Ask targeted questions to individuals:**\n     - \"What color are the leaves in our picture?\" (Green)\n     - \"What does soil do for a plant?\" (Gives water and food; helps roots drink)\n     - \"Is the seedling in the picture big or small?\" (Small)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Seedling** — A very young plant that just grew from a seed.\n- **Leaves** — The green parts of a plant that catch sunlight to help the plant grow.\n- **Stem** — The green stick part that holds leaves up and moves water through the plant.\n- **Roots** — The parts of a plant that grow under the soil. Roots drink water and hold the plant in place.\n- **Soil** — The dark material (dirt) that plants grow in. Soil has water and nutrients that plants need.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will use the words seedling, leaves, stem, roots, and soil when talking about plants.\n- Students will understand that young plants have the same parts as big plants but are smaller.\n- Students will know that plants need soil, water, and light to grow.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by designing a solution to help their seedlings grow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student seed cups (from Explore phase)\n- Sunny window location or access to grow lights\n- Chart paper with title: \"How Can We Help Our Seedlings Grow?\"\n- Markers\n- Optional: plant labels, small plant stakes\n- Optional: observations record sheet (simple template with plant illustration, spaces to draw and write)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-World Application — Problem-Solving (10 minutes):**\n   - \"Your seedlings are planted, but they're still under the soil sleeping. To wake up and grow, what do you think your seedling needs?\"\n   - Build on Explain vocabulary: light, water, soil.\n   - **Pose the design challenge:** \"Scientists and farmers need to help seedlings grow. Where should we put these cups so the seedlings get the light they need? How often should we give them water? Let's design a plan to help our seedlings grow big and strong.\"\n   \n   - **Facilitate group brainstorm:**\n     - \"Should we put the cups in a dark closet or by a sunny window?\" (Sunny window — plants need light!)\n     - \"Should we water them every day or just sometimes?\" (Enough to keep soil damp, not soggy.)\n     - \"Where should we put our cups so everyone can see them grow?\" (Classroom shelf in sunlight.)\n   \n   - **Co-create a care chart on poster paper:**\n     - Write student ideas: \"Our Seedling Care Plan\"\n     - Include: \"Put cups by the window for light. Water when soil feels dry. Check every day.\"\n     - Use simple icons/drawings next to each step so pre-readers understand.\n\n2. **Observation Setup (5 minutes):**\n   - Place seed cups in designated sunny location.\n   - Give each group a simple observation record: \"Draw what your seedling looks like today. Check it every day this week and draw again.\"\n   - **Optional:** Introduce a data chart: \"Every Friday, we'll measure how tall our seedlings are and write the number.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Guide students to think about plants' needs without directly telling them.\n- Affirm connections to the original photograph: \"Remember that seedling in the picture? It was growing in a place with light and soil and water, just like we're planning for our plants.\"\n- Circulate as students set up observations and answer questions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will identify that seedlings need light, water, and soil to grow.\n- Students will help design a simple care plan for their growing seedlings.\n- Students will begin documenting growth through drawings or simple records.\n- Students will make real-world connections: \"This seedling is like the one in the photo!\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant parts, plant needs, and young plants resembling parent plants.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during the lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore and Elaborate:\n  - ☐ Student identifies leaves, stem, and soil.\n  - ☐ Student can explain one reason plants need water.\n  - ☐ Student participates in planting and care plan discussion.\n  - ☐ Student makes a connection between the photo seedling and their own planted seed.\n\n- **Thumbs Up/Down checks** during Explain phase (recorded mentally or on a checklist).\n\n- **Listen to student language** during group share-outs and partner talk. Do students use vocabulary (seedling, leaves, stem, roots, soil)?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of Lesson 2, after 1 week of observations):**\n\n**Use ONE of the following based on student literacy level:**\n\n**Option A (Drawing-Based):**\n- \"Draw the seedling that came up from your seed. Label the leaves, stem, and soil. Draw what you think it will look like next week.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student draws recognizable plant parts; labels at least two parts correctly; shows understanding that it will grow.\n\n**Option B (Oral):**\n- **Ask each student individually:**\n  1. \"What is this called?\" (Point to the photograph.) — Expected answer: \"A seedling\" or \"a baby plant.\"\n  2. \"What does your seedling need to grow?\" — Expected answers: water, light, soil (any two of three).\n  3. \"How is your seedling like the one in the picture?\" — Expected answer: \"It has leaves and a stem\" or \"It's a plant that's growing.\"\n  4. \"Is your seedling the same size as a big plant?\" — Expected answer: \"No, it's smaller/little.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student correctly answers at least 3 of 4 questions with appropriate detail.\n\n**Option C (Written/Dictated Sentence):**\n- \"A seedling is _____.\" / \"Plants need _____ to grow.\" / \"My seedling looks like _____ because _____.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student fills in blanks with vocabulary from the lesson (seedling, water, light, soil, leaves, stem, etc.).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- **By the end of this lesson, students will demonstrate:**\n  1. Ability to name and point to plant parts (leaves, stem, soil).\n  2. Understanding that plants need water, light, and soil.\n  3. Recognition that a seedling is a young plant similar to but smaller than a parent plant.\n  4. Ability to care for a seedling using their designed plan and document growth.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary focus** — Emphasize only \"seedling,\" \"leaves,\" \"roots,\" and \"water.\" Use the same words repeatedly. Provide a picture card with labels at their workspace.\n\n2. **Hands-on seedling model** — If students struggle with the abstract concept of roots under soil, use a clear cup so they can see roots growing. Or, use a model/diagram where the root is visible and labeled.\n\n3. **Visual checklist for planting** — Provide a picture sequence showing: seed → soil → water → sunlight. Students follow the 3-step pictures instead of written directions. Pair with a buddy or aide.\n\n4. **Repeated observation time** — Allow struggling students extra time to look at the photograph and the seedlings during Explore. Sit with them and narrate what you see: \"I see tiny green leaves. I see the brown soil. I see water.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Comparative study** — Provide two types of seeds (bean and grass seed, or bean and radish seed) and have students predict and track which grows faster. Introduce the concept of \"germination rate.\" Students can graph or chart growth over 2-3 weeks.\n\n2. **Root observation extension** — Use a clear cup with wet paper towel on the sides so roots are visible. Challenge students to draw the roots they see growing and predict how long they will become. Discuss why roots need water.\n\n3. **Design a better seedling home** — \"If you were going to design the BEST place for a seedling to grow, what would you include? Draw and label your design.\" Students might draw different light amounts, water sources, or soil types. Discuss why their design would work.\n\n4. **Research real plants** — Provide picture books or tablets to research what the parent plant of their seed looks like. Encourage students to draw the full-grown plant and compare its size to the seedling. Introduce the term \"life cycle\" informally: \"This is what your plant will look like when it grows up!\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom Plant Timeline (1-2 weeks after planting):**\n   - Create a long strip display on a classroom wall titled \"From Seed to Seedling to Plant.\"\n   - As seedlings grow, students draw or take photos of their plants at 1-week intervals and arrange them left to right.\n   - Add small cards: \"Week 1: Seed sleeping.\" \"Week 2: Tiny leaves!\" \"Week 3: Bigger leaves and stem!\"\n   - Discuss: \"How is our seedling changing? Is it getting bigger like the plant in our first picture?\"\n   - **Connects to:** 1-LS3-1 (observing that young plants resemble but are not exactly like parent plants).\n\n2. **Seed Investigation Station (30 minutes, any time):**\n   - Set up a table with various seeds (bean, corn, pumpkin, sunflower, lettuce, grass).\n   - Provide hand lenses and a data sheet: \"What does your seed look like? Big or small? Hard or soft? What color? Draw it.\"\n   - Students explore different seeds and record observations.\n   - Discuss: \"Why do you think different plants have different seeds? Will they all grow the same way?\"\n   - **Connects to:** Curiosity and observation skills; foundation for plant diversity.\n\n3. **Parent and Baby Plants Photo Scavenger Hunt (homework or class activity):**\n   - Send students home with a simple worksheet: \"Find a seedling or small plant and a big plant of the same kind. Draw or take a picture of both. How are they the same? How are they different?\"\n   - Alternatively, do this in the school garden or outdoor space. Students find young and mature plants and compare them.\n   - Share findings in circle: \"Look at this big sunflower and this little sunflower seedling! They have the same leaves, but the big one is MUCH bigger!\"\n   - **Connects to:** 1-LS3-1 directly; family/parent-child connections.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing:** If possible, plant seeds 3-4 days before the formal lesson begins so that seedlings are actively emerging during ENGAGE and EXPLORE. This increases engagement and gives students something visible to observe immediately.\n- **Classroom location:** Keep seedling cups in a warm, well-lit spot (south or east-facing window). Rotation is helpful, but not necessary for first grade.\n- **Watering management:** Assign one student per group as \"water checker\" each day. Soil should be damp, not waterlogged. If you don't have daily sun, consider a simple grow light.\n- **Sensitivity:** Some students may have never planted seeds or seen a garden. Celebrate their discovery! Use inclusive language: \"Some of you may have helped a parent plant a garden. Some of you may be learning this for the first time. Both are wonderful!\"\n- **Photo documentation:** Take photos of student seedlings weekly. This serves as both formative assessment and a visual record students can reference.\n- **Vocabulary spiral:** Plant names and terms again in subsequent weeks as you observe changes. Repetition supports first-grade retention.",
