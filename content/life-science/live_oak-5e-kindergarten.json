ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the large oak tree and activate their prior knowledge about what plants need.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Photograph of the large oak tree (displayed on smartboard, printed poster, or projected)\n  - Chart paper and markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n  Display the photograph of the mighty oak tree prominently. Gather students in a circle where everyone can see it clearly. Begin with enthusiasm: \"Look at this amazing tree! It's so big and strong. I wonder how it got that way?\"\n\n  Ask these specific discussion questions:\n  1. \"What do you notice about this tree? What do you see?\" (Accept all observations: leaves, branches, thick trunk, shade, size)\n  2. \"Have you ever seen a really big tree like this one before? Where do you think it lives?\" (Park, outside, near buildings)\n  3. \"This tree is very healthy and has lots of green leaves. What do you think a plant needs to be healthy and strong like this tree?\" (Accept responses like water, sun, dirt, food)\n  4. \"If we took away the sun, the water, or the dirt from this tree, what would happen? Would it still grow big and strong?\" (This plants a seed of wonder about cause and effect)\n\n  Record student predictions and ideas on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n- **Transition:** \"Let's become plant detectives and do an experiment to discover what plants really need to survive and grow big!\"\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate what plants need to survive through hands-on observation and a simple experimental setup.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - 3 small potted plants (bean plants or fast-growing seedlings work well) OR 3 paper cups with soil and bean seeds\n  - Water (in a spray bottle or small pitcher)\n  - 1 sunny windowsill location\n  - 1 dark closet or cabinet location\n  - 1 sheltered but cool/dry location\n  - Paper towels\n  - Observation journals or drawing paper (one per student)\n  - Crayons or colored pencils\n  - Labels: \"Gets Sun,\" \"Gets Water,\" \"Gets Soil\" (or similar)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Day 1 – Setup and Observation:**\n\n  Divide students into three small groups. Assign each group one plant and one condition to observe:\n  - **Group 1 (Sunny Plant):** Places their plant in a sunny windowsill. Water it once at the start.\n  - **Group 2 (Water Plant):** Places their plant on a shelf. Waters it every day and keeps it in sunlight.\n  - **Group 3 (Soil Plant):** Observes a healthy plant already established in good soil with sun and water available.\n\n  Actually, for clearer learning, use this simpler setup:\n  - **Plant A:** Place in sunlight, water it daily (gets sun + water + soil)\n  - **Plant B:** Place in a dark closet, water it daily (NO sun, but has water + soil)\n  - **Plant C:** Place in sunlight, do NOT water it (gets sun, but NO water)\n\n  (Note: Do not leave Plant C completely dry—this is meant to be brief observation, 3-4 days maximum, for safety.)\n\n  **As a whole group:**\n  Gather around the three plants. Have students observe and describe what they see. Ask:\n  - \"Which plant looks the healthiest?\"\n  - \"Which one is starting to look droopy or sad?\"\n  - \"What is different about how we are treating each plant?\"\n\n  **Student recording:**\n  Each student draws a picture of one plant in their observation journal, coloring it to show its condition (healthy green, droopy, etc.). Write or have them dictate one sentence: \"This plant has _____ (sun/water/soil) and looks _____.\"\n\n  **Teacher Role:** Facilitate without leading. Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Why do you think this plant looks different?\" \"What is this plant missing?\" Let students make discoveries through careful observation.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students observe that the plant with sunlight and water stays healthy\n  - Students notice the plant in darkness starts to look pale or droopy\n  - Students see the plant without water beginning to droop\n  - Students record observations through drawings and simple descriptions\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and help students connect their observations to the concept that plants need specific things to survive.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper with the three plants' drawings or photos\n  - Picture cards of sun, water droplet, and soil/dirt (can be printed or drawn)\n  - The oak tree photograph again\n  - Three sentence stems on chart paper: \"Plants need _____ to survive.\" (fill in: sunlight, water, soil)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Group share-out:**\n  Ask the three groups to share what they noticed about their plant. Record observations on chart paper under headings: \"What We Saw,\" \"What Happened,\" \"Why?\"\n\n  **Introduce vocabulary:**\n  Point to each plant and say:\n  - \"This plant **SURVIVED** because it got everything it needed!\"\n  - \"This plant is **HEALTHY** because it has sunlight, water, and soil.\"\n  - \"This plant doesn't have **SUNLIGHT**, so it is not as healthy.\"\n  - \"Plants need **WATER** to drink, just like you do!\"\n  - \"Plants need **SUNLIGHT** to make food and energy, just like eating breakfast gives you energy!\"\n\n  **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy\n  - **Healthy:** Strong and growing well; having what you need\n  - **Sunlight:** Light and warmth from the sun\n  - **Water:** The drink that plants and animals need to live\n  - **Soil:** The dirt where plants grow their roots\n\n  **Connection back to the photograph:**\n  Show the oak tree photo again. Say: \"Look at this mighty oak tree! It's so big and so healthy. Why do you think it's so strong? That's right—it has everything it needs! It has sunlight shining on its leaves. It has water from rain and snow. It has soil where its roots grow deep. And it's been getting these things for a very, very long time—maybe 100 years or more! That's why it's so big.\"\n\n  **Check for understanding:**\n  Ask: \"If we took away the sun from this oak tree, what would happen?\" \"If it never got rain, what would happen?\" Listen for students to connect observations to the concept that removing these things would make the tree unhealthy or not survive.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students understand that plants need three main things: sunlight, water, and soil\n  - Students can name these three things when asked\n  - Students can explain why a plant might look sick (because it's missing one of these things)\n  - Students see the oak tree as an example of a healthy plant that has had these resources for a long time\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding by predicting and designing a scenario for plant survival.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Picture cards of plants in different conditions (sunny garden, desert, forest, indoor windowsill, dark basement—draw or print simple images)\n  - Chart paper with scenario cards\n  - A real plant or plant picture to \"rescue\"\n  - Soil, water pitcher, sunny spot markers (tape or chalk to mark a sunny area)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Scenario 1: Plant Rescue**\n  Show students a picture of a sad, droopy plant in a dark corner. Say: \"Oh no! This plant is not healthy. How can we help it survive and be healthy again?\"\n\n  Students discuss what the plant needs. Guide them to say: \"It needs sunlight! Let's move it to a sunny windowsill.\" Physically move a plant or show where you would move it.\n\n  **Scenario 2: Healthy Homes for Plants**\n  Show picture cards of different locations: sunny windowsill, dark closet, in a pot with soil, in a cup with no soil, in water, etc. Ask: \"Which place would help a plant survive and be healthy? Why?\"\n\n  Have students point to or circle the place where a plant would be most healthy. Discuss why.\n\n  **Scenario 3: Design Your Dream Plant Home**\n  Give each student (or pair) paper to draw a picture of the perfect place for a plant to live and grow big and strong, like the mighty oak. Have them draw:\n  - Where the sunlight comes from\n  - Where the water comes from\n  - Where the soil is\n  - How big and healthy the plant will grow\n\n  Students can dictate or write simple labels.\n\n  **Teacher Role:** Facilitate discussions by asking: \"Why did you put the plant there?\" \"Does this plant have everything it needs?\" \"Will it be healthy?\" Affirm connections to the oak tree and earlier observations.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students apply the concept that plants need sun, water, and soil\n  - Students can predict that removing one of these things would make a plant unhealthy\n  - Students can suggest ways to help an unhealthy plant become healthy again\n  - Students create a drawing showing a healthy environment for a plant\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of what plants need to survive.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative assessment throughout:**\n  - Observe student participation during Explore phase—are they noticing differences in plants?\n  - Listen to student explanations during Explain—can they name the three things plants need?\n  - Review student drawings and descriptions for understanding of cause and effect (if plant has X, it is healthy; if it lacks X, it is not healthy)\n\n  **Exit Ticket (delivered verbally or through quick drawing):**\n  Ask each student one or two of these questions. Record their responses:\n\n  1. \"What are three things a plant needs to survive and be healthy?\"\n  2. \"If a plant doesn't get water, what happens to it?\" or \"If a plant doesn't get sun, what happens?\"\n  3. \"Why do you think that big oak tree in the picture is so healthy and strong?\"\n\n  **Success Criteria:**\n  - ✓ Student can name at least 2 of the 3 things plants need (sun, water, soil)\n  - ✓ Student can explain that a plant needs these things to survive and stay healthy\n  - ✓ Student can make a simple connection between giving a plant what it needs and the plant being healthy\n  - ✓ Student can apply this understanding to the oak tree example or a new scenario\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Most students can identify sunlight, water, and soil as necessary for plant survival\n  - Students can explain in simple words why plants need these things (to be healthy, to grow, to live)\n  - Students show understanding through drawings and verbal explanations\n  - Students can predict what would happen if a plant didn't receive one of these resources\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support:**\n  1. **Use picture cards with labels:** Provide large, clear pictures of sun, water, and soil. Use these to prompt responses during discussions. Ask: \"Does this plant have ____?\" Point to the card.\n  2. **Simplify vocabulary:** Use consistent, simple language. \"Plants need **food from sun**, **water to drink**, and **dirt to grow roots**.\" Repeat these phrases often.\n  3. **Guided observation:** For students who struggle with noticing details, sit with them during Explore and ask: \"Is this plant green or yellow?\" \"Does it stand up tall or is it droopy?\" Help them describe one feature at a time before drawing.\n\n- **Challenge:**\n  1. **Extend reasoning:** Ask advanced students: \"What if a plant got sun and water but was planted in sand instead of soil? Would it survive? Why or why not?\" Encourage them to think about soil as a source of nutrients, not just a place to grow.\n  2. **Compare different plants:** Provide pictures of plants in very different habitats (cactus in desert, oak in forest, aquatic plant in water). Ask: \"Do all plants need the same amount of sun and water?\" Discuss how different plants need different amounts.\n  3. **Predict long-term outcomes:** \"This plant has had sunlight and water for three months and looks healthy. What would happen if it got these things for 10 years? 50 years? 100 years?\" Connect to the mighty oak tree's age and size.\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Plant Growth Journal Over Weeks:**\n   Set up three classroom plants with different care routines (one gets sunlight and water daily, one gets only water, one gets only sunlight—note: rotate this one carefully to avoid harm). Have students draw or photograph the plants weekly and notice changes over 3-4 weeks. Create a \"growth timeline\" showing how plants change when their needs are met or not met.\n\n2. **Visit a Local Tree:**\n   Take students on a nature walk to observe a large, healthy tree in your school yard or a nearby park. Have them sit under it, touch the bark, look at the leaves, and discuss: \"What does this tree have that helps it survive?\" Create a class poster titled \"What This Tree Needs\" with illustrations of sun, rain, and soil.\n\n3. **Seed Planting Experiment:**\n   Give each student a small cup with soil, a bean seed, and water. Have them plant the seed and care for it over several weeks. Keep a simple picture chart of what the plant needs each day (water drop, sun symbol). Students mark off each day they give it water and place it in sunlight. At the end, celebrate the growth and discuss: \"What helped your plant grow?\" This reinforces the lesson with a personal, hands-on experience.",
