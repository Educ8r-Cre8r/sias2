ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the spider on sandy ground\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small live spider in a clear, covered container (if your school allows and you're comfortable with this; otherwise, use only the photo)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it large so all students can see clearly. Do NOT tell them what it is yet.\n\n2. **Ask discovery questions one at a time, pausing for student responses:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What animal is this?\" (Allow students to identify it as a spider)\n   - \"Look closely at the legs. How many legs does this spider have? Count them together if you can.\" (Point to the legs in the image)\n   - \"Why do you think spiders have so many legs? What do you think those legs help the spider do?\"\n   - \"Where is this spider? What kind of home do you see?\" (Point to the sandy, rocky ground)\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:**\n   - \"If you were a spider, how would you use your eight legs to help you find food or move around? Turn and tell a friend one idea.\"\n   - Chart student responses: \"We think spiders use their legs to...\" Write student ideas on chart paper.\n\n4. **Share that in this lesson, they will explore how spiders use their special bodies and legs to survive.**\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's find out what spiders really do with all those legs by exploring together!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how spider legs work through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pipe cleaners (8 per student, in various colors)\n- Small foam or paper balls (ping-pong balls work; one per student)\n- Yarn or string (cut into 12-inch lengths, 3-4 per student)\n- Small paper cups (one per student)\n- Markers\n- Large open floor space or tables\n- Chart paper to record observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Building a Spider Model (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials:** Each student gets 8 pipe cleaners, a foam ball, and markers.\n\n2. **Guided construction with student input:**\n   - \"Use your foam ball as the spider's body. Now, let's attach our 8 pipe cleaners to be the spider's legs. You can stick them into the ball or wrap them around it.\"\n   - \"Now use your markers to make a face on your spider if you'd like!\"\n   - Teacher circulates, asking: \"How is your spider like the one in the photo? What did you notice about how many legs it has?\"\n\n3. **Quick observation:** \"Hold up your spider! Look at your neighbor's spider. Are they the same? Are they different? How?\"\n\n**Part B: Testing Spider Legs in Action (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Demonstrate the investigation:**\n   - Show students your pipe cleaner spider. Place a small paper cup on the ground a few feet away.\n   - \"Your job is to use your spider to move the cup closer to you, just like a real spider might move something in its world. But here's the rule: You can ONLY use the pipe cleaner legs—not your hands!\"\n\n2. **Students explore independently:**\n   - Give each student space to experiment. Provide yarn pieces to place around the cup (to make a \"web\") or the cup itself to move.\n   - Encourage manipulation: \"Can your spider drag the cup? Can it push it? Can you use different legs together?\"\n   - As students work, ask guiding questions:\n     - \"Which legs are working the hardest?\"\n     - \"Why do you think the spider needs so many legs?\"\n     - \"Could your spider do this if it only had 4 legs?\"\n\n3. **Record observations:**\n   - Have a student helper draw on chart paper what they see spiders doing with their legs.\n   - Write down student discoveries: \"Our spiders used their legs to pull, push, hold, and move things!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** Facilitate movement, ask questions that prompt observation, resist giving answers. If students struggle, ask, \"What did you notice when you bent this leg? What happened to the cup?\" Encourage persistence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students should discover that:\n- Multiple legs working together allow movement and pushing/pulling objects\n- Legs can bend and extend\n- More legs provide more ways to accomplish tasks\n- Each leg can work independently or together with others\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect discoveries to real spider behavior.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- The original spider photograph\n- Picture cards showing spider behaviors (optional: spinning web, hunting, walking)\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Gather students with their pipe cleaner spiders.\n   - Ask: \"What did your spider discover? Who can tell us what their spider did with its legs?\"\n   - Call on 3-4 students to share one thing their spider did.\n   - Affirm: \"You discovered that spiders use their legs to move and handle things—just like real spiders do!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Display each term with a simple image or gesture. Use the photograph to point out examples.\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Legs:** The long parts that grow from a spider's body. A spider has 8 legs. (Point to the photo: \"Look at all 8 legs!\")\n   - **Body:** The main part of the spider where all the legs connect. The body holds the spider's head and stomach. (Point to center of photo)\n   - **Arachnid:** A special animal group that has 8 legs. Spiders are arachnids. (Show the spider: \"This is an arachnid!\")\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. This spider lives on sandy, rocky ground. (Point to the ground in photo)\n   - **Survive:** To stay alive. Spiders use their legs to hunt food and escape danger so they can survive.\n\n3. **Connect Back to Learning (5 minutes):**\n   - Show the photograph again: \"This real spider is using its 8 legs on sandy ground, just like we explored with our pipe cleaner spiders!\"\n   - Ask: \"How is your spider model like the real spider in the picture? How is it different?\"\n   - Create a two-column chart: \"Real Spiders | Our Pipe Cleaner Spiders\"\n   - Example answers: Real spiders have 8 legs / Our spiders have 8 pipe cleaners. Real spiders are tiny / Our spiders are bigger.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask quick yes/no or pointing questions:\n     - \"Do spiders have 6 legs or 8 legs?\" (Point to the photo together)\n     - \"Is a spider an arachnid or an insect?\" (This is a preview; spiders are arachnids)\n     - \"Can a spider use its legs to move and hunt?\" (Yes! What did your spider do?)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students should understand that:\n- Spiders have 8 special legs adapted for their survival\n- Legs are used for movement, hunting, and handling objects\n- Spiders live in different habitats and their legs help them survive there\n- They can name basic spider body parts\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a spider-inspired tool to solve a real problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pipe cleaners (extra sets, 4-8 per student)\n- Straws or wooden sticks (one per student)\n- Paper clips or tape\n- Small objects to move (foam balls, blocks, marbles, crumpled paper)\n- Pencils and paper to draw designs\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the Challenge (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Imagine you are trying to pick up small things from the ground, but you can't use your hands. How could you design a tool that uses ideas from a spider's legs to help you?\"\n   - Show an example: Use pipe cleaners attached to a straw to create a \"gripper tool\" that mimics how spider legs might grasp things.\n\n2. **Design Phase (8 minutes):**\n   - Students sketch their idea on paper first: \"Draw your tool and label the legs.\"\n   - Ask: \"How many pipe cleaners will you use? How will you attach them? What will they do?\"\n   - Circulate and ask: \"How does your idea come from watching the spider? Which part is like the spider's legs?\"\n\n3. **Build and Test Phase (7 minutes):**\n   - Students build their tools using pipe cleaners, straws, and tape/paper clips.\n   - Test the tool by trying to move, pick up, or manipulate the small objects.\n   - Encourage modification: \"Does it work? Does it need to change? How can you use what you learned about spider legs?\"\n\n4. **Share Designs:**\n   - Quick gallery walk or pair-share: Students show their neighbor their tool and explain one way it's like a spider's legs.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Facilitate without building for students\n- Ask: \"What would a spider do in this situation?\"\n- Encourage experimentation and revision\n- Make connections: \"How is your tool using the idea of multiple legs working together?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students create a functional tool inspired by spider leg structure\n- Students can explain one way their design mimics how spiders use their legs\n- Students recognize that animal body parts can inspire human tools and solutions\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of spider body structures and their functions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n   - **Observe during Explore:** Can students manipulate their pipe cleaner spiders? Do they experiment with moving objects? Do they recognize the connection to the photograph?\n   - **Listen during Explain:** Can students answer questions about spider legs and habitats? Do they use vocabulary correctly?\n   - **Observe during Elaborate:** Do students apply the idea that legs help with movement and handling tasks?\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (Individual or Small Group) - 5 minutes:**\n   \n   Show the spider photograph again and ask (verbally or with visual responses):\n   \n   - **Question 1:** \"Point to the spider's legs in this picture. How many legs do you see?\" \n     - ✓ Success: Student points to legs and counts or says \"8\"\n   \n   - **Question 2:** \"Why does a spider need so many legs? You can tell me or show me with your body.\"\n     - ✓ Success: Student gives any reasonable answer (to move, to hunt, to hold things, to feel the ground) OR demonstrates with arms/fingers how legs could work together\n   \n   - **Question 3:** \"Show me with the pipe cleaner spider you made: How could a spider use its legs to catch food?\"\n     - ✓ Success: Student demonstrates the spider moving, reaching, or holding; shows understanding that legs help the spider survive\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n   - Student can identify 8 legs on a spider\n   - Student can name at least one function of spider legs (movement, hunting, grasping, sensing)\n   - Student can explain or demonstrate how spider legs help the spider survive\n   - Student can connect their model or tool to how real spiders work\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Take photos of student pipe cleaner spiders and their tools for a class portfolio\n   - Record student responses to exit ticket questions\n   - Save the chart of student observations and comparisons\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- All students should be able to identify spider legs and state a basic function\n- Most students should explain how legs help spiders survive in their habitat\n- All students should show engagement with the hands-on activities and demonstrate understanding through manipulation, drawing, or verbal explanation\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:**\n   - Use only \"legs,\" \"body,\" and \"spider\" consistently. Skip \"arachnid\" and \"habitat\" for now; reintroduce later.\n   - Use single-word or two-word answers: \"Eight legs!\" \"Move!\" \"Hunt!\" rather than full sentences.\n\n2. **Guided Hand-Over-Hand During Building:**\n   - Sit with the student and help attach pipe cleaners while they feel and manipulate the materials. Ask, \"What does your leg do now?\"\n   - Use a pre-made spider body (foam ball with holes) so the student only focuses on attaching legs.\n\n3. **Simplified Explore Task:**\n   - Instead of moving a cup, simply ask the student to make their spider \"walk\" across the table or \"dance.\"\n   - Provide a video clip (30 seconds) of a real spider moving before the activity so the student has a concrete visual reference.\n\n4. **Visual Supports for Explain Phase:**\n   - Provide picture cards showing spider legs, body, and ground.\n   - Allow non-verbal responses (pointing, thumbs up/down, drawing) instead of speaking.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Comparative Research:**\n   - Ask: \"How is a spider different from an ant? How many legs does an ant have? Why?\" \n   - Provide pictures of insects (6 legs) vs. arachnids (8 legs) for sorting and discussion.\n\n2. **Advanced Tool Design:**\n   - Challenge: \"Design a tool with 8 pipe cleaner 'legs' that can do TWO different things—like move something AND hold it at the same time.\"\n   - Require a written or drawn explanation with labels.\n\n3. **Spider Habitat Exploration:**\n   - Ask: \"Where else might spiders live? Show me with your tool how a spider would use its legs in a web, on a tree, or underground.\"\n   - Provide materials to create different habitats and test how legs work in each.\n\n4. **Recording Observations:**\n   - Ask advanced students to draw and label their spider model, their tool design, and write (or dictate) one sentence about why spiders need 8 legs.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Spider Web Exploration (Follow-Up Lesson or Center Activity):**\n   - Create a simple web indoors using yarn strung between chair legs or taped to a wall.\n   - Have students walk their pipe cleaner spiders across the web and observe how legs interact with the strings.\n   - Discussion: \"Does the web help the spider? How do the legs work with the web?\"\n   - *Connection:* Deepens understanding of how legs and other adaptations work together for survival.\n\n2. **Real Spider Observation (If Safe and Age-Appropriate):**\n   - Invite a local naturalist or bring in a safe, contained spider (or use a video of real spiders if a live spider is not an option).\n   - Have students observe the spider for 5-10 minutes and complete an observation sheet with drawings or stickers.\n   - Ask: \"How is the real spider like your pipe cleaner spider? What can real spiders do that your model couldn't?\"\n   - *Connection:* Connects model to real organism; builds scientific observation skills.\n\n3. **All About Spiders Picture Book Creation (Art + Literacy Integration):**\n   - Students create a simple 4-page book:\n     - Page 1: \"Spiders have ___ legs\" (with drawings or stickers)\n     - Page 2: \"Spiders use their legs to ___\" (draw a spider action)\n     - Page 3: \"My spider tool was like a real spider because ___\" (draw tool and habitat)\n     - Page 4: \"I learned that spiders are ___\" (amazing, strong, etc.)\n   - Students \"read\" their book to a partner or take home.\n   - *Connection:* Consolidates learning, builds communication skills, creates a keepsake.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis lesson uses the striking photograph of a ground-dwelling spider to anchor concrete exploration of how animal body structures enable survival. First graders build models, test designs, and solve real problems inspired by spider legs—moving from observation to application. The 5E sequence scaffolds from curiosity (Engage), through hands-on discovery (Explore), to vocabulary and connections (Explain), then to transfer learning (Elaborate), with multiple opportunities to assess whether students understand that spiders' eight legs are adaptations that help them survive.",
