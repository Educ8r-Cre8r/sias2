The plants are growing in soil near a wooden fence and some rocks.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe **Anchoring Phenomenon** is a thriving garden ecosystem where different plants grow successfully in the same space. This happens because plants have different needs for sunlight, water, and nutrients. Some plants grow tall to reach more sunlight, while others spread wide along the ground. The variety of plants creates a mini-ecosystem where each plant finds its own way to survive and grow, similar to how plants grow in nature.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Plant Diversity** - Different types of plants can live in the same area because they have different needs and ways of growing\n2. **Basic Plant Needs** - All plants need sunlight, water, air, and nutrients from soil to grow and stay healthy\n3. **Plant Parts and Functions** - Plants have roots (underground), stems, leaves, and flowers that each do different jobs\n4. **Living vs. Non-living** - Plants are living things that grow and change, while rocks, soil, and fences are non-living\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"I Notice, I Wonder\" thinking routine when showing students this image. Have them share what they observe first, then what questions they have. This builds observation skills and scientific curiosity.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to share observations - verbal discussion, drawing, or using gesture/movement to show how plants grow up or spread out. This supports different learning styles and language abilities.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** Inside the plant roots, tiny root hairs are absorbing water and nutrients from the soil. The roots are like tiny straws drinking up what the plant needs to grow.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This garden is part of a larger neighborhood ecosystem that includes other yards, trees, and wildlife. Birds and insects visit this garden, and it connects to other green spaces in the community.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** Plants get their food from the soil\n   **Reality:** Plants make their own food using sunlight, air, and water. They get nutrients from soil, but not food.\n\n2. **Misconception:** All plants need the same amount of water and sun\n   **Reality:** Different plants have different needs - some like lots of sun, others prefer shade.\n\n3. **Misconception:** Plants don't need air\n   **Reality:** Plants need air (carbon dioxide) to make food and oxygen to breathe, just like animals.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** 2-LS2-1 Plan and conduct an investigation to determine if plants need sunlight and water to grow\n- **Disciplinary Core Idea:** [[NGSS:DCI:2-LS2.A]] - Plants depend on water and light to grow\n- **Crosscutting Concept:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns in the natural world can be observed and used as evidence\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you notice about how the different plants are arranged in this garden? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n2. Why do you think some flowers are orange and others are purple? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n3. What would happen if these plants didn't get water for many days? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n4. How are the plants in this garden similar to and different from each other? (Bloom's: Compare | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Ecosystem:** A place where living and non-living things work together\n* **Nutrients:** Special materials from soil that help plants grow strong\n* **Diversity:** Having many different types of living things in one place\n* **Habitat:** The place where a plant or animal lives and gets what it needs\n* **Sunlight:** Light from the sun that plants use to make their food\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- A Seed Is Sleepy by Dianna Hutts Aston\n- The Great Kapok Tree by Lynne Cherry\n- From Seed to Plant by Gail Gibbons\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- \"What Do Plants Need to Grow? | Needs of Plants\" - Simple explanation of plant needs with colorful animations (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP7Fb0gWOxk)\n- \"Parts of a Plant | Science for Kids\" - Interactive song about plant parts and their functions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RziraZijGHw)",
