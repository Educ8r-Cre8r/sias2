The dragonfly is an animal that lives in nature, and we can see it sitting very still among the green plants around it. This shows us how different animals live in their homes with the plants around them.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\nThis image shows **Animal Habitat and Survival Needs**. Dragonflies need to live near water and plants because they hunt for food like mosquitoes and small insects among the vegetation. The dragonfly is positioned on plants, which provide shelter and a safe place to rest while it hunts. This demonstrates that animals depend on their environment—the plants and location—to meet their basic needs for food, water, and shelter to survive.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Animals need homes:** Dragonflies live near plants and water because these places give them food, shelter, and safety. The plants in this photo are part of the dragonfly's home.\n\n* **Plants and animals live together:** The dragonfly and the plants exist in the same space. The dragonfly uses the plants as a place to rest and hunt, showing how plants and animals need each other in nature.\n\n* **Different animals need different things:** Dragonflies specifically need to be near water and plants because they hunt insects and their young (called nymphs) live in water. This is different from animals that need forests or deserts.\n\n* **Observation helps us learn:** By looking carefully at where animals are and what they are doing, we can figure out what they need to stay alive and healthy.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nStart by asking students to observe the photo quietly for 30 seconds before asking any questions. This \"quiet observation time\" helps develop careful looking skills and gives all learners—including English language learners—time to process what they see before verbal discussion begins.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple ways for students to show what they know: some children might draw where the dragonfly lives, others might use words to describe it, and some might act out how a dragonfly moves. Offer a word bank with pictures (dragonfly, plants, water, food, shelter) so all students can participate in discussions regardless of vocabulary level.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n**Zoom In:** If we could look very closely at the dragonfly's mouth, we would see tiny parts called **mandibles** that help it chew and eat small insects. The dragonfly's eyes are made of thousands of tiny pieces that help it see insects flying very fast—much faster than human eyes can see!\n\n**Zoom Out:** The dragonfly is part of a larger community called a **habitat** or **ecosystem** that includes the pond or stream where it was born, all the plants it rests on, the insects it eats, and the birds or fish that might eat the dragonfly. Everything in this ecosystem depends on everything else to survive.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n* **Misconception:** \"Dragonflies are bugs, so they must eat plants like caterpillars do.\"\n  - **Clarification:** Dragonflies are hunters! They eat other insects like mosquitoes and gnats. They have strong jaws for catching and eating meat, not for chewing plants.\n\n* **Misconception:** \"The dragonfly can live anywhere because it can fly.\"\n  - **Clarification:** Even though dragonflies can fly, they need to live near water and plants. Their babies (nymphs) live in water, and they need plants for shelter and hunting insects.\n\n* **Misconception:** \"Dragonflies don't need plants—they just need to fly around.\"\n  - **Clarification:** Dragonflies need plants to perch on while they rest, hunt, and lay their eggs. Plants are an important part of their survival.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**K-LS1-1:** Use observations to describe patterns of what plants and animals (including humans) need to survive.\n\n[[NGSS:DCI:K-LS1.A]] All organisms have external parts. Different animals use their body parts in different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, move from place to place, and seek, find, and take in food, water and air. Plants also have different parts (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits) that help them survive and grow.\n\n[[NGSS:DCI:K-LS1.C]] All animals need food, water, and air to survive. Animals get food from plants or from other animals. Plants need water and light to grow. All organisms need a place to live where they can find food, water, air, and shelter. It is the plant and animals' behaviors (eating, migrating, hibernating, etc.) that enable them to respond to seasonal variations.\n\n[[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] Students notice patterns in what animals need to survive by observing where they live and what they do.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n* \"Where is the dragonfly in this picture, and why do you think it chose to rest on the green plants?\" (Bloom's: Comprehend | DOK: 1)\n\n* \"What do you think the dragonfly needs to stay alive? How do the plants help the dragonfly get what it needs?\" (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n* \"If all the green plants disappeared, what would happen to the dragonfly? Why?\" (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n* \"What other animals or plants do you think live in a place with dragonflies, and how do they help each other?\" (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Dragonfly:** A small animal with wings and a long body that lives near water and eats insects.\n\n* **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives that has everything it needs to survive, like food, water, shelter, and air.\n\n* **Shelter:** A safe, protected place where an animal can rest, hide from danger, and stay safe.\n\n* **Survive:** To stay alive and healthy by getting the food, water, air, and shelter you need.\n\n* **Plants:** Living things that grow in the ground or on other surfaces, have leaves, and make their own food using sunlight.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n* **Create a Dragonfly Home:** Give students blue paper, green leaves, and other craft materials to build a pretend dragonfly habitat. Have them label or talk about the food, water, shelter, and plants the dragonfly needs. This lets them show they understand what animals need to survive.\n\n* **Dragonfly Hunt Walk:** Take students outside to a safe area with plants and water (if available). Have them quietly observe and draw pictures of insects they see, where they find them, and what plants are nearby. Back in class, compare what different insects need to survive.\n\n* **Dramatic Play: Living as a Dragonfly:** Have students pretend to be dragonflies. They can move around the classroom \"flying,\" land on plants to rest, and make the movements a dragonfly makes. Ask: \"What do you need? Where do you go? What do you eat?\" This helps them understand the dragonfly's life from a different perspective.\n\n## 🔗 Cross-Curricular Ideas\n\n* **Math:** Count the leaves visible in the photo and compare sizes. Create a bar graph showing \"Things Dragonflies Need\" (food, water, shelter, plants) and talk about which one is most important.\n\n* **ELA/Language Arts:** Read books about insects or dragonflies. Have students dictate or write simple sentences like \"A dragonfly needs plants\" or \"The dragonfly lives near water.\" Create a class book with student drawings and sentences about what animals need.\n\n* **Art:** Paint or draw dragonflies in their habitat, focusing on the bright colors and details visible in the photo. Discuss how the blue and black colors help the dragonfly blend in or stand out in nature.\n\n* **Social Studies:** Explore different habitats around your school or community (gardens, parks, water areas). Talk about what animals live there and what plants they have. Discuss how humans can protect animal habitats.\n\n## 🚀 STEM Career Connection\n\n* **Entomologist (Insect Scientist):** An entomologist studies insects like dragonflies to learn how they live, what they eat, and how they help nature. They might work outside in parks or in laboratories with microscopes. These scientists help us understand why insects are important for our world. **Average Annual Salary:** $63,000 USD\n\n* **Wetland Biologist:** A wetland biologist studies plants and animals that live in wet places like marshes and ponds where dragonflies are born. They make sure these special habitats stay healthy and safe for all the creatures living there. **Average Annual Salary:** $59,000 USD\n\n* **Nature Photographer:** A nature photographer takes beautiful pictures of animals like dragonflies in their homes to teach people about nature and science. They spend time outside, observe animals carefully, and share what they see with others through photos. **Average Annual Salary:** $34,000 USD\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n* **The Dragonfly Door** by Julia Satterthwaite\n* **Dragonflies** by Lisa Trumbauer\n* **From Tadpole to Dragonfly** by Debbie Dadey",
