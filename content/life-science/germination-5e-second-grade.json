Observing the Magic of Germination**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Life Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Three 45-minute sessions (or 2–3 hours total, spread across 1–2 weeks)\n- **NGSS Standards:** 2-LS2-1 (Plan and conduct an investigation to determine if plants need sunlight and water to grow)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Observe and describe what happens to a seed when it is given water and warmth over several days.\n- Explain that seeds need water to grow into plants.\n- Record observations about plant growth using drawings and simple sentences.\n- Predict what will happen to seeds in different conditions (with water vs. without water).\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by connecting the photograph to students' own experiences with seeds and plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of germinating seeds (displayed on screen, printed, or projected)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around printed copies. Give students 30 seconds to look silently.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe it to a partner.\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a seed? What did it look like?\"\n   - \"What do you think is happening to this seed right now?\"\n   - \"What do you think the seed needs to become a plant?\"\n\n3. **Take a class prediction:** Ask students, \"If we gave a seed water and left it in a sunny spot for a week, what do you think would happen?\" Write predictions on chart paper without judgment. Accept all answers (e.g., \"It will grow,\" \"It will break open,\" \"A plant will come out\").\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what's inside the seed that makes it able to grow into a plant. Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become seed scientists. We're going to plant seeds and watch them grow to see what they need.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the conditions seeds need to germinate through a hands-on growing experiment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 2 clear plastic cups or small clear containers per student (or pair)\n- Potting soil or damp paper towels\n- Bean seeds (lima beans or pinto beans work well—soak overnight to speed germination)\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Labels and markers\n- A sunny windowsill and a dark closet or covered area\n- Observation journals (paper to draw and write on)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up two experimental cups per student or pair:**\n   - **Cup A (Control - with water):** Fill halfway with moist soil. Plant one seed about 1 inch deep. Label \"WATER.\" Place in sunlight.\n   - **Cup B (Test - without water):** Fill halfway with dry soil. Plant one seed about 1 inch deep. Label \"NO WATER.\" Place in sunlight. Do NOT water it.\n   \n   *Alternative simpler setup:* Use just one seed per student planted in a cup with soil. Have the class together only water one group's seeds and not the other group's seeds to compare results.\n\n2. **Explain the investigation:** \"We're going to see if water helps seeds grow. Cup A will get water. Cup B will not get water. Everything else will be the same—same soil, same sunlight, same temperature. Let's see what happens!\"\n\n3. **Daily observations (over 1–2 weeks):**\n   - Water Cup A lightly every 2–3 days (keep soil moist, not soaked).\n   - Leave Cup B dry.\n   - Every 2–3 days, students observe and record in their **observation journals:**\n     - Draw what they see in each cup.\n     - Write or dictate: \"The seed with water looks…\" and \"The seed without water looks…\"\n     - Note any changes (cracks in the seed, shoots emerging, color changes).\n\n4. **Connection to photograph:** \"Look at the picture again. The seed in the photo is starting to sprout because someone gave it water. We're going to see if the same thing happens in our cups!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions without providing answers: \"What do you notice different between your two cups today?\" \"What changed since yesterday?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Help students use picture-based observation sheets if they cannot yet write independently.\n- Gently redirect if students overwater or disturb seeds.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- The watered seed will crack, sprout a root (grows down), and later a shoot (grows up), typically within 3–7 days.\n- The dry seed will remain unchanged or only partially crack.\n- Students will create a visual record of these differences over time.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding after students have observed real changes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student observation journals from Explore phase\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms and pictures\n- The photograph of the germinating seed (reference again)\n- Optional: simple diagram showing seed parts (seed coat, root, shoot)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather students and ask:\n   - \"What did you notice in your watered cup? What did you see happen?\"\n   - \"What did you notice in your dry cup? Did anything change?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the watered seed changed but the dry one didn't?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with pictures and simple definitions:\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|----------------------------|\n   | **Seed** | A tiny package that holds a baby plant inside. It has a hard coat to protect it. |\n   | **Germination** | When a seed starts to grow and wake up. It needs water and warmth to begin germinating. |\n   | **Root** | The part of the plant that grows DOWN into the soil. It drinks water for the plant. |\n   | **Shoot** | The part of the plant that grows UP toward the sun. It becomes the stem and leaves. |\n   | **Water** | A liquid that plants need to grow strong and healthy. |\n\n3. **Make connections to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the image: \"See the tiny white root growing down? That's what happened in your cups with water!\"\n   - \"See the green shoot? That's starting to reach for the light, just like your seeds will do.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask students to point to the root and shoot in the photo.\n   - Ask: \"What does a seed need to germinate?\" (Expect: \"Water!\")\n   - Show students the dry, ungerminated seed: \"This seed didn't get water. What happened to it?\" (Expect: \"It didn't grow\" or \"Nothing happened.\")\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Seed:** A tiny package that holds a baby plant inside with a hard coat to protect it.\n- **Germination:** When a seed starts to grow and wake up with water and warmth.\n- **Root:** The part of the plant that grows down into soil to drink water.\n- **Shoot:** The part of the plant that grows up toward the sun and becomes the stem and leaves.\n- **Water:** A liquid that plants need to grow strong and healthy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify a root and a shoot in the photo and in their own growing seeds.\n- Students can explain in simple terms: \"Seeds need water to grow.\"\n- Students understand that different parts of a plant do different things (roots drink water; shoots grow toward light).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding by testing another condition and deepening knowledge about plant needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Additional seeds and cups\n- Potting soil\n- Water\n- Tape and markers\n- Newspaper or paper towels\n- Optional: sunny windowsill, dark closet, or cardboard box to create darkness\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Test Another Variable (Light)**\n\n1. **Introduce a new question:** \"We learned that seeds need water to grow. But what about light? Do you think seeds need sunlight to germinate?\"\n\n2. **Set up a simple test:**\n   - Provide each student (or pair) with two more cups of seeds, both watered regularly.\n   - **Cup C:** Place in sunlight (windowsill).\n   - **Cup D:** Place in darkness (cover with a box or place in a closet).\n\n3. **Observe over 3–5 days:** Do both seeds germinate? Does one grow differently than the other? (Expected outcome: Both germinate, but the one in darkness may be paler or have a longer shoot reaching for light.)\n\n4. **Discussion:** \"What does this teach us about seeds? What do they need?\" Guide students to conclude: Seeds need water to germinate, and they need light to grow healthy and green.\n\n**Option B: Compare Results (If light test isn't feasible)**\n\n1. **Have students compare their original cups A and B to the photograph.**\n2. **Create a class graph:** Draw two columns—\"Seeds with Water\" and \"Seeds Without Water.\" Mark whether each seed germinated or not.\n3. **Write a class conclusion:** \"Our seeds with water grew, but our seeds without water did not. Plants need water to grow!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the new investigation by asking, \"What do you predict will happen?\" and \"How will we know?\"\n- Allow students to form hypotheses even if they're not scientifically accurate yet.\n- Ask students to explain their thinking: \"Why do you think that seed is taller/greener/different?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that multiple factors affect plant growth (water, light, warmth).\n- Students can make predictions about what seeds need.\n- Students understand that plants are living things that have requirements to survive and grow.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of seed germination and plant needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation of journals:** Review drawings and writing. Do students show progression? Can they label root and shoot?\n- **Questioning during Explore and Elaborate phases:** Listen to student explanations. Do they understand the connection between water and growth?\n- **Group discussions:** Observe whether students reference their observations when answering questions.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of lesson):**\n\nProvide students with a simple picture sheet or ask them to draw and answer:\n\n1. **Draw a picture** of a seed with water and a seed without water. Label what you see.\n\n2. **Answer these questions (by drawing, dictating, or writing):**\n   - \"What does a seed need to grow?\" \n   - \"What did you see happen to your seed?\"\n   - \"Look at the photo from the beginning. What part of the plant is the root? What part is the shoot?\"\n\n3. **Write or dictate one sentence:** \"I learned that seeds need ___________ to grow into plants.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student can identify water as necessary for seed growth.\n- Student's drawings show observable changes (cracking, roots, shoots) or lack thereof based on watering.\n- Student can point to and name a root and shoot in a germinating seed (photo or their own).\n- Student's exit ticket demonstrates understanding that water is essential for germination.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will recognize that the watered seed changed and the dry seed did not.\n- Students will be able to identify roots and shoots in photos and their own plants.\n- Students will articulate (verbally or in writing): \"Seeds need water to grow.\"\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Picture-based observation sheets:** Provide pre-drawn outlines of two cups. Students color or draw only what changed, rather than creating drawings from scratch. Include word labels (root, shoot, water, seed).\n\n2. **Sentence stems for exit ticket:** \n   - \"The seed with water grew _________.\"\n   - \"The seed without water _________.\"\n   - \"Seeds need _________ to grow.\"\n   \n   Students fill in the blanks or point to pictures of correct answers.\n\n3. **Peer observation partners:** Pair a struggling student with a stronger observer. They document findings together, with the stronger student helping describe what they see.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Test a third variable:** Ask, \"What if we kept our seeds in different temperatures—one in a warm place and one in a cold place—while both got water? What do you think would happen?\" Students design and conduct this investigation with teacher guidance.\n\n2. **Research and present:** Have students research what's inside a seed using picture books or digital resources. They create a simple poster showing the baby plant (embryo) inside the seed coat and present to a peer.\n\n3. **Predict the future:** Ask students to predict, \"If we keep watering and giving light, what will your plant look like in 3 weeks? 3 months? What will it need then?\" They draw and write predictions and can check them later.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Grow a plant to maturity:** Continue watering the seedlings daily. Transplant to larger pots. Track growth over weeks and months. Measure height weekly and create a bar graph. Observe when first true leaves appear, when the plant flowers (if applicable).\n\n2. **Seed hunt and collection:** Take students on a nature walk to observe and collect different types of seeds (pinecones, acorns, pods, dandelion fluff, etc.). Sort them by size, shape, and color. Discuss how different plants make seeds and how seeds travel (dispersal—connects to 2-LS2-2 if desired to develop in future lessons).\n\n3. **Plant needs poster:** Have students create a class poster showing all the things plants need to grow: water, sunlight, soil, and warmth. Include pictures from magazines, drawings, and words. Display in the classroom and refer to it throughout the year when discussing plants.\n\n---",
