Identify and describe the internal and external structures of a squash and explain how each structure helps the plant reproduce.\n2. Explain the function of seeds and the fruit's flesh in plant reproduction and survival.\n3. Construct an evidence-based argument using observations that plant structures are designed for reproduction.\n4. Compare how different plant structures (seeds, flesh, protective coating) work together to support the plant's life cycle.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the cut squash halves (or printed copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the projector or document camera. Show the image of the cut squash halves with visible seeds and flesh. Do not explain what they're looking at yet.\n\n2. **Pose the opening question:** \"What do you think this plant part is, and why do you see all these little things inside?\" Allow 30 seconds of think-time before taking responses.\n\n3. **Ask these discovery questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"Why might a plant make so many seeds inside this fruit?\"\n   - \"What do you notice about the position and arrangement of the seeds? Why do you think they're arranged this way?\"\n   - \"What do you think would happen to these seeds if an animal ate this fruit?\"\n   - \"How is this fruit different from the outside of the plant? Why might a plant need both?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"If you could open up a different plant fruit—like an apple, a bean pod, or a pumpkin—what do you predict you'd find inside? Why?\"\n\n5. **Record student predictions and wonderings** on chart paper to revisit during the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become plant detectives. You'll get to examine squash halves just like the ones in this picture, and discover why plants have these special internal structures.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- 1 halved butternut or acorn squash (pre-cut, room temperature, safe for handling)\n- Paper plate or tray to contain seeds and pulp\n- Spoon or plastic knife for scooping\n- Small cup or bowl for collected seeds\n- Hand lens or magnifying glass (optional but recommended)\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Data collection sheet (see below)\n- Pencil\n\n**Data Collection Sheet Template:**\n\n```\nSQUASH STRUCTURE INVESTIGATION\nName: _________________ Date: _____________\n\nExternal Observations (outside the squash):\n- Color: _________________________________\n- Shape: _________________________________\n- Skin texture: ____________________________\n\nInternal Observations (inside the squash):\n1. Seeds:\n   - Count how many seeds you can see: ______\n   - Describe their color and shape: __________\n   - Are they all the same? ________________\n\n2. Flesh/Pulp:\n   - Color: _______________________________\n   - Texture (soft, hard, stringy?): __________\n   - How thick is it? _____________________\n\n3. Cavity (the hollow space):\n   - What does it contain? __________________\n   - Why do you think the seeds are here? _____\n\nMy Prediction: What do the seeds need to grow into new plants?\n_____________________________________________\n```\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** and squash halves to students (pairs work well).\n\n2. **Provide clear directions:**\n   - \"Look at the outside of your squash first. Describe what you see—color, shape, how the skin feels.\"\n   - \"Now, use your spoon to gently scoop out the seeds and stringy pulp. Place them on your plate.\"\n   - \"Count the seeds in your squash. How many did you find?\"\n   - \"Use the hand lens to look closely at a single seed. Describe its texture, color, and shape.\"\n   - \"Look at the flesh (the yellow/orange part) inside your squash. Feel it. Is it soft or hard? Thick or thin?\"\n   - \"Look at the hollow space where the seeds were. What do you think that space is for?\"\n\n3. **Connection to photograph:** \"Compare your real squash to the picture. Can you see the same structures in both?\"\n\n4. **Recording:** Students complete the data collection sheet as they investigate, drawing pictures and writing observations.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: *\"Why do you think the seeds are surrounded by that flesh?\" \"What might happen if an animal ate this fruit?\" \"How does the thick skin protect what's inside?\"*\n- Do not provide answers; encourage students to make their own observations and inferences.\n- Assist with counting seeds if needed, but allow students to do the work.\n- Ensure safe handling and cleanup.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and record that seeds are arranged in a central cavity surrounded by flesh.\n- Students count seeds and discover there are many seeds in each squash.\n- Students describe the internal structure (seeds, flesh, skin) and begin to wonder about their purposes.\n- Students create sketches and data records showing their observations.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or poster board\n- Markers\n- Completed student data sheets\n- The photograph of the cut squash (displayed again)\n- Optional: pictures of other fruits with seeds (apple, watermelon, bean pod)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 3-4 student pairs to briefly describe what they observed. Record key observations on chart paper, organizing them into categories: *External Structures, Internal Structures, and What We Wonder.*\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions. Write each term and definition on chart paper, and have students add it to a science vocabulary notebook or wall chart:\n\n   - **Seed:** A tiny package containing a baby plant and food it needs to grow. Seeds can become new plants.\n   - **Fruit:** The part of a plant that holds and protects the seeds. The flesh inside and the skin outside are part of the fruit.\n   - **Reproduction:** Making new living things. Plants reproduce by making seeds.\n   - **Structure:** A part of a plant (or animal) that has a special job to do. Different structures do different things.\n   - **Protection:** Keeping something safe from harm. The thick skin and flesh protect the seeds inside.\n\n3. **Connect back to observations:** \n   - \"When you counted all those seeds, you discovered that one squash can make many, many new plants! That's the fruit's job—to hold and protect all these seeds.\"\n   - \"The flesh inside is packed with nutrients—food—that helps new baby plants grow.\"\n   - \"The tough outer skin keeps the seeds safe until an animal eats the fruit or the squash falls and breaks open.\"\n   - Point to the photograph: \"This is exactly what you observed in your squash halves. See the seeds? The orange flesh? The green skin?\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Turn to a partner and explain: Why does a plant make a fruit around its seeds?\" (Listen for responses about protection, dispersal, nutrition.)\n   - Ask: \"If there were no flesh around these seeds, what might happen to them?\"\n   - Show a picture of an apple or watermelon: \"What structures inside this fruit do you think work the same way as your squash?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Seed** | A tiny package that holds a baby plant and food to help it grow. Each seed can become a new plant. |\n| **Fruit** | The part of a plant that grows around the seeds to protect them. It includes the flesh and the skin. |\n| **Reproduction** | Making new living things. Plants make seeds so new plants can grow. |\n| **Structure** | A part of a living thing that has a special job. Different structures do different things to help the plant survive. |\n| **Protection** | Keeping something safe from harm or damage. The fruit protects seeds. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that seeds are baby plants and that fruits protect them.\n- Students recognize that squash is a fruit, not just a vegetable.\n- Students can explain one reason why plants make fruits: to protect and disperse seeds.\n- Students begin to see structures as having specific functions related to survival and reproduction.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or poster board (one per group)\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Pictures or samples of other fruits with seeds (apple, pumpkin, bean pod, orange, watermelon, avocado, or acorn—as available)\n- Optional: hand lenses for closer observation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station Rotation: Fruit Structure Exploration**\n\n1. **Set up 3-4 stations**, each with a different fruit (or fruit picture) that students can observe.\n\n2. **Divide the class into small groups** (3-4 students per group). Groups rotate through stations, spending 4-5 minutes at each.\n\n3. **At each station, students:**\n   - Observe the fruit and its seeds.\n   - Answer on a station card or in their science notebook:\n     - *\"Where are the seeds in this fruit?\"*\n     - *\"How is this fruit similar to the squash we examined?\"*\n     - *\"How is it different?\"*\n     - *\"How does this fruit protect its seeds?\"*\n\n4. **Whole-class synthesis:** After rotations, gather as a group. Ask:\n   - \"What did you discover about how different plants protect their seeds?\"\n   - \"Why do all fruits have seeds inside?\"\n   - Create a class chart titled *\"How Plants Protect Their Seeds\"* and record patterns students noticed across the fruits.\n\n**Alternative activity (if fruit samples unavailable):**\n\n**Create a labeled diagram:** Students draw and label a cross-section of their squash, identifying the seed, flesh, skin, and central cavity. Next to their diagram, they write 2-3 sentences explaining how each structure helps the squash reproduce or protect its seeds. Model this on a large poster first.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate station rotations and ensure materials are accessible.\n- Ask probing questions: *\"What job does the skin do here? The flesh? The seeds?\"*\n- Guide students to notice patterns across different fruits.\n- Ensure students connect their observations to the concept of reproduction and survival.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe multiple fruits and recognize common structural patterns (seeds inside, protective flesh, protective skin).\n- Students infer that different plants have adapted fruits suited to their environments and reproduction strategies.\n- Students deepen their argument that plant structures support reproduction.\n- Students produce diagrams and written explanations showing deeper understanding.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- Observation of student responses during Engage discussion and partner talks during Explain.\n- Review of completed data collection sheets from Explore phase for accuracy and completeness.\n- Listen to student explanations during Elaborate station rotations and the class synthesis discussion.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket**\n\nDistribute an exit ticket (digital or paper) with the following prompts. Students complete before leaving class:\n\n**Exit Ticket: What I Learned About Plant Structures and Reproduction**\n\n*Name: _________________ Date: _____________*\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Sketch a cross-section of the squash you examined. Label: seed, flesh, skin, and cavity.\n\n2. **Explain in 2-3 sentences:** Why does a plant make fruit around its seeds?\n\n3. **Construct an argument:** Use what you observed to complete this sentence:\n   - *\"The internal structures of a squash support reproduction because __________________________.\"*\n   - Provide at least one piece of evidence from your observations.\n\n4. **Extend your thinking:** If a fruit had no protective flesh around the seeds, what might happen? Explain your reasoning.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding when they can:\n- ✓ Accurately identify and label internal and external structures of the squash (seed, flesh, skin, cavity).\n- ✓ Explain that the fruit (flesh and skin) protects seeds.\n- ✓ Recognize that multiple seeds in one fruit is a reproductive strategy.\n- ✓ Provide at least one observation-based reason why plants have fruits (e.g., \"The thick skin keeps the seeds safe,\" \"The flesh gives seeds food to grow,\" \"Seeds are packed together inside to be dispersed together\").\n- ✓ Make a logical connection between a plant structure and a reproductive function.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets reveal whether students understand that fruits are reproductive structures.\n- Students can identify the functions of different parts (seed = future plant; flesh = nutrition/protection; skin = protection).\n- Most students construct a basic argument linking structure to function related to reproduction.\n- Advanced students may recognize that fruits attract animals, helping with seed dispersal.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Sentence frames for explanation:** Provide pre-written sentence frames for the exit ticket and Elaborate activities:\n   - *\"The seeds are inside the fruit because _______.\"*\n   - *\"The flesh around the seeds helps by _______.\"*\n   - *\"The skin of the squash protects the seeds by _______.\"*\n\n2. **Simplified data collection:** Offer a picture-based data sheet where students circle, color, or point to structures rather than write detailed descriptions. Include pictures of seed, flesh, and skin with blank lines for labels.\n\n3. **Peer partnerships:** Pair struggling learners with strong communicators during Explore and Elaborate. Assign them specific observation roles (e.g., counter, illustrator, describer) to ensure active engagement.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate seed dispersal:** Ask: *\"How do you think these seeds get from the fruit into the ground to grow? What animal or natural force might help?\"* Have students research or design an experiment to test how far a seed could travel if released from the squash. Connect to the photograph's setting (grass nearby).\n\n2. **Compare reproductive strategies:** Provide students with pictures of different fruits (berries, nuts, pods, winged seeds). Ask them to construct an argument comparing how different plant structures serve the same reproductive function in different ways. Create a comparative analysis chart.\n\n3. **Model the complete life cycle:** Challenge students to create a labeled diagram or comic strip showing the complete life cycle of a squash plant, from seed inside the fruit, to germination, to flowering, to fruit production. Include structural labels and functional explanations at each stage.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Germination Experiment:** Plant squash seeds (or other large seeds from the fruit) in cups with soil and water. Students observe and record the growth of the root, stem, and first leaves over 2-3 weeks. Compare this to their earlier observations about how the seed is protected in the fruit. Discuss why a seed needs the flesh/nutrients inside the fruit before it can grow in soil.\n\n2. **Visit a Local Garden or Farmer's Market:** Arrange a field trip or virtual tour. Ask students to observe different fruits and vegetables, identify which have seeds inside, and record their observations. Have them photograph or sketch examples and create a classroom \"Fruits with Seeds\" poster displaying images with labels describing the protective structures.\n\n3. **Plant Reproduction Art and Writing:** Students create a \"seed travel adventure\" story or comic from the perspective of a seed inside a squash. The narrative should include details about the fruit's structures, how the seed is protected, and how it eventually disperses and grows. Integrate this with literacy instruction for a cross-curricular project.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson empowers fourth graders to observe, investigate, and construct evidence-based arguments about how plant structures—seeds, flesh, and protective skin—work together to support reproduction and survival. The progression from concrete observation to abstract reasoning about function builds scientific thinking aligned with NGSS 4-LS1-1.",
