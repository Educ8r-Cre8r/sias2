Observe and describe the different plants and animals that live on and inside a fallen log.\n2. Explain that a fallen log is a special habitat where many living things can grow and survive.\n3. Identify that decomposing wood provides nutrients and shelter for plants and organisms to thrive.\n4. Compare the diversity of life in a log habitat to other habitats they know.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about decomposition and habitats using the photograph of the nurse log.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Photograph of the nurse log (projected or printed)\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Picture/video of a healthy green tree (for comparison)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Display and Introduction:**\n  Project the nurse log photograph on the board. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation, then ask:\n\n  **Discussion Questions:**\n  1. \"What do you see in this picture? Describe what the log looks like to you.\"\n  2. \"Do you think this log is alive? Why or why not?\"\n  3. \"Look carefully—can you spot any plants or living things growing on or near the log? Point them out to a partner.\"\n  4. \"Why do you think there are green plants and weeds growing around and near this old, broken log?\"\n\n  **Wonder Prompt:**\n  \"This dead log might seem like it's the end of the story for this tree, but it's really the beginning of a new adventure. I wonder what invisible creatures might be living *inside* this log right now? What do you think? Turn to your neighbor and share one guess.\"\n\n  Record student predictions on chart paper titled \"What's Living in the Log?\" without correcting responses.\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be log detectives and discover all the surprising life hiding in and on fallen logs!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students investigate the different organisms and conditions present in a decomposing log habitat through observation and hands-on discovery.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Small, rotting log sections (pre-collected; ensure they're safe to handle)\n  - Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per pair)\n  - Observation sheets (printed template with labeled drawings of log exterior, interior, and surroundings)\n  - Small paintbrushes or craft sticks for gently probing\n  - Paper towels\n  - Containers for collecting small specimens (optional, if your school permits catch-and-release observation)\n  - Chart: \"What We Found in Our Log\"\n  - Colored pencils or crayons\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Student Directions:**\n\n  1. **In pairs**, receive a small rotting log section and an observation sheet.\n\n  2. **Exterior Observation:** Use your hand lens to examine the *outside* of the log. Look for:\n     - Green plants or moss growing on the bark\n     - Insects or bugs crawling on it\n     - Holes or tunnels\n     - Color changes in the wood\n     - Draw or label what you see in the \"Outside of Log\" box on your sheet.\n\n  3. **Interior Investigation:** Carefully use a craft stick or brush to gently probe *into* the soft, broken areas of the log. Do NOT pry hard—be gentle! Observe:\n     - What color is the wood inside? (Compare to outside.)\n     - Is the wood hard or soft?\n     - Do you see any insects, worms, or tiny creatures?\n     - Do you see fungi (white threads or fuzzy patches)?\n     - Record or draw your observations in the \"Inside of Log\" box.\n\n  4. **Surrounding Habitat:** Look at the ground and plants *around* the log. Record:\n     - What plants are growing near it?\n     - Are there animals nearby?\n     - Does the soil around the log look different from other soil?\n\n  5. **Prediction:** On the back of your sheet, answer: \"Why do you think so many plants and animals like living in or near this log?\"\n\n  **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate and ask clarifying questions without giving away answers: \"What textures do you feel? What do those white threads remind you of?\"\n  - Encourage students to use sensory language: soft, crumbly, damp, dark.\n  - Gently guide students to safe handling: \"Be gentle so we don't hurt the tiny creatures living here.\"\n  - Take photos of student discoveries for later discussion.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students observe visible decomposers (fungi, insects, worms) and new plant growth.\n  - Students note that the interior wood is softer and darker than exterior wood.\n  - Students document organisms and plants in their habitat.\n  - Students begin to form hypotheses about why a log supports so much life.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after exploration, connecting observations to life cycles and habitats.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n  - Photos taken during Explore (if available)\n  - Picture cards or simple illustrations: fungi, decomposer, nutrient, habitat, microhabitat\n  - Anchor chart: \"The Life Cycle of a Tree\"\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Group Share-Out:**\n  Invite 3-4 pairs to share one observation from their log. Ask the class: \"Did other groups find the same things? Raise your hand if you found green plants too!\" Create a master list on chart paper: \"All the Life We Found in Logs.\"\n\n  **Introduce Key Vocabulary:**\n\n  Present and define these terms using student observations as examples:\n\n  1. **Decomposer:** A living thing (like fungi or insects) that breaks down dead plants and animals. \"The white fuzzy stuff you might have seen—that's a fungus! It's a decomposer helping break down the log into smaller pieces.\"\n\n  2. **Decomposition:** The process of something breaking down and rotting. \"The log is decomposing. That's why it feels soft instead of hard like a living tree.\"\n\n  3. **Nutrient:** Food or material that living things need to grow and be healthy. \"When the log breaks down, it turns into nutrients—special food—that goes into the soil. Plants can use those nutrients to grow!\"\n\n  4. **Habitat:** The place where a plant or animal lives and finds everything it needs. \"The log is a habitat—a home—for insects, fungi, and plants.\"\n\n  5. **Microhabitat:** A tiny special habitat within a larger area. \"Under the bark, inside the holes, in the dark—these are all tiny microhabitats hiding in one log!\"\n\n  **Connections Back to Photo and Explore:**\n  \"Remember those green plants we saw growing around and on the log? They're growing *because* the log is decomposing and making nutrients. And all those insects and fungi we discovered? They're the decomposers doing the work! It's like the log is becoming food for the forest.\"\n\n  **Check for Understanding:**\n  Ask students to turn to a partner and complete this sentence: \"A decomposer is _____.\" Listen to responses and gently correct misconceptions.\n\n- **Vocabulary:** (See above for detailed definitions provided to students.)\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students understand that fallen logs decompose and provide nutrients for new plant growth.\n  - Students can identify decomposers and explain their role.\n  - Students recognize a log as a habitat with smaller microhabitats inside.\n  - Students see the connection between death (tree falls) and new life (plants, fungi, insects).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by comparing the log habitat to other habitats and predicting what will happen as decomposition continues.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper: \"Log Habitat vs. Other Habitats\"\n  - Pictures of different habitats (forest floor, garden, pond, tree bark, under a rock—simple images)\n  - Prediction worksheet: \"What Will Happen to the Log?\"\n  - Colored pencils\n  - Optional: Small potted plant or seedling to observe\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Habitat Comparison:**\n  Display pictures of 2-3 different habitats (forest floor, garden, bird's nest). Ask:\n  - \"What living things did we find in the log habitat?\"\n  - \"What living things might be in this pond/garden/tree?\"\n  - \"How is the log habitat the same? How is it different?\"\n  - Record responses on a simple Venn diagram or chart.\n\n  Highlight: \"The log is special because it brings together SO many different organisms in one tiny space. It's very crowded with life!\"\n\n  **Prediction Activity - \"The Future of the Log\":**\n\n  Show students a progression of images (if available) or draw simple illustrations on chart paper showing:\n  - Year 1: Fresh log (still looks like a log)\n  - Year 3: Log is softer, more overgrown with plants\n  - Year 5+: Log is mostly crumbled into soil, invisible as a log\n\n  Ask: \"What do you think will happen to the log after 1 year? 3 years? 5 years? Why?\"\n\n  Students draw and write their predictions on a worksheet showing what the log might look like in the future.\n\n  **Real-World Connection:**\n  \"This is how forests renew themselves! Every fallen log eventually becomes part of the soil. New trees and plants grow in that rich soil. The forest keeps going because of decomposers and nutrients from fallen logs.\"\n\n  **Teacher Role:**\n  Facilitate discussion, ask follow-up questions, and validate student thinking without correcting predictions prematurely—these will be revisited in future observations.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students recognize that a log habitat is rich in biodiversity.\n  - Students predict that over time, logs will break down completely and become soil.\n  - Students understand the long-term cycle: fallen tree → decomposition → nutrient-rich soil → new plant growth.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of habitats, decomposition, and the role of decomposers in sustaining life.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n  - Observe student observations and drawings during Explore phase—note who identifies organisms and who asks questions about decomposition.\n  - Listen to student responses during Explain vocabulary check.\n  - Review prediction drawings for evidence of understanding cause and effect.\n\n  **Exit Ticket (Individual, ~5 minutes):**\n  Provide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal for emerging readers):\n\n  **Question 1 (Draw and Write):** \"Draw one living thing you saw on or in the log. Write or tell: What is it? Does it help break down the log?\"\n\n  **Question 2 (Multiple Choice or Draw):** \"What does a decomposer do?\"\n  - A. It eats dead things and breaks them down.\n  - B. It builds new logs.\n  - C. It keeps logs from falling.\n\n  **Question 3 (Open Response):** \"Why is a fallen log a good home for plants and animals?\"\n\n  **Success Criteria:**\n  ✓ Student identifies at least one organism from the log habitat.\n  ✓ Student uses the word \"decomposer,\" \"nutrient,\" or \"break down\" appropriately.\n  ✓ Student explains that a log provides shelter, food, or nutrients for living things.\n  ✓ Student makes a reasonable prediction about what happens to logs over time.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Exit ticket responses demonstrate student understanding of habitats and decomposition.\n  - Students can name and describe at least one organism found in the log.\n  - Students show emerging understanding that decomposition creates conditions for new life.\n  - Students recognize a fallen log as a valuable ecosystem, not \"dead wood.\"\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (Struggling Learners):**\n  1. **Simplified observation sheet:** Provide a pre-drawn diagram with labeled boxes (outside, inside, nearby plants) where students only need to circle or place checkmarks for what they see, rather than draw.\n  2. **Vocabulary scaffolding:** Pre-teach key vocabulary (decomposer, habitat, nutrient) using real objects—show a piece of moldy fruit, compare soft and hard wood—before the lesson.\n  3. **Partner pairing:** Pair struggling students with more observant peers during Explore, and assign the teacher to work closely with this pair to model how to use the hand lens and ask questions.\n  4. **Exit ticket alternative:** Offer a picture sort or verbal response instead of written exit ticket; accept one-word or two-word answers.\n\n- **Challenge (Advanced Learners):**\n  1. **Research extension:** Have students research what happens to logs in different climates (rainforest vs. desert vs. temperate forest). Do decomposers work faster or slower in different places? Why?\n  2. **Design a habitat:** Ask advanced students to design a \"perfect log habitat\" on paper—what would it need? Where should it be placed (sun/shade/wet/dry)? Why would organisms prefer this location?\n  3. **Deeper investigation:** Invite students to examine the log over multiple weeks, documenting changes in photographs. Measure how much the log crumbles or how many new plants grow. Create a time-lapse sequence or written log of changes.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Log Detective\" Field Journal (1-2 weeks):**\n   If possible, place a marked log (or section) in a safe outdoor location near the school. Have students visit it weekly to sketch and record changes: Are there more plants? Are the insects different? Is the wood softer? Create a simple bar graph showing decomposition progress over time. This extends 2-LS2-1 (investigating growth conditions) and 2-LS4-1 (observing habitat diversity).\n\n2. **Build a \"Log Habitat\" Terrarium:**\n   In a clear container, layer soil, small rotting wood pieces, and add live plants (moss, small seedlings), insects (pill bugs, if safe), and leaves. Keep it moist and observe for 2-3 weeks. Students predict what will happen and observe whether plants thrive, whether decomposers stay active, and how the habitat changes. This models a real log habitat in miniature and extends understanding of plant growth conditions (2-LS2-1).\n\n3. **\"What Eats What?\" Food Web Discussion:**\n   Create a simple food web showing: Log (producer/source) → Decomposers (fungi, beetles) → Larger insects → Birds. Discuss: \"If we removed the log, what would these animals lose?\" This plant the seeds for third-grade food chain concepts and deepens understanding of organism interdependence in habitats (2-LS4-1).\n\n4. **Invite a Naturalist or Mycologist:**\n   If available, invite a local nature educator or fungi expert to discuss the role of decomposers in the forest. This brings real-world expertise and deepens student engagement with the concept.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
