ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about animals and habitats using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed copy or projected image of the raccoon photograph (or display on interactive board)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Small stuffed raccoon or toy for tactile learners\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without any introduction. Ask students to look silently for 30 seconds and notice what they see. This builds anticipation and focuses attention.\n\n2. **Ask these four discussion questions** (display one at a time; allow 1-2 minutes per question):\n   - *\"What animal do you see in this picture? How do you know it's a raccoon?\"* (Prompt them to notice the mask-like markings around the eyes, the size, and the gray fur.)\n   - *\"Where do you think this raccoon is? What clues in the picture tell you?\"* (Guide them to notice the water, the log, the green plants, and the natural setting.)\n   - *\"What do you think this raccoon might be doing here?\"* (Accept predictions: looking for food, playing, resting, exploring.)\n   - *\"If you were a raccoon, what would you need in this place to live and survive?\"* (Draw out: water, food, shelter, safety.)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt**: \"I wonder why raccoons like places with water, trees, and logs? Let's find out how their special traits help them live in habitats like this.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to explore what makes raccoons such amazing survivors in wet, wild places, and we'll discover why their special features are perfect for where they live.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate raccoon adaptations and habitat needs through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 3-4 printed copies of the raccoon photograph (one per small group)\n- **\"Raccoon Detective\" observation sheet** (see template below)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per pair)\n- Chart paper labeled with columns: \"Body Parts,\" \"What It Does,\" \"Why It Helps Raccoons\"\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: Real objects to touch—rough bark, smooth river stone, wet sponge—to simulate habitat textures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into small groups** (3-4 students per group). Distribute one photograph and one observation sheet per group.\n\n2. **Explain the task**: \"You are raccoon detectives. Your job is to look very carefully at this raccoon and discover its special features. Use your hand lens to zoom in. Look at:\n   - The markings on its face\n   - Its paws and how they're positioned\n   - Its fur\n   - Its size compared to the log\n   - How it fits into this place\"\n\n3. **Direct students to complete the observation sheet** (provided below). They should:\n   - **Draw or label** at least 4 special features of the raccoon\n   - **Write or dictate** one sentence about each feature (e.g., \"The mask helps the raccoon see in the dark\")\n   - **Mark where the raccoon is** in the picture and note what's nearby (water, log, plants)\n\n4. **Observation Sheet Template**:\n   ```\n   RACCOON DETECTIVE SHEET\n   \n   Name: ________________________     Date: __________\n   \n   **What special features does this raccoon have?**\n   \n   Feature 1: _________________ \n   What it does: _________________________________\n   \n   Feature 2: _________________\n   What it does: _________________________________\n   \n   Feature 3: _________________\n   What it does: _________________________________\n   \n   **Where is the raccoon in the photo?**\n   Circle: Water / Log / Plants / All of these\n   \n   **Why do you think the raccoon is here?**\n   _____________________________________________\n   ```\n\n5. **Optional tactile exploration**: While groups work, circulate and invite students to touch actual textures (bark, stone, damp sponge) and compare to the raccoon's environment in the photo.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions rather than giving answers:\n  - *\"What do you notice about the raccoon's paws? How are they different from your hands?\"*\n  - *\"Why might a mask-like marking be useful if a raccoon comes out at night?\"*\n  - *\"What food might a raccoon find near water and logs?\"*\n- Support students in recording ideas (scribe for emergent writers)\n- Encourage use of hand lenses and close observation\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify 4+ physical traits of the raccoon (mask, paws, claws, fur, size, tail)\n- Students make initial connections between traits and the environment (e.g., paws for climbing logs, water access for food)\n- Students produce written/drawn observations they can share\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts about adaptations and habitat after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart from Explore phase with student observations\n- Large poster or digital display with vocabulary terms\n- Photograph displayed again (large, central)\n- Index cards with vocabulary words and pictures (optional, for word wall)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on carpet** with the large photograph visible. Invite each group to share **one observation** from their detective sheets. As they share, add their findings to a class chart:\n\n   | Body Part | What It Does | Why It Helps |\n   |-----------|--------------|-------------|\n   | Mask | Blocks glare from water | Helps see and hunt |\n   | Paws | Grab and hold things | Can open things, climb |\n   | Fur | Keeps warm and dry | Survives in wet places |\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** with student-friendly language. Point to the photograph as you define each term:\n\n   - **Adaptation**: A special feature on an animal's body that helps it survive in its habitat. (Point to the mask and paws.) *\"The raccoon's mask and clever paws are adaptations.\"*\n   \n   - **Habitat**: The place where an animal lives. It has everything the animal needs to survive—food, water, shelter, and safety. (Point to the water, log, and vegetation.) *\"This wetland with water, logs, and plants is a perfect habitat for raccoons.\"*\n   \n   - **Trait**: A special feature or characteristic that an animal is born with. (Point to the mask.) *\"Raccoons are born with their mask marking. That's a trait.\"*\n   \n   - **Inherited**: Traits that come from a baby animal's parents. All raccoons have masks because their parents have masks. (Show pictures of multiple raccoons if available.) *\"The mask is inherited—baby raccoons get it from their mom and dad.\"*\n   \n   - **Survival**: Staying alive and healthy. (Point back to the photo.) *\"Raccoons survive in wetlands because they have the right adaptations for that habitat.\"*\n\n3. **Make explicit connections** back to the photograph:\n   - *\"Look at this raccoon's smart paws. They're an adaptation that helps it survive by catching food in the water and climbing that log. Every raccoon inherits paws like these from its parents.\"*\n   - *\"This habitat—with water, shelter from logs and plants, and lots of food—is perfect for raccoons. A raccoon would not survive as well in a hot desert. Why? Because it doesn't have the adaptations for that place.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding**:\n   - Ask: *\"Why are a raccoon's paws an important adaptation?\"* (They can grab things, open things, hold food)\n   - Ask: *\"Is the mask something a raccoon learns, or is it born with it?\"* (Born with it—it's inherited)\n   - Ask: *\"Could a raccoon survive in a place with no water? Why or why not?\"* (Guide them to see that water is part of a raccoon's habitat and survival needs)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n1. **Adaptation** – A special body part or skill that helps an animal survive in its home.\n2. **Habitat** – The place where an animal lives that has food, water, shelter, and safety.\n3. **Trait** – A body feature that an animal is born with (like the raccoon's mask).\n4. **Inherited** – A trait that a baby animal gets from its parents.\n5. **Survival** – Staying alive and staying healthy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define adaptation and habitat in their own words\n- Students can name 3+ raccoon adaptations and explain why each one helps\n- Students understand that the raccoon's features are inherited and match its habitat\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by comparing raccoons to other animals and considering how they might adapt to different habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of 4-5 different animals (squirrel, deer, duck, beaver, fox—or animals studied in class)\n- Chart paper titled \"Adaptations for Different Habitats\"\n- Colored markers\n- Optional: **\"Raccoon Habitat Sorting\" worksheet** (see below)\n- Pictures of different habitats: desert, forest, grassland, wetland, mountain\n\n**Activity Option A: Adaptation Comparison (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display pictures of 4 other animals** (squirrel, deer, duck, beaver) alongside the raccoon photograph.\n\n2. **Ask comparison questions**:\n   - *\"How is a raccoon's body different from a squirrel's? Which animal do you think is better at catching fish in water? Why?\"*\n   - *\"A beaver also lives in water. What adaptations does a beaver have that a raccoon doesn't? Why might a beaver's tail and flat teeth be important?\"*\n   - *\"Could a raccoon survive in the same habitat as a desert coyote? Why or why not?\"*\n\n3. **Create a class comparison chart**:\n\n   | Animal | Habitat | Special Adaptations | Why It's Good for That Home |\n   |--------|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n   | Raccoon | Wetland | Smart paws, mask, fur | Catches water food, climbs logs |\n   | Squirrel | Forest | Sharp claws, bushy tail | Climbs trees, keeps balance |\n   | Duck | Water | Webbed feet, waterproof feathers | Swims and dives |\n\n4. **Conclude**: *\"Different animals have different adaptations for different habitats. The raccoon is a superstar in the wetland!\"*\n\n**Activity Option B: Habitat Suitability Sorting (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Display pictures of 5 habitats**: desert, rainforest, grassland, wetland, ice/arctic.\n\n2. **Show students the raccoon photograph** and ask: *\"Which habitats would be good homes for raccoons? Which would be hard? Why?\"*\n\n3. **Have students sort** habitats into three categories:\n   - **\"Raccoons thrive here!\"** (Wetland, temperate forest with water)\n   - **\"Raccoons can survive here.\"** (Grassland, temperate forest without much water)\n   - **\"Raccoons cannot survive here.\"** (Desert, Arctic)\n\n4. **Discuss reasoning**: *\"Why is a wetland perfect? Because raccoons need water, and their fur keeps them warm and dry in cool, wet places. Why can't they live in a desert? They need water constantly, and their dark fur would get too hot.\"*\n\n5. **Record ideas on chart** for reference and future study.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask probing questions to deepen thinking\n- Validate all reasoning and ask students to justify their choices with evidence from the photograph and what they learned\n- Guide students to see that adaptations are \"matched\" to habitats\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students explain how raccoon adaptations are well-suited to wetlands\n- Students compare raccoon traits to at least 2 other animals and describe differences\n- Students predict whether raccoons could thrive in unfamiliar habitats and explain why/why not\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of raccoon adaptations, inherited traits, and habitat suitability.\n\n**Activity: Multi-Part Assessment**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** while students work in Explore and Elaborate phases:\n  - ☐ Identifies at least 3 physical traits of the raccoon\n  - ☐ Makes connections between traits and habitat needs\n  - ☐ Uses vocabulary (adaptation, habitat, inherited) appropriately in discussion\n  - ☐ Compares raccoon features to other animals with reasoning\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n\nProvide students with these three prompts (read aloud; accept verbal or written responses):\n\n1. **\"Show me one special feature of the raccoon in this picture. Why does that feature help the raccoon survive in a wetland?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria*: Names a feature (paws, mask, fur) and gives a reason connected to habitat (catches food, sees at night, stays warm/dry)\n\n2. **\"The raccoon in the picture has a mask on its face. Is the mask something the raccoon learned, or was it born with it? How do you know?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria*: Answers \"born with it\" or \"inherited,\" and explains that all raccoons have this feature because their parents do\n\n3. **\"If we moved this raccoon to a hot, dry desert with no water, would it be able to survive? Why or why not?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria*: Answers \"no\" or \"not well,\" and explains that raccoons need water, and their adaptations (dark fur, need for water habitat) are made for wet places, not deserts\n\n**Exit Ticket Template (for recording):**\n```\nNAME: _________________     DATE: _________\n\n1. One special feature: ____________________\n   Why it helps: __________________________\n\n2. Is the mask inherited?     YES / NO / NOT SURE\n   Explain: _________________________________\n\n3. Can a raccoon live in a desert?  YES / NO / NOT SURE\n   Why: ___________________________________\n```\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- Correctly identify 2+ raccoon adaptations and link them to survival needs\n- Understand that inherited traits (like the mask) come from parents and are shared by all raccoons\n- Reason that raccoons are adapted to wet habitats, not dry ones, and explain evidence for this claim\n- Use vocabulary (adaptation, habitat, inherited, survival) with increasing accuracy\n\n**How to Determine Success:**\n- **Proficient**: Answers all three exit questions with specific evidence and reasoning\n- **Developing**: Answers 2 of 3 questions correctly; reasoning may be emerging\n- **Beginning**: Identifies some traits but struggles to link them to survival or habitat needs\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Provide a visual word bank** with pictures of adaptation, habitat, inherited, and other key terms. Allow students to point to or copy the word rather than write independently.\n\n2. **Pair with a strong communicator** during Explore and Elaborate phases. The pair can share one observation sheet together, with the stronger student helping scribe or organize thinking.\n\n3. **Simplify exit ticket questions** to yes/no or multiple choice format:\n   - *\"Does the raccoon's mask help it? YES / NO\"*\n   - *\"Is the mask something raccoons are born with?  YES / NO\"*\n   - Allow verbal responses recorded by teacher or aid.\n\n4. **Use tactile and kinesthetic elements**: Encourage students to act out raccoon movements (climbing, reaching with paws, looking around) to embody understanding of how physical traits enable behavior.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research and present**: Assign a brief research task (with picture support) on a second animal that shares a habitat with raccoons (beaver, muskrat, or heron). Have students identify that animal's adaptations and compare to the raccoon's. They can present findings to the class.\n\n2. **Design an adaptation**: Give students this scenario: *\"If a raccoon had to move to a snowy mountain with no water, what new adaptations would it need? Draw or describe a new raccoon with different features.\"* This requires students to think critically about how adaptations must match habitats.\n\n3. **Debate habitat suitability**: Present a scenario (e.g., *\"A zoo wants to move a raccoon to an indoor air-conditioned room with no water. Is this a good habitat?\"*) and have advanced students construct a supported argument using evidence from what they've learned.\n\n4. **Extended vocabulary**: Introduce the term **\"camouflage\"** (a trait or coloring that helps an animal hide) and discuss whether the raccoon's dark coloring provides camouflage. Can they identify other animals' camouflage?\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Raccoon Lifecycle Poster**: Create a visual showing the raccoon's life cycle—birth, growth, reproduction, and death. Include images or drawings showing a baby raccoon (kit), juvenile, adult, and how traits are passed to offspring. This connects to **3-LS1-1** and reinforces inherited traits. Students can illustrate and label each stage.\n\n2. **Wetland Habitat Diorama**: In pairs or small groups, students create a shoebox or paper diorama of a raccoon's wetland home. They include the raccoon, water, logs, plants, and food sources (fish, insects, berries). As they build, they label and explain why each element is part of a raccoon's habitat. This deepens understanding of **3-LS4-3** (habitat suitability).\n\n3. **\"Animal Trait Detective\" Field Guide**: Students select 3-4 animals from the classroom or school environment (real observations or pictures) and create a simple field guide where they:\n   - Draw or paste a picture of each animal\n   - Label 2-3 adaptations\n   - Describe the habitat where it lives\n   - Explain one way an adaptation helps that animal survive\n   \n   This metacognitive activity extends learning to multiple species and builds generalized understanding of adaptations.\n\n4. **Interactive Read-Aloud**: Read a short, picture-rich book about raccoons (e.g., *\"Rascal\" by Sterling North* [adapted], or *\"The Raccoon\"* by Bert Kitchen). As you read, students call out adaptations or habitat features they notice, connecting text to the photograph from this lesson.\n\n5. **Raccoon Role-Play / \"A Day in the Life\"**: Students write or dictate 3-4 sentences describing a day in a raccoon's life, incorporating what they learned about habitats, adaptations, and survival. Example: *\"I wake up at night because my eyes are adapted to see in the dark. I use my smart paws to catch fish in the water. I climb up a log to rest during the day.\"* This synthesizes learning in a narrative format.\n\n---\n\n## Materials Checklist\n\n**Lesson-Wide:**\n- ☐ Large printed or projected photograph of raccoon\n- ☐ Hand lenses (class set)\n- ☐ Chart paper and markers\n- ☐ Optional: Tactile items (bark, stone, damp sponge)\n\n**Explore Phase:**\n- ☐ Printed copies of photograph (1 per group)\n- ☐ Observation sheets (printed or on whiteboard for copying)\n- ☐ Colored pencils\n\n**Explain Phase:**\n- ☐ Class comparison chart (large format)\n- ☐ Vocabulary word cards with pictures\n\n**Elaborate Phase:**\n- ☐ Animal picture cards\n- ☐ Habitat picture cards\n- ☐ Chart paper\n\n**Evaluate Phase:**\n- ☐ Exit ticket template (printed or digital)\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Pacing**: This lesson can be taught in one 90-minute block or split across two 45-minute sessions (Session 1: Engage → Explore → Explain; Session 2: Elaborate → Evaluate).\n- **Prior Knowledge**: Students should have basic familiarity with the concept of animals having body parts with functions. A brief pre-lesson review of \"What animals need to survive\" (food, water, shelter, safety) strengthens scaffolding.\n- **Real-World Connection**: If possible, share that raccoons are found across North America in wetlands, forests, and even cities. This reinforces that raccoons thrive in the right habitat but struggle in unsuitable ones.\n- **Cross-Curricular Link**: This lesson pairs well with a reading or language arts unit on animal habitats or folktales (raccoons appear in many Native American stories). Art: students can draw or paint raccoons in their habitat.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson positions students as active investigators who discover how raccoon adaptations match their habitat, internalize the vocabulary of inheritance and survival, and reason about how organisms fit into specific environments—core Third Grade life science thinking.",
