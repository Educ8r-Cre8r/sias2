Observe and describe the external body parts of an earthworm (segments, shape, skin texture) and explain how these parts help the worm survive.\n2. Make observations about how an earthworm's long, flexible body helps it move through soil to find food and water.\n3. Design a simple model or solution that mimics how a worm's body helps it move through tight spaces, solving a problem.\n4. Compare their observations of earthworms to what a parent worm might look like, noting similarities and differences.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about earthworms using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the earthworm on grass\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"Wonder wall\" or bulletin board space\n\n**Activity:**\n\nDisplay the photograph of the earthworm on the grass where all students can see it clearly.\n\n**Discussion Questions:**\n1. \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about this animal.\" (Allow students to name it: earthworm.)\n2. \"Why do you think this worm's body looks so long and wiggly? What is it good for?\"\n3. \"Where do you think earthworms live, and why do they need bodies that bend and wiggle?\"\n4. \"Have you ever seen an earthworm? What was it doing?\" (Encourage students to share personal experiences.)\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n\"I wonder how an earthworm uses its long, bendy body to live in the soil and find food. Let's investigate and become earthworm scientists!\"\n\nWrite student wonderings on chart paper to revisit at lesson's end.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to look very carefully at earthworms and discover how their special bodies help them survive. Then, we'll try to design something that wiggles like a worm!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate earthworm body structures and movement through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Live earthworms (5-8 for whole class, kept in a moist container with soil; earthworms can be obtained from garden supply stores, bait shops, or online science suppliers)\n- Clear plastic containers or shallow trays (one per small group)\n- Moist soil (prepared in advance)\n- Hand magnifiers or simple magnifying glasses\n- Wet paper towels or cloths\n- Observation sheets (simple pictures of a worm outline for students to label or draw details)\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- **Important:** Keep a spray bottle with water nearby; earthworms must stay moist.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Organize into small groups (3-4 students per group).**\n\n2. **Introduce the worm safely:** \"We're going to carefully observe real earthworms. Worms are delicate, so we handle them gently. Let's watch to learn, not to hurt.\"\n\n3. **Observe the worm in its container:**\n   - \"Look at the earthworm's body. Can you see the rings or segments on its body? Count them if you can, or just notice how many you see.\"\n   - \"Feel the container—the soil is wet and dark. Why do you think worms like it wet and dark?\"\n   - \"Watch how the worm moves. Does it go straight, or does it wiggle side to side?\"\n\n4. **Close observation with magnifiers:**\n   - \"Use your magnifying glass to look at the worm's skin. Is it smooth? Is it wet or dry?\"\n   - \"Can you see the segments? They're like rings or tubes stacked together. Why might a segmented body help a worm move?\"\n\n5. **Observe movement (no handling required for first graders):**\n   - \"Watch the worm try to burrow into the soil. Does its long body help it squeeze into tight spaces?\"\n   - \"Does the worm move fast or slow?\"\n\n6. **Record observations:**\n   - Students draw the worm on observation sheets, labeling or coloring the segments.\n   - Students write or dictate one sentence: \"The worm's body helps it by ____.\"\n\n**How this connects to the photograph:** The photograph shows the worm's long, segmented body in its natural habitat (grass and soil). Students are now experiencing a similar organism, noticing the same body features in real life.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to groups and ask guiding questions: \"What do those rings remind you of? Could a worm bend with a hard, straight body?\" \n- Prevent students from drying out worms; keep them moist and return them to the container after observation.\n- Encourage observation language: \"I notice,\" \"I see,\" \"The worm's segments...\"\n- Do NOT tell students answers; let them discover through observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe and document the segments, smooth moist skin, and long flexible body shape.\n- Students notice the worm burrowing behavior and connect it to body flexibility.\n- Students produce simple drawings or verbal descriptions of the worm's external features.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration, connecting observations to survival and body function.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple illustrations\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Simple picture book about earthworms (e.g., *Earthworms* by Rebecca Olien or similar picture book; optional but helpful)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\n- Invite groups to share one observation: \"What did your worm look like?\" or \"What did you notice the worm doing?\"\n- Affirm all observations and list them on chart paper.\n\n**Teach Key Vocabulary** (with student-friendly definitions and visual references):\n\n1. **Segments:** \"The rings or circles on a worm's body. They help the worm bend and wiggle like a stretchy toy.\"\n\n2. **External Parts:** \"The parts on the outside of an animal's body that we can see and touch, like a worm's skin and segments.\"\n\n3. **Adaptation:** \"A special body part or behavior that helps an animal survive and live in its home. A worm's long, bendy body is an adaptation that helps it burrow.\"\n\n4. **Burrow:** \"To dig or tunnel into soil. Earthworms burrow to find food, water, and a safe place to live.\"\n\n5. **Habitat:** \"The home of an animal, like the soil where earthworms live.\"\n\n**Make Connections Back to the Photograph:**\n- \"Look at the photograph again. The earthworm is on the grass. Its long body helps it crawl through soil and grass to find what it needs—water, food, and a dark, safe place.\"\n- \"See the segments in the photo? Each ring helps the worm bend and move.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- \"Show me with your body: Can you make segments with your arms? Wiggle like a worm!\"\n- \"Why is a long, bendy body good for a worm?\"\n- \"Where do worms live, and why do they need their special body?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that worms have external body parts (segments, skin) designed to help them survive.\n- Students can name at least two ways the worm's body helps it (burrowing, movement, finding food).\n- Students use new vocabulary (segments, burrow, habitat) in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by designing a solution that mimics how a worm's body helps it move, connecting to real-world problem-solving.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pipe cleaners or yarn, cut into segments (8-10 pieces per student, connected loosely or segmented)\n- Empty paper towel tubes (for worm tunnels)\n- Moist soil in shallow boxes\n- Plastic straws (optional, for comparison)\n- Design sheet or chart: \"Design Your Worm Tool\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge:** \"Pretend you're an inventor. A farmer needs help moving through soil quickly to plant seeds. Can you design a tool that moves through soil the way a worm does, using a bendy, segmented design like a real worm?\"\n\n**Design Steps:**\n\n1. **Show the comparison:** Show students a straight plastic straw (rigid) and a pipe cleaner (bendy, segmented). \"Which one can bend and wiggle like a worm?\"\n\n2. **Student Design Task:** Each student or pair designs a simple \"worm tool\" using pipe cleaners, yarn, or paper towel tubes loosely connected to mimic segments.\n\n3. **Test the Design:** Students try to push their worm tool through a container of moist soil or through a paper towel tube tunnel. Does it work? Can it bend?\n\n4. **Reflect:** \"How is your tool like a real worm? What does the bendy, segmented design do?\"\n\n5. **Document:** Students draw or paste their design on a sheet and write: \"My worm tool has _____ [segments/bendy parts] so it can _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate design thinking: \"What part of the worm was the most important for moving through soil?\"\n- Encourage testing and iterating: \"Did it work? What would make it bend better?\"\n- Ask reflection questions: \"Why did you use segments in your design?\"\n- Celebrate creative problem-solving.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students create a model tool inspired by worm body structure.\n- Students explain the connection between the worm's segmented, bendy body and movement through soil.\n- Students demonstrate understanding of adaptation through design.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of earthworm body structures, survival adaptations, and ability to apply knowledge to design.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Listen to student explanations during group discussions and Elaborate phase.\n- Observe drawings and annotations on observation sheets.\n- Note ability to use vocabulary (segments, burrow, habitat, adaptation).\n- Watch student design and testing process—can they explain connections to the worm?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment** (Choose one or combine):\n\n**Option 1: Picture-Based Question**\nShow a simple drawing of an earthworm and ask: \n- \"Point to the segments. Why are they important?\"\n- \"Where does this worm live? How does its body help it live there?\"\n\n**Option 2: Verbal Explanation**\nAsk each student:\n- \"Tell me one thing about a worm's body that helps it survive.\"\n- \"If you designed a worm, what would you give it? Why?\"\n\n**Option 3: Drawing with Sentence**\n- Students draw an earthworm and write or dictate: \"A worm's _____ [body part] helps it _____.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Students can identify and name at least one external body part of an earthworm (segments, skin).\n\n✓ Students can explain how at least one body part helps the worm survive (burrowing, moving, finding food).\n\n✓ Students use or understand vocabulary: segments, burrow, habitat, external parts.\n\n✓ Students attempt to design a tool inspired by worm structure and can explain the connection.\n\n✓ Students make observations comparing a real worm to the photograph and describe similarities.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- All students will demonstrate observational skills and basic understanding of worm adaptations.\n- Most students will explain one way the worm's body helps it survive.\n- Some students will make sophisticated connections between body structure and survival, and will explain their design choices.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only \"segments,\" \"wiggly,\" and \"soil\" initially. Introduce other terms after initial understanding is secure.\n\n2. **Guided Observation:** Pair struggling students with a partner or provide a teacher-led small group observation of the worm. Ask very specific, yes-no questions: \"Do you see rings? Is it wet? Does it wiggle?\"\n\n3. **Pre-Drawn Diagrams:** Provide partially completed worm drawings with blanks (e.g., a worm outline with dotted segment lines). Students only need to color or label, not create from scratch.\n\n4. **Shortened Design Task:** Instead of creating a new tool, have students choose between a straight stick and a bendy pipe cleaner to burrow through soil, then explain which works better and why.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Comparative Biology:** Have students compare earthworms to other soil creatures (if available: millipedes, centipedes) or to pictures. How are their bodies similar? Different? Why?\n\n2. **Depth of Explanation:** Ask: \"Why do you think worms have moist skin? Where do they get water?\" Encourage research or predictions about the worm's life cycle.\n\n3. **Complex Design:** Challenge students to design a two-part system: a tool that moves like a worm AND a habitat structure that keeps it safe and moist.\n\n4. **Writing Extension:** Have students write a short \"Worm Survival Guide\" in picture form: \"If I were a worm, I would need _____ to survive because _____.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Worm Composting Observation (Home/School Project):**\n   Set up a simple worm composting bin in the classroom or send instructions home for families to observe worms breaking down food scraps. Students observe and document worm behavior over 2-3 weeks, noting how the worms interact with their environment and food sources. Connects to understanding worm roles in nature and their needs.\n\n2. **Earthworm Life Cycle Illustration:**\n   Provide a simple picture book about earthworm reproduction (e.g., worm eggs in soil, young worms, adult worms). Students compare a young worm to an adult worm using the photograph. They draw or cut-and-paste to show: \"A baby worm looks like an adult worm because _____, but it is different because _____.\" (Addresses 1-LS3-1.)\n\n3. **Soil Investigation and Worm Hunt:**\n   Take students outside to a garden or grass area. Hunt for earthworms in the soil after rain (when worms surface). Students count and observe worms in their natural habitat. Discuss: Why do worms come out after rain? What does this tell us about what worms need? (Extends understanding of habitat and adaptation.)\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
