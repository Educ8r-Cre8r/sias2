ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, printed color copy of the photograph (or display on interactive board)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Butterfly puppet or stuffed animal (optional, but helpful for engagement)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see?\"\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause for responses after each):\n   - \"What is the big colorful insect doing? Have you seen one of these before?\" *(Observe the butterfly's behavior)*\n   - \"What is the butterfly touching with its long, thin mouth? What do you think it's doing?\" *(Infer feeding behavior)*\n   - \"Why do you think the butterfly is visiting the flower? What might it want?\" *(Activate curiosity about food/survival)*\n   - \"Does the flower look happy to have a visitor? Why do you think the flower is pink and pretty?\" *(Begin thinking about how they attract each other)*\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what butterflies eat for breakfast... let's find out if this flower is like their kitchen!\"\n\n4. **Record student observations** on chart paper under two columns: \"What the Butterfly Has\" and \"What the Flower Has.\" Don't correct; just record.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become scientists and explore how butterflies and flowers need each other to stay healthy and alive!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Butterfly wing pattern template (pre-cut or drawn on colorful paper)\n- Flower cutouts (pre-made from colored paper or card stock)\n- Crayons, markers, or colored pencils\n- Small cups or containers filled with water (to represent nectar)\n- Plastic straws or coffee stirrers (to represent the butterfly's proboscis)\n- Tape and glue sticks\n- Observation record sheets (simple picture sheets with spaces to draw or paste)\n- Real flowers (if available) in a vase for sensory exploration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Station Setup (5 minutes):** Divide students into 2-3 small groups. Set up stations:\n   - **Station A (Butterfly Decorating):** Students color and decorate a pre-cut butterfly, adding patterns to the wings. Encourage them to make it colorful \"so it's pretty like the one in the picture.\"\n   - **Station B (Flower Exploration):** Students observe real flowers (or high-quality pictures) using magnifying glasses. They feel the petals, look at the center, and smell if safe. Record observations by drawing or pointing to pictures.\n   - **Station C (Feeding Simulation):** Students use a straw (proboscis) to \"drink\" water from a cup (representing nectar), discovering how the butterfly's tube-shaped mouth works.\n\n2. **Hands-on exploration:**\n   - At **Station A:** As students decorate, ask: \"What colors and patterns did you see on the butterfly in the picture? Can you make yours look similar?\"\n   - At **Station B:** Provide these guiding questions: \"What do the petals feel like? Do they have a smell? What colors do you see?\" Provide a picture chart showing flower parts (petals, center) so students can point and identify.\n   - At **Station C:** After students use the straw, ask: \"How did you drink the water like the butterfly? Did your mouth make a tube shape like the butterfly's? The butterfly's mouth is like a straw!\"\n\n3. **Recording/Documentation:**\n   - Station A: Students paste/tape their decorated butterfly onto their observation sheet.\n   - Station B: Students draw what they observed about the flower (petals, colors, smell) or use stickers/pictures to show parts.\n   - Station C: Students draw themselves drinking through a straw and label it \"like a butterfly.\"\n\n4. **Transition between stations:** Rotate groups every 6-8 minutes with a gentle signal (bell, song, or hand clap).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between stations, asking open-ended questions (\"What did you notice about...?\" \"How is that like the butterfly in our picture?\")\n- Facilitate without providing direct answers—let students discover.\n- Help students articulate observations verbally if they struggle to record them.\n- Model the straw technique at Station C to show how butterflies \"drink.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create a decorated butterfly showing understanding that butterflies are colorful.\n- Students will observe and describe flower characteristics (color, texture, smell, petals).\n- Students will physically experience how a butterfly feeds using the straw tool, building concrete understanding.\n- Students will record at least one observation per station (drawing, label, or verbal).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with the original photograph\n- Pre-made vocabulary cards with pictures (illustrated with simple drawings or photos)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- The original photograph (large display)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a circle** on the carpet, where all can see the photograph and your chart paper.\n\n2. **Group share-out (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover about the butterfly at your station?\" *Listen to 3-4 students from each station.*\n   - As students share, add their observations to the chart under \"What We Learned.\"\n   - Say: \"You're noticing that butterflies have colorful wings, a long mouth like a straw, and they drink from flowers. Flowers are pretty and have special juice inside called nectar. Great scientists!\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary (5-8 minutes):** Use picture cards for each term. Point to the photograph as you explain:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Butterfly** | A pretty insect with four colorful wings that fly from flower to flower. |\n| **Nectar** | Sweet juice inside flowers that butterflies drink to get energy and stay healthy. |\n| **Flower** | The colorful part of a plant that makes food (nectar) to feed butterflies and other insects. |\n| **Proboscis** | The long, thin tube-shaped mouth of a butterfly that works like a straw to drink nectar. |\n| **Food** | Something living things eat to grow and have energy to play and move. |\n\n   **Teacher script:** \"The butterfly has a special mouth called a *proboscis*. It looks like a straw! It uses this to drink *nectar*, which is sweet juice inside the *flower*. The *nectar* is the butterfly's *food*. Just like you need breakfast to have energy, butterflies need nectar!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Show the photograph again. Point to the butterfly's proboscis and ask: \"What is the butterfly using to drink?\"\n   - Point to the flower and ask: \"What is inside here that the butterfly wants to eat?\"\n   - Ask one or two students to repeat the connection: \"Why do butterflies visit flowers?\"\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create and display a chart with pictures and the terms. Leave it posted throughout the unit.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will recognize and use 3-5 vocabulary terms (with teacher modeling and repetition).\n- Students will understand that butterflies eat nectar from flowers.\n- Students will begin to see that butterflies and flowers help each other (plants give food, butterflies help spread pollen—simplified for Kindergarten as \"they need each other\").\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-cut butterfly and flower shapes (cardstock or construction paper)\n- Brads or paper fasteners\n- Markers and crayons\n- Sentence frame poster: \"A butterfly needs a flower because ___.\"\n- Optional: Simple butterfly life cycle cards (egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, butterfly)\n- Picture sort activity: Cards with butterflies, flowers, other insects, food items\n\n**Activity:** *Choose one or both options based on time and student readiness.*\n\n**Option A: Butterfly-Flower Matching Game (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the activity:** \"We learned that butterflies and flowers are special friends. Let's play a game to show we understand why!\"\n\n2. **Create a matching board** on the floor or table:\n   - On one side, place 3-4 butterfly picture cards.\n   - On the other side, place 3-4 flower picture cards.\n   - Students draw a line or place a string between each butterfly and flower that \"belongs together.\"\n\n3. **Prompt for thinking:** \"Why do you think this butterfly and this flower are friends? What does the butterfly want from the flower?\"\n\n4. **Document learning:** Have students tell you their answer to: \"A butterfly needs a flower because ___.\" Record their responses on the sentence frame poster.\n\n**Option B: Life Cycle Introduction (15 minutes)** *(If students show strong understanding and interest)*\n\n1. **Show simple life cycle cards** (egg → caterpillar → chrysalis → butterfly) in order.\n\n2. **Narrate a simple story:** \"Did you know? Butterflies start as tiny eggs on leaves. The egg hatches into a caterpillar. The caterpillar eats lots and lots of leaves to grow big and strong. Then it makes a chrysalis—like a sleeping bag. Inside the chrysalis, it changes into a butterfly! Now it's ready to drink nectar from flowers.\"\n\n3. **Activity:** Provide each student with the four life cycle pictures (pre-cut or drawn). Students arrange them in order on their paper and draw or paste them to show the butterfly's life story.\n\n4. **Deepen thinking:** \"Why do you think the caterpillar needs to eat leaves? The butterfly needs nectar. What else in nature needs food to grow?\" *(Accept all answers.)*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the matching activity by asking guiding questions rather than giving answers.\n- For the life cycle activity, model placing the pictures in order first.\n- Ask students to explain their thinking: \"Why did you put the egg first?\"\n- Affirm connections students make between butterflies needing food to grow and survive.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will correctly match butterflies to flowers and explain a simple reason (e.g., \"The butterfly drinks the flower's juice\").\n- Students will complete the sentence frame with a reason showing understanding (e.g., \"because the butterfly is hungry\" or \"to drink nectar\").\n- (If doing life cycle) Students will sequence the four stages and verbally explain that the caterpillar eats to grow, and the butterfly drinks nectar to live.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of what plants and animals need to survive and their relationship.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist:** As students work, note:\n  - ✓ Can students describe what they observed about the butterfly? (wing colors, proboscis, feeding)\n  - ✓ Can students describe what they observed about the flower? (petals, colors, center, nectar)\n  - ✓ Can students use the vocabulary terms (butterfly, flower, nectar, food)?\n  - ✓ Do students show understanding that butterflies eat nectar to survive?\n\n- **Listen-in prompts** during Explore and Elaborate:\n  - \"Tell me why the butterfly is visiting the flower.\"\n  - \"What does the butterfly need from the flower?\"\n  - \"How is the straw like a butterfly's mouth?\"\n\n**Summative Exit Assessment (5-7 minutes at end of Lesson 2):**\n\n**Option A: Picture-Based Response**\nDisplay the original photograph. Ask these questions one at a time, and record student responses (verbal or drawn):\n1. \"Point to the butterfly. What is it doing?\" *(Student should indicate it's drinking/eating)*\n2. \"What does the butterfly need from the flower to stay healthy?\" *(Accept: food, nectar, juice, energy)*\n3. \"Why do butterflies visit flowers?\" *(Accept: to eat, to get food, because they're hungry, to drink nectar)*\n\n**Option B: Cut-and-Paste Exit Ticket**\nProvide a simple worksheet with three boxes:\n- Box 1: Picture of a butterfly\n- Box 2: Picture of a flower\n- Box 3: Picture of nectar/food\n\n**Directions:** \"Draw a line to show what the butterfly needs. Butterflies need ___.\"\n\nStudents draw or place a line from the butterfly to the flower, and you record their verbal explanation.\n\n**Option C: Thumbs Check**\nAsk students to show their understanding with hand signals:\n- \"Thumbs up if you know: What does a butterfly eat?\" \n- \"Thumbs up if you know: Why butterflies visit flowers?\"\n- Students who give thumbs up should be able to explain.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify that butterflies eat nectar from flowers.\n- ✓ Student can name at least one thing butterflies need to survive (food/nectar).\n- ✓ Student can make a simple connection: Butterflies need flowers; butterflies and flowers help each other.\n- ✓ Student uses at least 2-3 vocabulary terms correctly (butterfly, flower, nectar, food, proboscis).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will demonstrate understanding that butterflies eat from flowers and that flowers provide food for butterflies.\n- Students will show emerging understanding that living things depend on other living things (plants and animals help each other).\n- Students will use Kindergarten-appropriate language and may not use all formal vocabulary, but should show conceptual understanding through drawings, gestures, and simple explanations.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only 2-3 key terms (butterfly, flower, food) instead of all five. Use these consistently throughout.\n\n2. **Concrete, multi-sensory exploration:** Provide real flowers (or high-quality, touchable models) in the Explore phase so students can interact directly. Use the straw activity as a repeated, tactile anchor for understanding how butterflies drink.\n\n3. **Visual supports and picture cards:** Use picture-based communication during discussions. Point to the photograph and gesture as you speak. Provide picture cards showing \"butterfly,\" \"flower,\" \"eating,\" \"drinking,\" and \"food\" that students can touch and manipulate during Explain.\n\n4. **Reduced expectations for recording:** Accept drawings only (no need for labels). Allow verbal explanations instead of written responses. Pair students with a peer or adult scribe to document observations.\n\n5. **Pre-teach vocabulary:** Before the Engage phase, show students 2-3 key pictures (butterfly, flower, nectar) and use the words repeatedly in context during a quick picture walk.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Expanded vocabulary and concepts:** Introduce the term \"pollination\" in simple terms: \"When the butterfly drinks nectar, yellow powder (pollen) sticks to its body. When it visits another flower, the pollen helps make new flowers. The butterfly helps the flower make babies!\" Provide pollination picture cards or simple diagrams.\n\n2. **Extended life cycle exploration:** Have students complete the full butterfly life cycle, then ask: \"What does a caterpillar eat? Why does it need to eat so much? How is what a caterpillar eats different from what a butterfly eats?\" Have them sort cards showing caterpillar foods (leaves) vs. butterfly foods (nectar).\n\n3. **Habitat and ecosystem thinking:** Ask: \"Where do butterflies and flowers live together? What else lives there? Do other insects visit flowers? Draw a picture of a garden where butterflies, flowers, and bees all live together.\"\n\n4. **Comparative observation:** Provide pictures of different butterflies and flowers. Ask: \"Do all butterflies look the same? Do all flowers look the same? What's different? What's the same?\" Have students sort and classify by color, size, or pattern.\n\n5. **Why-question investigation:** Provide a chart with \"Why?\" questions:\n   - Why are butterflies colorful?\n   - Why do flowers have bright colors and sweet nectar?\n   - Why does the butterfly have a long proboscis?\n\n   Students draw or write/dictate answers, exploring adaptation and survival.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Butterfly Garden Planning Project (30-45 minutes)**\n   - Show students pictures of a butterfly garden.\n   - Ask: \"What flowers would we plant to bring butterflies to our classroom garden or school garden?\"\n   - Have students choose a flower they learned about (or from pictures provided) and draw it on a paper garden template.\n   - Create a class garden map and display it. If possible, work with a teacher or volunteer to plant one or two butterfly-friendly flowers near the classroom (zinnias, marigolds, coneflowers are Kindergarten-friendly and attract butterflies).\n   - **Connection:** Students apply their understanding that butterflies need flowers for food in a real-world context.\n\n2. **Butterfly Life Cycle Movement Game (20-30 minutes)**\n   - Teach students four movements to represent life cycle stages:\n     - **Egg:** Curl up tiny on the ground\n     - **Caterpillar:** Crawl on hands and knees, \"eating leaves\" (touch the ground)\n     - **Chrysalis:** Stand still in a frozen pose\n     - **Butterfly:** Spread arms and \"fly\" around the room\n   - Call out each stage, and students move to show it. Repeat the cycle several times.\n   - Ask: \"What does each stage need to survive? (Eggs need leaves, caterpillars need lots of leaves, chrysalises need rest, butterflies need nectar.)\"\n   - **Connection:** Kinesthetic learning reinforces the life cycle and the idea that living things need different things at different times.\n\n3. **Butterfly and Flower Art Integration (30-40 minutes)**\n   - Students create a large collaborative mural titled \"Butterflies and Flowers—Friends Forever.\"\n   - Provide pre-cut or hand-drawn butterfly and flower shapes.\n   - Students decorate with watercolors, markers, collage materials (tissue paper, sequins, glitter).\n   - Create a visual that shows butterflies visiting flowers.\n   - Display in the hallway with a label explaining: \"Butterflies need flowers for food. Flowers need butterflies to help make new flowers. They are nature's friends!\"\n   - **Connection:** Art allows creative expression of learning and makes the concept memorable and visible.\n\n4. **Take-Home Family Observation Task (Ongoing)**\n   - Provide families with a simple worksheet showing a butterfly and a flower.\n   - Instructions: \"This week, look for butterflies and flowers outside your home. Draw or write what you see. What colors are the butterflies and flowers? Are they together? Tell your child what you learn.\"\n   - Have students share their family observations the following week.\n   - **Connection:** Extends learning beyond the classroom and involves families in observation-based science.\n\n5. **Sensory Butterfly and Flower Exploration Station (20-30 minutes)**\n   - Set up a permanent classroom station with:\n     - Real flowers (changed weekly, if possible)\n     - Butterfly pictures and models (toy butterflies, crafts)\n     - Scent cards (lavender, rose, other flower scents in small jars)\n     - Magnifying glasses\n     - Texture cards (smooth petals, rough stems)\n   - Students visit during choice time to explore and discuss what butterflies and flowers need.\n   - **Connection:** Provides ongoing, sensory-rich reinforcement of concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Tips & Notes\n\n- **Pacing:** You may split this lesson across **two 30-minute sessions** (one for Engage/Explore, one for Explain/Elaborate/Evaluate) or combine into **one 90-minute block** with a snack or movement break in the middle.\n\n- **Real vs. Artificial Flowers:** Real flowers are ideal for the Explore phase, but if unavailable, high-quality photographs or artificial flowers with realistic details work well.\n\n- **Safety Consideration:** If using real flowers, check for thorns. Trim or cover any sharp edges. Ensure no student has a flower allergy before the sensory exploration.\n\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Kindergarteners learn through repetition. Use the key vocabulary (butterfly, flower, nectar, food, proboscis) consistently in everyday language throughout the week and beyond.\n\n- **Connection to Daily Life:** Point out butterflies or flowers in the classroom, playground, or on a nature walk. Ask: \"What do you think it's doing? What does it need?\"\n\n- **Photo Reference:** Return to the original photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. It serves as your concrete anchor for abstract concepts.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly addresses K-LS1-1** by having students observe and describe patterns in what butterflies and flowers need to survive (food, nectar, and their interdependence). The lesson is fully developmentally appropriate for Kindergarten, hands-on, and grounded in the photograph provided.",
