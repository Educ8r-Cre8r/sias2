ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of the crab (color, at least 8.5\" × 11\")\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and hook:** Show the photograph on the board or as a large print. Allow students 30 seconds of silent looking before speaking.\n\n2. **Discussion questions (calibrated for first grade):**\n   - \"What animal do you see in this picture? Have you ever seen a crab?\"\n   - \"Look at the crab's claws. What do you think the crab uses those claws for? Why would a crab need claws?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this crab lives? What do you notice about what's around it?\" (Students should observe the sand.)\n   - \"If you were a crab, how would you use your body to stay safe or find food on a sandy beach?\"\n\n3. **Wonder and prediction prompt:** \"I wonder... what special parts does a crab have that help it live on the beach? Let's find out what makes a crab's body so special!\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas:** Write 2-3 student predictions on chart paper with simple drawings. Celebrate curiosity: \"Great thinking! We're going to explore this today.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to become crab scientists and use our own bodies to act out what a real crab does!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover crab body structures and functions through hands-on, kinesthetic exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of crab (visible throughout activity)\n- Open classroom floor space or outdoor area\n- Small classroom objects (blocks, small balls, bean bags, plastic cups) — enough for pairs to practice grabbing\n- Optional: construction paper, tape, or pipe cleaners for making crab claws\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Crab Charades (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show and identify:** Display the photograph. Point to and name each body part clearly: \"See the eyestalks? See the claws? See the ten legs?\"\n\n2. **Model the movements:** Demonstrate slowly how a crab moves:\n   - \"Watch my hands—crabs walk sideways like this.\" (Demonstrate.)\n   - \"Crabs use their claws like this to grab things.\" (Slowly demonstrate a clamping motion.)\n   - \"Crabs can hide by moving into the sand like this.\" (Demonstrate a lowering/burrowing motion.)\n\n3. **Student practice:** Have students stand and copy your movements in slow motion:\n   - \"Now YOU be a crab. Walk sideways around the room!\"\n   - \"Now pretend your hands are crab claws. Open and close them slowly.\"\n   - \"Can you move down low like you're burrowing into sand?\"\n\n4. **Observation recording:** Ask students to think-pair-share: \"What did your crab body need to do? Which parts did you use?\"\n\n**Part B: Crab Claw Challenge (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up:** Place small objects (blocks, bean bags, soft balls) on a table or floor in a circle.\n\n2. **Directions:** \"Now we're going to test crab claws! Make your hands into crab claws by pinching your fingers together. Can you pick up objects like a crab would?\"\n\n3. **Trial 1 - Using crab claws:** Students try to grab small objects using only a pinching motion with thumb and fingers (mimicking crab claws).\n\n4. **Trial 2 - Using all fingers:** Students try to grab the same objects using their whole open hand (not like a crab).\n\n5. **Observation question:** \"Which way worked better? When would a real crab use its claws?\" Allow students to handle and feel the photo crab's environment (sand in a container, if available) to understand the habitat.\n\n6. **Record:** Students draw or dictate observations: \"Crab claws are good for...\" or \"I noticed...\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"Why do you think that worked?\" \"What would happen if a crab didn't have claws?\"\n- Help students connect actions to survival: \"How does this help the crab get food?\" \"How could claws protect a crab?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answers; guide discovery through questioning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will discover that crab claws are specialized for gripping and holding.\n- Students will observe that certain body parts work better for specific tasks.\n- Students will recognize that the crab's body is suited to its sandy beach environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with body parts labeled (prepared beforehand)\n- Photograph of crab (large, visible)\n- Simple diagram showing crab body parts (you can draw this or use a pre-made image)\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore phase (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 students to share one thing they discovered about crab claws or crab movement.\n   - Write or draw their observations on a \"What We Learned\" chart.\n   - Validate all contributions: \"That's an important observation!\"\n\n2. **Teach vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Display the photograph and point to each part as you define it. Use simple, visual language:\n\n   - **Claws (or pincers):** Special grabbers at the front of the crab's body. Crabs use claws to hold food, protect themselves, and dig in the sand.\n   - **Eyestalks:** Two stalks on top of the crab's head with eyes at the tips. They help the crab see above the sand and spot danger or food.\n   - **Legs:** Ten legs total! Eight walking legs help the crab move sideways. The two front legs have the claws. Legs help crabs walk on sand and climb.\n   - **Shell (exoskeleton):** The hard outside covering that protects the crab's soft body inside. The shell is brownish and tan to blend in with sand.\n   - **Habitat:** The place where an animal lives. Crabs live on sandy beaches where they can hide and find food.\n\n3. **Connections back to observations (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember when we tried to pick up objects with crab claws? That's EXACTLY what real crabs do to get food!\"\n   - \"Remember when we walked sideways? That's how crabs move across the sand!\"\n   - \"See how the crab's color looks like sand? That helps it hide. We call that camouflage.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Point to the crab's claws in the photo: \"What do crabs use these for?\"\n   - \"Why do you think a crab needs to hide in the sand?\"\n   - \"Show me with your hands how a crab walks.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Claw:** A hard, pinching body part that crabs use to grab food and protect themselves.\n- **Eyestalk:** A stalk on a crab's head with an eye at the end that helps the crab see.\n- **Leg:** A body part that helps animals move; crabs have ten legs.\n- **Shell:** The hard outside covering of a crab that protects it.\n- **Habitat:** The home or place where an animal lives.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use new vocabulary with prompting (claws, legs, eyestalks, shell, habitat).\n- Students will explain that crabs' body parts help them survive on the beach.\n- Students will connect their hands-on experiences to real crab biology.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by designing a tool that mimics how crabs use their claws to solve a real problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Craft materials: popsicle sticks, pipe cleaners, clothespins, rubber bands, tape, construction paper\n- Small objects to \"pick up\" (cotton balls, pom-poms, small blocks, dried beans)\n- Safety scissors (adult-supervised if needed)\n- Paper bags or cups to hold \"collected\" items\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the design challenge (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Crabs use their claws to pick up food and dig in the sand. Can YOU design a tool that works like crab claws?\"\n   - \"Your tool needs to pick up these small objects and put them in a bag—just like a crab collects food!\"\n\n2. **Student design and building (10-12 minutes):**\n   - Students work individually or in pairs to create a \"crab claw tool\" using craft materials.\n   - Simple examples:\n     - Two popsicle sticks taped together at one end (like a pincher)\n     - A clothespin with decorations\n     - Pipe cleaners bent into claw shapes\n   - Students test their tools by trying to pick up small objects.\n\n3. **Testing and refinement (3-5 minutes):**\n   - \"Does your crab claw pick up the object? If not, what could you change?\"\n   - \"Can your claw pick up more than one thing at a time?\"\n   - Allow time for quick adjustments.\n\n4. **Share and celebrate (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 students to show their crab claw tool and explain what it does.\n   - \"How is your tool like a real crab's claws?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What part of the crab claw do you need to copy?\" \"What materials might work best for pinching?\"\n- Avoid building the tool for students; let them problem-solve.\n- Celebrate creative solutions and persistence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create a functional tool inspired by crab anatomy.\n- Students will verbalize the connection between crab body parts and their tool's function.\n- Students will recognize that understanding animal structures helps humans design solutions.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of crab body parts, functions, and how animals' external structures help them survive.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Listen to student responses during discussion questions (Engage phase).\n- Observe student movements and explanations during the Crab Claw Challenge (Explore phase).\n- Check student vocabulary use during verbal sharing (Explain phase).\n- Review student drawings or dictations from exploration.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes):**\n\nAdminister one of the following (choose based on your students' writing/drawing ability):\n\n**Option A (Drawing + Dictation):**\n- Students draw a crab and label (or you label) at least two body parts.\n- Ask and record: \"What does this body part do? How does it help the crab survive?\"\n\n**Option B (3-Question Verbal Check):**\nAsk each student individually or in small groups:\n1. \"Show me where a crab's claws are. What does a crab use its claws for?\"\n2. \"Why do you think crabs need to hide in the sand?\"\n3. \"If you were a crab, what would you use your legs for?\"\n\n**Option C (Show-and-Tell):**\n- Students show their crab claw tool and answer: \"How does your tool work like a real crab's claws?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Identify at least 2 crab body parts (claws, legs, eyestalks, shell) when prompted.\n- ✓ Explain that at least one body part helps the crab survive (grab food, move, hide, see).\n- ✓ Use vocabulary (claw, leg, eyestalk, shell, or habitat) at least once.\n- ✓ Create a simple tool inspired by crab claws or accurately mimic crab movement.\n- ✓ Make a connection between crab body parts and survival in the beach habitat (e.g., \"Crabs use claws to get food\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most first graders will successfully identify 2-3 crab body parts and explain at least one function.\n- Students will show understanding that animals' external parts help them survive.\n- Students will engage with the concept that different animals have different body parts for different purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on only 2-3 key terms (claws, legs, shell) instead of all five. Repeat these terms frequently and pair with visuals (photo, real object if available, labeled diagram).\n\n2. **Provide a body-parts checklist:** Give students a simple picture card showing crab body parts labeled. During activities, have them point to each part on the card and the photograph, reducing memory demands.\n\n3. **Partner with a stronger peer:** During exploration, pair struggling students with classmates who can model movements and language. They can copy and participate with scaffolding.\n\n4. **Simplify the design challenge:** Provide a pre-made \"crab claw\" (e.g., a clothespin decorated as a crab) and let the student practice using it rather than building from scratch. Focus on functional understanding rather than design.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research extension:** Provide picture books or short videos about other beach animals (starfish, hermit crabs, sea urchins). Ask: \"How are their body parts different from a crab's? What do those parts help them do?\" Students compare and contrast external structures across species.\n\n2. **Complex design challenge:** Ask advanced students to design a multi-part tool that mimics TWO crab functions (e.g., claws for grabbing AND legs for digging/moving). Require them to test both functions and explain how each part works.\n\n3. **Habitat exploration:** Provide sand, shells, and small rocks in a sensory bin. Ask: \"How do you think a crab's body helps it live in this sandy habitat? Where would a crab hide? What would it eat?\" Encourage detailed observation and written/drawn responses.\n\n4. **Comparison activity:** Show pictures of a crab, a bird, and a fish. Ask: \"Why does each animal have different body parts? How does each animal's body help it live in its home?\" Advanced students explain how body structure matches habitat and lifestyle.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Crab Life Cycle and Family Comparison:**\n   Use 1-LS1-2 to explore: Read a simple picture book about how baby crabs grow into adult crabs (e.g., *Hermit Crab's Home* or similar). Ask: \"How is a baby crab like its parents? How is it different?\" Students observe that young crabs look similar to adults but are smaller. Create a chart: \"How Baby Crabs and Adult Crabs Are the Same and Different\" to support 1-LS3-1.\n\n2. **Beach Habitat Diorama:**\n   Students create a small shoebox diorama of a crab's beach habitat. Include sand, shells, rocks, and a clay or paper crab positioned as it would be in real life. As students build, ask: \"Where is the crab? Why would it be here? What can it find to eat? How does it hide?\" This deepens understanding of adaptation and habitat (connections to K-ESS3-1 concepts and 1-LS1-1 survival needs).\n\n3. **\"Other Animals' Special Parts\" Matching Game:**\n   Create or display picture cards of other animals and their specialized body parts (bird wings, fish fins, rabbit ears, dog claws). Students match animals to parts and explain: \"Why does this animal need this body part?\" This extends learning to recognize that all animals have external parts suited to their survival—a foundational concept for future grades.\n\n---",
