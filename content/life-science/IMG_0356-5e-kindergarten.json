ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the seedling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the photograph (8.5\" × 11\" or larger) OR digital display on smartboard/projector\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Observe:** Show the photograph on a large screen or printed poster. Do not explain it yet. Simply say: *\"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see?\"* Let students observe silently for 10-15 seconds.\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Discussion Questions:**\n   - *\"What is this thing? Is it alive? How do you know?\"*\n   - *\"Can you find the green parts? What do you think they are called?\"*\n   - *\"Do you see the brown, stringy parts at the bottom? What might those be? What could they do?\"*\n   - *\"If you were this plant, what would you need to stay alive and healthy?\"*\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Say: *\"This is a baby plant. It started as a tiny seed. I wonder... what does this plant need to grow big and strong? Turn and talk to your neighbor about what you think.\"* (Allow 2-3 minutes of peer discussion.)\n\n4. **Record Predictions:** On chart paper, write down 2-3 student predictions. Do not confirm or correct them yet. Say: *\"Great thinking! Let's find out if your ideas are right.\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to be plant scientists and explore what plants really need to live and grow!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover what plants need through hands-on exploration with real seeds and seedlings.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 bean seed per student (dried beans from the grocery store work well)\n- Small clear cups or clear plastic containers (one per student)\n- Potting soil or garden soil\n- Water in a spray bottle or small watering can\n- Paper towels\n- Hand lenses (magnifying glasses) — 1 per pair of students\n- Clipboards and paper (for recording observations)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Examine a Real Seedling (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Prepare in advance:** Have 2-3 live seedlings (similar to the photograph) at different stations around the room. You can grow these a week ahead of time using beans in damp paper towels.\n\n2. **Station Rotation:** Place students in small groups (3-4 per group). Each group rotates to a seedling station and observes the plant carefully using hand lenses.\n\n3. **Guided Observation Questions (Teacher asks while students observe):**\n   - *\"What colors do you see?\"*\n   - *\"Touch the stem gently. Is it hard or soft?\"*\n   - *\"Look at the bottom. What do you notice about the roots?\"*\n   - *\"How many leaves can you count?\"*\n\n4. **Student Documentation:** Students draw or point to the parts they observe on a simple diagram sheet labeled with: roots, stem, leaves.\n\n**Part B: Plant Your Own Seed (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Give each student a clear cup with a small amount of potting soil already in the bottom.**\n\n2. **Step-by-step planting directions (demonstrate each step first):**\n   - *\"Put your bean seed on top of the soil.\"*\n   - *\"Cover it gently with more soil — about this much.\"* (Show with fingers)\n   - *\"Spray it with a little water. The soil should feel damp, like a wrung-out sponge.\"*\n   - *\"Put your cup in a sunny spot in our classroom.\"*\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:** Say: *\"The plant in the picture started as a tiny seed just like this one. Your seed will grow roots first, even though you can't see them. Then, leaves will pop up!\"*\n\n4. **Student Record:** Each student draws and labels their planted seed on a paper. They write their name on their cup.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among students, asking guiding questions: *\"What do you think will happen next?\" \"Why do you think the plant needs water?\"*\n- Avoid directly telling students what roots or leaves \"do\" — let them observe and wonder.\n- Provide gentle corrections if seeds are planted incorrectly (too deep or too shallow).\n- Encourage students to use their senses responsibly (looking and touching, not tasting).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe and point to different plant parts.\n- Students will plant a seed and understand it needs water and a sunny spot.\n- Students will make simple drawings and labels showing what they see.\n- Students will begin connecting the real seed to the photographed seedling.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of what plants need to survive.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original photograph\n- Chart paper with student predictions (from Engage phase)\n- Simple picture cards (sun, water, soil, plant)\n- Large poster or anchor chart\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Return to Predictions (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Review what students predicted plants need during Engage.\n   - Say: *\"Now that we've explored, let's see if your guesses were right!\"*\n\n2. **Group Share-Out from Explore (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Ask a few volunteers: *\"What did you see when you looked at the real seedling?\" \"What did you do when you planted your seed?\"*\n   - Affirm their observations: *\"Yes! The roots were below the soil, and the leaves were above!\"*\n\n3. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (5-8 minutes):**\n\n   Teach these terms using the photograph as reference and the real seedlings they explored:\n\n   - **Roots:** *\"These are the stringy, brown parts you see at the bottom of the plant. They drink water from the soil and help keep the plant in the ground.\"* (Point to the roots in the photograph.)\n   \n   - **Stem:** *\"This is the green stick-like part that holds up the leaves. It carries water from the roots up to the leaves.\"* (Point to the stem.)\n   \n   - **Leaves:** *\"These are the green, flat parts. They catch sunlight and help the plant make food to grow big and strong.\"* (Point to the leaves.)\n   \n   - **Water:** *\"Plants drink water through their roots, just like you drink water. Water helps them grow.\"*\n   \n   - **Sunlight:** *\"Plants need sunlight to stay healthy and green. That's why we put our seeds in the sunny spot in our classroom.\"*\n\n4. **Create an Anchor Chart (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Title: *\"What Do Plants Need to Live?\"*\n   - Draw or paste pictures of: ☀️ Sunlight, 💧 Water, 🌱 Soil\n   - Add simple sentences: *\"Plants need water.\" \"Plants need sunlight.\" \"Plants need soil.\"*\n   - Post this chart where students can see it for the rest of the lesson.\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"Show me with your fingers where the roots are.\"* (Students point downward.)\n   - Ask: *\"What color are the leaves?\"* (Green)\n   - Ask: *\"Does our seed need water?\"* (Yes)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Roots** | The parts of a plant that grow under the soil and drink water |\n| **Stem** | The green stick-like part that holds up the plant and carries water |\n| **Leaves** | The green, flat parts that catch sunlight and help the plant grow |\n| **Sunlight** | Light from the sun that plants need to stay healthy and green |\n| **Water** | A clear liquid that plants drink through their roots to live and grow |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name roots, stem, and leaves.\n- Students can answer: *\"What does a plant need to live?\"* with at least one correct answer (water, sunlight, or soil).\n- Students understand that plants are living things with parts that help them survive.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by predicting plant needs in different scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards of plants in different environments (optional: draw or print pictures of a plant in sunlight, a plant in a dark closet, a plant with water, a wilted plant without water)\n- Chart paper with two columns labeled \"Happy Plant\" and \"Sad Plant\"\n- Students' cups with planted seeds\n- Markers and crayons\n- (Optional) Small observational worksheet with checkboxes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Thinking:**\n\n1. **Introduce Scenarios (Teacher-led, 5 minutes):**\n   \n   Say: *\"Let's think like plant scientists. I'm going to tell you about some plants. You tell me if they will be happy and healthy or sad.\"*\n\n   **Scenario 1:** *\"A plant gets plenty of water and sunshine every day. Will it be happy or sad?\"* (Happy!) *\"Why?\"* (Because it has what it needs!)\n\n   **Scenario 2:** *\"A plant sits in a dark corner of a room and never gets water. Will it be happy or sad?\"* (Sad!) *\"Why?\"* (Because it needs light and water!)\n\n   **Scenario 3:** *\"A plant is in the sunshine but has no soil — it's floating in the air. Will it be happy or sad?\"* (Sad!) *\"Why?\"* (Because roots need soil!)\n\n2. **Create a \"Happy Plant vs. Sad Plant\" Chart (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Divide a paper into two sides.\n   - On \"Happy Plant\" side: Draw or paste a healthy plant. Students dictate or draw what the plant has (sun, water, soil).\n   - On \"Sad Plant\" side: Draw a droopy plant. Students identify what's missing.\n   - Write simple labels: *\"Happy plants have water, sunlight, and soil.\"*\n\n3. **Individual Task: Plant Care Prediction (5 minutes):**\n   - Show students their planted seeds again.\n   - Ask: *\"What will we do to keep our plants happy and healthy?\"*\n   - Students draw or write one thing they will do: water it, put it in the sun, or keep it in soil.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions: *\"Why do you think that plant looks sad?\" \"What does this plant need?\"*\n- Affirm connections to the Explore phase: *\"Yes! Just like the plant you planted, it needs water!\"*\n- Gently redirect if students suggest unrealistic plant care (e.g., feeding it candy) to science-based needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can predict whether a plant will be healthy based on what it has (water, sunlight, soil).\n- Students understand that plants have consistent needs.\n- Students can apply learning to their own planted seed.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of plant parts and plant needs for survival.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observe student drawings** from Explore and Elaborate phases. Can they identify roots, stems, and leaves?\n- **Listen to student responses** during group discussions. Do they use vocabulary appropriately?\n- **Watch students during plant care.** Do they understand plants need water and sunlight?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes)**\n\n**Format: Picture-Based Questions** (Kindergarten-appropriate)\n\nDisplay the original photograph one more time. Ask these questions. Students respond by drawing, pointing, or saying aloud:\n\n1. **Question 1 (Plant Parts):** *\"Point to the roots. Point to the leaves. Can you tell me the name of this part?\"* (Student must correctly identify 2 of 3 parts: roots, stem, or leaves)\n\n2. **Question 2 (What Plants Need):** Show three picture cards: ☀️ sun, 💧 water, 🍕 pizza.\n   *\"Which things does a plant need to live?\"* (Students select sun and water; must reject pizza)\n\n3. **Question 3 (Application):** *\"You have a plant in a dark corner with no water. Will it be happy? Why or why not?\"* (Student should indicate the plant will be sad because it's missing water and sunlight)\n\n**Alternative Quick Assessment (for time-constrained classrooms):**\n- **Thumbs up/middle/down:** Ask: *\"Do you know what plants need to live?\"*\n  - Thumbs up = I can name at least 2 things plants need\n  - Thumbs middle = I know plants need something, but I'm not sure what\n  - Thumbs down = I'm still learning\n\n**Success Criteria — Students have met the learning objectives if they:**\n- Correctly identify at least 2 plant parts (roots, stem, or leaves) when shown the photograph\n- State or draw at least 1 thing plants need to survive (water, sunlight, or soil)\n- Demonstrate understanding that plants are living things by participating in Explore and Elaborate activities with engagement\n- Make a connection between the photographed plant and their own planted seed\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify 2+ plant parts.\n- 75% of students will name at least 2 things plants need to survive.\n- 90% of students will show that they understand plants are living and need care through their participation and observations.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only \"roots,\" \"leaves,\" and \"green parts\" for some students. Skip \"stem\" or introduce it later.\n\n2. **Hands-On Manipulation:** Provide a large model of a plant (made from felt or pipe cleaners with laminated parts) that students can physically point to and touch, rather than relying on drawings alone.\n\n3. **Visual Cues with Objects:** Pair vocabulary with real objects constantly (show real water while saying \"water,\" point to sunlight coming through the window while saying \"sunlight\"). Repeat these pairings multiple times.\n\n4. **Reduced Task Complexity:** In Elaborate, ask simpler either/or questions: *\"Does a plant need water? Yes or no?\"* instead of open-ended \"why\" questions.\n\n5. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair a struggling student with a confident peer during Explore so they can observe the seedling together and benefit from peer language.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Observation:** Provide magnifying glasses and ask: *\"What tiny details can you see on the roots? Can you count the leaves? Do all plants have the same number of leaves?\"* Students can sketch detailed diagrams.\n\n2. **Experimental Prediction:** Ask: *\"What if we put a plant in a very hot place? What if we gave it too much water? What do you think would happen?\"* Have them make specific predictions based on plant needs.\n\n3. **Research Task:** Introduce the concept of different plant habitats. *\"Some plants grow in dry deserts, some in wet rainforests. Why do you think different plants need different amounts of water?\"* Provide picture books or images to explore.\n\n4. **Vocabulary Extension:** Introduce additional terms: photosynthesis (simple version: *\"Plants make their own food using sunlight and water\"*), germination (*\"When a seed grows and sprouts for the first time\"*).\n\n5. **Responsibility Role:** Assign advanced learners as \"plant monitors\" who check on the class's planted seeds daily, water them appropriately, and report back to the class: *\"Our plant is growing! The stem is getting taller.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Journal (Daily Observation Over 2-3 Weeks):**\n   - Students draw or photograph their planted seed every 2-3 days as it germinates and grows.\n   - Create a simple flip chart or poster showing the progression: seed → roots appear → sprout emerges → leaves grow.\n   - Read the book *\"From Seed to Plant\"* by Gail Gibbons during this time to reinforce the life cycle.\n   - **Connection:** This extends the Elaborate phase by allowing students to observe real plant growth over time and deepen their understanding of plant development.\n\n2. **Plant Needs Sort and Categorize:**\n   - Create or collect magazine cutouts and drawings of items plants need (water bottle, sun, soil, rock, air) and things they don't (candy, shoes, pencil).\n   - Students sort items into \"Plants Need This\" and \"Plants Don't Need This\" categories.\n   - Discuss why each item belongs in its category.\n   - **Connection:** This reinforces K-LS1-1 by asking students to describe patterns in what plants need to survive in a concrete, sortable format.\n\n3. **Plant Needs Hunt Around the Classroom and School:**\n   - Take students on a \"plant detective walk\" around the classroom and outdoor area.\n   - Have them find examples of what plants need: a sunny windowsill, a watering can, soil in a planter, a green plant.\n   - Take photos or draw pictures to create a \"What Plants Need\" display.\n   - Back in the classroom, organize the evidence on a chart: *\"We found these things plants need!\"*\n   - **Connection:** This real-world application connects abstract concepts to students' immediate environment and builds observational skills.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Timing Flexibility:** Kindergarteners have variable attention spans. If students seem fatigued during Explain, pause and continue the next day. The lesson is designed as two 40-minute sessions to accommodate this.\n\n- **Plant Material Prep:** Grow 2-3 seedlings for the Explore phase one week in advance using bean seeds and damp paper towels in a clear cup. This ensures you have healthy, observable specimens.\n\n- **Safety Reminders:** Ensure students wash hands after handling soil. Remind them not to taste seeds or soil.\n\n- **Photography:** Take photos of student-planted seeds on Day 1. This creates a visual record and helps students compare Day 1 to Day 2+ growth.\n\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Use the vocabulary consistently throughout the day (during calendar time, transitions, etc.) to support retention: *\"We're walking to the sunny window for our plants to get sunlight.\"*\n\nThis lesson directly uses the photograph as a springboard for investigating plant survival and life science concepts, aligning closely with K-LS1-1.",
