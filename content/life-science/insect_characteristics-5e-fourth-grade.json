ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the grasshopper's structures and activate prior knowledge about animal bodies.\n\n- **Materials:** \n  - Printed or projected image of the grasshopper on the leaf\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Student observation journals or notebooks\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. Display the photograph prominently on a screen or large printout. Do not provide any context—simply show it and wait for students to notice details.\n  2. Ask students to turn and talk with a partner: *\"What do you notice about this animal? What do you see that is interesting or unusual?\"* (Allow 2-3 minutes of paired discussion.)\n  3. Facilitate a quick whole-class share-out and record observations on chart paper under the heading **\"What We Notice.\"** Accept all observations without correction.\n  4. Ask these targeted discussion questions:\n     - *\"What body parts does this grasshopper have that help it stay on this green leaf without falling off?\"*\n     - *\"If this grasshopper needed to escape from a bird, what parts of its body would help it get away quickly?\"*\n     - *\"Why do you think those long, thin parts sticking out from its head might be important?\"*\n     - *\"How do you think this grasshopper's green color helps it survive?\"*\n  5. Pose a prediction prompt: *\"I want you to wonder: How does every part of a grasshopper's body help it stay alive? We're going to investigate this mystery together.\"*\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today, you're going to become grasshopper scientists. We'll examine the parts of a grasshopper up close, figure out what each part does, and then explain why those structures are so important for the grasshopper's survival.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate grasshopper structures through close observation and discover how each part functions in survival and sensing.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Live grasshoppers in clear containers (or high-quality photographs/videos if live specimens are unavailable)\n  - Hand lenses (magnifying glasses)\n  - \"Grasshopper Structure Investigation\" worksheet (see template below)\n  - Colored pencils\n  - Rulers\n  - Optional: Video clip of grasshopper movement or sensory behavior (2-3 minutes)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Setup:** Divide students into small groups (3-4 students). Assign each group a grasshopper observation station or provide them with a detailed close-up photograph.\n\n  **Student Directions:**\n\n  1. **Observe the whole animal (5 minutes):** Using your hand lens, look carefully at the grasshopper. Sketch what you see in your observation journal. Label the main body sections you notice (head, thorax, abdomen). Record the color and texture.\n\n  2. **Investigate the head region (5 minutes):** Focus your hand lens on the head. You should see:\n     - **Antennae** (the long, thin structures extending from the head): Measure them. Are they longer or shorter than the grasshopper's body? Gently observe how they move. In your worksheet, write down: *What might these be used for?*\n     - **Eyes** (large, dark structures on the sides of the head): Circle them in your sketch. Notice their position. *Why do you think they're placed on the sides of the head?*\n     - **Mouth parts** (visible below the eyes): Sketch what you see. *What might the grasshopper use these for?*\n\n  3. **Investigate the legs (5 minutes):** Count the legs carefully. You should find six legs. Look closely at the **back two legs**—they are much larger and thicker than the others. Measure the back legs compared to the middle legs. Write or draw in your worksheet: *Why do you think these back legs are so much bigger?*\n\n  4. **Optional movement observation (3 minutes):** If watching a short video or live grasshopper movement: Observe how the grasshopper jumps or walks. Which legs move first? Which legs push the hardest? Record observations.\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate between groups, asking open-ended questions without providing answers: *\"What are you noticing about that structure? What might it be used for? Why do you think it looks that way?\"*\n  - Help students focus their observations without leading conclusions.\n  - Ensure all group members participate in observing and recording.\n  - Redirect students who are stuck: *\"Compare the back legs to the other legs. What's different about them? Why might that difference matter?\"*\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Detailed sketches of grasshopper structures with labels\n  - Measurements and observations recorded on the worksheet\n  - Initial hypotheses about function (not yet formal, but evidence-based guesses)\n  - Recognition that different structures appear to have different purposes\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts, then connect observations to survival functions.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper or whiteboard\n  - Labeled diagram of grasshopper anatomy (teacher-created or from reliable source)\n  - \"Structure-Function Matching\" handout\n  - Markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Ask each group to share one structure they observed and one hypothesis about what it does. Record these on chart paper under the heading **\"Structures and What They Might Do.\"** Validate observations without correcting yet.\n\n  2. **Teacher-led explanation with visual support (8 minutes):**\n     \n     Display a labeled diagram of a grasshopper. Teach the key structures and their functions using student-friendly language:\n\n     **Vocabulary:**\n     - **Antennae:** Long sensory organs that detect smells, tastes, and touch. They help the grasshopper find food and sense danger. Think of them like \"feelers\" or super-sensitive noses.\n     - **Compound eyes:** Special eyes made of thousands of tiny lens units. They help the grasshopper see movement very quickly, which is important for spotting predators.\n     - **Legs:** The grasshopper has six legs. The front two and middle two legs are used for walking and gripping. The back two legs are long and powerful—they are designed for jumping. The strong muscles in these legs let the grasshopper leap up to 20 times its own body length!\n     - **Abdomen:** The rear section of the body. It contains the digestive system and, in females, a special structure for laying eggs.\n     - **Body segments:** The grasshopper's body is divided into three main sections (head, thorax, abdomen) and further divided into rings or segments. This segmented design allows the grasshopper to bend and flex when jumping.\n     - **Camouflage:** The green color of the grasshopper's body helps it blend in with grass and leaves. This protects it from being seen by predators.\n\n  3. **Connect back to the photograph and Explore activity (4 minutes):**\n     - \"Remember those long back legs you measured? Scientists call those jumping legs. When a grasshopper detects danger using its antennae or eyes, it can use these powerful legs to launch itself away—sometimes 20 times its own size!\"\n     - \"See how green it is in our photograph? That green color isn't just pretty—it's a survival tool. On a green leaf, the grasshopper is hard to see. That's called camouflage.\"\n     - \"Those antennae sticking out? They're like invisible feelers. Even in the dark, a grasshopper can sense what's around it using those antennae.\"\n\n  4. **Check for understanding (2 minutes):**\n     - Ask quick comprehension questions: *\"If I cover a grasshopper's antennae, what might it have trouble doing?\"* (Finding food, sensing danger)\n     - *\"Why would a grasshopper need powerful back legs?\"* (To jump away from predators)\n     - *\"Why is being green helpful to a grasshopper?\"* (Camouflage—hard for predators to see it on leaves)\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Antennae:** Thin, long sense organs on the head that detect smells, tastes, and feel.\n  - **Compound eyes:** Special eyes made of thousands of tiny parts that help see movement very quickly.\n  - **Abdomen:** The rear section of the body that holds digestive organs.\n  - **Camouflage:** Coloring or patterns that help an animal blend in with its surroundings and hide from predators.\n  - **Segments:** Rings or sections that divide the grasshopper's body, allowing it to bend and move.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students can name and locate major external structures of a grasshopper.\n  - Students understand that structures have specific functions related to survival (sensing, moving, hiding, eating).\n  - Students can explain why certain structures look the way they do (e.g., why back legs are big, why the grasshopper is green).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a sensory model and explaining how grasshoppers respond to environmental information.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Large paper or poster board (1 per group)\n  - Markers, colored pencils, crayons\n  - Index cards or sticky notes\n  - Grasshopper diagram (reference copy for each group)\n  - Yarn or string (optional, for creating 3D antennae)\n  - Scissors\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Part 1: Sensory Response Model (10 minutes)**\n\n  Students create a labeled diagram or poster titled **\"How a Grasshopper Senses and Survives.\"** The model should show:\n\n  1. **Sensory input:** What information does the grasshopper gather? (Draw or label: eyes see a shadow moving fast, antennae feel vibrations from footsteps, eyes see a green leaf with food)\n  2. **Processing:** The grasshopper's brain receives signals from the senses. (Draw an arrow to the head/brain area)\n  3. **Response:** What does the grasshopper do with that information? (Draw the response: jumps away from danger, moves toward food, stays still on a green leaf to hide)\n\n  Students should use the grasshopper photograph and their Explore observations to support their diagrams. Encourage them to add labels and color.\n\n  **Part 2: Scenario Application (5 minutes)**\n\n  Present this scenario: *\"A red bird is flying toward a grasshopper sitting on a green blade of grass. The grasshopper doesn't see the bird coming at first, but then its antennae sense vibrations in the air.\"*\n\n  Have students write or draw (on their model or on a separate card) the step-by-step response:\n  - What does the grasshopper sense? (vibrations through antennae)\n  - What does the grasshopper's brain do with this information? (recognizes danger)\n  - How does the grasshopper respond? (powerful back legs contract and launch it away)\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate and ask: *\"How does each structure you drew help the grasshopper respond to this situation?\"*\n  - Encourage students to use evidence from the photograph: *\"Look at the grasshopper's eyes and legs in the image. How could these structures help it survive this danger?\"*\n  - Support groups in connecting sensory structures (antennae, eyes) to survival behaviors (jumping, hiding).\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Labeled diagrams showing sensory input, brain processing, and behavioral response\n  - Ability to explain the pathway from sensing to response\n  - Recognition that multiple structures work together to support survival\n  - Clear evidence that students understand 4-LS1-2 (animals receive information through senses, process it in the brain, and respond)\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of grasshopper structures, their functions, and how structures support survival and sensory response.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n  - Observation of student sketches and labels during Explore phase\n  - Quality of responses to teacher questions in Explain phase\n  - Group discussions and participation in model-building (Elaborate)\n\n  **Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):** Administer this at the end of the lesson or as a quick follow-up. Students can respond verbally, in writing, or by drawing. Use at least 2-3 of the following:\n\n  1. **Structure-Function Matching (with a new image):** Show a zoomed-in photograph of a different grasshopper species or a similar insect. Ask: *\"Label three structures you see. Next to each, write or draw what that structure helps the grasshopper do to survive.\"*\n\n  2. **Constructed Argument:** *\"Explain why a grasshopper's back legs are much bigger and more powerful than its other legs. Use evidence from what you observed to support your answer.\"* (Success criterion: Student identifies that back legs are for jumping and jumping helps the grasshopper escape predators.)\n\n  3. **Sensory Scenario:** *\"A grasshopper is on a green leaf at night. It hears a cricket nearby. Which of its sensory structures would help it find the cricket? Explain your thinking.\"* (Success criterion: Student correctly identifies antennae and explains that antennae detect vibrations or sound/movement in darkness.)\n\n  4. **Function Explanation:** *\"Explain how the grasshopper's green color is a structure that helps it survive. What problem does it solve?\"* (Success criterion: Student explains camouflage and protection from predators.)\n\n  5. **Argument Construction (aligns with 4-LS1-1):** *\"Write or draw an argument that shows how at least two external structures of a grasshopper work together to help it survive. Include evidence.\"* (Success criterion: Student identifies two structures, explains their individual functions, and describes how they work together—e.g., antennae sense danger + powerful legs allow escape.)\n\n- **Success Criteria:**\n  - Student accurately identifies at least 3-4 major external structures.\n  - Student explains the function of each structure in terms of survival (finding food, sensing danger, moving, hiding).\n  - Student uses evidence from the photograph or their observations to support explanations.\n  - Student demonstrates understanding that sensory structures (antennae, eyes) lead to processed responses (jumping, moving toward food).\n  - Student can construct a simple argument using evidence.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Exit tickets show understanding of structure-function relationships.\n  - Students can explain how multiple structures support survival and sensory response.\n  - Students demonstrate readiness to apply these concepts to other animals.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Diagram:** Provide a pre-labeled grasshopper diagram during Explore. Students color-code structures and write or match simple descriptions of function (e.g., *\"Back legs for jumping\"*) instead of generating full sentences.\n\n2. **Sentence Stems for Explanation:** Offer sentence starters for the Elaborate phase: *\"The _______ helps the grasshopper _______ because _______.\"* or *\"When the grasshopper senses _______, it uses its _______ to _______.\"* This scaffolds thinking without removing challenge.\n\n3. **Guided Investigation Worksheet:** Provide a structured worksheet during Explore with fill-in-the-blank observations (e.g., *\"I counted _______ legs. The back legs are _______ than the front legs.\"*) to focus attention and reduce overwhelm.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Comparative Anatomy:** Provide images of a grasshopper, a cricket, and a katydid. Have students compare structures and hypothesize why these similar insects might have small differences (e.g., different antenna lengths might relate to different habitats or hunting strategies). Ask: *\"What does this difference in structure tell us about how these insects might live differently?\"*\n\n2. **Sensory Depth Study:** Challenge students to research or diagram how grasshopper senses compare to human senses. For example: *\"A grasshopper can see ultraviolet colors humans cannot. How might this help it find flowers with nectar?\"* Have them create an infographic or comparison chart.\n\n3. **Design Challenge:** Present this problem: *\"Design a robot that could move and sense like a grasshopper. What structures or parts would you need to include? Why?\"* This applies structure-function thinking to engineering and requires deeper reasoning about why each structure matters.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Life Cycle Investigation:** Students research and illustrate the complete life cycle of a grasshopper (egg, nymph stages, adult). They compare structures of nymphs (young grasshoppers) to adults and discuss how structures change as grasshoppers grow and prepare for reproduction. (Connects to growth and reproduction aspects of 4-LS1-1.)\n\n2. **Grasshopper Adaptations in Different Habitats:** Show photographs of grasshoppers from different environments (desert grasshoppers, tree-dwelling grasshoppers, cave grasshoppers). Have students compare and contrast their structures and hypothesize how each is adapted to its habitat. For example: *\"Why might a cave grasshopper have longer antennae but smaller eyes than a field grasshopper?\"* (Extends understanding of structure-function across populations.)\n\n3. **Design a Predator-Avoidance Simulation Game:** Students use their knowledge of grasshopper structures to design a simple game or simulation where a \"grasshopper\" (played by a student or game piece) must use its senses to detect a \"predator\" and use its jumping ability to escape. This kinesthetic activity reinforces sensory processing and behavioral response (4-LS1-2) in an engaging, real-world scenario.\n\n---\n\n## End of Lesson Plan",
