All around it are pieces of broken bark and wood chips that cover the ground. This brave little plant found a way to grow even though it's surrounded by wood instead of soft soil!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates plant resilience and seed dispersal. A seed landed in this mulched area (maybe dropped by a bird, blown by wind, or carried by an animal) and found just enough soil beneath the mulch to germinate. Plants are incredibly determined – their roots push down through obstacles while their shoots push up toward sunlight. The green leaves need light for photosynthesis (making food), so the plant instinctively grows upward. This shows that plants can adapt to challenging environments!\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Seed Dispersal**: Seeds travel away from parent plants through wind, water, animals, or gravity to find new places to grow.\n\n2. **Germination Requirements**: Seeds need water, warmth, air, and eventually light to sprout and grow into healthy plants.\n\n3. **Phototropism**: The way plants automatically grow toward light sources, even if they have to push through obstacles like mulch.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nDo a \"seed detective\" investigation! Have students search the schoolyard or playground for plants growing in unexpected places (cracks in sidewalks, gaps in fences, gravel areas). Document findings with photos or sketches. Discuss: How did seeds get there? What challenges do these plants face?
