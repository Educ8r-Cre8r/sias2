  "content": "This box turtle has an incredible built-in home that it carries everywhere! The hard shell is made of bone covered by tough plates that protect the turtle's soft body from predators. Notice how the shell has beautiful rings and patterns - these actually show how old the turtle is, similar to rings on a tree. When danger approaches, box turtles can pull their head, legs, and tail completely inside their shell and close it up tight like a box with a lid!",
