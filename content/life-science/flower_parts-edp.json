  "content": "# NGSS Engineering Design Challenge: Hibiscus Flower\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n- Pink hibiscus flower with five broad petals\n- Yellow/cream-colored stamen (center reproductive part) with orange pollen-bearing structures\n- Long, thin pistil extending upward with round stigma at the tip\n- Dark green blurred background (outdoor setting)\n- Veined texture visible on petals\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n- **From stamen and pistil structure**: The flower must position pollen-bearing parts at specific heights and angles to increase the chance of pollination by insects or other visitors; this suggests a need for structural support and accessibility.\n- **From petal arrangement**: The broad, flat petals serve as a landing platform; this implies an engineering solution for attracting and stabilizing visiting creatures.\n- **From outdoor setting**: The flower must withstand wind, water, and weight of visiting insects without breaking or losing function, suggesting durability requirements.\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2: Build a Flower for Bugs**\nDesign and build a big flower out of paper, fabric, or pipe cleaners that a toy bug or craft figure can land on safely. Your flower needs sturdy petals that don't bend and a center that holds a small object (like a bead for pollen). Will your flower hold up if you gently shake it?\n\n**3-5: Design a Pollinator-Friendly Flower Structure**\nDesign a model flower (using craft materials) with the following constraints:\n- Petals must be at least 8 cm long and positioned to create a landing platform at least 5 cm wide.\n- The stamen (pollen part) must extend 3–5 cm above the petals and support a 20-gram weight without bending more than 1 cm.\n- The structure must remain stable when tilted 45 degrees (simulating wind or insect movement).\n- Test your design with a toy insect landing on the flower. Document where it lands most easily and adjust the petal angle if needed.\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem** — This photo shows a natural structure solving real challenges (pollination, structural support, accessibility). Students should start by observing what the flower does and asking *why* it's shaped this way, then identify the engineering problem: \"How can we design a structure that attracts visitors, supports their weight, and keeps pollen accessible?\"\n\n### Suggested Materials\n- Colored paper or tissue paper (petals)\n- Pipe cleaners or straws (stamen/pistil)\n- Foam balls or pom-poms (pollen clusters)\n- Clay or play dough (base/stem)\n- Tape, string, or hot glue gun\n- Toy insects, beads, or small weights for testing\n\n### Estimated Time\n- **K-2**: One 40-minute session (observation + building + testing)\n- **3-5**: Two 40-minute sessions (design + build + test + redesign)\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly supports **NGSS 3-5-ETS1-1** (\"Ask questions to define a design problem\") and **K-2-ETS1-1** (\"Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change\") by grounding the challenge in observable nature and asking students to solve a real biological problem through engineering design.",
