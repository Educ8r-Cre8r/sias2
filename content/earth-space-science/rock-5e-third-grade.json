ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by connecting the photograph to their everyday experience with rocks and weather.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the layered rock (rock.jpeg)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a printed image. Ask students to take a close look without talking for 15 seconds, then turn to a partner and describe what they notice.\n\n2. **Facilitate group discussion** using these guiding questions:\n   - \"What do you notice about this rock? Does it look like a regular rock you might find in your yard?\"\n   - \"See these stripes or bands in the rock? What might they be? Why do you think they look different colors?\"\n   - \"If you could look *inside* this rock, what story do you think it might tell us?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen something in nature that shows layers, like a slice of cake or a tree stump? What does each layer represent?\"\n\n3. **Record student ideas** on chart paper as they respond. Affirm curiosity and avoid confirming or correcting answers at this stage.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what this rock could tell us about what Earth was like a long, long time ago?\" Write this question where students can see it throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become rock detectives and learn how to read the clues that rocks leave us, just like detectives solve mysteries!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rock layers through hands-on observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One sample of layered sedimentary rock per pair or small group (or high-quality photograph if actual rock unavailable)\n- Magnifying glasses (one per pair)\n- Colored sand or soil (3-4 different colors: light tan, dark brown, reddish, light gray)\n- Clear plastic cups or jars (one per pair)\n- Small spoons or measuring cups\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Paper towels\n- Student observation sheets (see below)\n- Pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the rock model:** Explain to students: \"We're going to create our own layered rock to understand how real rocks like this one form. When Earth's surface weathers and breaks down, small pieces wash into water and settle in layers at the bottom. Over a very long time, these layers get pressed together and become rock.\"\n\n2. **Provide hands-on instructions** for pairs/small groups:\n   - Examine the actual rock sample (or photograph) with magnifying glasses. Ask: \"What colors do you see? Can you count the different bands or layers?\"\n   - Document observations on their observation sheet by drawing and labeling the layers they see.\n   - Using the colored sand, create their own \"rock\" by layering different colors into a clear cup: Spoon in a layer of light sand (about 1 inch), then a layer of dark soil, then reddish sand, then light gray. Create at least 4 distinct layers.\n   - Gently spray water on top of the layers and observe how the sand settles and compacts.\n   - Observe their model rock and the real rock side-by-side. Record: \"How are they similar? How are they different?\"\n\n3. **Teacher circulates** and asks guiding questions without giving answers:\n   - \"What do you think each layer represents?\"\n   - \"Why are the layers in this order? Did they happen at the same time or different times?\"\n   - \"What do you think would happen to your rock if it got wet and dried many times?\"\n\n4. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students create a visual model of stratification (layering).\n   - Students identify that real rocks have multiple layers of different colors and textures.\n   - Students observe that layers are distinct and don't all look the same.\n   - Students record observations in drawings and simple written descriptions.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts, connecting exploration to the photograph and real-world geology.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary pre-written\n- The photograph (displayed again)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Pencils or markers for note-taking\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students for a group share:** Ask 2-3 pairs to show their model rocks and describe what they observed. Ask other students: \"What do you notice about [Student A's] rock? How does it compare to [Student B's]?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions. Write each on chart paper and keep visible for reference:\n\n   - **Rock Layers (or Strata):** Bands of different types of rock or sediment stacked on top of each other, like pages in a book. Each layer formed at a different time.\n   - **Weathering:** The breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by wind, water, ice, and weather.\n   - **Sediment:** Tiny pieces of rock and soil that are carried by water and settle in layers.\n   - **Erosion:** The movement of rock pieces and soil from one place to another by wind, water, or ice.\n   - **Stratification:** The natural process of materials settling into layers.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the photograph again. \"Remember this rock? The bands we see are layers that formed over thousands of years. Each layer tells us something different about what Earth was like when that layer formed.\"\n   - \"Notice the top of the rock—it looks broken and worn. That's weathering at work! Rain, wind, and freeze-thaw cycles break it down slowly, just like they break down rocks everywhere.\"\n   - \"Different colors in the layers often mean different climates or environments. A light layer might have formed during a wet season. A darker layer might show a time when there was different vegetation or weather.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Can someone point to a layer in the photograph and tell us what it might represent?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the layers are different colors?\"\n   - \"What would happen to this rock if it sat outside for a whole year in different seasons?\"\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students understand that rock layers form over time and record Earth's history.\n   - Students connect weathering and erosion to changes in rocks and landforms.\n   - Students use vocabulary accurately to describe what they observed.\n   - Students make inferences about environmental conditions based on layer appearance.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding of rock layers and weathering to explore how different climates affect rocks differently.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards showing rocks from different climate regions (desert, tropical, arctic, temperate forest) — create these beforehand or use printed images\n- Data table template (simple 3-column table: \"Climate Region / What Happens to Rocks / Why\")\n- Chart paper for displaying findings\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set the scenario:** \"We know that weathering breaks down rocks. But here's an interesting question: Does weathering happen the same way in different parts of the world? A desert is very hot and dry. A rainforest is hot and wet. The Arctic is cold and icy. How might rocks change differently in each place?\"\n\n2. **Facilitate small-group investigation:**\n   - Assign each group a climate region (desert, tropical rainforest, temperate forest with seasons, arctic/mountain).\n   - Provide a picture of a rock formation from that region (or a description).\n   - Pose the question: \"Based on what you know about this climate, how do you think rocks in this region get weathered? What would happen to our layered rock if it lived here?\"\n   - Students discuss and record their ideas in the data table: Climate region → observable features or changes → explanation based on weather/climate.\n\n3. **Teacher role:** Facilitate discussion by asking:\n   - \"What kind of weather happens most in this climate?\"\n   - \"How might rain, ice, heat, or cold affect rocks?\"\n   - \"Would weathering happen quickly or slowly here?\"\n\n4. **Group share:** Each group presents one climate region and their prediction about weathering. Create a class chart showing all regions.\n\n5. **Connection to NGSS 3-ESS2-2:** \"We just obtained and combined information to describe how different climates in different regions of the world affect rocks differently. This is how scientists learn about Earth!\"\n\n6. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students make evidence-based predictions about how different climates cause different types of weathering.\n   - Students represent their thinking in a data table or visual display.\n   - Students understand that Earth's climate varies by region and affects landforms.\n   - Students begin to connect environmental factors to geological processes.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rock layers, weathering, and Earth processes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n   - Observation of student participation during Explore phase: Do students identify layers and differences in the rock?\n   - Review of observation sheets: Can students draw and label layers with some accuracy?\n   - Listen to student language during group discussions: Are they using vocabulary like \"layers,\" \"weathering,\" and \"erosion\" appropriately?\n   - Questioning during Explain: Can students make simple inferences about what layers tell us?\n\n2. **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment** (provide these questions orally or in writing, depending on grade readiness):\n\n   **Question 1:** \"Look at this photograph of our layered rock. Tell me two things you notice about how it looks. (Prompt: Think about the colors, the bands, the broken top.)\"\n   \n   **Question 2:** \"Why do you think rocks have different layers? What does each layer tell us?\"\n   \n   **Question 3:** \"Our rock has a broken, rough top. What do you think caused it to look like that?\" (Accept answers about: weather, rain, wind, sun, freezing, animals, or time.)\n   \n   **Question 4 (Challenge):** \"If this rock lived in a rainy rainforest instead of a dry place, how might it look different after one year? Why?\"\n\n3. **Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n   - **Developing:** Student identifies at least 2 observable features of the rock (e.g., \"it has stripes\" or \"different colors\") and recognizes that weather affects rocks.\n   - **Proficient:** Student describes multiple layers, explains that they formed at different times, and connects weathering to visible changes. Uses at least one science vocabulary word correctly.\n   - **Advanced:** Student makes inferences about environmental conditions based on layer appearance, predicts how climate affects weathering, and represents thinking in a table or detailed drawing.\n\n4. **How to Determine if Objectives Were Met:**\n   - Review exit ticket responses and observation sheets.\n   - Note which students can describe layers and make simple inferences.\n   - Identify students who need additional support with the concept that layers form over time (these students may benefit from repeated exposure to the idea through stories and images).\n   - Recognize students ready for deeper investigation into fossils, erosion rates, or regional geology.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support:**\n\n- **Provide a sentence frame for observations:** \"This rock has _____ (layers/stripes/bands). The colors are _____ and _____. I think each layer formed when _____.\" This scaffolds written expression for students who struggle with writing.\n- **Use real objects during Explore:** Provide an actual rock sample that students can handle, touch, and examine closely. Tactile engagement helps students with different learning styles access the concept.\n- **Simplify vocabulary initially:** Focus on \"layers\" and \"weathering\" as primary terms. Introduce \"stratification\" and \"sediment\" only for students showing readiness. Repeat definitions frequently and display them visually.\n\n**Challenge:**\n\n- **Deeper investigation into time scale:** Have advanced students estimate how long it might take to form a rock layer (research and report). Introduce the concept that rocks form over millions of years using accessible examples (e.g., \"It would take longer than your great-great-grandfather's lifetime\").\n- **Design a weathering experiment:** Students design a fair test to compare how fast different materials (chalk, sugar cubes, salt, foam) break down when exposed to water, ice, or heat. They predict outcomes, conduct the experiment, and represent data in a graph or table.\n- **Research real rocks and fossils:** Have students find pictures of actual rock formations or fossils from a specific location and write a short caption explaining what the rocks tell us about that place's climate or history long ago.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Layered Earth Book Project:** Students create a \"pop-up\" or accordion-fold book showing Earth's layers (crust, mantle, core) using the same layering concept from the lesson. They label and color each layer, explaining what it is made of and how it differs from other layers. This connects to understanding that Earth itself has layers, just like the rocks we studied.\n\n2. **Local Rock Collection and Classification:** Students collect 5-6 rocks from their neighborhood or schoolyard. They observe and sort them by color, texture, size, and hardness. They create a chart showing their classification system and explain their choices. This builds observation skills and connects Earth science to the local environment.\n\n3. **Weather and Erosion Documentation:** Over 2-4 weeks, students photograph a specific rock, brick wall, or stone feature in their community from the same spot. They observe and record changes (cracks, chips, color changes, weathering). They create a time-lapse display with annotations explaining what weather events may have caused each change. This demonstrates that weathering is an ongoing, observable process.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\nThis lesson successfully addresses all three specified NGSS standards by grounding abstract concepts in concrete observation. Students engage with real rocks (or detailed representations), collect data through their own investigation, and represent findings in tables and drawings (3-ESS2-1). The Elaborate phase explicitly guides students to obtain and combine information about how different climate regions affect rocks (3-ESS2-2). While 3-ESS3-1 (design solutions for weather hazards) is not the primary focus, the foundation laid here—understanding that weather changes rocks and landforms—prepares students for future lessons on protecting structures and landscapes from erosion and weathering. Consider pairing this lesson with outdoor observation, local geology resources, or a visit to a natural history museum for extended impact.",
