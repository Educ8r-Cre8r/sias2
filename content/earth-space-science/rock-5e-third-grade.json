Observe and describe visible layers in rocks and explain what layers tell us about how rocks form.\n2. Identify evidence of erosion and weathering on rock surfaces and explain how these processes change Earth's landscape.\n3. Sort and classify rocks based on observable characteristics (color, texture, layers) and use data to organize their observations.\n4. Explain why rocks and minerals are important natural resources that people use.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about rocks and layers.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the layered rock (or display on interactive board)\n- Index cards or whiteboard for writing predictions\n- Optional: A slice of a layered cake or sandwich to show analogy\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the large image prominently. Give students 30-45 seconds of silent \"observation time\" to look carefully.\n\n2. **Launch with Wonder:** Say: *\"This rock has visible stripes or bands running through it. What do you think those bands or layers mean? Are they just for decoration, or do they tell a story?\"*\n\n3. **Discussion Questions (Calibrated for Third Grade):**\n   - \"What do you notice about this rock? What colors and patterns do you see?\" (Observation)\n   - \"Why do you think this rock has different layers or stripes inside it?\" (Prediction/Inference)\n   - \"Have you ever seen rocks before? Did they look like this one? What was different?\" (Prior Knowledge)\n   - \"If you could talk to this rock, what story do you think it would tell us?\" (Imagination/Engagement)\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** Have students turn to a partner and say: *\"I think these layers formed because...\"* Students share one sentence predictions. Record 3-4 on the board without correcting.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to become rock detectives and discover how rocks actually form their layers and what they can teach us about Earth.\"*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rock layers and erosion through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Plastic ziplock bags (sandwich or quart size)\n- Sand (play sand or beach sand)\n- Pebbles or small gravel\n- Crushed chalk or crushed crackers (represent sediment)\n- Soil or dirt from outside\n- Water (in a spray bottle and a cup)\n- Ruler or measuring stick\n- Paper towels\n- Spoon or craft stick for mixing\n- Large index cards or paper towel sheets to place under bags for observation\n- **Optional:** Coffee filters or clear cups for alternative layering activity\n\n**Activity: \"Create Your Own Layers\"**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Build Your Layers:** Pour 1 inch of sand into your ziplock bag. Press it down gently with your spoon.\n\n2. **Add the Next Layer:** Sprinkle crushed chalk (or crushed crackers) on top of the sand in a thin layer. This represents sediment.\n\n3. **Keep Building:** Add layers of pebbles, then soil, then sand again. Alternate materials 4-5 times. Leave the last layer as something visible (like pebbles). This shows how rocks form from different sediments stacking up over time.\n\n4. **Seal and Compress:** Seal the bag and press down firmly from the top to compress the layers together. You are mimicking the pressure that creates real rocks underground.\n\n5. **Observe and Record:** Draw a picture of your layers on paper. Write or dictate labels for each layer (sand, pebbles, chalk, etc.). Measure the total height with a ruler and record the number.\n\n6. **Simulate Weathering and Erosion:** \n\n   - **Part A (Weathering):** Spray water on the outside of the sealed bag 10 times. Observe: Do the materials change? Does water seem to break things down?\n   \n   - **Part B (Erosion):** Carefully open the bag and place the layered materials on a paper towel. Pour 2 tablespoons of water onto one side of your pile. Observe: What happens to the layers? Which materials wash away first? Which stay in place? Why?\n\n7. **Document Your Findings:** Draw a picture of what your layers look like after water moved through them. Circle any changes you observe.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups with guiding questions (not answers): *\"What's happening to your layers? Which layer is moving the most? Why do you think sand moves easier than pebbles?\"*\n- Use a chart to record observations from each group without confirming correctness yet.\n- Redirect students who are off-task by asking them to predict what will happen next.\n- Encourage students to use words like \"before,\" \"after,\" \"change,\" \"washing away,\" \"moving.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will observe that water moves lighter materials (sand, chalk) more easily than heavier materials (pebbles).\n- Students will notice that layering happens when materials settle and compress.\n- Students will create visual records (drawings with labels) showing their layers before and after water movement.\n- Students will begin to infer that wind, water, and time shape rocks and change Earth's surface.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to rock science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Photograph of the layered rock (displayed again)\n- Real rock samples if available (igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic—optional but powerful)\n- Picture cards or digital images of: sediment, erosion, weathering, layers/strata, natural resources\n\n**Activity: Group Debrief and Vocabulary Introduction**\n\n1. **Share Observations (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share what they observed: *\"What happened to your layers when you added water? What materials moved? What materials stayed?\"*\n   - Record observations on chart paper in two columns: \"Before Water\" and \"After Water.\"\n   - Affirm all observations without judgment.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   - Use the chart to connect vocabulary to what students just experienced.\n   - **Define each term in simple, concrete language:**\n\n   | Vocabulary | Third Grade-Friendly Definition | Connect to Explore |\n   |---|---|---|\n   | **Sediment** | Tiny pieces of rock and minerals that move in water and wind (sand, pebbles, chalk) | The materials you layered in your bag |\n   | **Layers/Strata** | Bands or stripes of different materials stacked on top of each other in rocks | The sandwich you made with different materials |\n   | **Erosion** | When water, wind, or ice slowly wears away and moves rocks and soil from one place to another | What happened when you poured water on your pile |\n   | **Weathering** | When rocks break apart into smaller pieces due to weather (rain, sun, frost) | The spray bottle simulation; rocks breaking down |\n   | **Natural Resources** | Materials from Earth that people use to build things or meet their needs (rocks, soil, water) | The rock in the photo—humans dug it up to use |\n\n3. **Reconnect to the Photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Display the original rock image again.\n   - Say: *\"This real rock has layers just like your model did. The light and dark bands show different types of sediment that piled up over millions of years. The cracks and broken edges tell us that weathering and erosion have shaped this rock.\"*\n   - Point to specific features: *\"See these white stripes? That's one type of sediment. See the darker brown? That's a different sediment. Over time, they got pressed together into solid rock.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If I showed you a rock with no layers, would it have formed the same way as this one? Why or why not?\"* (Listen for: layers = sediment built up; no layers = might be igneous/different formation)\n   - Ask: *\"This rock is in a gravel pit. Why do you think people dug it up? What might we use it for?\"* (Expect: building, decoration, driveways)\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart:**\n- Create a large poster with each vocabulary word, a simple drawing, and a sentence. Post it in the classroom for reference.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will use the terms \"sediment,\" \"layers,\" \"erosion,\" and \"weathering\" with prompting in conversation.\n- Students will explain that rocks form from layered sediment pressed together.\n- Students will connect the photograph's visible features to the processes they explored.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to a new context and deepen reasoning about rock formation and erosion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large poster board\n- Markers in multiple colors\n- Images of real-world erosion (cliff faces, stream banks, canyon formations—print or project 3-4 images)\n- Images of how rocks are used (buildings, roads, sculptures, decorative landscaping)\n- Optional: Videos clip (2-3 minutes) of water erosion or time-lapse of rock formation\n\n**Activity: \"Rocks in Our World\"**\n\n**Option A: Erosion Detective Scavenger Hunt (Recommended for kinesthetic learners)**\n\n1. Show students 4-5 photographs of real landscapes showing evidence of erosion (weathered cliffs, worn rocks in streams, canyon walls, gullies from water runoff).\n\n2. For each image, students work in pairs and discuss:\n   - *\"Where do you see erosion or weathering happening in this picture?\"*\n   - *\"What is causing the change—water, wind, or time?\"*\n   - *\"If this picture was taken again in 10 years, how might it look different?\"*\n\n3. Create a class chart titled **\"Erosion Around Us\"** with three columns: **Location | What's Happening | Why It Matters**. Record student observations.\n\n4. Discuss: *\"Is erosion always bad? Or can it create beautiful things?\"* (Expect: Grand Canyon, canyons, badlands—erosion shaped them beautifully.)\n\n**Option B: \"Design a Protected Rock\" (Problem-Solving Focus)**\n\n1. Present this scenario: *\"A construction company found a beautiful, historic rock with layers like our photo. But they're worried that rain and wind will weather it and damage it before they can build around it. They want YOUR help. How could we design a shelter or cover that protects the rock but still lets people see it?\"*\n\n2. Small groups sketch a design on paper showing:\n   - The rock (draw simple layers)\n   - A protective structure (roof, glass case, etc.)\n   - Labels explaining why their design protects from **erosion** and **weathering**\n\n3. Groups share designs and explain: *\"How does your design stop water from wearing it away?\"* This is an informal connection to 3-ESS3-1 (design solutions to reduce hazards).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate discussion without providing answers; ask guiding questions.\n- Record ideas on the chart to validate student thinking.\n- Encourage students to use new vocabulary in their explanations.\n- Celebrate diverse design solutions; discuss trade-offs (e.g., a roof protects but blocks the view).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will identify real-world examples of erosion and weathering.\n- Students will apply understanding of sediment, layers, and erosion to explain landforms or design problems.\n- Students will use vocabulary naturally in context.\n- Students will understand that rocks are important resources and that we sometimes need to protect them.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rock formation, layers, erosion, weathering, and natural resources.\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n\n- **Observation Checklist** (Circulate during Explore and Elaborate phases):\n  - ☐ Student accurately describes visible layers in their model or the photo.\n  - ☐ Student explains erosion using evidence (e.g., \"The sand washed away because water is stronger\").\n  - ☐ Student uses at least 2 vocabulary terms correctly in conversation.\n  - ☐ Student makes a reasonable prediction about what would happen if they repeated the water erosion activity.\n\n- **Question Prompts for Formative Assessment:**\n  - *\"Tell me what happened to your layers when you added water. Why do you think that happened?\"*\n  - *\"Look at the cracks in the real rock. What do you think caused those?\"*\n  - *\"Why is this rock sitting in a pile of gravel? What might people use these rocks for?\"*\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (Choose One):**\n\n**Option 1: Drawing + Label (Best for all learners; takes 5-7 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with a half-page template showing a simple rock with visible layers and some cracks/weathered edges. Students:\n1. Color or shade the layers with different colors.\n2. Write or dictate 1-2 labels identifying:\n   - At least one layer\n   - Evidence of erosion or weathering\n3. Write or dictate one sentence: *\"This rock formed when...\"* or *\"I can see erosion because...\"*\n\n**Option 2: Multiple Choice + Short Answer (Best for students ready for text)**\n\nProvide 3-4 questions:\n\n1. **Multiple Choice:** *\"How do rock layers form?\"*\n   - A) Rocks fall from the sky.\n   - B) Different types of sediment stack up and get pressed together.\n   - C) Wind paints stripes on rocks.\n   - D) Rocks are born in factories.\n   \n   *Correct answer: B*\n\n2. **Short Answer:** *\"Look at the photograph. What does the cracked and broken look of the rock tell us about weathering?\"*\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student mentions water, wind, or time breaking the rock into pieces.\n\n3. **Application:** *\"If you left a chalk rock outside in the rain for a whole year, what might happen to it? Why?\"*\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student explains that water would wear it away / break it down / cause erosion.\n\n**Option 3: Performance Task (Best for observing deeper understanding)**\n\nReturn to the layered model from Explore. Ask: *\"If you left this bag outside for one month in the rain and sun, draw what might happen to your layers. Explain why.\"*\n\n- **Success Criteria:** \n  - Student shows some layers mixing or moving.\n  - Student explains weathering OR erosion by water/sun.\n  - Uses vocabulary (sediment, erosion, weathering, or layers).\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria for All Options:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student accurately describes layers and erosion/weathering, uses 2+ vocabulary terms, and makes a reasonable explanation based on evidence from exploration.\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student describes layers or erosion but may confuse processes; uses 1 vocabulary term with support; explanation shows partial understanding.\n\n✓ **Beginning:** Student identifies rock features but cannot explain formation or erosion; limited or no use of vocabulary; explanation lacks detail.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- 80% of students will correctly identify rock layers and describe how they form.\n- 75% of students will explain erosion or weathering with specific examples.\n- 70% of students will use at least 2 vocabulary terms correctly in their exit ticket.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:**\n   - Pair each vocabulary term with a concrete image and a hand motion (e.g., \"weathering\" = use both hands to break apart an imaginary rock).\n   - Provide a **vocabulary sheet with pictures** that students can reference during Explore and Evaluate phases.\n   - Use sentence frames for exit tickets: *\"This rock has layers because ____.\"* or *\"I see erosion when ____.\"*\n\n2. **Simplify the Explore Activity:**\n   - Pre-layer the sediment in bags so the student focuses on observing weathering/erosion rather than building layers.\n   - Use only 2-3 materials instead of 5 (e.g., just sand, pebbles, and chalk).\n   - Provide a **visual data sheet** with pictures of \"Before\" and \"After\" that students can circle or check off rather than drawing.\n\n3. **Reduce Recording Demands:**\n   - Allow students to **draw and dictate** observations to a peer, aide, or teacher rather than write independently.\n   - Provide a **partially completed graphic organizer** (e.g., a T-chart with \"What I See\" and \"Why It Happened\" with sample answers for one example).\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Questioning:**\n   - During Elaborate, ask: *\"If erosion is always happening, why aren't all rocks completely worn down? What protects rocks from being worn away?\"* (Expect: New layers, burial underground, hardness of rock type.)\n   - *\"In your model, the water moved the sediment. But in real rocks, the sediment got stuck together. What do you think happened to make real sediment stick?\"* (Expect: Pressure, minerals acting like glue, time.)\n\n2. **Extended Investigation:**\n   - Challenge students to compare **two different materials** (e.g., chalk vs. pebbles) and test which one weathers faster under running water. Students design a fair test, collect data, and present findings.\n   - Ask: *\"Can you predict what will happen to the rock in the photograph in 100 years? In 1,000 years? Make a comic strip showing the future.\"*\n\n3. **Real-World Application Project:**\n   - Research and present: *\"Where do rocks and gravel come from in our town? Where is the nearest quarry or mining site?\"* (Connects to natural resources.)\n   - Design a museum display or poster explaining how sedimentary rocks form, using their model as a visual aid.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Rock Timeline\" (1-2 class periods or homework)**\n   - Provide students with images of rocks at different stages of erosion (fresh/intact → weathered → nearly dissolved).\n   - Students arrange them in order and write captions explaining what happened: *\"First, the rock was solid. Then, water started to wear it away. Finally, it became broken pieces.\"*\n   - Display as a hallway poster to teach other classes.\n\n2. **\"Layers in Food\" (30 minutes; cross-curricular with nutrition)**\n   - Bring in or have students bring layered foods: sandwiches, cakes, lasagna, parfaits.\n   - Students describe the layers, predict which layers might \"erode\" (get soggy/break down first), and test: Which layer dissolves in water first?\n   - Reflect: *\"Food layers and rock layers both stack up. How are they the same? Different?\"*\n   - (This reinforces layering concepts through a familiar, safe context.)\n\n3. **\"Our Local Rocks\" (Ongoing; outdoor investigation)**\n   - Take students on a **walking field trip** around the school or nearby area.\n   - Collect safe, small rocks and look for evidence of erosion, weathering, or layering.\n   - Create a **classroom rock collection** with labels: *\"Where we found it, What it looks like, What happened to it.\"*\n   - Compare to the photograph: *\"Are our rocks similar to the one in the photo? How?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Summary for Teacher Implementation\n\n**This lesson moves students through a complete 5E cycle centered on the layered rock photograph.** Students actively build understanding by creating a model, observing erosion firsthand, connecting to real-world examples, and applying vocabulary in meaningful contexts. The lesson aligns with 3-ESS2-1 (observation and recording) and introduces concepts central to 3-ESS3-1 (resources and design).\n\n**Key success factors:**\n- Allow plenty of time for **hands-on exploration**—students need to feel water moving sediment to internalize erosion.\n- Use the **photograph repeatedly** to anchor abstract concepts to concrete evidence.\n- **Circulate and listen** during Explore to catch misconceptions and ask productive questions.\n- Celebrate **observations and predictions** before introducing formal vocabulary—this builds confidence and engagement.\n\nThe differentiation strategies ensure all learners can access the core concepts while advanced students deepen their thinking. Rock science is both visible and immediately testable in the classroom—use that power to create genuine curiosity and scientific thinking in your third graders.",
