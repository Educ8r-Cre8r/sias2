  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Observing Dawn and Earth's Waters\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Water in Multiple Forms:** The visible mist/fog represents water vapor in the air and demonstrates that water exists as a gas and can be seen in the atmosphere; the water body visible on the left shows water in liquid form.\n- **Weather and Atmosphere:** The dawn scene shows how atmospheric conditions change over time—the color gradients and fog formation illustrate weather patterns that occur naturally on Earth.\n- **Landforms and Water Bodies:** The photograph clearly shows the relationship between land (the cultivated field and raised earth in the foreground) and water (the river or water body in the distance), demonstrating how water and land coexist in landscapes.\n- **Daily Changes on Earth:** The progression from dark to light illustrates how Earth rotates and causes day-night cycles, showing students that Earth events happen regularly and observably.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Where Does Water Hide? A Dawn Investigation**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or 80-90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-ESS2-3: Obtain information to identify where water is found on Earth and that it can be solid or liquid.\n  - 2-ESS1-1: Use information from several sources to provide evidence that Earth events can occur quickly or slowly.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify water in different forms (liquid and gas/vapor) in the photograph and in their environment.\n2. Describe where water is found on Earth using evidence from observations.\n3. Explain that water can change forms and that these changes happen naturally on Earth.\n4. Record observations about atmospheric water using pictures and words.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about water and its visible and invisible forms.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected photograph (or large printed copy)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: a small mirror or clear cup\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Show students the dawn image on a projector or large screen. Keep it displayed for the entire discussion. Ask them to look carefully without talking for 15-20 seconds.\n\n2. **Guiding Questions (ask one at a time, allow think-pair-share before responses):**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe the colors and shapes.\"\n   - \"Do you see any water in this picture? Where is it?\" (Guide them to notice the water on the left, the misty/foggy areas, and the wet-looking field.)\n   - \"What is that whitish, cloudy stuff floating above the field? Have you seen something like that before?\"\n   - \"If we could touch that misty air, what do you think it would feel like? Would it be wet or dry?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... where does all that misty, wet air come from? Is it water, or something else? Let's be scientists and figure it out!\"\n\n4. **Create a \"Wonder Wall\":** Write student questions and predictions on chart paper. Don't answer yet—tell them they'll investigate to find the answers.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to do an experiment to see how water moves and hides in the air, just like in this dawn picture.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover that water can be invisible (vapor) in the air and visible (liquid) on surfaces through hands-on observation and simple investigation.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Clear plastic cups (at least 3-4 per group)\n- Warm water (teacher-prepared, in a basin or kettle—NOT boiling; warm to touch)\n- Ice cubes\n- Paper towels\n- Small mirrors or plastic wrap\n- Observation journals or large index cards\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Digital thermometer (optional, one per class)\n\n**Activity (Teacher Demonstration + Student Investigation):**\n\n**Part 1: Teacher Demonstration (5 minutes)**\n1. Fill a cup halfway with warm water and place it where all students can see.\n2. Hold a clear mirror or plastic wrap a few inches above the water surface (do NOT touch it to the water).\n3. Ask: \"What do you see happening to the mirror/plastic?\"\n4. Wait 30-45 seconds. Students will observe condensation forming on the mirror—small water droplets appearing.\n5. Say: \"The warm water is sending invisible water into the air. When it hits the cold mirror, it turns back into tiny drops we can see! This invisible water in the air is called water vapor.\"\n\n**Part 2: Student Investigation (15-20 minutes)**\n\nDivide students into pairs or small groups. Each group receives materials and follows these steps:\n\n1. **Step 1 - Warm Water Observation:** \n   - Pour warm water into a clear cup (about 1-2 inches deep).\n   - Place the cup in the center of your investigation area.\n   - Observe for 1 minute. Can you see anything leaving the water and going into the air? (Students should notice steam or the subtle mist.)\n   - Draw what you see in your observation journal.\n\n2. **Step 2 - The Mirror Trick:**\n   - Carefully hold a cold mirror or plastic wrap about 3 inches above the warm water.\n   - Do NOT let it touch the water.\n   - Watch for 2-3 minutes. What appears on the mirror?\n   - Draw or write: \"I see _____ on the mirror. It looks like _____.\"\n\n3. **Step 3 - The Ice Cup Experiment:**\n   - Fill a second cup with ice cubes (or cold water).\n   - Hold this cold cup near (but not touching) the warm water cup.\n   - After 1-2 minutes, look at the outside of the cold cup. What happened?\n   - Record: \"The cold cup got _____ on the outside.\"\n\n4. **Step 4 - Comparison Sketch:**\n   - Draw two cups side by side: one warm, one cold.\n   - Label where you saw water in each one.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups without giving direct answers.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What did you notice?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\" \"Where did the water come from?\"\n- Prompt students to touch surfaces gently to feel if they're wet.\n- Ensure safety (warm water is warm, not hot; supervise all interactions).\n- Encourage groups to whisper their observations to each other before recording.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that warm water creates moisture in the air.\n- Students discover that cold surfaces collect water droplets (condensation).\n- Students record observations in words and pictures.\n- Students make connections between the warm water experiment and the misty air in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect observations to formal concepts about water on Earth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Projected photograph (display again)\n- Picture cards or hand-drawn illustrations of: water droplets, water vapor, ice, liquid water, clouds, fog, rain\n- Index cards for vocabulary\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 pairs to share one observation from their investigation.\n   - Write their observations on a class chart under the heading: \"Where We Found Water.\"\n   - Example responses: \"Water came out of the warm water,\" \"The mirror got wet,\" \"The cold cup got wet on the outside.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n   - Display each term on a card with a simple, labeled drawing. Define in student-friendly language:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Liquid Water:** Water you can see and pour. It's wet and feels cold. (Show picture of water in a cup, the river in the photograph.)\n   - **Water Vapor:** Water that floats in the air as an invisible gas. You can't see it, but it's there. (Show drawing of invisible arrows rising from water.)\n   - **Condensation:** When water vapor turns back into tiny drops of liquid water. This happens when vapor touches something cold. (Show the mirror from the experiment or a window on a cold day.)\n   - **Fog/Mist:** Tiny water droplets floating in the air near the ground. (Point to the foggy areas in the photograph—this is what students saw in their experiment!)\n   - **Water on Earth:** Water is found everywhere—in oceans, rivers, lakes, clouds, rain, ice, and even in the air.\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (4-5 minutes):**\n   - Display the dawn photograph again.\n   - Point to the misty areas: \"This fog is the same thing we made in our experiment! Water vapor from the river rose into the cool morning air and turned into tiny droplets. That's why we can see it as fog.\"\n   - Point to the water body on the left: \"That's liquid water—a river. The water in liquid form and the water in vapor form are both in this picture.\"\n   - Point to the field: \"The soil and plants might have water droplets on them from the fog, too.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students to show thumbs up/middle/down to these questions:\n     - \"Is water vapor something we can see?\" (Down = No, correct!)\n     - \"Can liquid water change into water vapor?\" (Up = Yes, correct!)\n     - \"Does fog mean water is in the air?\" (Up = Yes, correct!)\n   - Clarify any misconceptions immediately with simple restatements.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the three forms of water (solid ice, liquid water, water vapor).\n- Students understand that water is found on Earth in many places and forms.\n- Students connect their experiment to real-world phenomena (fog, mist, condensation).\n- Students use new vocabulary in short sentences.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of water's location and forms to interpret a new scenario and create a model of the water cycle at ground level.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic bags or small terrariums (one per pair)\n- Damp soil or sand (collected or purchased)\n- Small plants or grass seeds (optional; can use colored paper instead)\n- Water in small spray bottles\n- Tape\n- Observation journals\n- Optional: Digital camera or iPad to document changes\n\n**Activity: \"Creating a Mini Water Cycle\"**\n\n1. **Introduction (3 minutes):**\n   - \"In the photograph, we saw water moving from the river into the air. Let's make a tiny version of this right here in the classroom. We'll create a mini water cycle in a bag!\"\n\n2. **Student Instructions (12-15 minutes):**\n\n   **Step 1 - Build Your Bag:**\n   - Place a handful of damp soil in the bottom of a clear plastic bag.\n   - Lightly spray the soil with water (3-4 mists). It should be damp but not soaking.\n   - Optional: Plant a small seed or place a cutting of grass in the soil.\n   - Fold the top of the bag and seal it with tape.\n\n   **Step 2 - Prediction:**\n   - Draw and write in your journal: \"I predict that in the next few days, _____ will happen inside the bag.\"\n   - (Students might predict: water will appear on the sides, something will grow, it will get wet, etc.)\n\n   **Step 3 - Observation:**\n   - Place the bag in a sunny (but not too hot) window.\n   - Over the next 3-5 days, observe once daily.\n   - Draw what you see inside the bag each day.\n   - Write labels: \"Is it wet inside? Where is the water?\"\n\n   **Step 4 - Connection:**\n   - After 2-3 days (or when students observe water droplets forming on the bag's sides), gather together.\n   - Ask: \"What do you see on the inside of the bag? Where did that water come from? Is this like what happened in the photograph?\"\n\n3. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Prepare bags with students, ensuring they understand: the soil has water, plants release water, water rises as vapor, and when it touches the cool plastic, it condenses into droplets.\n   - Use this as an extended observation activity throughout the next week.\n   - Take photos of the bags over days to show the cycle in action.\n   - Prompt with questions: \"Where is the water now? Can you find the water vapor?\" \"Is this like the fog in the dawn picture?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe water moving from soil and plants into the air (vapor) and back to droplets (condensation) in a confined space.\n- Students recognize that this mini cycle mirrors the water cycle in nature (as shown in the photograph).\n- Students make predictions and test them through observation over time.\n- Students deepen their understanding that water is constantly moving and changing forms on Earth.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of water's location, forms, and movement on Earth.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe student participation during the ENGAGE discussion and wonder wall contributions.\n- Circulate during EXPLORE and check observation journals for accuracy and detail.\n- During EXPLAIN, use thumbs up/middle/down for quick checks.\n- Ask individual students: \"Show me in the photograph where you see water. Is it liquid or vapor?\"\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (End of Session 1 or 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a small paper or digital form with these prompts (use drawings + words/dictation as appropriate for Second Grade):\n\n1. **Picture Identification:**\n   - Show a simple image (or describe): a cup of liquid water, fog, ice, a cloud.\n   - Ask: \"Which of these is water?\" (All are correct—reinforce that water appears in many forms.)\n\n2. **Open Response (Dictate or Draw):**\n   - \"Where did you see water in the dawn photograph? Draw it or tell me.\"\n   - Expected: Students identify the river (liquid), the fog (vapor), and possibly moist areas.\n\n3. **Concept Application:**\n   - \"In our experiment, the warm water sent invisible water into the air. What did we call that invisible water?\" \n   - Expected: \"Water vapor\" or \"vapor.\"\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - \"Have you seen fog or mist near your home or at the playground? Tell me about it.\"\n   - Expected: Students describe morning fog, bathroom mirrors getting wet, breath on glass, etc.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students can identify water in at least two different forms in the photograph.\n- Students use the term \"water vapor,\" \"condensation,\" or \"fog\" appropriately at least once.\n- Students make at least one connection between their experiment and observations in nature.\n- Students can explain that water is found on Earth in different places and forms (with teacher prompting if needed).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify liquid water and water vapor/fog in the photograph.\n- 75% of students can explain that water changes forms (with scaffolding).\n- All students can describe where they observed water during the investigation.\n- Students demonstrate understanding through drawings, words, and verbal explanations calibrated to Second Grade literacy levels.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Focus on just two forms—\"water you can see\" (liquid) and \"water in the air\" (vapor). Introduce \"fog\" as a visual example. Delay or simplify the term \"condensation\" for some learners.\n\n2. **Guided Exploration:** Pair with a strong peer or assign a small group guided by the teacher. Provide sentence starters: \"I see _____ on the mirror,\" \"The cold cup got _____ on the outside,\" \"In the photograph, the water is _____.\"\n\n3. **Concrete Visuals:** Provide large, labeled photographs or drawings showing water in different forms. Create a tactile anchor chart with images students can point to and touch.\n\n4. **Pre-Teaching:** Before the lesson, show the photograph and name one water source (the river, the mist). Ask: \"Can you find water here?\" This activates schema.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Inquiry:** Ask advanced students to design their own investigation: \"How can we make condensation happen faster? What happens if we use hotter water? Colder surfaces?\" Let them test variables and record results.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Deepening:** Introduce the term \"evaporation\" (water turning into vapor). Create a word chart with evaporation, condensation, and the water cycle. Have students explain the cycle in their own words orally or in writing.\n\n3. **Real-World Application:** Have advanced students research and report on where water is found on Earth (oceans, glaciers, groundwater, atmosphere). Create a simple poster or digital presentation showing different water sources.\n\n4. **Extended Observation:** Ask students to predict and monitor their mini water cycle more frequently (daily or multiple times per day) and create a time-lapse drawing series or photograph sequence showing changes over a week.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Water Detective\" Hunt (Classroom or Home):**\n   - Students search their classroom or home for evidence of water in different forms.\n   - They might find: a water fountain (liquid), a window with condensation (water vapor and condensation), ice in a freezer (solid), a plant (water storage), etc.\n   - Create a simple checklist or poster: \"Places We Found Water.\"\n   - Debrief: \"Water is everywhere on Earth!\"\n\n2. **Sunrise/Sunset Observation Journal:**\n   - Over one week, have students observe the sky at sunrise or sunset (with family or during outdoor time).\n   - Ask: \"Do you see fog, clouds, or mist? What colors do you see? Where is the water?\"\n   - Encourage simple sketches and one-word descriptions.\n   - Share observations in class and compare to the lesson photograph.\n\n3. **Water Cycle in a Bottle (Take-Home Activity):**\n   - Send home a sealed plastic bottle with a small amount of water, a few drops of food coloring, and a label: \"Observe your water cycle.\"\n   - Include simple parent instructions: \"Watch for condensation on the inside. Where does the water go? Where does it come from?\"\n   - Students bring back observations to share and connect to the lesson.\n\n---\n\n## **Teacher Implementation Notes**\n\n- **Safety:** Warm water should be warm to touch but never boiling. Supervise all water use. Ensure plastic bags are sealed securely and kept away from very small children (choking hazard).\n- **Timing:** This lesson naturally spans two sessions. Session 1 includes Engage, Explore, and Explain. Session 2 includes Elaborate (with ongoing observation) and Evaluate. The mini water cycle continues as an observation activity throughout the following week.\n- **Adaptations for Remote Learning:** If teaching remotely, provide families with materials (cups, warm water, mirrors, ice) for the Explore phase, or demonstrate on camera and have students follow along at home. Use shared digital platforms to collect observation photos/journals.\n- **Inclusion:** This lesson uses visual, kinesthetic, and verbal modalities. Provide sentence stems and vocabulary cards for English language learners. Allow non-readers to dictate observations to a peer or teacher.",
