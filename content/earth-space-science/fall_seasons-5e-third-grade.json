Discovering Fall's Colorful Secrets**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or 90 minutes total if combined)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - **3-ESS2-1:** Represent data in tables and graphical displays to describe typical weather conditions expected during a particular season.\n  - **3-ESS2-2:** Obtain and combine information to describe climates in different regions of the world.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Identify and describe** the typical weather conditions and observable changes that happen during autumn using evidence from photographs and real-world observations.\n2. **Collect and record** data about seasonal changes (leaf color, temperature, daylight) and organize this information in a table or graph.\n3. **Explain the relationship** between cooler temperatures, shorter days, and changes in plants during fall.\n4. **Compare autumn characteristics** in their local region with autumn characteristics in other parts of the world.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about autumn using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the fall leaves photograph (or printed large copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student observation recording sheet (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without context. Project it large on the board or pass around printed copies to small groups.\n\n2. **Ask students to observe in silence for 30 seconds.** Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. What do you notice? Don't tell anyone yet—just think.\"\n\n3. **Facilitate a \"Notice and Wonder\" discussion** using these specific questions:\n   - \"What colors do you see in this picture? Why might the leaves be so many different colors—red, yellow, orange, and brown?\"\n   - \"Why do you think there are so many leaves on the ground instead of on the trees?\"\n   - \"What season do you think this is? How can you tell?\"\n   - \"If I told you this photo was taken on a cool, breezy day, what might you feel if you were standing in this yard?\"\n\n4. **Record student responses** on chart paper with a \"What We Notice\" column and \"What We Wonder\" column. Affirm all observations without confirming accuracy.\n\n5. **Pose a prediction prompt:** \"We're going to figure out WHY this happens every year. I'm curious—do you think this happens everywhere on Earth, or only in some places? Turn and talk to a partner.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Let's become autumn scientists and investigate what really happens to leaves and weather when fall arrives.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate seasonal changes through hands-on observation and data collection.\n\n**Materials (per small group or pair):**\n- 3-5 real autumn leaves (or colored paper cutouts in fall colors if fresh leaves unavailable)\n- Thermometers\n- Simple data recording sheet (table with columns: Day, Temperature, Leaf Color, Leaf Condition)\n- Magnifying glasses\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Bag or envelope to collect leaves\n- Digital camera or smartphone (if available, for documentation)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide students into small groups (3-4 students).** Assign each group a different role:\n   - **Temperature Tracker:** Records temperature each day\n   - **Leaf Observer:** Examines leaves closely and describes changes\n   - **Data Recorder:** Writes or draws information on the recording sheet\n   - **Documenter:** Takes pictures or draws sketches\n\n2. **If outdoors (preferred):** Direct students to a grassy area with fallen leaves.\n   - \"Walk around and collect 5-10 fallen leaves from one spot. Look at the colors, feel the texture. Are they crispy? Soft? Wet?\"\n   - \"Look at trees nearby. Are there still leaves on the branches? How many?\"\n   - \"Measure the temperature with a thermometer if outdoors. Write it down.\"\n\n   **If indoors only:** Provide pre-collected leaves and a thermometer reading.\n\n3. **Have students examine leaves closely:**\n   - \"Use the magnifying glass. What do you notice about the edges? The colors? Are they all the same color or does each leaf have different colored spots?\"\n   - \"Compare leaves. Are some more broken down than others? Why might that be?\"\n\n4. **Students record observations** on their data sheet using drawings and words. Include simple sketch boxes for color representation.\n\n5. **Each group shares one leaf discovery** with another group to compare observations.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups asking guiding questions: \"What do you notice about how this leaf feels? What colors do you see? If this leaf fell from a tree two weeks ago, what might have happened to it?\"\n- Resist giving answers; instead, ask students to look closer or compare.\n- Support recording by accepting drawings, labels, and invented spelling.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will collect observable data about leaf characteristics, temperature, and plant conditions.\n- Students will create a visual and written record of their observations.\n- Students will notice variations in leaf colors, textures, and stages of decay.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the science of seasonal change.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary and illustrations\n- Photograph on display\n- Student-created observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Visual anchor chart showing the four seasons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Invite groups to share findings.** Ask:\n   - \"What did you discover about the leaves? Show us your leaf and describe what you found.\"\n   - \"What was the temperature? Was it warm or cool?\"\n   - \"What did the leaves feel like? Look like?\"\n\n2. **Connect observations to seasons.** Say: \"All of these changes we observed—the colors, the cooler temperature, leaves falling—these things happen at a specific time of year called **autumn** or **fall**.\"\n\n3. **Teach key vocabulary** using the photograph and student observations as reference:\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|\n   | **Autumn (or Fall)** | The season when it gets cooler, leaves change colors, and fall from trees. It comes between summer and winter. |\n   | **Chlorophyll** | A green color that plants have in their leaves all year. When it gets cold, the green color goes away and we see other colors hidden underneath—red, yellow, and orange! |\n   | **Season** | A time of year with its own weather and patterns. There are four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. |\n   | **Weather** | What the air is like outside—hot, cold, rainy, sunny, windy, or snowy. |\n   | **Temperature** | How hot or cold something is. We measure it with a thermometer. |\n\n4. **Explain the cause-and-effect relationship:**\n   - Display the photograph while pointing to leaves.\n   - \"When summer ends, the days get shorter and the air gets cooler. Plants feel this change. Trees stop sending energy to their leaves because it's about to get very cold.\"\n   - \"When the green chlorophyll goes away, we see the other colors that were always there—yellows, reds, and oranges!\"\n   - \"Soon, the leaves get too weak to stay on the tree, and they fall. All of these leaves we found on the ground fell because of the cool weather and shorter days.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Why did the leaves in our photo turn yellow and red?\" (Chlorophyll color faded, revealing other colors underneath.)\n   - \"What makes this happen?\" (Cooler temperatures and shorter days.)\n   - \"Is this a weather change or a season change?\" (Both—the change in weather defines the season.)\n\n**Vocabulary Reference Chart (posted in classroom for remainder of lesson):**\n- Create an anchor chart with the 5 vocabulary terms with illustrations and definitions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that autumn is a season with predictable characteristics (cool weather, falling leaves, color changes).\n- Students can explain that temperature and daylight changes trigger plant responses.\n- Students can use vocabulary terms (autumn, season, weather, temperature) correctly.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by comparing seasonal patterns across regions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photographs or illustrations of autumn in 2-3 different regions (e.g., local area, tropical region, northern region—see note below)\n- Comparison chart template (2-3 columns: \"Our Autumn\" / \"Autumn in [Region]\")\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: Short video clip (2-3 min.) showing fall in a different climate region\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the concept:** Say: \"We learned that autumn happens when it gets cool and days get shorter. But does autumn look the same everywhere on Earth?\"\n\n2. **Show images of autumn in a contrasting region:**\n   - Display your local autumn photo (similar to the lesson photograph).\n   - Display autumn in a warm/tropical region where leaves don't change colors as dramatically (or where the transition is different).\n   - Discuss: \"In some places, fall leaves turn beautiful colors like we saw. In other places, it's always warm, or the weather changes differently.\"\n\n3. **Guided comparison activity:**\n   - \"Let's compare autumn where we live to autumn in another place.\"\n   - Show students a simple 2-column chart with images.\n   - Ask: \"What's the same about fall in both places? What's different?\"\n   - Record responses: Same (it's a season, weather changes), Different (temperature, leaf colors, what happens to plants).\n\n4. **Create a class comparison poster:**\n   - Title: \"Autumn Around the World\"\n   - Use drawings, words, and photos to show how fall is similar and different in 2-3 locations.\n   - Students contribute ideas and illustrations.\n\n5. **Real-world connection:** \n   - \"If you had a pen pal in [tropical country], how would you describe what autumn looks like here? What would surprise them?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to notice that while autumn happens most dramatically in cooler places, seasonal changes occur everywhere.\n- Use questioning to push thinking: \"Why might fall look different in a warm place? What do you think happens to trees if it's always warm?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that seasonal patterns vary by region and climate.\n- Students can compare and contrast seasonal characteristics across locations.\n- Students begin to understand climate as a broader pattern of weather conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of seasonal changes and weather patterns.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student participation during \"Notice and Wonder\" discussion.\n- Review observation data sheets from Explore phase—check that students recorded colors, temperatures, and leaf conditions.\n- Listen to group explanations during Explain phase—do students use vocabulary correctly and show understanding of cause-and-effect?\n- Monitor Elaborate activity—can students identify similarities and differences between regions?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nDisplay or read these questions aloud. Students respond using words and/or drawings on a half-sheet of paper:\n\n1. **\"What is autumn? Describe what happens to leaves and the weather in fall.\"**\n   - *Look for:* Mention of cooler temperatures, leaf color changes, leaves falling, shorter days.\n\n2. **\"Why do leaves change colors?\"**\n   - *Look for:* Reference to chlorophyll fading, hidden colors showing through, or temperature/weather causing the change.\n\n3. **\"Draw or write: What would you see, feel, and notice if you were standing in the picture we looked at today?\"**\n   - *Look for:* Sensory details that show understanding of fall conditions (cool, colorful, windy, crispy leaves, etc.).\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ **Developing:** Student identifies at least 2 fall characteristics (e.g., cooler weather, falling leaves).\n- ✓ **Proficient:** Student describes 3+ fall characteristics AND explains a cause (e.g., cooler weather causes leaves to change).\n- ✓ **Advanced:** Student compares fall conditions and explains regional differences OR uses multiple vocabulary terms correctly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that autumn is a season with predictable characteristics.\n- Students explain the relationship between weather (temperature, daylight) and observable plant changes.\n- Students can represent their understanding through drawings, written descriptions, and verbal explanations.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Cards:** Provide picture cards with single words (cool, leaves, color) during Explain phase. Students match words to images from the photograph.\n\n2. **Guided Data Recording:** Offer a pre-drawn table with visual symbols (thermometer icon, leaf icon) and blanks to fill in. Model the first entry together before independent work.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Exit Ticket:** Provide sentence starters:\n   - \"Autumn is when the weather gets ___ and leaves turn ___.\"\n   - \"Leaves change color because ___.\"\n   - \"If I was in this picture, I would feel ___ and see ___.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research Extension:** \"Why do some trees lose all their leaves while others stay green all year? Find out what evergreen trees are and explain why they're different.\"\n\n2. **Climate Comparison Deep Dive:** Provide 3-4 different regional autumn photos. Create a detailed comparison chart showing temperature ranges, hours of daylight, and plant responses. Predict what autumn would be like in a place students choose (e.g., Australia, Hawaii).\n\n3. **Seasonal Data Graphing:** Collect temperature data over 1-2 weeks of autumn and create a bar graph or line graph showing temperature changes. Write a simple conclusion: \"Is autumn getting colder every day? How do you know?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Leaf Color Chemistry Exploration:** Collect leaves and use coffee filters and rubbing alcohol to separate pigments and reveal hidden colors. Document which colors appear and discuss how this proves that red, yellow, and orange colors were always in the leaf, hidden under the green chlorophyll.\n\n2. **Seasonal Weather Prediction Chart:** Create a classroom \"Seasonal Pattern Tracker.\" Students predict typical weather for each season (temperature range, rainfall, daylight hours) based on their own observations and research. Update monthly and discuss patterns.\n\n3. **\"Then and Now\" Autumn Photo Series:** Take photos of the same outdoor location (school grounds, neighborhood tree, park) weekly throughout fall. Create a digital or poster timeline showing how the landscape changes from early fall to late fall. Write captions explaining what seasonal changes are visible in each photo.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n**Safety Considerations:**\n- If outdoors collecting leaves, establish clear boundaries and ensure students stay visible.\n- Ensure thermometers are plastic or low-mercury versions safe for student use.\n- Check for allergies before using natural materials.\n\n**Real-World Connection:**\nConsider inviting a local groundskeeper, park ranger, or arborist to explain why they rake leaves or how seasons affect their work managing outdoor spaces.\n\n**Assessment Documentation:**\nKeep student observation sheets, exit tickets, and comparison charts in a science portfolio to track student growth in understanding seasonal patterns over the school year.",
