Identify and describe how the four Earth systems (geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere) interact in a city environment.\n2. Explain how human communities modify Earth's surface and why protecting natural resources is important.\n3. Create a model or diagram showing how water, air, rock/soil, and living things work together in an urban setting.\n4. Propose at least one way their community can better protect or conserve Earth's natural resources.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about cities and Earth systems using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the city skyline (e.g., Houston skyline photo)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster where all students can see clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What do you notice in this picture? What things do you see?\" *(Students identify buildings, water, sky, trees, bridge.)*\n   - \"Where do you think this city gets its water from? Can you point to where water might be?\" *(Guide them to notice the river/waterway.)*\n   - \"Why did people decide to build a city in this spot? What resources do you think were here?\" *(Elicit: water for drinking, flat land, transportation.)*\n   - \"What would happen to the animals and plants that lived here before the buildings were built?\" *(Create cognitive dissonance—buildings replace natural habitats.)*\n\n3. **Present the Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if this city is built on Earth, how do the four parts of Earth—the rocks and soil beneath, the water around it, the air above, and the living things—all work together to keep this city alive?\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper. Celebrate curiosity; don't correct misconceptions yet.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become Earth system detectives. We'll investigate how cities depend on all four of Earth's systems—and what we need to do to protect them.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate Earth systems by analyzing the photograph and conducting a model-building activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Copies of the city skyline photograph (one per pair or small group)\n- Large sheets of paper (11\" × 14\")\n- Colored pencils, markers\n- Four small paper labels: \"Geosphere,\" \"Hydrosphere,\" \"Atmosphere,\" \"Biosphere\"\n- Optional: small physical models (pebbles, water in cups, cotton balls, plant sprigs, toy buildings)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Photograph Analysis (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute copies** of the city skyline photograph to each pair or small group.\n\n2. **Give each group the four labels** and ask them to:\n   - Circle or point to parts of the photograph that belong to the **Geosphere** (rocks, soil, ground, buildings made of stone/materials from Earth).\n   - Draw arrows to the **Hydrosphere** (water—river, water that flows under the city).\n   - Shade the **Atmosphere** (the sky, air above).\n   - Mark the **Biosphere** (trees, grass, any living things visible).\n\n3. **Ask students to discuss in pairs:** \"How do you think each system helps the other systems?\" Encourage them to make predictions, not to have \"correct\" answers.\n\n4. **Teacher circulates** and asks probing questions: \"Why would the river be important to a city?\" \"Where does the water go after people use it?\" \"What about the trees—why are they still here?\"\n\n**Part B: Interactive Model Building (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute large paper sheets.** Ask students to sketch a simplified side-view (cross-section) of \"their city\":\n   - **Bottom layer:** Geosphere (rocks, soil, underground).\n   - **Next layer:** Buildings, roads (made of geosphere materials).\n   - **Vertical feature:** River or water source.\n   - **Sky area:** Atmosphere and sun.\n   - **Plants/trees:** Biosphere.\n\n2. **Students label and draw arrows** showing:\n   - How water moves (up from underground, in river, to the sky).\n   - How the sun's energy affects the city (heat, shadows, growth of plants).\n   - How buildings depend on rock and soil.\n   - How plants need water, air, and sun.\n\n3. **Option for kinesthetic learners:** Using small objects (pebbles for geosphere, water in a cup for hydrosphere, cotton balls for clouds, toy trees), create a 3D model on the paper.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"What would happen if this river dried up?\" \"Where does rain go in a city?\" \"Can plants grow without soil?\"\n- Do not tell students the answers; instead, guide them to discover connections.\n- Record observations of student thinking for the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should produce a labeled diagram or model showing where the four Earth systems are.\n- Students should verbally identify at least 2–3 connections between systems (e.g., \"River gives water to people,\" \"Sun makes shadows,\" \"Trees need soil and water\").\n- Students may not yet understand the *mechanism* of interaction, but they should see that systems are present and related.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts about Earth systems interactions and human impact.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original city photograph (projected again)\n- Poster or slide with key vocabulary and definitions\n- Small whiteboard or chart paper for teacher modeling\n- Student notebooks or science journals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Conduct a group share-out** (5 minutes):\n   - Ask 2–3 pairs to briefly show their diagrams/models.\n   - Ask the class: \"What patterns do you notice? What do all these diagrams show?\" *(Elicit: systems are connected; humans use natural resources.)*\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly explanations (written on board or poster; keep visible):\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Geosphere** | The solid, rocky part of Earth—rocks, soil, and the hard materials that make up the ground and mountains. |\n| **Hydrosphere** | All the water on Earth—oceans, rivers, lakes, underground water, and water in clouds. |\n| **Atmosphere** | The invisible layer of air surrounding Earth that we breathe; it also holds water and helps keep our planet warm. |\n| **Biosphere** | All the living things on Earth—plants, animals, and people—and the places where they live. |\n| **Interact / Interaction** | When two things affect each other or work together; they need each other to survive. |\n| **Natural Resources** | Things from nature that people use, like water, soil, rocks, trees, and air. |\n\n3. **Explain Earth systems in the city** (8–10 minutes):\n\n   Use the photograph to model thinking:\n   - **\"In this city, the geosphere is the foundation.**\" Point to buildings and ground. \"All these buildings are made of materials that came from Earth's rocks and minerals. But people had to dig up soil and move land to build. What do you notice is missing now?\" *(The natural landscape has changed.)*\n   \n   - **\"The hydrosphere is critical.**\" Point to the river. \"Cities need water to drink, to grow food, to cool buildings. But cities also create pollution that goes into this water. The river has to filter and move that water away.\"\n   \n   - **\"The atmosphere surrounds the whole city.**\" Point to the sky. \"The sun heats the city. The air carries pollution from cars and factories. Rain falls from clouds—that's water from the hydrosphere moving through the atmosphere.\"\n   \n   - **\"The biosphere is squeezed into small spaces.**\" Point to trees and green areas. \"Plants and animals used to cover all this land. Now they live only in parks and gardens. But they're still important—trees clean the air and provide shade.\"\n   \n   - **\"These systems interact constantly.**\" Draw a simple web on the board:\n     - Geosphere (soil/rock) → supports buildings and plants\n     - Plants (biosphere) → need soil (geosphere), water (hydrosphere), air and sun (atmosphere)\n     - Water (hydrosphere) → comes from sky (atmosphere), flows over land (geosphere), used by living things (biosphere)\n     - Atmosphere → delivers rain, carries away pollution, brings sun's energy to all systems\n\n4. **Introduce human impact and resource protection** (5 minutes):\n   - \"Cities are built by people who need Earth's resources. But when we use resources, we have to be careful. We can't just take and take—we need to protect and restore.\"\n   - Example: \"This city needs clean water. If we pollute the river, the hydrosphere is damaged. If we remove all the trees, the biosphere is damaged. But if we protect the river and plant more trees, we help all four systems.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can you name the four Earth systems?\" (Quick popcorn responses.)\n   - Ask: \"If a city cut down all its trees, which systems would be affected?\" *(Biosphere directly; atmosphere would have less air cleaning; geosphere would lose roots holding soil; hydrosphere would have more runoff.)*\n   - Observe: Do students understand that systems are connected?\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and define the four Earth systems.\n- Students can point to examples of each system in the photograph.\n- Students understand that systems interact (are interdependent).\n- Students recognize that cities impact natural systems, and protection is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a sustainable city and identifying community resource-protection strategies.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheets of paper (11\" × 14\") or poster board\n- Colored pencils, markers, magazines for collage (optional)\n- Rulers\n- Access to the photograph for reference\n- Optional: \"Community Action\" photo cards or examples of real cities protecting resources\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Design a Sustainable City (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge:** \"Imagine you are a city planner. You need to build a new city that provides homes and jobs for people BUT also protects all four Earth systems. How would you design it?\"\n\n2. **Provide design constraints:**\n   - The city must have housing and buildings.\n   - There must be a water source (river, lake, or managed water system).\n   - At least 25% of the city must be green space (parks, gardens, trees).\n   - There must be a way to manage waste and pollution.\n   - People must be able to move around (roads, transportation).\n\n3. **Students work individually or in pairs** to sketch or create a labeled diagram of their \"sustainable city.\" They should:\n   - Show all four Earth systems clearly labeled.\n   - Include at least one way each system is protected or conserved.\n   - Use color and labels to explain their choices.\n\n4. **Examples to prompt thinking:**\n   - \"Where will drinking water come from, and how do you keep it clean?\"\n   - \"How will you protect the soil and plants?\"\n   - \"How will you keep the air clean?\"\n   - \"Where will trash and water from buildings go?\"\n\n**Part B: Community Action Plan (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show examples** (photos, slides, or descriptions) of real communities protecting resources:\n   - City parks that filter rainwater naturally\n   - Green roofs on buildings\n   - Protected river corridors\n   - Community gardens\n   - Recycling and composting programs\n\n2. **Ask students:** \"What is one thing your *actual* community could do to better protect Earth's systems?\"\n\n3. **Have students write or draw one action** in their science notebook:\n   - \"Our school/city could _________ to protect the _________ [system] because _________.\"\n   - Example: \"Our city could plant more trees in downtown areas to protect the biosphere because trees clean the air and help water stay in the ground.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Tell me why you put that green space there.\" \"How does this protect the water?\" \"What would happen if you didn't include this?\"\n- Encourage creative thinking; there is no single \"right\" design.\n- Note student reasoning for assessment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce a labeled diagram or model of a sustainable city showing understanding of all four systems.\n- Students identify at least one specific way humans can protect or restore each system.\n- Students propose a realistic, community-level action aligned with their learning.\n- Drawings/writing show causal thinking: \"If we do X, then system Y will benefit.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of Earth systems interactions and human resource stewardship.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Do students identify locations of the four systems in the photograph?\n- **Questioning during Explain:** Can students name systems and give examples from the city?\n- **Participation in Elaborate:** Do student designs show understanding of interdependence? Do explanations show reasoning?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5–7 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with a card or slip of paper. They respond to **one of the following** (or all three, depending on time):\n\n1. **\"Draw and label the four Earth systems in a city. Show one way they interact.\"**\n   - **Success Criteria:** All four systems are labeled correctly and in appropriate locations. At least one arrow or connection shows interaction (e.g., water from hydrosphere helps biosphere grow).\n\n2. **\"Fill in the blanks:**\n   - \"The _________ is where buildings and rocks are.\"\n   - \"The _________ is all the water on Earth.\"\n   - \"The _________ is the air we breathe.\"\n   - \"The _________ is all the living things.\"\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student correctly identifies all four systems (3–4 out of 4 correct).\n\n3. **\"Cities depend on Earth's resources. Name one resource a city needs and explain why protecting it is important.\"**\n   - Example: \"Cities need clean water because people drink it and use it to grow food. We need to protect the river by not polluting it.\"\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student names a resource AND provides a reason related to human or environmental need AND identifies a protection strategy.\n\n**Exit Ticket Scoring:**\n- **Proficient:** Student correctly identifies and explains ≥3 of the 4 systems; shows evidence of understanding interaction.\n- **Developing:** Student identifies and explains 2 systems; interaction understanding is emerging.\n- **Beginning:** Student identifies ≤1 system OR explanations lack clarity or accuracy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- ≥80% of students correctly identify and label all four Earth systems.\n- ≥75% of students describe or show at least one interaction between systems.\n- ≥70% of students propose a specific, realistic action to protect or conserve a resource.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Scaffolding for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce cognitive load with a pre-labeled diagram:**\n   - Provide a simplified, pre-drawn cross-section of a city (geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere areas already outlined).\n   - Student task: Color each section, label it, and draw 2–3 things that live/exist in that system.\n   - This removes the design challenge but keeps the conceptual learning intact.\n\n2. **Use a word bank and sentence frames:**\n   - Provide labels: *geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, interact, water, air, rock, plants, animals.*\n   - Provide sentence frames: \"The _________ is made of _________.\" \"The _________ needs _________ to survive.\"\n   - Students select and write, not generate from scratch.\n\n3. **Pair with a strong peer for Explore and Elaborate activities:**\n   - Pair struggling student with a patient, articulate peer.\n   - Assign roles: struggling student is \"illustrator/pointer,\" peer is \"explainer.\"\n   - This allows participation without language/fine-motor barriers.\n\n### Challenge (Extensions for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Introduce the water cycle explicitly:**\n   - Advanced students predict and diagram: \"How does water move through a city?\" Evaporation from river → atmosphere, condensation in clouds, precipitation as rain, infiltration into soil, use by organisms, human water systems (pipes, treatment).\n   - Prompt: \"How do cities change the natural water cycle?\"\n\n2. **Research a real city's resource challenges and solutions:**\n   - Provide articles or videos about cities facing water scarcity, air pollution, habitat loss, etc. (e.g., Los Angeles water crisis, Singapore's urban forest initiative, Paris green spaces).\n   - Student task: Identify the Earth system problem and describe the community's solution.\n   - Share findings with the class or create a brief presentation.\n\n3. **Design a model for testing:**\n   - Challenge: Create a working model (using sand/soil, water, plants in containers) showing:\n     - How rain infiltrates soil (geosphere + hydrosphere interaction)\n     - How plants affect water retention (biosphere + hydrosphere)\n     - How to measure/predict outcomes\n   - Conduct the experiment, observe, and report results.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Local Community Audit:**\n   - Take students on a nature walk or field trip around the school or neighborhood.\n   - Ask: \"Can you spot the four Earth systems here? Is this area protecting them?\"\n   - Create a class \"Community Resource Map\": Mark locations where water, green space, and natural areas are (or are missing).\n   - Discuss: \"What could we do to improve this area?\"\n\n2. **Build a Rain Garden Model or Rainwater Collection System:**\n   - Design and construct a simple rain garden or downspout diverter system for the school.\n   - Purpose: Show how water (hydrosphere) and soil (geosphere) interact to naturally filter rainwater, reducing pollution runoff and recharging groundwater.\n   - Students measure water infiltration and document the impact on the biosphere (plants watered naturally).\n\n3. **Create an Illustrated \"City Systems Handbook\":**\n   - Students create a multi-page digital or paper handbook for \"future city planners.\"\n   - Pages include: \"What Are Earth's Four Systems?\" \"How Systems Interact in Cities,\" \"Ways to Protect Water,\" \"Ways to Protect Air,\" \"Ways to Protect Soil and Land,\" \"Ways to Protect Living Things.\"\n   - Include illustrations, diagrams, and simple explanations.\n   - Share with younger grades as a teaching tool.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Tips & Notes\n\n- **Photograph Familiarity:** Show the city photo multiple times across all five phases. Each time, students notice new details and make deeper connections.\n- **Vocabulary Anchor:** Keep the four Earth systems definitions and a simple diagram posted throughout the unit. Reference it daily.\n- **Cultural Responsiveness:** If your school/community is urban, emphasize students' everyday observations. If rural, discuss how rural areas also depend on all four systems—just in different ways. Celebrate local examples.\n- **Safety Note:** If conducting the optional hands-on water infiltration or rain garden activity, ensure proper drainage and supervision to prevent slipping or overflow.\n- **Common Misconception:** Students may think cities are *separate from* nature. Reinforce: Cities are *built on and within* nature; they depend on Earth's systems and affect them in return.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is ready to teach.
