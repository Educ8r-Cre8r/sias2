The crops grown here will eventually become food for humans and animals, transferring energy through multiple trophic levels in ecosystems.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: \"Soil is just dirt and doesn't contain living things.\"\n   **Clarification**: Healthy soil is full of living organisms like bacteria, fungi, worms, and insects that help plants grow.\n\n2. **Misconception**: \"Plants only need water and sunlight to grow.\"\n   **Clarification**: Plants also need nutrients from soil, carbon dioxide from air, and proper soil structure for root development.\n\n3. **Misconception**: \"Farming doesn't affect the environment.\"\n   **Clarification**: Farming practices can both positively and negatively impact soil health, water quality, and local ecosystems.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation**: 5-ESS3-1 - Obtain and combine information about ways individual communities use science ideas to protect the Earth's resources and environment.\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:5-ESS3.C]] - Human activities in agriculture can have positive and negative impacts on Earth's systems\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]] - A system can be described in terms of its components and their interactions\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] - Cause and effect relationships are routinely identified and used to explain change\n- **Science and Engineering Practices**: Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. \"How might this farming practice affect the soil differently in wet versus dry weather?\" (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n2. \"What would happen to our food supply if farmers couldn't use machines like tractors?\" (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n3. \"Compare the advantages and disadvantages of using heavy machinery on farmland.\" (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 2)\n\n4. \"Why do you think the farmer chose to work this field at this particular time?\" (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Agriculture:** The practice of growing crops and raising animals for food and other products.\n* **Soil preparation:** The process of getting soil ready for planting by breaking it up and mixing it.\n* **Tilling:** Breaking up and turning over soil using tools or machines.\n* **Seedbed:** Soil that has been prepared with the right conditions for seeds to sprout and grow.\n* **Natural resource:** Materials from nature that humans use, like soil, water, and minerals.\n* **Erosion:** The wearing away of soil by wind, water, or other natural forces.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- From Seed to Plant by Gail Gibbons\n- The Magic School Bus Meets the Rot Squad by Joanna Cole\n- Our Animal Friends at Maple Hill Farm by Alice Provensen\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- \"How Does a Seed Become a Plant?\" - Simple explanation of plant growth requirements and soil's role: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk_wCvvkzT0\n- \"Farming and Agriculture for Kids\" - Overview of modern farming practices and tools: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnNe2nj8gLs"
