ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate prior knowledge about rain and introduce the rain gauge as a measurement tool.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the rain gauge (displayed on screen or printed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: A clear cup or container\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** of the rain gauge on the board or screen. Point to the tool and ask: \"What do you see here? What is it measuring?\"\n\n2. **Ask discovery questions:**\n   - \"What happens when it rains outside? Where does the water go?\"\n   - \"Have you ever noticed that sometimes rain falls really hard and fast, and sometimes it falls very slowly? How could we know how much rain actually fell?\"\n   - \"What is this clear tube with numbers on it? What do you think it does?\"\n   - \"If we wanted to catch rain and measure it, what would we need?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to show you a tool called a rain gauge. Before we use it, what do you think it will help us find out about rain?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper for later comparison.\n\n**Transition:** \"Scientists use special tools to measure rain so they can understand weather better. Today, we're going to become rain detectives and learn how to use a rain gauge to track the rain in our area!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how a rain gauge works and begin collecting rainfall data.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One or more rain gauges (or DIY rain gauge made from a clear plastic cup with a ruler taped to the side)\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Small notebooks or data recording sheets (see template below)\n- Water (for demonstration)\n- Funnel (optional, for setup)\n- Outdoor access or window view\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: How the Rain Gauge Works (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Demonstrate the rain gauge** to the class. Point out:\n   - The clear tube that collects water\n   - The numbered measurements (inches or centimeters)\n   - The collection cup at the bottom\n\n2. **Show a simple demo:** Pour a small amount of water into a clear cup and measure it with a ruler. Ask: \"How high does the water reach? That's what the rain gauge does—it measures how much water collects from rain.\"\n\n3. **Allow students to observe the actual rain gauge** (or photograph). Have them notice:\n   - Where the water would go\n   - Why it needs to be outside to collect rain\n   - Why the numbers on the side are important\n\n4. **Ask:** \"Why do you think the opening at the top needs to be wide? Why can't we just use a closed jar?\"\n\n**Part B: Setting Up & First Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Place the rain gauge** in a safe outdoor location (or near a window if outdoor access is limited). If possible, have students help position it.\n\n2. **Record the starting measurement** together. Ask: \"What number is the water at right now? Let's write it down so we remember.\"\n\n3. **Give each student a data recording sheet** with:\n   - Date and time of observation\n   - Illustration space to draw the gauge\n   - Blank for \"Amount of rain: _____ inches/cm\"\n   - Space to write: \"Did the rain fall quickly or slowly?\"\n\n4. **Have students sketch** what the rain gauge looks like at the start, noting where the water level is.\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate while students observe and record. Ask guiding questions: \"What do the numbers tell us?\" \"What would happen if we left this out during a rainstorm?\" Avoid saying whether predictions are \"right\" or \"wrong.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students understand that the gauge collects water, can identify measurement markings, and have documented a baseline observation. They begin thinking about how to track changes.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary, explain how rain gauges work, and connect observations to Earth's water cycle.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: Simple diagram of rain gauge or water cycle illustration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students to review findings** from the Explore phase. Ask: \"What did we notice about our rain gauge? What did the numbers tell us?\"\n\n2. **Introduce and define key vocabulary** (write on chart paper with simple illustrations):\n\n   - **Precipitation:** Water that falls from clouds in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. (Show pictures of different types.)\n   - **Rain Gauge:** A tool that collects and measures how much rain has fallen.\n   - **Measurement:** Using a tool (like a ruler or the numbers on a gauge) to find out how much or how big something is.\n   - **Data:** Information we collect by observing and measuring.\n   - **Pattern:** Something that repeats or happens over and over.\n\n3. **Explain how the rain gauge works:**\n   - \"Rain falls from clouds in the sky. The rain gauge catches the rain in its wide opening.\"\n   - \"The water fills up inside the clear tube. The numbers on the side help us measure exactly how much water collected.\"\n   - \"By measuring the rain every day (or after each rainstorm), we can see how much rain our area gets. This helps scientists predict weather!\"\n\n4. **Connect to the photograph:** \"This is what we saw in our picture. The gauge was attached to a wooden fence so it could catch rain. The numbers let someone know whether it was a rainy week or a dry week.\"\n\n5. **Introduce quick/slow observation:**\n   - \"Some Earth events happen very fast—like a thunderstorm where lots of rain falls in minutes.\"\n   - \"Other Earth events happen slowly—like a light drizzle that takes all day.\"\n   - \"Our rain gauge helps us notice and measure both kinds!\"\n\n6. **Check for understanding:** \"Who can show me with your fingers how high the water would be if we had a lot of rain? What if we had just a little rain?\" (Have students show high vs. low with hand positions.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Precipitation:** Water falling from clouds (rain, snow, sleet, hail)\n- **Rain Gauge:** Tool to catch and measure rainfall\n- **Measurement:** Using tools to find how much of something there is\n- **Data:** Facts and numbers we collect by observing\n- **Pattern:** Something that happens again and again\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students understand what a rain gauge does, can use the vocabulary in context, and recognize that rain is measurable and predictable through data collection.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply measurement skills in a new context and predict rainfall patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large class graph template\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Student data sheets\n- Optional: Pictures of different weather events (heavy rain, drizzle, snow)\n- Calendar showing the week or month ahead\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Create a Class Rainfall Graph (Recommended for Day 2 after rain has occurred)**\n\n1. **If rain has fallen since the first observation,** gather students and measure the rain gauge together.\n\n2. **Record the new measurement** on the board. Ask: \"How much rain do we have now? Is it more than yesterday or the same?\"\n\n3. **Create a simple bar graph together:**\n   - Draw a grid on chart paper with days of the week on the bottom\n   - Use colored blocks or draw bars to show rainfall amounts\n   - Label the y-axis with measurements (0, 1, 2, 3 inches/cm)\n   - Add a title: \"Our Weekly Rainfall\"\n\n4. **Ask prediction questions:**\n   - \"Looking at our graph, when do you think we'll get more rain?\"\n   - \"Why might some days have no rain and other days have lots?\"\n   - \"If it rains all week, what will our graph look like?\"\n\n**Option B: Quick/Slow Rain Comparison (Alternative or simultaneous activity)**\n\n1. **Show pictures or describe two rainstorms:**\n   - Heavy thunderstorm (quick, lots of rain in a short time)\n   - Light drizzle (slow, small amount of rain over many hours)\n\n2. **Ask:** \"If a thunderstorm happened in 15 minutes, how high would our rain gauge go? If a drizzle lasted 6 hours, would the gauge be as full?\"\n\n3. **Have students draw two rain gauges:**\n   - One showing a \"quick\" rainstorm (high water level)\n   - One showing a \"slow\" rainstorm (lower water level)\n   - Label which is which and explain in 2-3 sentences why they drew them differently.\n\n**Teacher Role:** Facilitate discussion, ask \"Why?\" and \"How do you know?\" questions. Help students see that measuring rain tells us about Earth events. Encourage peer explanations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students create and interpret a simple graph, make predictions about rainfall, and demonstrate understanding that Earth events (rain) vary in speed and amount.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rain gauge use, precipitation measurement, and quick vs. slow Earth events.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing):**\n- Observe students during Explore: Can they use the rain gauge and record data?\n- Listen to explanations during Explain: Do they use vocabulary correctly?\n- Review drawings and graphs from Elaborate: Can they represent data visually?\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket or Observation Task:**\n\n**Option A: Exit Ticket (picture-based for early readers)**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet showing:\n1. A blank rain gauge drawing\n2. Three questions to answer (with picture choices or write/draw):\n   - \"What is this tool called?\" (rain gauge / thermometer / wind vane)\n   - \"Draw or show: How much rain do you think fell today?\" (draw water level)\n   - \"Was the rain quick or slow? How do you know?\" (draw or explain)\n\n**Option B: Teacher Observation Checklist**\n\nAs students work, note:\n- ☐ Student can identify the rain gauge and its purpose\n- ☐ Student can read or interpret measurements on the gauge\n- ☐ Student can record data on a sheet or graph\n- ☐ Student can describe rain as quick or slow\n- ☐ Student can predict what will happen with future rain\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students correctly identify the rain gauge as a weather measurement tool\n- Students can read or estimate the water level on a gauge\n- Students understand that rainfall can be measured and varies in amount\n- Students recognize that some rain falls quickly (heavy storms) and some falls slowly (light rain)\n- Students collect and organize data about rainfall\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students demonstrate they can use a rain gauge, measure precipitation, and recognize that Earth events (rainfall) vary in speed and quantity. They should be able to explain in simple terms why measuring rain helps us understand weather.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Data Sheet:** Provide a sheet with pictures instead of words. Students circle or point to the gauge measurement rather than writing numbers.\n\n2. **Paired Observation:** Pair a struggling learner with a peer or assign an aide to help read measurements and record data together.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a visual anchor chart with pictures of each vocabulary word (rain gauge, precipitation, measurement, data, pattern). Leave it posted throughout the lesson so students can reference it independently.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-Week Data Collection:** Challenge students to collect rainfall data for 2–4 weeks and identify real patterns. Ask: \"In which week did we get the most rain? Can you predict how much rain we'll get next week based on our data?\"\n\n2. **Comparison Activity:** Provide data from two different locations (e.g., your school vs. a nearby city). Have students compare: \"Which place gets more rain? Which gets less? Why might that be?\" (Introduce the idea that geography affects weather.)\n\n3. **Design a Better Gauge:** Ask: \"If our rain gauge broke, how would you design a new one? Draw or build one using materials in the classroom. What makes a good rain gauge?\" (Encourages critical thinking about measurement tools.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Classroom Weather Station Project:** Extend beyond rain by adding a simple thermometer and wind direction indicator. Have students create a daily weather report poster, combining temperature, rainfall, and wind observations. They can present findings to another class or post in the hallway.\n\n2. **Water in Different Forms:** Connect to 2-ESS2-3 by exploring precipitation in different forms. During winter, add a snow gauge (or mark snowfall on a ruler). Discuss: \"Is snow the same as rain? How is it different? Can we measure both?\" Create a chart showing rain, snow, sleet, and hail.\n\n3. **Rain Gauge Hunt & Compare:** Take students on a walk around the school or neighborhood to spot other rain gauges, weather instruments, or water collection tools (gutters, puddles, drainage). Have them photograph or sketch what they find and discuss: \"Why do scientists put gauges in different places? Would rainfall be different in the open field vs. under a tree?\"\n\n---",
