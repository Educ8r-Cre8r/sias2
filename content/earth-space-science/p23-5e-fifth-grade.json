ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how water shapes Earth by examining the dramatic erosion visible in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed copy of the photograph (or projector to display image)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or as a large printout. Ask students to observe silently for 20-30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (pause after each for think-pair-share):\n   - \"What do you notice about the water in this picture? Where did it come from, and where do you think it's going?\"\n   - \"Look at the light-colored gravel on the left and the darker, muddier area in the middle. What do you think caused the difference between these two areas?\"\n   - \"If you came back to this spot one year from now, do you think it would look the same? What might have changed?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen water do something like this—moving dirt or rocks—in your neighborhood, yard, or on a playground?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** On chart paper, write: *\"I wonder why moving water can pick up and move rocks and soil, and what this means for the land over time.\"* Invite students to add their own wonderings.\n\n4. **Teacher tip:** Accept all responses without judgment. The goal is to activate curiosity about water's power and get students thinking about cause-and-effect.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, you're going to become Earth scientists and create your own model of how water shapes the land—just like what we see in this photograph.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover how water erosion works through a hands-on model-building investigation.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 rectangular aluminum baking pan or shallow plastic storage bin (9\" × 13\" or larger)\n- 1 cup of soil (potting soil or garden soil)\n- 1 cup of sand (play sand or beach sand)\n- 1 cup of small pebbles or gravel (1/4\" to 1/2\" diameter)\n- 1 spray bottle filled with water\n- 1 small cup or pitcher of water\n- 1 wooden ruler\n- Paper towels\n- Data sheet (template provided below)\n- Camera or phone to document (optional)\n\n**Activity: \"Build Your Erosion Model\"**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and display on chart paper):**\n\n1. **Set up your model:** In your baking pan, create a \"landscape\" by piling soil, sand, and pebbles together on one side to form a slope or hill. Make it at least 4-5 inches high at the peak. Leave space on the other side for water to flow.\n\n2. **Observe your starting landscape:** Use the data sheet to sketch or describe what your model looks like before water touches it. Note the colors and arrangement of materials.\n\n3. **Predict:** Before you add water, predict what you think will happen when water flows down your slope. Write or draw your prediction.\n\n4. **Test with light water (spray):** Using the spray bottle, gently spray water on the peak of your slope. Observe for 1-2 minutes. What happens? Does water move the soil and rocks? Does the water separate the materials? Record what you observe.\n\n5. **Test with flowing water (pour):** Now pour a cup of water slowly down the slope from the highest point. Watch carefully as it flows. Where does the water go? What materials does it carry? Where do these materials end up? Sketch what happens.\n\n6. **Repeat and refine:** Pour more water if desired and observe additional changes. What happens to the slope's shape?\n\n7. **Measure and record:** Use the ruler to measure how much the slope has changed (e.g., \"The peak got 2 inches shorter\"). Look for sorted materials (small pieces in one place, larger ones in another).\n\n**Data Sheet Template:**\n```\nEROSION MODEL DATA SHEET\n\nGroup Names: _________________\n\nBEFORE WATER:\nSketch your landscape:\n[Space for drawing]\n\nPREDICTIONS: What do you think water will do?\n_________________________________________\n\nOBSERVATIONS:\n\nAfter spraying (light water):\nWhat changed? _______________________\n\nAfter pouring (flowing water):\nWhat changed? _______________________\n\nWhere did the materials end up?\n• Soil: _____________________________\n• Sand: _____________________________\n• Pebbles: ___________________________\n\nWhat surprised you? __________________\n```\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions rather than providing answers: *\"What materials moved first? Why might that be?\" \"Where did the biggest pieces end up? Where did the tiniest pieces go?\"*\n- Encourage careful observation and recording.\n- If a student says, \"It's just washing it away,\" ask, \"Where is it washing? Can you trace the path of the water?\"\n- Allow students time to experiment and adjust their models.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that water moves materials downslope.\n- Students discover that different-sized particles move different distances.\n- Students notice that the landscape changes shape.\n- Students create physical evidence (sketches, measurements, observations) that water has power to reshape Earth.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Connect observations to formal vocabulary and Earth system interactions using the photograph and student discoveries.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Digital slides or pictures showing examples of erosion\n- Vocabulary cards (written on index cards)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Invite 2-3 groups to briefly describe what happened in their models. Ask: *\"What did you notice was the same in each group's model? What was different?\"* Write observations on chart paper.\n\n2. **Make the connection (3 minutes):** Point back to the original photograph. Say: *\"Just like in your models, real water did this. The water you see in this picture has been moving soil and rocks, creating pathways and changing the shape of the land—that's exactly what your water did to your models.\"*\n\n3. **Introduce and define key vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Erosion** | The process where water, wind, or ice picks up and carries away soil and rock particles, moving them to new locations. |\n| **Weathering** | The breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by water, wind, ice, or other forces. (In this lesson, water is the main weatherer.) |\n| **Sediment** | Small pieces of rock and soil that are carried by water or wind and eventually settle in a new place. |\n| **Geosphere** | All the solid parts of Earth—rocks, soil, mountains, and the ground beneath us. |\n| **Hydrosphere** | All the water on Earth—oceans, rivers, rain, groundwater, and even water in soil. |\n\n   **Teach these terms using the photograph and student models:**\n   - Point to the flowing water in the photo: \"That's the **hydrosphere** doing work.\"\n   - Point to the soil and gravel: \"That's the **geosphere**.\"\n   - Point to the muddy water: \"See how brown the water is? That's **sediment**—tiny pieces of soil and rock that the water picked up. This is **erosion** happening right now in this photograph.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"In your model, which was the **hydrosphere**?\" (the water)\n   - \"Which was the **geosphere**?\" (the soil, sand, and pebbles)\n   - \"What was the **sediment** in your model?\" (the materials the water carried)\n   - Thumbs up/sideways/down quick check: \"Do you understand how water causes erosion?\" Adjust explanations based on responses.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use the terms erosion, weathering, and sediment in context.\n- Students understand that water (hydrosphere) interacts with rock and soil (geosphere) to cause erosion.\n- Students see the connection between their model and real-world erosion in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply erosion concepts to a real-world problem and develop solutions aligned with protecting Earth's resources.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photos or video clips of human-impacted erosion sites (railroad beds, construction sites, riverbanks, or roadsides)—can be printed or shown on screen\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Examples of erosion prevention methods (pictures showing: vegetation, retaining walls, mulch, gravel, erosion control blankets)\n- Real-world scenario handout (below)\n\n**Activity: \"Solving Erosion Problems in Our Community\"**\n\n1. **Present the problem (3 minutes):** Show a photograph or video of a real erosion problem—for example, a severely eroded railroad bed, a muddy construction site, or a bare slope beside a road. Ask:\n   - *\"Why is this erosion happening here?\"* (likely: heavy water flow, no plants, exposed soil)\n   - *\"How might this erosion cause problems for people?\"* (loss of land, water pollution, danger to structures)\n\n2. **Introduce solutions (4 minutes):** Show pictures of how communities reduce erosion:\n   - **Planting trees and shrubs** (roots hold soil together; plants slow water flow)\n   - **Adding mulch or straw** (temporary cover to hold soil)\n   - **Building terraces or retaining walls** (slows water and holds soil)\n   - **Installing erosion control blankets** (fabric that holds soil while plants grow)\n\n3. **Design a solution (8 minutes):** In small groups, give each a **Real-World Erosion Scenario Card** (see below). Groups must:\n   - Draw or describe their chosen erosion problem\n   - Propose one erosion prevention solution\n   - Explain why their solution would work (use what they learned about water, soil, and Earth systems)\n   - Consider: Will this help the community? Is it realistic?\n\n**Sample Erosion Scenario Cards:**\n\n> **Card 1 - Railroad Erosion:** A railroad bed near town has heavy erosion during rainy season. Muddy water runs onto nearby roads and into a stream. What would you do?\n\n> **Card 2 - Construction Site:** A new building is being built. The bare soil is washing away during storms. How could the workers prevent erosion?\n\n> **Card 3 - Riverbank:** A stream bank is eroding, threatening homes nearby. What solution would you suggest?\n\n4. **Gallery share (4 minutes):** Groups post their solutions on the wall. Do a quick gallery walk where students see other ideas.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group discussion without imposing answers.\n- Ask: *\"How would plants help based on what you learned in your model?\"*\n- Encourage students to reference their erosion models: *\"Remember how water moved your sediment? How would this solution change that?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students propose realistic erosion prevention solutions.\n- Students explain their solution using vocabulary (erosion, hydrosphere, geosphere, sediment).\n- Students demonstrate understanding of how Earth systems interact.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of erosion, Earth system interactions, and solutions.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation of student predictions and model outcomes during Explore\n- Quality of observations recorded on data sheets\n- Participation in group discussions during Explain and Elaborate\n- Ability to use vocabulary correctly when explaining erosion\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket:**\n\nProvide each student with the following exit ticket (can be handwritten or digital):\n\n---\n\n**EXIT TICKET: What Do You Know About Erosion?**\n\n**Name: _________________________ Date: ______________**\n\n**1. Look at this picture of flowing water on a slope. Draw arrows showing where you think the water is moving and what it will carry away.**\n[Include a simple slope diagram or use the original photograph]\n\n**2. Write or draw: What happens to the soil and rocks that water picks up?**\n\n**3. Complete this sentence:**\n*\"Water causes erosion by _________________________________\"*\n\n**4. If you wanted to stop erosion on a bare hillside, what would you do? Why would it work?**\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Student demonstrates understanding if they can:**\n- Identify the direction of water flow on a slope\n- Explain that water carries sediment (soil and rock) away\n- Use the word \"erosion\" or \"sediment\" correctly\n- Propose a realistic solution and explain how it uses Earth systems knowledge (e.g., \"Plant trees because roots hold the soil together\")\n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Evidence |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Explain water erosion and system interactions | Exit ticket Q1, Q3; participation in Explain phase; accuracy of vocabulary use |\n| Model erosion and predict changes | Quality of Explore observations; accuracy of predictions; measurements of change in model |\n| Identify erosion evidence | Photograph analysis during Engage; detailed observations on data sheet |\n| Propose community solutions | Elaborate activity; quality of reasoning on exit ticket Q4 |\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n1. **Simplified data sheet:** Reduce written recording—use mostly sketches and labeled diagrams instead of sentences. Provide sentence stems: *\"The water moved the __________. The biggest rocks went to __________.\"*\n\n2. **Partner with a stronger peer:** During Explore, pair a struggling student with one who is naturally observant. Assign specific roles: one observes, one records; then swap.\n\n3. **Vocabulary visuals:** Create a visual anchor chart showing pictures of erosion, weathering, and sediment before the lesson. During Explain, point to these repeatedly. Provide definition cards students can reference during activities.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n1. **Quantitative analysis:** Have advanced students measure and graph changes in their model over multiple trials (e.g., height of slope after 1 pour, 2 pours, 3 pours). Ask: *\"Is erosion happening at a constant rate or does it speed up?\"*\n\n2. **Multi-variable investigation:** Challenge students to test different variables independently: *\"Does a steeper slope erode faster? Does vegetation (a sponge) slow erosion? Does the type of soil matter?\"* Have them design a controlled experiment.\n\n3. **Research and connect:** Have advanced students research real erosion prevention projects in their state or region. Prepare a short presentation or poster explaining the problem, solution, and results.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Erosion in Your Neighborhood:** Take students on a short outdoor exploration of your school grounds or nearby area. Have them identify one place where water erosion is happening (a worn path, a eroded slope, a gully). Document with photos or sketches. Return to class and discuss: What Earth systems are involved? What could prevent this erosion? This extends Elaborate into real-world observation.\n\n2. **Time-Lapse Erosion Project:** Challenge students to create a video or series of photographs showing their erosion models over several days with repeated water additions. Time-lapse photography (if available) is even more dramatic. Present findings to another class: *\"Here's how we watched Earth change before our eyes!\"*\n\n3. **Historical Landform Comparison:** Provide before-and-after photographs of a landscape that has experienced significant erosion over years (e.g., a riverbank, a hillside after construction, a roadside gully). Have students identify what changed and hypothesize what caused it. This deepens understanding that erosion is a process unfolding over time.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson works best across two sessions: Session 1 (Engage + Explore = 35 min), Session 2 (Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate = 50 min), or as a single 90-minute block.\n- The models are messy—plan ahead with newspaper, towels, and easy cleanup.\n- Students become highly engaged when they see immediate, visible changes in their models. This is the power of the hands-on phase.\n- Connecting the abstract photograph to their concrete model, then back to real-world solutions, creates deep learning and retention.",
