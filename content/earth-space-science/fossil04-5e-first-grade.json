ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about rocks and fossils using the photograph and activate prior knowledge about Earth materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected color copy of the fossil photograph (enlarged to 11x14\" or displayed on a screen)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per pair of students)\n- Real rocks or pebbles from outside (variety of colors and textures; 5–8 examples)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently on the board or document camera. Do NOT tell students what it is yet.\n\n2. **Invite observations** before naming it:\n   - \"What do you see when you look at this picture? What colors do you notice?\"\n   - \"Can you point to the roughest part? The smoothest part?\"\n   - \"Do you see any shapes or patterns? What do they remind you of?\"\n\n3. **Ask curiosity-sparking questions:**\n   - \"I see something that looks like a fan made of thin lines. Have you ever seen something like this before?\"\n   - \"This picture is from a rock. What do you think made those fan-shaped lines in the rock?\"\n   - \"Why do you think rocks might have patterns on them?\"\n\n4. **Pass around 2–3 real rocks** and hand lenses. Let students feel and examine them briefly.\n   - \"Does this rock look or feel like the picture? How is it different?\"\n\n5. **Wonder prompt:**\n   - \"I wonder if rocks can tell us stories about animals or plants that lived a very, very long time ago. What do you think?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become rock detectives and make our own discoveries about what rocks can tell us!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rocks and Earth materials through hands-on exploration, discovering properties and patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small bags or containers of rocks/pebbles (1 bag per pair; collect from outside or provide from a science supply kit)\n- Sand, soil, and clay in separate shallow trays or containers\n- Hand lenses (1 per student or pair)\n- White paper or clipboards\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Chart paper titled \"What We Notice About Rocks\"\n- Magnifying glasses\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Free Exploration (8 minutes)**\n1. Distribute one bag of mixed rocks to each pair of students.\n2. Provide hand lenses and say: \"You are rock detectives. Look very carefully at your rocks. Feel them. Observe them with the magnifying glass. What do you notice?\"\n3. Students handle, observe, and explore rocks freely without guidance.\n4. Teacher circulates, asking open-ended questions:\n   - \"What does this rock feel like?\"\n   - \"Do you see any bumps or patterns?\"\n   - \"Are all the rocks the same color?\"\n\n**Step 2: Comparison with Earth Materials (7 minutes)**\n1. Invite students to observe sand, soil, and clay in trays.\n2. Say: \"These are also from the Earth, like rocks. How are they the same as the rocks? How are they different?\"\n3. Students examine with hand lenses and touch materials (with adult supervision).\n4. Ask: \"Which of these materials look like the ground where the fossil picture came from?\"\n\n**Step 3: Documentation (5 minutes)**\n1. Have each student choose one rock they find interesting.\n2. Provide white paper and crayons/colored pencils.\n3. Direct students: \"Draw or color your rock. Draw any patterns or bumps you see.\"\n4. Encourage them to make their drawing big and detailed.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without giving answers; use questioning to guide observation.\n- Model how to use hand lenses correctly.\n- Encourage use of descriptive words: \"bumpy,\" \"smooth,\" \"rough,\" \"shiny,\" \"dark,\" \"light,\" \"striped,\" \"spotted.\"\n- Record student observations on chart paper (write their exact words).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will handle and examine rocks carefully.\n- Students will use hand lenses and describe observable properties.\n- Students will produce drawings showing patterns or details observed.\n- Teacher will collect 8–12 student-generated observation words on chart.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalizing concepts after exploration; connect to the fossil photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with student observations from Explore phase\n- Fossil photograph (displayed again)\n- Picture cards or simple drawings showing: rock, fossil, pattern, texture\n- Anchor chart with vocabulary (create during lesson)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Share What We Discovered (5 minutes)**\n1. Gather students on carpet with their rock drawings visible.\n2. Ask: \"What words did you use to describe your rocks? Let's make a list together.\"\n3. Point to the chart paper with observations. Read them aloud and celebrate: \"You are scientists! You noticed all these things!\"\n4. Group similar words (e.g., bumpy, rough, textured all describe how rocks *feel*).\n\n**Step 2: Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes)**\n\nCreate and display a simple anchor chart with illustrations or photographs:\n\n| **Term** | **Child-Friendly Definition** |\n|----------|------|\n| **Rock** | A hard, solid material that comes from the Earth. Rocks can be big or small. |\n| **Fossil** | A picture or shape of a plant or animal left in rock a very, very long time ago. |\n| **Pattern** | Shapes or lines that repeat again and again. It's like a design. |\n| **Texture** | How something feels when you touch it—bumpy, smooth, rough, etc. |\n\n**Step 3: Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes)**\n1. Display the fossil photo again.\n2. Point to the fan-shaped pattern: \"This is a **fossil**. It's the shape of a shell that was pressed into rock millions of years ago.\"\n3. Ask: \"Can you see the **pattern**? The thin lines go 1, 2, 3 in a fan. That's a **pattern**.\"\n4. Ask: \"What **texture** do you think this fossil would have if you could touch it?\" (Answer: bumpy, ridged, rough)\n5. Remind: \"The rock in this picture is made of sand and clay, just like the materials we explored!\"\n\n**Step 4: Check for Understanding (2 minutes)**\nUse a **show-me** strategy:\n- \"Show me with your hand how the texture feels. Is it bumpy or smooth?\" (Students gesture.)\n- \"Who can point to the pattern in the fossil?\" (Students point at displayed photo.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Rock:** A hard, solid material from the Earth; rocks come in different sizes, shapes, and colors.\n- **Fossil:** The shape or picture of an animal or plant that was saved in rock a very, very long time ago.\n- **Pattern:** Shapes or designs that repeat again and again, like lines that go over and over.\n- **Texture:** How something feels when you touch it (bumpy, smooth, rough, hard).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use vocabulary words to describe rocks and the fossil.\n- Students will identify patterns in the photograph and in real rocks.\n- Students will understand that fossils are records of past life preserved in rock.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by creating their own fossil and comparing it to natural examples.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Modeling clay or air-dry clay (1 small ball per student, about the size of a golf ball)\n- Small natural objects: shells, leaves, twigs, insects (plastic or real from outside)\n- Shallow trays or cookie sheets lined with wax paper\n- Paper plates\n- Fossil photograph (for reference)\n- Optional: plaster of paris or white paint (if making \"fossil molds\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Student-Made Fossils with Clay (Recommended for First Grade)**\n\n1. **Explain the activity:** \"Now YOU are going to make your own fossil! Just like the real fossil was made millions of years ago when a shell got pressed into wet mud and rock, you will press something into clay to make a pattern.\"\n\n2. **Model the process:**\n   - Take a ball of clay and flatten it gently into a disk (about ½-inch thick).\n   - Press a shell or leaf firmly into the clay, then lift it out.\n   - Show students the imprint left behind.\n   - Say: \"This is like a fossil! It shows us the shape of the shell, just like the real fossil in our picture.\"\n\n3. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Roll your clay into a ball and flatten it with your hand on the plate.\"\n   - \"Choose one object to press into your clay. Push gently but firmly.\"\n   - \"Lift your object up slowly. Look at the pattern it made!\"\n   - \"Feel the texture of your fossil. Is it bumpy?\"\n\n4. **Observation questions during work:**\n   - \"What pattern do you see?\"\n   - \"Does your fossil remind you of the fan-shaped one in our picture?\"\n   - \"If an animal stepped in mud and it turned to rock, what would we see?\"\n\n5. **Gallery walk:** Students place their clay fossils on a table and observe classmates' work.\n   - Ask: \"Whose fossil has the most detailed pattern?\"\n   - \"Can you guess what object made each fossil?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions.\n- Help students who struggle with clay manipulation (pre-flatten some clay pieces).\n- Reinforce vocabulary: \"Tell me about the texture of your fossil.\"\n- Take photos of student fossils for documentation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create an imprint fossil using clay.\n- Students will observe and describe patterns and textures in their own fossils.\n- Students will make connections between their model and the photograph.\n- Students will use scientific vocabulary in sentences.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rocks, fossils, patterns, and textures through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist:** As students explore and create, note:\n  - ☐ Student uses hand lens correctly.\n  - ☐ Student describes rock properties (color, texture, shape).\n  - ☐ Student identifies patterns in rocks or fossils.\n  - ☐ Student uses vocabulary terms: rock, fossil, pattern, texture.\n  \n- **Questioning during Explain and Elaborate:**\n  - Ask each student: \"What is a fossil?\" and \"How do you know?\"\n  - Listen for connections to their observations and the photograph.\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5–10 minutes):**\n\nGather students and ask these **three targeted questions** (record responses orally or have students draw/point):\n\n1. **Show the fossil photograph and ask:** \"What do you see in this picture? What do you think made those lines?\"\n   - *Success criteria:* Student identifies the fan shape or lines; mentions \"shell,\" \"animal,\" or \"long ago.\"\n\n2. **Hold up a rock and ask:** \"How would you describe this rock? Use words we learned—color, texture, or pattern.\"\n   - *Success criteria:* Student uses at least one descriptive word (bumpy, smooth, dark, etc.) or vocabulary term.\n\n3. **Ask:** \"If I walked in mud with my shoe and it became rock, what would we see?\"\n   - *Success criteria:* Student responds that we'd see the shape or pattern of the shoe; makes connection to how fossils form.\n\n**Document by:**\n- Recording student responses on a checklist.\n- Photographing student clay fossils as evidence.\n- Collecting student rock drawings.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify a fossil as a shape or picture of something from long ago.\n- Students will describe at least 2 rock properties using observational language.\n- Students will explain that fossils form when objects leave imprints in rock.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-made vocabulary cards with images:** Provide picture-word cards (rock, fossil, pattern) so students can point to words rather than retrieve them from memory.\n   - Use during Explain phase; let students handle cards during discussions.\n\n2. **Hand lens practice:** Spend 2–3 minutes at the start of Explore teaching correct hand lens use (hold close to eye, adjust focus).\n   - Partner with a stronger student for rock exploration.\n\n3. **Simplified fossil creation:** Pre-flatten clay into disks; provide only 1–2 objects to press (e.g., a shell and a leaf).\n   - Offer hand-over-hand support if needed when pressing and lifting objects.\n\n4. **Sentence frames for explanation:** Provide verbal sentence starters:\n   - \"The fossil has a _____ (bumpy/smooth) texture.\"\n   - \"I see a _____ (pattern/color) in the rock.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Compare fossil photos:** Show students 3–4 different fossil photographs and ask: \"What do you think each fossil was? What clues help you decide?\"\n   - Challenge them to draw inferences based on patterns observed.\n\n2. **Predict fossil formation:** Ask, \"If we buried objects in sand and pressed on them for a very long time, what would happen? How is that like how real fossils form?\"\n   - Encourage multi-step thinking and predictions.\n\n3. **Create multiple-object fossils:** Have students press 2–3 different objects into one clay piece and create a composite \"fossil.\"\n   - Ask: \"Can you make a fossil with multiple patterns? What story does it tell?\"\n\n4. **Research and sketch:** Provide pictures of real fossils (shells, fish, leaves, trilobites) from books or websites.\n   - Ask: \"Draw one fossil. Label the pattern you see. What animal or plant do you think it is?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rock and Mineral Collection Display:**\n   - Students bring rocks from home or collect from the playground.\n   - Create a classroom display organized by color, size, or texture.\n   - Students create labels using vocabulary words: \"Bumpy Gray Rock,\" \"Smooth Brown Pebble.\"\n   - Connects to: classifying materials, observational skills.\n\n2. **Fossil Hunt in the Schoolyard:**\n   - Take students outside to observe rocks in their natural environment.\n   - Search for rocks with interesting textures, patterns, or colors.\n   - Sketch or photograph finds; discuss: \"Do you think this rock has a fossil in it? Why or why not?\"\n   - Connects to: fieldwork, real-world observation, Earth materials.\n\n3. **Make a Fossil Guidebook:**\n   - Create a class book where each student illustrates one fossil (real or from research images).\n   - Write a simple sentence: \"This is a _____. It is _____ years old. It looks like a _____.\"\n   - Share during a family reading night.\n   - Connects to: literacy integration, communication, deepening knowledge.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety reminder:** Supervise hand lens use and clay handling. Ensure materials are non-toxic.\n- **Source materials:** Collect rocks from outside beforehand or use inexpensive aquarium pebbles/craft rocks.\n- **Photography:** Take photos of student work throughout the lesson for assessment portfolios and family communication.\n- **Follow-up:** This lesson naturally leads to future lessons on weather, erosion (rocks changing over time), and paleontology concepts in upper grades.\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Use the vocabulary anchor chart throughout the lesson and in follow-up discussions to reinforce terms.\n- **Engagement boost:** Tell the story: \"This fossil is millions of years old! When dinosaurs lived, there was an ocean here. This shell fell in the mud, and over millions and millions of years, it turned into rock. Now we can see its story!\"\n\n---\n\nThis lesson positions First Graders to observe, describe, and begin to understand the evidence Earth materials (rocks) can provide about natural systems and history. It builds foundational skills for future ESS learning while honoring the concrete, hands-on learning style of early elementary students.",
