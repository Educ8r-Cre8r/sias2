Explain how Earth's water, air, rock, and living things depend on each other and interact as systems.\n2. Identify evidence of chemical weathering (rust formation) caused by water and oxygen in the atmosphere.\n3. Describe why organisms like the chrysalis need clean water and air to survive and grow.\n4. Propose ways that communities can protect water and air quality to support life.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the interdependence of Earth's systems using the photograph as an entry point.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph of the chrysalis (p48.jpg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** in large format or projected on the board. Allow 1-2 minutes of silent observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions to spark discussion:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the metal structure in this picture? What has happened to it, and why?\"\n   - \"The chrysalis is hanging from this metal. What might the chrysalis need from the air and water around it to survive and change?\"\n   - \"How is the rusty metal and the chrysalis connected to the same Earth systems?\"\n   - \"What would happen to the chrysalis if the air became polluted or the water around it was dirty?\"\n\n3. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper. Accept all responses without correction; highlight comments about weather, water, air, rust, and the organism's needs.\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Right now, I want you to think: **What is causing the metal to look rusty and old?** Is it just time, or is something from the environment doing this work?\" Have students turn-and-talk with a partner for 30 seconds.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore how water and air in our environment change things—like this metal—and how those same systems help living things survive.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover evidence of chemical weathering and understand how Earth's systems interact through a hands-on investigation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4 small clear cups (per group of 3–4 students)\n- Iron or steel wool (small pieces, pre-cut for safety)\n- Labels: \"Water Only,\" \"Air Only,\" \"Water + Air,\" \"Control (Nothing)\"\n- Water (tap water)\n- Observation sheets (template provided below)\n- Paper towels\n- Safety goggles (if school protocol requires)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Set Up the Investigation (5 minutes)**\n- Distribute materials to each group. Explain: \"We're going to observe what happens to steel when it meets water and air—just like the metal in the photograph.\"\n- Have students label four cups and fill according to this plan:\n  - **Cup 1 (Water Only):** Place steel wool, add water, leave dry part exposed to air.\n  - **Cup 2 (Air Only):** Place steel wool, add NO water, leave completely dry and exposed to air.\n  - **Cup 3 (Water + Air):** Place steel wool, add water, stir gently so steel is wet AND exposed to air.\n  - **Cup 4 (Control):** Leave empty; this is the comparison.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Observations (3 minutes)**\n- Have students sketch and describe the steel wool in each cup on their observation sheet.\n- Ask: \"Which steel looks most like it will change? Why do you think so?\"\n\n**Step 3: Wait and Observe (Throughout the Explore phase and beyond)**\n- Check the cups at the 10-minute mark. Rust should begin visible in Cup 3 (water + air).\n- Have students record observations: color changes, texture changes, any smell or other signs.\n\n**Step 4: Draw Conclusions (5 minutes)**\n- Ask: \"Which cup shows the most rust? What does rust tell us about how water and air work together?\"\n- Students record: \"Rust forms when steel meets **BOTH** water and air. This is a chemical change caused by Earth's atmosphere and hydrosphere.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group. Ask guiding questions: *\"What's different between Cup 2 (air only) and Cup 3 (water + air)? What does that tell you about whether air alone causes rust?\"*\n- Do NOT tell students what will happen—guide them to observe.\n- Redirect observations to the photograph: *\"How is what you see in Cup 3 like the rusty metal holding the chrysalis?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that rust requires BOTH water and air (evidence of how two Earth systems interact).\n- Students record data showing that water alone or air alone produces little change, but water + air produces visible rust.\n- Students make the connection: Earth's hydrosphere and atmosphere interact to change Earth's geosphere (rock/metal).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and connect student observations to Earth systems and the chrysalis's dependence on those systems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with \"Earth's Four Systems\" diagram (prepared in advance or created during this phase)\n- Vocabulary cards (printed or handwritten)\n- Photograph of chrysalis (displayed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Group Share-Out (5 minutes)**\n1. Ask 2–3 groups to share their observations: *\"What did you notice in Cup 3? How did water and air work together?\"*\n2. Record commonalities on chart paper: \"Both water AND air were needed for rust.\"\n\n**Part B: Introduce Vocabulary and Concepts (8 minutes)**\n\nDisplay a simple diagram showing **Earth's Four Systems and How They Interact:**\n\n```\nGEOSPHERE (rocks, soil, metal)\n    ↑↓ (interact)\nHYDROSPHERE (water) ←→ ATMOSPHERE (air)\n    ↓↑\nBIOSPHERE (living things—like the chrysalis)\n```\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Geosphere:** All the rocks, soil, and metal that make up Earth's solid ground. *(In your experiment: the steel wool.)*\n- **Hydrosphere:** All of Earth's water—in oceans, clouds, rain, and even tiny water droplets in the air. *(In your experiment: the water you added.)*\n- **Atmosphere:** The blanket of air around Earth that contains oxygen and other gases. *(In your experiment: the air around the steel.)*\n- **Biosphere:** All living things on Earth and the environments they live in. *(In the photograph: the chrysalis.)*\n- **Weathering:** The breaking down and changing of rocks and metal over time by water, air, and temperature. *(In your experiment: rust formation is a type of weathering.*\n\n**Part C: Connect Back to the Photograph (4 minutes)**\n\n1. Display the chrysalis photo again.\n2. Ask: *\"Why does the chrysalis hang on rusty metal? What does this tell us about how all four systems touch the chrysalis?\"*\n3. Guide discussion:\n   - The geosphere (metal) provides support.\n   - The atmosphere (air) provides oxygen and carries moisture.\n   - The hydrosphere (water in rain and humidity) keeps the chrysalis from drying out.\n   - The biosphere (the chrysalis) depends on all three to transform safely.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:** Have students do a **Thumbs Up/Sideways/Down** gesture:\n   - Thumbs up: \"I can explain how water and air work together to cause rust.\"\n   - Sideways: \"I'm still thinking about it.\"\n   - Down: \"I need more help.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand the four Earth systems and can give examples from the experiment and photograph.\n- Students recognize that weathering is an interaction of the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and geosphere.\n- Students see that the chrysalis depends on clean, healthy air and water from these systems.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of Earth systems to a real-world environmental protection scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed scenario cards (one per group) or displayed on screen\n- Chart paper or digital template for group response\n- Images of pollutants (optional: pictures of industrial smoke, litter, factory runoff)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Challenge:**\n\nDivide students into small groups (3–4 per group) and assign one of the following real-world scenarios:\n\n**Scenario A: The River Community**\n*A town's river has become cloudy and brown from factory runoff. Insects, fish, and birds are disappearing. The chrysalis of a rare butterfly species hangs near this river.*\n- **Task:** Explain how polluted water harms the four Earth systems and especially threatens the chrysalis. What can your community do to protect the hydrosphere?\n\n**Scenario B: The Industrial City**\n*Car exhaust and factory smoke have made the air gray and hard to breathe. Plants are struggling, and insects are leaving the area.*\n- **Task:** Describe how polluted air affects all four Earth systems. Why is clean air especially important for a chrysalis preparing to transform? What solutions can your community try?\n\n**Scenario C: The Farm with Rust**\n*Old metal machinery on a farm is rusting quickly because of rain and humidity. The rust is poisoning the soil around it. A family wants to protect their land and the chrysalises that live there.*\n- **Task:** Explain the connection between weathering and environmental damage. How can the family protect both the geosphere and the biosphere?\n\n**Group Response Template:**\nGroups fill in or present:\n1. Which Earth system(s) are affected?\n2. How does this problem hurt living things (biosphere)?\n3. What is ONE action individuals or communities can take to protect Earth's resources?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Assign scenarios strategically (scaffold for struggling groups, challenge for advanced).\n- Ask probing questions: *\"You said the river is polluted. Which system is damaged first? How does that affect the others?\"*\n- Encourage groups to connect back to the chrysalis's needs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply the four-systems model to real-world situations.\n- Students propose evidence-based solutions (e.g., reduce factory emissions, clean up rivers, install rain gardens to filter water).\n- Students articulate why protecting Earth's systems is connected to protecting all living things.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess students' understanding of Earth systems interactions and environmental stewardship.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation Sheets** from Explore phase: Check for evidence that students recorded which conditions created rust.\n- **Thumbs Up/Sideways/Down** check during Explain.\n- **Group Discussions** during Elaborate: Listen for correct use of vocabulary and reasoning about connections.\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5–7 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a slip of paper or digital form with the following prompts. Students choose ONE to respond to in 2–3 sentences:\n\n**Option A (Core):**\n*\"Look at the photograph of the chrysalis again. Name at least two Earth systems that are helping or could hurt the chrysalis. Explain your thinking.\"*\n\n**Option B (Alternative for visual learners):**\n*\"Draw or label the four Earth systems (geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere) in and around the chrysalis photograph. Show one way each system affects the chrysalis.\"*\n\n**Option C (Extended thinking):**\n*\"The rust on the metal is caused by the hydrosphere (water) and atmosphere (air) working together. If a community wanted to protect a chrysalis and the metal structure it hangs from, what action could they take? Explain how your action protects at least two Earth systems.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ Student identifies at least two Earth systems by name.\n✓ Student explains how those systems interact or affect the chrysalis.\n✓ Student uses evidence from the lesson (rust experiment, photograph, or discussion).\n✓ Student proposes a reasonable protective action (for Option C).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n**Proficient Students** will:\n- Correctly name the four systems and describe how they interact.\n- Connect the rust formation directly to water + air + metal.\n- Explain why the chrysalis needs clean air and water.\n- Propose at least one community action to protect resources.\n\n**Developing Students** may:\n- Name systems but confuse definitions.\n- Describe one interaction but struggle to explain all four systems.\n- Exit ticket shows emerging understanding with teacher support.\n\n**Advanced Students** will:\n- Explain multiple interactions and feedback loops between systems.\n- Propose solutions that address root causes (e.g., reducing emissions vs. just cleaning up rust).\n- Make connections to broader environmental issues (climate, biodiversity).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Scaffolding for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce the Explore complexity:** Provide only two cups (Water + Air vs. Control) instead of four. Focus on comparing these two.\n\n2. **Vocabulary anchor chart:** Create a posted reference with pictures and simple definitions of the four systems. Allow students to reference this during all phases.\n\n3. **Partner with a strong reader/communicator:** During Explain and Elaborate, pair students with peers who can help articulate connections. Assign specific roles: one student observes/records, the other explains to the group.\n\n4. **Sentence stems for exit ticket:**\n   - \"The water and air worked together to make rust because ___.\"\n   - \"The chrysalis needs clean _____ and _____ to be healthy.\"\n   - \"My community could protect Earth's water by _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (Extension for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Investigate oxidation more deeply:** Have advanced students predict what would happen if they added salt (like salt water) to Cup 3. Would it rust faster? Slower? Why? Have them design and conduct the modified experiment, then explain the chemistry in student-friendly language.\n\n2. **Research real-world weathering scenarios:** Assign small groups to research and present one example of weathering that affects human communities (e.g., acid rain, erosion, corrosion of bridges). They should explain how the hydrosphere and atmosphere are involved and propose solutions.\n\n3. **Systems thinking challenge:** Create a more complex diagram showing how pollution in one system creates problems in the others (e.g., air pollution → acid rain → water pollution → harm to organisms). Have students trace these connections and propose intervention points.\n\n4. **Community audit project:** Have students photograph or document examples of weathering, rusting, or environmental damage in their own school or neighborhood. Create a visual presentation identifying which systems are involved and suggesting solutions.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **The Chrysalis Timeline:** Students research the actual life cycle of a Monarch butterfly (or local species). Create a timeline showing each stage and what environmental conditions (water, air, temperature, food) are needed at each stage. Connect to why protecting Earth's systems protects the entire lifecycle. *(Connects to 5-ESS3-1: protecting resources for life.)*\n\n2. **Build a Water Filtration System:** Extend learning about protecting the hydrosphere. Provide students with soil, sand, gravel, activated charcoal, and dirty water. Have them design and build a simple filter to clean polluted water. Test it and measure how much cleaner the water becomes. Discuss how communities use filtration systems. *(Real-world application of protecting water resources.)*\n\n3. **Rust Prevention Engineering Challenge:** Give students small metal objects and challenge them to find materials or methods to prevent rust (e.g., paint, oil, plastic coating, keeping it dry). Test which method works best over 1–2 weeks. Connect to how engineers protect infrastructure and why geosphere materials must be maintained. *(Advanced problem-solving; connects to protecting Earth's resources.)*\n\n4. **Local Environmental Stewardship Research:** Students investigate one local initiative in your community that protects air or water (a park cleanup, a recycling program, a rain garden, an air quality improvement effort). They gather information (via interviews, websites, or articles) and present how this action protects one or more Earth systems. *(Direct connection to 5-ESS3-1.)*\n\n---\n\n## Connections to NGSS Standards\n\n**5-ESS2-1** *(Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact)*\n- **Evidence:** Students use the rust experiment as a model of how the geosphere (steel), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air) interact. They apply this model to explain the chrysalis's dependence on these systems.\n\n**5-ESS3-1** *(Obtain and combine information about ways individual communities use science ideas to protect the Earth's resources and environment)*\n- **Evidence:** During Elaborate, students propose real-world solutions to protect water and air quality. Extension activities involve research into actual community initiatives that protect resources.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing:** The Explore phase (rust observation) requires 10+ minutes for visible changes. If you want results on Day 1, prepare a demonstration cup ahead of time (rust it overnight before the lesson) to show students what Cup 3 will look like after waiting.\n- **Safety:** Steel wool can be sharp. Pre-cut into small pieces and handle with care. Supervise closely.\n- **Engagement:** The chrysalis photograph is naturally engaging. Use it as an anchor throughout all phases—revisit it often so students make the connection between the experiment and the real organism.\n- **Vocabulary load:** The four systems are abstract. Use pictures, labels, and repeated exposure. Consider creating a \"systems bingo\" game as a follow-up review.\n- **Cross-curricular link:** If your ELA teacher is reading books about insects or life cycles, coordinate timing. This science lesson builds literacy about why clean environments matter for survival.\n\n---\n\n## Assessment Rubric (Simple, Fifth-Grade Friendly)\n\n| Criterion | Developing | Proficient | Advanced |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| **Identifies Earth Systems** | Names 1–2 systems; definitions unclear | Names 3–4 systems; definitions mostly accurate | Clearly defines all four systems and explains their roles in the environment |\n| **Explains System Interactions** | Identifies one interaction (e.g., \"water makes rust\") | Explains how 2+ systems interact; connects to chrysalis | Describes multiple interactions and feedback loops; links to broader environmental concepts |\n| **Uses Evidence** | Weak connection between experiment and thinking | References the rust experiment or photograph to support ideas | Integrates evidence from multiple sources (experiment, observation, research) |\n| **Proposes Solutions** | Suggests an idea but unclear connection to systems | Proposes a reasonable action that protects one or two systems | Proposes solutions addressing root causes and protecting multiple systems |\n\n---\n\nThis lesson honors the photograph by making it the center of inquiry, ensuring that students see Earth's systems not as abstract concepts but as living, interacting realities that sustain all life—including a chrysalis waiting in the rain.",
