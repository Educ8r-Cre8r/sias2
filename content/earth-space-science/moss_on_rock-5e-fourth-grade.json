ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of moss-covered rock (or printed copies, 1 per pair)\n- Whiteboard and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or distribute printed color copies to pairs of students. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking—they are \"rock detectives.\"\n\n2. **Facilitate a quick observation discussion** using these guiding questions:\n   - *\"What do you notice on this rock? What colors do you see?\"* (Expected: green, gray, brown, pink/red tones)\n   - *\"Why do you think moss is growing all over this rock?\"* (Expected: moisture, shade, nutrients)\n   - *\"Do you think this rock looks old or new? How can you tell?\"* (Expected: cracks, rough texture, color changes)\n   - *\"If you touched this rock, what do you predict it would feel like?\"* (Expected: bumpy, rough, possibly slimy where moss grows)\n\n3. **Pose a wonder prompt:** \"This rock hasn't always looked like this. What do you think happened to change it? What forces in nature might have broken it down and made it rough? Write or draw one prediction in your science notebook.\"\n\n4. **Allow 2-3 volunteers to share predictions.** Affirm all responses and note that today's investigation will help them discover the real answers.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now you're going to become rock scientists and test how rocks change. Let's explore what happens to rocks over time!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover weathering and erosion concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chalk (white) – 1 stick per pair\n- Small cups of water (room temperature)\n- Small cups of water with salt (simulating freeze-thaw cycles; prepare ahead: 1 tablespoon salt per ½ cup water)\n- Spray bottles with water (1 per pair)\n- Small paintbrushes (1 per pair)\n- Paper towels\n- Sandpaper (1 sheet per pair, medium grit)\n- Small trays or plates to contain the investigation\n- Data collection sheets (printed template provided below)\n- Hand lenses (optional but recommended)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute chalk to each pair.** Explain: \"Chalk is soft rock. Today, chalk will help us understand how real rocks break down and change.\"\n\n2. **Divide students into four stations** (or carousel format). Each pair rotates through 4-5 minute stations, spending time at each investigation scenario:\n\n   **Station 1 – Freeze-Thaw Weathering:**\n   - Students place chalk in a cup of regular water and a cup of salt water side-by-side.\n   - They observe and record which one shows more changes (cracks, softness, crumbling).\n   - Instruction: \"What happens to water when it gets cold and freezes? How might this crack rocks in nature?\"\n\n   **Station 2 – Water Erosion:**\n   - Students hold chalk over a tray and use spray bottles to spray water on it.\n   - They observe how the chalk breaks apart and how water carries the pieces away.\n   - Instruction: \"Where do you see chalk pieces going? How is water changing this rock?\"\n\n   **Station 3 – Wind and Weathering (Simulated):**\n   - Students place chalk in a tray and use paintbrushes or gentle breath to move particles around.\n   - They observe how pieces break off and scatter.\n   - Instruction: \"If wind blows this way, what happens to the rock bits?\"\n\n   **Station 4 – Physical/Mechanical Weathering:**\n   - Students rub sandpaper gently against chalk and observe how it crumbles.\n   - They record observations about texture changes.\n   - Instruction: \"This sandpaper acts like ice or other rocks grinding together. What's happening to the chalk?\"\n\n3. **Data Collection:** Provide a simple chart for each pair:\n   ```\n   Station Name: _________________\n   What did we do? _________________\n   What happened to the chalk? _________________\n   How is this like what happens to real rocks? _________________\n   ```\n\n4. **Visual Documentation:** Have students sketch one observation from their most interesting station.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between stations asking open-ended questions: *\"What do you notice?\" \"How is the chalk different now?\" \"What's causing this change?\"*\n- Avoid telling students the \"answer\"—instead, ask them to describe what they observe.\n- Provide hand lenses for closer observation.\n- Encourage peer discussion: *\"Talk to your partner—what do you think is happening?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe chalk (soft rock) breaking apart, crumbling, and changing color/texture.\n- Students discover that water, salt, friction, and physical force all cause rocks to break down.\n- Students record observations and begin connecting the activity to natural processes.\n- Students sketch or describe changes they observed.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original moss-covered rock photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures (printed or hand-drawn)\n- Student science notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather the group** and return to the original photograph. Ask: \"Now that you've experimented with chalk, what do you think caused the cracks, colors, and rough texture on this real rock?\"\n\n2. **Facilitate a share-out** from each station (2 minutes total):\n   - \"What happened at the freeze-thaw station?\" (Water expands when it freezes, pushing rock apart.)\n   - \"What happened at the water/spray station?\" (Water carried rock pieces away—erosion.)\n   - \"What happened at the wind station?\" (Small pieces blow away.)\n   - \"What happened with the sandpaper?\" (Friction and grinding break rock down.)\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary** using the photograph as visual reference:\n\n   **Vocabulary with Fourth Grade-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n   - **Weathering:** The slow breaking down of rocks into smaller and smaller pieces by water, wind, ice, temperature changes, or living things. *Point to the cracks and rough areas on the photo.* \"This rock has been weathered—broken down by nature over a very long time.\"\n\n   - **Erosion:** The movement and carrying away of broken rock and soil by water, wind, or ice. *Gesture as if water is washing pieces away.* \"When water carries these small rock pieces downhill or into a stream, that's erosion.\"\n\n   - **Freeze-Thaw Weathering:** When water gets into cracks in rocks, freezes (turns to ice), expands (gets bigger), and pushes the rock apart. *Mime ice expanding.* \"This happens again and again—freeze, thaw, freeze, thaw—until the rock cracks.\"\n\n   - **Biological Weathering:** When living things, like plant roots or moss, grow on or into rocks and slowly break them down. *Point to the moss on the photo.* \"The moss and tiny organisms on this rock are actually helping to break it down!\"\n\n   - **Microhabitat:** A tiny area with special conditions (like moisture and shade) where certain living things can survive. \"The wet, shady cracks on this rock are a perfect microhabitat for moss to grow.\"\n\n4. **Connect back to the photo:** \"Look at this rock again. How many types of weathering can you spot? The cracks might be from freeze-thaw. The rough texture might be from water and wind. The moss is doing biological weathering. All of these changes take years and years—but they're always happening.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to a partner and explain: How did we use chalk to model what happens to real rocks?\"\n   - \"Show me with your hands: How does water break down a rock?\" (Students gesture: spray, carve, push apart)\n   - Ask 3 individual students: \"Name one way rocks can be weathered.\" Listen for: water, ice, wind, or living things.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that weathering is the breakdown of rocks by natural forces.\n- Students can name at least 2-3 types of weathering.\n- Students see the connection between their chalk experiment and real rocks.\n- Students recognize that moss and other living things contribute to rock change.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by predicting future changes and connecting to landscapes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large images or videos of real weathered landscapes (optional: Grand Canyon, rocky coastlines, mountain terrain)\n- Prediction worksheet (template below)\n- Sample rocks or rock photos showing different weathering stages\n- Optional: Google Earth images of the same location at different times (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A – Rock Timeline Prediction:**\n\n1. Provide students with 2-3 images of the same rock or location at different time periods (or create a visual sequence: \"new\" granite, weathered granite, heavily weathered granite).\n\n2. **Instruction:** \"These are pictures of a rock at different times. The first one is brand new. The second was taken 50 years later. The third was taken 100 years later. What do you predict will happen to a rock after 200 years? After 1,000 years?\"\n\n3. **Student activity:** Students draw or write predictions about how today's moss-covered rock might look in:\n   - 10 years\n   - 50 years\n   - 100 years\n\n   Use sentence frames: \"In 10 years, the rock will _______ because _______.\"\n\n4. **Share:** 2-3 students share their predictions. Affirm that rocks change very slowly, and the moss-covered rock might not look drastically different in 10 years, but it will keep weathering.\n\n**Option B – Landscape Change Investigation:**\n\n1. Show an image of a real landscape affected by weathering/erosion (examples: canyon, boulder field, eroded riverbank, coastal cliffs, or mountain terrain).\n\n2. **Guiding questions:**\n   - \"What forces of nature created this landscape?\"\n   - \"How long do you think it took to look like this?\"\n   - \"What evidence of weathering and erosion do you see?\"\n\n3. **Student task:** Students write or draw an explanation: \"This landscape looks the way it does because of weathering and erosion caused by _______, _______, and _______.\"\n\n**Option C – Moss and Plants as Weathering Agents:**\n\n1. Revisit the photograph and ask: \"The moss is helping to break down this rock. Why might plants be important for breaking down rocks, even though they seem small and gentle?\"\n\n2. **Discussion prompt:** \"If this moss keeps growing and spreading, will it speed up or slow down the weathering of the rock? Why?\"\n\n3. **Student reflection:** \"Draw or write: How are plants both living on the rock AND changing the rock at the same time?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask probing questions to deepen thinking: *\"What evidence supports your prediction?\" \"What happens first, weathering or erosion?\"*\n- Encourage students to use vocabulary from the Explain phase.\n- Challenge students to think about long time scales: *\"This process takes thousands of years in nature. Our chalk experiment was much faster—why?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students predict future rock changes using evidence from the lesson.\n- Students apply weathering/erosion concepts to real landscapes.\n- Students explain the role of living things in Earth processes.\n- Students use vocabulary accurately in written or verbal explanations.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of weathering and erosion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- **Station observations:** Teacher notes on how students explain weathering processes at each station.\n- **Partner conversations:** Listen for accurate use of vocabulary and cause-effect thinking.\n- **Check-for-understanding questions in Explain phase:** Student responses reveal misconceptions in real time.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide this to each student at the end of the lesson. Students can draw, write, or use a combination.\n\n---\n\n**EXIT TICKET: Rock Detective Report**\n\n**Name: _________________ Date: _________________**\n\n**Look at this photograph of a weathered rock covered with moss.**\n\n[*Insert the original lesson photograph or a similar one*]\n\n**Answer these questions:**\n\n1. **What evidence do you see that this rock has been weathered?** (Describe 1-2 things you observe.)\n   - _____________________________________________________________\n\n2. **Name at least TWO things from nature that weathered this rock.**\n   - _________________ and _________________\n\n3. **The moss is growing on this rock. How does moss help weather the rock?**\n   - _____________________________________________________________\n\n4. **If you visited this same rock 50 years from now, how would it be different? Why?**\n   - _____________________________________________________________\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery if they:\n\n✓ **Identify specific evidence of weathering** from the photograph (cracks, rough texture, color changes, texture differences).\n\n✓ **Name at least 2 types of weathering** from the lesson (water, ice/freeze-thaw, wind, living things/biological).\n\n✓ **Explain a cause-and-effect relationship** (e.g., \"Water goes into cracks and freezes, which pushes the rock apart\").\n\n✓ **Recognize biological weathering** by acknowledging that moss and plants contribute to rock breakdown.\n\n✓ **Predict future changes** using evidence and understanding that weathering is an ongoing process.\n\n✓ **Use lesson vocabulary appropriately** (weathering, erosion, freeze-thaw, biological weathering, microhabitat).\n\n**Data Recording:**\n- Collect exit tickets and review for evidence of learning.\n- Use results to identify students needing reteaching or ready for extension.\n- Students who struggle with cause-effect relationships may need additional scaffolding in the next lesson (e.g., weathering → erosion sequencing).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Sentence Frames and Word Banks:**\n   - Provide pre-written sentence frames with blanks: \"Weathering happens when _________ breaks down _________ over a long time.\"\n   - Create a word bank on the board with vocabulary and pictures: freeze-thaw, moss, water, cracks, etc.\n   - Allow students to point to words or pictures to answer questions rather than write.\n\n2. **Hands-On Station Modifications:**\n   - Pair struggling readers/writers with stronger peers.\n   - Provide a visual data chart with pictures instead of words (show a crack, show moss, show water droplets, etc.).\n   - Reduce the number of stations to 2-3 instead of 4 if time/complexity is overwhelming.\n   - Allow students to dictate observations to a partner or teacher rather than write.\n\n3. **Exit Ticket Scaffolding:**\n   - Provide multiple-choice options for question 2: \"Which caused weathering? a) moss b) wind c) water d) all of the above\"\n   - Allow drawing only for questions 3 and 4; accept sketches with labels instead of written sentences.\n   - Use a simpler version: *\"Is this rock new or old? How do you know?\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Deep Dive into Time Scales:**\n   - Introduce the concept of geological time: \"Most rocks weather over thousands or millions of years. Our chalk experiment happened in minutes. Research: How long does it take for a real granite boulder to completely weather away? (Answer: often 50,000+ years)\"\n   - Challenge: \"If weathering is so slow, why do you think we sometimes see big piles of boulders broken into smaller rocks? What might speed up weathering?\"\n\n2. **Erosion After Weathering:**\n   - Extend the lesson by modeling what happens *after* weathering: \"Once rocks are broken down into small pieces, how do they move? Create an experiment showing how water or gravity carries broken rock pieces downhill. Where does this sediment end up? How does this create new landscapes?\"\n   - Challenge students to predict where eroded rock particles from the moss-covered rock might end up (stream, soil, downhill).\n\n3. **Biological Weathering Investigation:**\n   - Research project: \"Find out what kinds of organisms (lichens, mosses, bacteria, fungal roots) live on rocks and contribute to weathering. Create a field guide or poster showing these 'rock breakers' and how each one works.\"\n   - Design an experiment: \"Can we grow moss on a rock and observe how it changes the rock's surface over 4-6 weeks?\" (Advanced students could set this up as a long-term class project.)\n\n4. **Real-World Application:**\n   - Discussion: \"Weathering is natural, but humans sometimes want to slow it down. How do we protect buildings, monuments, or statues from weathering? (Sealants, coatings, shelters) Why would a city want to protect a historic stone building from weathering?\"\n   - Challenge: \"Design a solution to prevent weathering on a monument or old building. What material would you use and why?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### 1. **\"Fossilize a Cookie\" Simulation (for understanding rock layers and weathering over time)**\n\n**Time:** 30-40 minutes (can be done as a follow-up lesson or take-home activity)\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chocolate chip cookies or crackers (1 per student)\n- Plate or foil\n- Water in a cup\n- Spoon\n\n**Activity:**\n- Students place a cookie on a plate and represent \"weathering\" by crumbling it, spraying it with water, or letting it sit in water for a few minutes.\n- Discuss: \"Just like weathering breaks down rocks into small pieces, what happened to your cookie? These small pieces are like sediment. When sediment gets pressed together over time, it forms new rocks called sedimentary rocks.\"\n- Optional: Layer crushed cookie pieces (with food coloring for different \"layers\") in a jar with water to show how sediment layers form.\n- This connects weathering to **rock formation and the rock cycle**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Field Investigation: Finding Weathered Rocks in Your School or Neighborhood**\n\n**Time:** 45-60 minutes (outdoor activity, can be homework-based)\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clipboards\n- Data collection worksheet (template below)\n- Digital camera or tablets to photograph rocks\n- Hand lenses (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n- Take students on a nature walk around the school, nearby park, or neighborhood (with parental permission for off-campus exploration).\n- Challenge: \"Find examples of rocks that show weathering. Look for cracks, moss, lichen, color changes, or rough texture.\"\n- Students photograph or sketch 2-3 weathered rocks and answer:\n  - Where is the rock located?\n  - What weathering evidence do you see?\n  - What type of weathering do you think caused these changes? (water, ice, wind, living things)\n  - Is this rock in a wet or dry spot? How does that affect weathering?\n- Back in class: Students create a **\"Weathering Evidence Gallery\"** by displaying photos with captions explaining the weathering they observed.\n- This reinforces **observational skills** and **real-world application** of lesson concepts.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Rock Cycle Connection: From Weathered Rock to Sedimentary Rock**\n\n**Time:** 2-3 days (can be extended across multiple days)\n\n**Materials:**\n- Weathered rock samples (from local sources or craft store)\n- Shallow container with water\n- Sand, small pebbles, crushed chalk from Explore phase\n- Plaster of paris or cement powder\n- Water\n- Mixing bowls and spoons\n\n**Activity:**\n- **Day 1 – Weathering Review:** \"We know rocks break down through weathering. Today, let's follow what happens next.\"\n- **Day 2 – Simulated Erosion and Deposition:** Students mix broken chalk pieces with water in a container and let it settle. Observe: \"The broken rock pieces (sediment) have been moved by water and are settling at the bottom. This is what happens in rivers and lakes.\"\n- **Day 3 – Forming New Rock:** Students mix plaster of paris with the settled sediment to simulate **lithification** (pressing and cementing sediment into new rock). Pour into a mold and let dry.\n- **Reflection:** \"We started with a whole rock (weathering broke it down), water moved the pieces (erosion), and now we've formed a new rock. Rocks are constantly recycled on Earth through the **rock cycle**.\"\n- This extension connects to **4-ESS1-1** and **4-ESS2-1** by showing how rock formation relates to weathering and Earth's changing landscapes.\n\n---\n\n## Alignment Notes\n\n- **4-ESS2-1** is fully addressed through the Explore phase (hands-on weathering observations) and the Exit Ticket assessment.\n- **4-ESS1-1** is supported by the photograph analysis and prediction activities (identifying evidence of past changes).\n- The lesson incorporates **CCC1: Patterns** (weathering patterns on rocks over time) and **CCC3: Cause and Effect** (weathering agents → rock breakdown) from the NGSS Crosscutting Concepts.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is ready to implement immediately. All materials are classroom-accessible, and the 5E flow builds student understanding progressively from observation to application. Teachers can adjust timing and extension based on class pace and interest.**",
