Explain that trees grow slowly over many years, adding one new ring each year.\n2. Count and compare rings on different tree sections to determine which tree is older.\n3. Describe how trees are a natural resource that comes from Earth and grows over time.\n4. Demonstrate understanding that some Earth events and processes happen very slowly, over many years.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about tree rings and activate prior knowledge about trees and time.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of wood log cross-sections (projected or printed large format)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: A real cross-section of a log or branch (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a large printout where all students can see clearly. Give students 30 seconds of quiet \"looking time\" before any talking.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (pause for hands-up responses; call on 3-4 students per question):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the circles you notice?\" *(Students should observe the rings, colors, and circles.)*\n   - \"What do you think made these circles? Why are some circles bigger and some smaller?\" *(Accept all hypotheses without judgment.)*\n   - \"Do you think these circles tell us something about how long this tree lived? Why or why not?\" *(Guide thinking toward time and growth.)*\n   - \"If each circle is one year, how could we know how old this tree was?\" *(Plant the seed that rings can be counted.)*\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder how many circles—or rings—this big tree had in its whole life. I wonder if we could count them all and figure out how old the tree was when someone cut it down.\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper with sketches. Highlight any mention of \"rings,\" \"circles,\" \"years,\" or \"age.\"\n\n**Transition:** \n\"You asked such great questions! Today, we're going to explore real tree pieces and learn what these rings mean. We might even become ring counters ourselves!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate tree rings hands-on and discover that rings relate to age and time.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 3-4 different cross-sections of logs or thick branches (can be real wood discs or high-quality printed photographs of cross-sections mounted on cardstock)\n- Rulers (inches or cm)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Paper for recording\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but recommended)\n- Small toothpicks or pencils for pointing at rings\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Teacher Setup:**  \nArrange students into groups of 3-4. Provide each group with 3 different log cross-sections (one large, one medium, one small). Label them A, B, and C but do NOT tell students which is oldest.\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud, then display visually):**\n\n1. \"Look carefully at your three wood pieces. Use your toothpick or pencil to point at the rings without touching the wood.\"\n\n2. \"Count the rings on piece A. Start from the very center and count outward, one ring at a time. If you lose count, start again. Write down your number on your paper.\"\n\n3. \"Do the same for pieces B and C. Write down how many rings each one has.\"\n\n4. \"On your paper, draw a picture of the piece with the MOST rings. Draw a picture of the piece with the FEWEST rings. Below your drawings, write (or have an adult write) which piece you think is oldest and which is youngest.\"\n\n5. \"Talk with your group: Does the biggest piece of wood always have the most rings? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to each group. Ask clarifying questions: *\"How many rings have you counted so far?\" \"Do you think you need to count again to double-check?\" \"Which piece looks like it has more rings—this one or that one?\"*\n- Do NOT tell students the answers or directly point out rings. If students struggle, ask: *\"Can you use your magnifying glass to see the rings better?\" or \"Let's count together out loud. You point, and I'll say the numbers.\"*\n- Encourage peer teaching: *\"Ask your group partner to help you count.\"*\n- Record on a clipboard which groups correctly correlate ring count to age; note any misconceptions (e.g., students thinking bigger = always more rings).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students count rings on at least two wood samples (some may accurately count; some may lose track—this is normal).\n- Students create drawings showing different wood pieces.\n- Students make an observation comparing ring count to age (even if they say something like, \"The one with more rings is older\").\n- Groups discuss whether size and age are always connected.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and establish the connection between rings, years, and tree age.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Markers\n- Photograph (projected or displayed again)\n- Optional: A simple diagram showing a tree cross-section with one ring highlighted for each year\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Invite group share-out** (5 minutes):\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their ring counts and which piece they thought was oldest. Record responses on chart paper.\n   - Display responses side by side: *Piece A: 8 rings | Piece B: 15 rings | Piece C: 5 rings.*\n   - Ask: \"Based on what you found, which tree lived the longest?\"\n\n2. **Teach the key concept** (7-10 minutes):\n   - Point to the photograph again. \"These circles are called **tree rings**. Here's the amazing thing: **Every year, a tree grows and adds ONE new ring.** One ring = one year.\"\n   - Use a simple analogy: *\"It's like a birthday candle. Every birthday, you get one more year older and one more candle. Trees work the same way—every year, one more ring!\"*\n   - Show or draw a simple diagram (even a basic circle with lines radiating outward). Label: \"This tree has 5 rings = This tree is 5 years old.\"\n   - Point back to the photograph: \"This tree is much, much older than 5 years. We can count ALL the rings to find out exactly how old it was.\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary** (3 minutes):\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|----------------------------|\n   | **Tree Ring** | A circle of wood that grows on a tree each year as the tree gets bigger. |\n   | **Growth** | When something gets bigger or older over time. |\n   | **Natural Resource** | Something from nature that we use, like wood from trees. |\n   | **Slowly** | Over a long, long time—not fast. |\n   | **Age** | How old something is. |\n\n4. **Check for Understanding** (2-3 minutes):\n   - Ask: *\"If I show you a tree ring picture, how could you figure out how old the tree was?\"* (Guide to: \"Count all the rings!\")\n   - Ask: *\"Is a tree growing fast or slowly?\"* (Guide to: \"Slowly—one ring per year, so it takes many years to get big.\")\n   - Ask: *\"What does the photograph show us about how long it takes a tree to grow?\"* (Guide to: \"It takes a very, very long time—these trees are much older than we are!\")\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart:**  \nWrite the five vocabulary terms and definitions on chart paper. Leave it posted for the remainder of the unit. Students can refer to it.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that one ring = one year of growth.\n- Students can explain (in simple words) that trees grow slowly, one ring per year.\n- Students recognize that counting rings tells you a tree's age.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by comparing tree ages and considering real-world connections to natural resources and time.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Three \"mystery trees\" shown as photograph prints or drawings of log cross-sections with clearly visible, countable rings (keep to 5-12 rings each for Second Grade)\n- Paper and pencils\n- Tree Ring Comparison Worksheet (simple version with pictures and numbers to fill in)\n- Optional: Pictures of a young tree, a medium tree, and an old tree\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario Introduction:**\n\"Imagine a park has three trees. A scientist cut down these three trees and counted the rings to learn how old they were. Let's be scientists and do the same!\"\n\n**Student Task:**\n\n1. **Show three \"mystery tree\" pictures** (labeled Mystery Tree 1, 2, and 3). \n   - Mystery Tree 1: 6 rings\n   - Mystery Tree 2: 10 rings  \n   - Mystery Tree 3: 8 rings\n\n2. \"Count the rings on each mystery tree. Write down the number of rings.\"\n\n3. \"Now, put the trees in order from youngest to oldest. Which tree is the baby? Which is the oldest grandparent?\"\n\n4. **Real-World Connection Prompt:**\n   \"Trees give us wood for things we use—like paper, pencils, building houses, and furniture. But trees take a very long time to grow. A tree that is 10 years old might only be this tall [show with hands about 2-3 feet]. Why do you think it's important not to cut down trees too fast? Turn and talk to your neighbor.\"\n\n5. **Facilitate whole-group discussion** on why we need to protect forests and let trees grow. Record student ideas: *\"Trees take a long, long time to grow,\" \"We use wood from trees,\" \"We need to wait for new trees to grow big,\"* etc.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate as students count, asking: *\"How many have you counted so far? Do you see any more?\"*\n- Guide the real-world conversation without imposing answers. Accept responses like \"We should plant new trees\" or \"We shouldn't cut down all the trees.\"\n- Connect back to the original photograph: *\"This is why cutting down so many trees is a big choice—it takes many, many years for new trees to grow and replace them.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students correctly count and order trees by age.\n- Students begin to understand that natural resources (like trees) take time to grow.\n- Students show emerging awareness of why we should care about trees and forests.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of tree rings, slow growth, and natural resources.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student ring counting during Explore phase. Record which students accurately count and which need support.\n- Listen to student responses during Explain discussions.\n- Review drawings and written answers from Explore and Elaborate activities.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) – Administer at the end of the lesson:**\n\nGive each student (or pair) a simple exit ticket with these questions. You may read aloud and students respond verbally, draw, or write with your support:\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n1. (Draw or point) **\"How many rings does this tree have?\"** *(Show a picture of a log cross-section with clearly countable rings—use 7 or 8 rings.)*\n2. **\"If a tree has 10 rings, how many years old is it?\"** *(Choices: 5 years / 10 years / 20 years)*\n3. **\"Does a tree grow fast or slow? Why?\"** *(Open-ended; accept \"slow\" and any explanation relating to rings/years.)*\n4. **\"What do we use trees for?\"** *(Open-ended; accept: wood, paper, pencils, etc.)*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- **Proficient:** Student correctly counts rings (within 1-2) and accurately states that ring count = age. Student identifies \"slow\" growth and provides a reason. Student names at least one use of trees.\n- **Developing:** Student counts rings with some inaccuracy (off by 3+) or hesitates but self-corrects. Student recognizes the ring-to-age connection with prompting. Student identifies growth as slow but may not explain why.\n- **Beginning:** Student is unable to accurately count rings; does not yet connect rings to age without significant support.\n\n**How to Use Results:**\n- **Proficient students:** Ready for Extension Activities; can serve as peer teachers.\n- **Developing students:** Provide a follow-up review session with real or printed rings; have them recount with one-on-one support.\n- **Beginning students:** Provide concrete, tactile practice with large, clearly marked ring diagrams; consider pairing with Proficient students for peer learning.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Reduce Ring Count:** Provide wood samples or diagrams with only 4-6 rings for initial practice, rather than 10-15. This builds confidence and accuracy.\n\n2. **Use Tactile/Visual Markers:** Use small stickers or finger paint dots on the center of a printed ring diagram. Have students touch each dot as they count, promoting one-to-one correspondence and reducing miscounting.\n\n3. **Pair with a Peer or Adult:** Assign a Proficient student or classroom aide to work alongside the struggling learner during Explore and Elaborate phases. The peer/adult can model ring-counting strategies and provide encouragement.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Ring Thickness Variation:** Provide samples of wood with rings of different thicknesses. Ask: *\"What do you notice about the thick rings versus thin rings? What might cause a ring to be thick or thin?\"* (Guide toward the idea that thick rings mean the tree grew more that year, possibly due to good weather and rain; thin rings might mean drought or stress—connecting to ESS2-1 about environmental factors.)\n\n2. **Predict Real-World Scenarios:** Give advanced students scenarios: *\"A forest fire happened 3 years ago in this forest. Look at this tree's rings. Which rings might be thinner because of the fire? How would we know?\"* This promotes critical thinking about how external events affect growth patterns.\n\n3. **Create a \"Tree Timeline\":** Have students create a visual timeline showing a tree growing from year 1 to year 12, drawing the tree larger each year and adding a ring each year. Then, they write or draw what happened to Earth (weather, animals, people) during each of those 12 years, connecting tree growth to historical time.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Bring in a Real Tree Cross-Section (if possible):**  \n   Contact a local arborist, tree service, or park department to request a freshly cut cross-section of a tree. Students can examine and count rings on an authentic specimen. Take photographs and add to your classroom nature journal.\n\n2. **Plant a Seed and Predict Growth:**  \n   Start a bean or sunflower seed in a clear cup. Over several weeks, measure and record how much the plant grows each week. Create a simple bar graph showing growth over time. Discuss: *\"If this plant lived for 10 years like a tree, how big do you think it would be? How many 'rings' might it have?\"*\n\n3. **Interview a Tree Caretaker:**  \n   Invite a local gardener, arborist, or park ranger to visit the classroom (virtually or in-person) to discuss tree care, growth rates, and why protecting forests matters. Students prepare 2-3 questions in advance. This deepens understanding of trees as natural resources and living systems.\n\n---\n\n## Connections to Other Lessons (Optional Guidance)\n\n- **Future ESS2-1 Lesson:** Expand into how environmental factors (water, sunlight, soil) affect ring thickness and tree health—connecting slow environmental change to observable patterns.\n- **Literacy Connection:** Read aloud *\"The Biggest Tree\"* by Linda White or *\"Crinkle Root's Guide to Knowing the Trees\"* by Jill McDonald to deepen tree knowledge.\n- **Math Connection:** Create a classroom graph comparing ring counts of all wood samples examined; practice counting and ordering numbers.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Tips\n\n- **Preparation:** If you don't have access to real wood discs, print high-resolution images of tree rings and mount them on heavy cardstock. Laminate them for durability and repeated use.\n- **Pacing:** You may extend this lesson across three 30-minute sessions (Engage + start Explore | Explore + Explain | Elaborate + Evaluate) if time is limited.\n- **Safety Note:** If using real wood samples, ensure there are no sharp edges or splinters. Sand or seal edges if needed.\n- **Language Support:** Pre-teach vocabulary words (ring, growth, slow, year) with visual aids for English learners or students with language delays.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly addresses NGSS 2-ESS1-1 by providing multiple sources of evidence (the photograph, the wood samples, student observations) that Earth events—specifically tree growth—can occur slowly (over many years). It also lays groundwork for ESS2-1 by exploring how natural resources are formed over time and how we might \"slow or prevent\" damage to them through sustainable practices.**",
