  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Severe Weather and Storm Safety\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Weather Patterns and Severe Conditions:** Dark storm clouds indicate changing atmospheric conditions that can bring severe weather; students can observe visual signs that help predict dangerous weather approaching.\n- **Weather Hazards and Their Impacts:** Severe storms pose risks to communities; understanding what makes weather \"hazardous\" helps students recognize when to take protective action.\n- **Preparation and Design Solutions:** Communities use infrastructure (power lines, street lights, buildings, roads) that must be designed to withstand or protect against severe weather impacts.\n- **Observable Weather Indicators:** Dark, thick clouds, wind patterns, and atmospheric changes are visible clues that weather is changing and severe conditions may develop.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Storm Watch: Reading the Sky and Staying Safe**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or one 90-minute block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** 3-ESS2-1, 3-ESS3-1\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify and describe visual signs in the sky that indicate severe weather is approaching.\n2. Represent weather observations in a simple table or chart to track weather changes over time.\n3. Explain why certain community structures and safety plans help protect people during severe storms.\n4. Make a claim about one design solution that reduces harm from severe weather, using evidence from observations or research.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about severe weather by examining the photograph and connecting it to student experiences.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital display of the photograph\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Ask students to sit in a circle or gathering area.\n\n2. **Pose initial observation questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the sky in this picture? What color is it?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen clouds that look like these? What happened next?\"\n   - \"What do you think the people in this town should do right now? Why?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the street lights are already turned on even though it looks like daytime?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations** on chart paper without correcting. This reveals prior knowledge and misconceptions.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what signs in the sky tell us that a big storm is coming, and how communities stay safe when storms arrive.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become storm detectives. We'll learn how to read the sky's warning signs and discover how people protect their communities from severe weather.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate weather indicators and design/evaluate community safety solutions through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Access to real images or video clips of severe weather (dark storm clouds, heavy rain, wind) — search \"severe storm photos\" or use school science resource site\n- Drawing paper or digital drawing tool\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: Weather data from past month (temperature, precipitation, cloud cover)\n- Simple worksheet: \"Weather Observation Chart\" with columns for Date, Sky Description, Wind, Temperature (observed), Hazard Signs\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Sky Detective Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show students 3-4 additional photographs or short video clips** of severe weather approaching (dark clouds building, lightning, heavy rain).\n\n2. **Ask:** \"What do you see changing in the sky? How is it different from a normal sunny day?\"\n\n3. **Have students work in pairs.** Distribute the \"Weather Observation Chart\" worksheet. \n\n4. **Direct students:** \"Look at each image. In the first column, write or draw what the sky looks like. In the second column, draw what you think the wind might be doing. In the third column, mark any signs that this could be dangerous weather.\"\n\n5. **Students record observations** using words, drawings, or both. Emphasize that scientists observe carefully.\n\n**Part B: Safety Solution Design (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Transition:** \"Now we know the signs of severe weather. But how do communities stay safe? Let's design something that could protect people or buildings.\"\n\n2. **Show the original photograph again.** Point out: power lines, street lights, sturdy buildings, paved roads, clear areas.\n\n3. **Provide small groups with a scenario card:**\n   - *Scenario A:* \"A severe thunderstorm with lightning is coming. What should buildings have to keep people safe?\"\n   - *Scenario B:* \"High winds are coming. How should we design or protect power lines?\"\n   - *Scenario C:* \"Heavy rain and flooding are possible. What should streets have to keep water moving?\"\n\n4. **Students sketch a solution** to their assigned problem on paper, labeling key parts.\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate, ask clarifying questions (\"Why did you choose that?\"), record student thinking, and encourage students to explain their reasoning without leading them to \"correct\" answers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Completed weather observation charts showing identified hazard signs\n- Sketched designs with labels showing one solution to a weather hazard\n- Verbal explanations connecting their design to protection (e.g., \"Lightning rods catch lightning so it doesn't hit the building\")\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary, clarify concepts, and connect exploration to scientific understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Student sketches and observation charts from Explore phase\n- Picture cards or posters showing: severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, flooding, wind damage\n- Vocabulary reference sheet (printed or displayed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 2-3 pairs to share their weather observations. Ask the class: \"Do you agree? Did anyone see different signs?\" Build consensus on observable storm indicators.\n\n2. **Display safety solution sketches.** Invite groups to present briefly: \"We designed ___ because ___.\" Affirm all attempts.\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** using the photograph and student work:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Severe Weather:** Dangerous weather conditions that can cause harm to people, animals, or property (examples: thunderstorms with lightning, tornadoes, heavy rain that floods).\n   - **Hazard:** Something that can cause danger or harm. A severe storm is a weather hazard.\n   - **Weather Signs/Indicators:** Observable changes in the sky and atmosphere that show weather is changing (dark clouds, wind, lightning, heavy rain).\n   - **Weather-Related Hazard:** A dangerous natural weather event that affects a community (storms, flooding, high winds).\n   - **Design Solution:** A plan or structure built to solve a problem or reduce danger (lightning rods, storm drains, reinforced buildings).\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:** \n   - \"The dark sky in this picture is a weather indicator — it's telling us dangerous weather is close.\"\n   - \"The street lights that are on help people see and stay safe.\"\n   - \"The buildings and power lines are designed to handle strong winds and rain from storms.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask students to **show a thumbs-up, thumbs-middle, or thumbs-down** to indicate understanding:\n     - Thumbs-up: \"I can name 2-3 signs that a severe storm is coming.\"\n     - Thumbs-middle: \"I can name 1 sign, but need help with more.\"\n     - Thumbs-down: \"I'm not sure what signs to look for yet.\"\n   - Reteach briefly with struggling students using simpler language and the photo.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students use vocabulary in sentence frames: \"A severe storm is _____.\" \"A hazard is _____.\"\n- Students can identify 2-3 weather signs in photographs that indicate dangerous conditions.\n- Students explain one reason communities design buildings or structures to handle severe weather.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply weather and safety concepts to real-world community scenarios and deepen understanding of design solutions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or poster board\n- Markers, colored pencils, pictures from magazines or printed images\n- Sentence frame poster (displayed):\n  - \"If a severe _____ is coming, communities can _____.\"\n  - \"A good design solution is _____ because it _____.\"\n- Optional: Photos of actual community safety features (storm shelters, drainage systems, early warning sirens, flood barriers)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Community Safety Plan Poster**\n\n1. **Divide class into small groups.** Assign each group a severe weather scenario:\n   - Severe Thunderstorm with Lightning\n   - Tornado\n   - Heavy Flooding from Rain\n   - Strong Straight-Line Winds\n\n2. **Direct students:** \"Your job is to create a poster that shows how your community stays safe from your assigned weather hazard. Draw or paste pictures of: What the hazard looks like, What people should do, What buildings or designs help protect the community.\"\n\n3. **Provide sentence frame support:** \"If a _____ is coming, our community can _____.\"\n\n4. **Students create and annotate** their posters collaboratively.\n\n**Option B: \"Rate the Solution\" Activity**\n\n1. **Show 3 design ideas** for protecting a community from severe storms (e.g., a shallow ditch to prevent flooding, a deep storm drain system, a sloped road; or: cloth roof vs. metal roof on a building, tall unprotected power lines vs. power lines in conduit).\n\n2. **Facilitate a simple claim-and-evidence discussion:**\n   - \"Which solution is better and why?\"\n   - Students make a claim: \"Solution A is better for severe storms.\"\n   - Students provide evidence from what they observed in the photograph or learned: \"Because it protects people by _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Facilitate group work by asking, \"Why did you choose that solution?\"\n- Ensure all group members contribute.\n- Encourage students to use vocabulary from the Explain phase.\n- Record student thinking to inform evaluation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Completed community safety posters with drawings/labels of at least one design solution\n- Verbal or written claims about which solution is best with simple evidence (\"Because it stops flooding\")\n- Application of vocabulary to real community contexts\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students achieved the learning objectives through formative and summative evaluation.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observe student participation during Engage discussion and check for prior misconceptions.\n- Review weather observation charts from Explore for accuracy of identified hazard signs.\n- Monitor group conversations during Elaborate to hear if students use vocabulary and make simple claims with evidence.\n- Use thumbs-up/middle/down check during Explain to identify students needing support.\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket. Read the questions aloud and allow drawing or writing responses:\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n1. **Draw or describe** what the sky looks like when a severe storm is coming. (Label at least one weather sign.)\n2. **Name one design solution** that helps keep communities safe from severe weather. (Can be from poster work or photograph study.)\n3. **Complete this sentence:** \"A weather hazard is _____.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ **Proficient:** Student identifies 2+ observable weather signs (dark clouds, wind, lightning, heavy rain); names one community design solution with brief explanation; defines hazard accurately.\n- ✓ **Developing:** Student identifies 1 weather sign; names a design solution but explanation is unclear; definition of hazard is partially correct.\n- ✓ **Beginning:** Student struggles to identify weather signs or name solutions; needs reteaching and support.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show students can recognize observable severe weather indicators.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that communities use design solutions (buildings, drainage, warning systems, power line protection) to reduce harm from weather hazards.\n- Vocabulary use is emerging and age-appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for students who are struggling):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Reference Card:** Provide a visual card with pictures and words for key terms (dark clouds = storm coming; lightning = danger; drain = water moving away). Allow student to reference during activities.\n\n2. **Observation Chart with Pictures:** Instead of blank charts, provide pre-drawn images of different weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, stormy, rainy) for students to circle or point to rather than draw independently.\n\n3. **Sentence Frame Scaffolding:** Provide multiple choice options for design solutions:\n   - \"Communities stay safe by:  _____ (choosing buildings / painting roads / adding more trees)\"\n   - Pair students with a stronger peer for poster creation.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research Extension:** Provide 2-3 printed articles or video clips about how a real community (their town, a nearby city, or a notable location) prepared for or responded to a specific severe weather event (hurricane, tornado, flood). Ask students: \"How did their design solutions work? What could they improve?\" Students create a \"Improvement Plan\" poster.\n\n2. **Multiple Hazards Analysis:** Give students a complex scenario: \"Your community might face thunderstorms, flooding, AND high winds. Design ONE solution that helps with all three.\" Requires higher-level thinking about multi-purpose designs.\n\n3. **Data Interpretation:** Provide a simple data table showing temperature and precipitation amounts during a storm event (or hypothetical data). Students graph the data and make predictions: \"What would happen if the rainfall was even heavier?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Storm Safety Interview Project:** Students interview a family member, firefighter, or community leader about what they do to prepare for or stay safe during severe weather. Students create a poster or write 3 sentences about what they learned. Share findings with class.\n\n2. **Weather Watching Journal:** Over 2-3 weeks, students keep a daily weather observation log (simple chart: date, sky description, temperature, any signs of storms). Students create a line graph or table showing weather patterns. Discuss: \"Did we see any hazard signs? When did they occur?\"\n\n3. **Design Your Own Shelter:** Students receive the challenge: \"Design a shelter or building that can stay safe during severe storms. What materials would you use? Draw a picture and label the parts that protect people.\" Encourage creativity while using scientific reasoning.\n\n4. **Community Helpers Role Play:** Set up a dramatic play station where students role-play as meteorologists giving storm warnings, emergency responders, or community members preparing. Use language and concepts from the lesson in authentic contexts.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
