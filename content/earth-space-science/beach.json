    "grade5": "## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis detailed photograph captures a ghost crab (Ocypode quadrata) on a sandy beach substrate. The crab exhibits a tan, sandy-colored exoskeleton providing exceptional camouflage against the beach sediment. Its stalked compound eyes are positioned dorsally, and its chelae (claws) are visible anteriorly. The crab is positioned adjacent to a burrow entrance in the sand. The surrounding substrate displays fine granular texture with small shell fragments, organic debris, and varied grain sizes characteristic of beach sediment. Ghost crabs are nocturnal organisms demonstrating remarkable behavioral and morphological adaptations to sandy intertidal zones.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image illustrates coastal geomorphology, sedimentology, and biological adaptation in beach ecosystems. Beach sand represents unconsolidated sediment composed of mineral and biogenic particles that have undergone extensive weathering, erosion, and transport processes over geological time scales. The fine texture visible results from continuous mechanical weathering through wave action - hydraulic forces repeatedly fracture and abrade larger materials into progressively smaller particles. Grain characteristics (size, shape, sorting, composition) reflect source lithology, transport distance, and energy conditions. Chemical weathering also contributes through dissolution and alteration of minerals. Ghost crabs function as ecosystem engineers - their burrowing creates three-dimensional habitat structure, enhances sediment oxygenation, increases infiltration rates, and facilitates nutrient cycling through bioturbation. The crab's cryptic coloration represents an evolutionary adaptation - natural selection has favored phenotypes matching substrate color, reducing predation by visual hunters (shorebirds, gulls). Beaches represent dynamic transitional environments continuously modified by wave energy, tidal cycles, longshore currents, and storm events.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Sedimentology and Weathering**: Sand forms through mechanical weathering (physical breakdown), chemical weathering (alteration/dissolution), and biological weathering of parent materials over extended timeframes. Grain characteristics reflect source rock composition, transport mechanisms, and depositional environment.\n2. **Coastal Geomorphology**: Beaches are shaped by complex interactions between wave energy, sediment supply, tidal range, coastal geometry, and sea level. Erosion (sediment removal) and deposition (sediment accumulation) continuously reshape coastal landforms.\n3. **Evolutionary Adaptations**: Organisms evolve traits enhancing survival and reproduction in specific environments. Ghost crab camouflage demonstrates natural selection acting on heritable variation in coloration.\n4. **Ecosystem Engineering**: Organisms that physically modify environments, creating or altering habitats utilized by other species. Bioturbation by burrowing organisms affects sediment properties, biogeochemical cycles, and community structure.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nImplement a comprehensive \"Coastal Sedimentology Investigation\"!

Students create detailed data tables, calculate percentages, and graph results. Facilitate weathering experiments: use rock samples in jars with water, shake vigorously over multiple sessions, measure sediment accumulation, photograph grain size reduction over time.
