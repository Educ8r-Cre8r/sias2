ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about the sun and daily patterns using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital display of the sunrise photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: projector or interactive board\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the sunrise photograph prominently on the board or screen. Do not immediately identify it as a sunrise.\n\n2. Ask students to sit in a circle or gather where everyone can see the image clearly.\n\n3. Ask the following discussion questions (pause for student responses after each):\n   - **\"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the colors you notice?\"** (Look for students to mention orange, pink, red, yellow, blue, and gray colors in the sky.)\n   - **\"Where is the sun in this picture? How do you know?\"** (Guide students to observe the bright colors on the horizon where the sun appears to be.)\n   - **\"What time of day do you think this is? What clues help you figure it out?\"** (Encourage observation of the darkness in the sky compared to midday brightness, the position of the sun low on the horizon.)\n   - **\"Have you ever seen the sky look like this? When? What were you doing?\"** (Activate prior knowledge about their own experiences with sunrise or sunset.)\n\n4. Present a prediction prompt: **\"The sun looks different at different times of the day. I wonder what it would look like if we watched the sun all day long. What do you think will happen to the sun and the sky as the day goes on?\"**\n\n5. Record student predictions on chart paper to return to later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Let's discover what really happens to the sun and sky by watching it change throughout our day together.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover daily patterns of the sun's movement through observation and hands-on modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large styrofoam or foam ball (or orange/yellow ball) to represent Earth\n- Flashlight or small lamp to represent the sun\n- Dark room or area with dimmed lights\n- Chart paper and colored pencils or markers\n- Observation notebook for each student (can be a simple worksheet or journal page)\n- Optional: mirrors to reflect light and observe angles\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Part 1: Observe and Record Sky Patterns (10 minutes)**\n   - Distribute observation notebooks to each student.\n   - Show the sunrise photograph again and have students draw what they see in their notebooks. They should label the sun, sky, clouds, and land.\n   - Ask: \"What colors do you see? Where is the sun? Is the sun high or low in the sky?\" Students sketch and color their observations.\n\n2. **Part 2: Model the Sun's Movement (12-15 minutes)**\n   - In a dimmed or dark space, hold up the foam ball to represent Earth.\n   - Explain: \"This ball is Earth. We live on Earth. Watch what happens when the sun shines on different parts of Earth.\"\n   - Shine the flashlight (sun) on one side of the ball. Ask: \"Where is the sun shining? What happens to that part of Earth?\" (It gets light.)\n   - Slowly rotate the ball while keeping the flashlight steady, showing how different parts of Earth get light as it turns.\n   - Explain: \"As Earth slowly turns, the sun appears to move across the sky. This happens very slowly, over many hours. In the morning, the sun rises low in the east. As the day goes on, the sun slowly moves higher in the sky.\"\n   - Show how the light on the ball gets brighter or dimmer depending on the angle, connecting this to the colors in the photograph (dimmer = orange/pink; brighter = white).\n\n3. **Part 3: Draw a Model of Daily Sun Movement (5 minutes)**\n   - Back in normal classroom lighting, students draw a simple landscape (like in the photograph) showing the sun at three different times: sunrise, midday, and sunset.\n   - They label each position with the time and use colors to show how the sky looks at each time.\n   - Students record one observation about how the sun's position changes: \"The sun starts _____, moves to _____, and ends _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the model demonstration without immediately explaining it; let students observe and make connections.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the light? Which direction is the sun shining from? Does the sun stay in one place?\"\n- Listen to student language and gently introduce the term \"rotate\" or \"turn\" in context.\n- Circulate during drawing activity and ask: \"Why did you color the sky differently at each time?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create drawings showing the sun at different positions during the day.\n- Students verbally describe that the sun appears to move across the sky.\n- Students recognize that the colors and brightness of the sky change as the sun's position changes.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to concepts about daily patterns and slow Earth events.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms written out\n- Colored markers\n- Sunrise photograph (printed or displayed)\n- Student observation notebooks from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share and Discuss Observations (5-7 minutes)**\n   - Gather students and invite 3-4 volunteers to share their drawings and observations from the Explore phase.\n   - Ask the group: \"What did you notice about where the sun was in each drawing? What was the same? What was different?\"\n   - Connect their observations back to the original photograph: \"In this sunrise picture, the sun is just beginning to come up. Based on what you discovered, what do you think will happen next?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8-10 minutes)**\n   - Write and display each vocabulary term. Use the photograph and student drawings as visual references.\n   - **Sunrise:** The time each day when the sun appears on the eastern horizon in the morning and the sky gets bright. Show on the photograph where sunrise is happening.\n   - **Sunset:** The time each day when the sun appears to drop below the western horizon in the evening and the sky gets dark. Ask: \"What if we turned this photograph around? That would be sunset.\"\n   - **Rotation:** The slow turning of Earth. Show this with the foam ball model again briefly. \"Earth rotates, or spins, all the time—but it happens so slowly we can't feel it moving. It takes 24 hours for Earth to make one complete turn.\"\n   - **Horizon:** The line where the land meets the sky; where we can see the sun rise and set. Point to the horizon in the photograph.\n   - **Pattern:** Something that happens again and again in the same way. \"Sunrise happens every morning. Sunset happens every evening. This is a pattern.\"\n\n3. **Make Connections Back to the Photograph and Model (2-3 minutes)**\n   - Hold up the photograph again: \"This is a sunrise. The sun is low on the horizon. As Earth rotates, the sun will appear to move higher and higher in the sky. This is a slow event—it happens over many hours.\"\n   - Reference 2-ESS1-1: \"We are observing an Earth event. Sunrise happens slowly—not all at once. It takes time for the sun to rise and for the sky to get bright. We can predict that tomorrow, the sun will rise again in the same way.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2-3 minutes)**\n   - Ask students to show thumbs up, middle, or down to answer: \"Do you understand what 'sunrise' means? Can you tell me what happens during sunrise?\" (Invite 1-2 students to respond.)\n   - \"What do you think will happen next after this sunrise is over?\" (Guide answers toward: the sun will move higher, the sky will get brighter, the day will continue.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Sunrise** | The time in the morning when the sun appears over the horizon and the sky gets bright. |\n| **Sunset** | The time in the evening when the sun appears to sink below the horizon and the sky gets dark. |\n| **Rotation** | When something spins or turns. Earth rotates, which makes the sun appear to move across the sky. |\n| **Horizon** | The line far away where the land meets the sky. This is where we see the sun rise and set. |\n| **Pattern** | Something that happens again and again in the same way. Sunrise and sunset happen in a pattern every day. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define sunrise and understand it is a slow, daily event.\n- Students recognize that Earth's rotation causes the sun to appear to move.\n- Students can identify the horizon in the photograph and in real life.\n- Students understand that sunrise, sunset, and daily sun movement form a predictable pattern.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of daily sun patterns by predicting, observing real sunrises or sunsets, and connecting to the landscape shown in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Calendar or chart for tracking sunrise/sunset observations\n- Drawing paper and colored pencils\n- Optional: photos or pictures of landscapes at different times of day\n- Optional: access to a window with an eastern or western view\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Real-World Observation Plan (Recommended)**\n\n1. Explain: \"Scientists observe the sun and sky every day to learn about patterns. You're going to be sun scientists! You can observe the sunrise or sunset at home with your family.\"\n\n2. Send home a simple observation sheet (one-page) that includes:\n   - A place to draw what they see\n   - Boxes to check: \"I saw the sun low on the horizon. The sky was orange/pink/red. It was quiet/busy.\"\n   - A line to complete: \"I observed the sunrise/sunset at _____ o'clock.\"\n   - Instructions for a parent/guardian to sign off\n\n3. Back in class, create a \"Sunrise/Sunset Observation Chart\" on the wall where students can add their drawings or write about their observations.\n\n4. Ask students: \"Did anyone see a sunrise or sunset? What did the sky look like? What colors did you see? How was it like the picture we saw in class?\"\n\n**Option B: Classroom Landscape Comparison (If real observation is not possible)**\n\n1. Show students 3-4 pictures of the same landscape photographed at different times of day (sunrise, midday, late afternoon/sunset).\n\n2. Ask: \"How is this place different at different times? What changed? What stayed the same?\"\n\n3. Students create a three-panel comic strip or timeline showing the same landscape at sunrise, midday, and sunset, using colors to show how the light and sky change.\n\n4. Students write or dictate one sentence for each panel: \"At sunrise, the sky is _____ and the sun is _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate family communication about home observations.\n- Celebrate each observation shared, asking follow-up questions.\n- Help students notice patterns: \"Many of you saw orange and pink colors. Why do you think the sky is those colors at sunrise?\"\n- Connect observations back to the lesson concepts: \"You observed a slow Earth event—the sun rising. This is the same pattern we see every day.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe or research sunrise/sunset in real contexts.\n- Students create visual representations showing how the landscape and sky change throughout the day.\n- Students make predictions about what the sky will look like at a specific future time based on patterns.\n- Students recognize that the sunrise in the photograph follows the same pattern they observe in their own environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of daily sun patterns, sunrise as a slow Earth event, and their ability to predict and describe these patterns.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Monitor student drawings and descriptions of the sun's changing position. Do they show the sun at different heights? Do they use appropriate color changes?\n- **Questioning during Explain:** Listen for student responses to vocabulary checks. Can they use terms like \"sunrise,\" \"horizon,\" and \"pattern\" correctly?\n- **Observation during Elaborate:** Review home observation sheets or classroom-created landscape drawings. Do they show evidence of understanding how the sun and sky change?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson or Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with one of these options (or all three, for a comprehensive assessment):\n\n**Option 1: Drawn Response**\n- Prompt: \"Draw the sunrise from our photograph. Label the sun, the horizon, and the sky. Use colors to show what you saw.\"\n- Success Criteria: Student draws a clear horizon, positions sun low on the horizon, uses warm colors (orange, pink, red), and labels at least two elements correctly.\n\n**Option 2: Written/Oral Response**\n- Prompt: \"Tell me or write: What is a sunrise? When does it happen? Why does the sun appear to move across the sky?\"\n- Success Criteria: Student identifies sunrise as a morning event; states that Earth rotates (spins) or turns; uses the word \"slowly\" to describe the event; demonstrates understanding that sunrise is a predictable pattern.\n\n**Option 3: Prediction Task**\n- Prompt: \"Look at this picture of sunrise. What will the sky look like one hour from now? Draw it and explain why you think that.\"\n- Success Criteria: Student shows the sun higher in the sky; uses lighter, brighter colors (yellows, whites); provides a reason that references the sun moving or Earth rotating.\n\n**Success Criteria for All Students:**\n- Demonstrates understanding that sunrise is when the sun appears and the sky gets bright.\n- Shows awareness that the sun's position changes throughout the day (slow event).\n- Can identify the horizon and sun in the photograph.\n- Uses color and position to show that the sky and light change during sunrise.\n- Applies vocabulary appropriately (sunrise, horizon, pattern, or rotation).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will correctly identify and describe a sunrise and its characteristics.\n- Most students will explain that the sun appears to move (connecting to Earth's rotation, though second graders may use simpler language like \"the sun moves\").\n- Students will demonstrate the ability to predict what happens next in a daily sun cycle.\n- All students will provide evidence of observing and understanding a slow, predictable Earth event.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Focus on core terms only: sunrise, sunset, sun, sky, and horizon. Introduce \"rotation\" only through the model demonstration without requiring students to use the term independently. Accept simpler descriptions: \"The sun goes up and down\" instead of \"Earth rotates.\"\n\n2. **Scaffolded Drawing and Labeling:** Provide students with pre-drawn landscape outlines with blanks to fill in (sun, horizon, clouds). Allow them to point to and name features of the photograph rather than draw from memory. Provide color-word labels (orange, pink, blue) to choose from when describing the sky.\n\n3. **Concrete Model Reinforcement:** Repeat the foam ball/flashlight model multiple times throughout the lesson. Let students hold the ball and shine the light themselves to tactilely experience the rotation concept. Use consistent language: \"The sun appears to move because Earth is turning.\"\n\n4. **Paired Observation:** During Elaborate phase, pair struggling learners with a peer or conduct a small group observation together rather than sending an independent home task.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Time Tracking:** Invite students to observe and track the sunrise or sunset over multiple days using a calendar chart. Ask: \"Does the sun rise in the same place every day? Does it take the same amount of time? Do you notice any differences?\" Students can create a data chart showing their observations and look for patterns across a week or month.\n\n2. **Model Refinement:** Challenge students to use the foam ball/flashlight model to explain other concepts: Why is it dark on one side of Earth while it's light on the other? Why do we have different seasons? Why can we only see stars at night? Create a more detailed model that shows day/night or seasons.\n\n3. **Comparative Analysis:** Provide images of sunrises and sunsets from different locations (desert, ocean, mountains, city) and ask: \"How are these sunrises similar? How are they different? Why might the colors be different in different places?\" Students can research and create a poster or presentation comparing sunrise conditions.\n\n4. **Real Data:** Introduce a simple sunrise/sunset time chart or app showing official sunrise times for your location. Ask: \"When will the sun rise tomorrow? Next week? Why do you think the time changes?\" Students can make predictions and test them, connecting to the concept that patterns can be used for prediction.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Sun Path\" Floor Model:** Use a long rope or chalk line on the classroom floor or playground to show the sun's path across the sky from east to west. Have students stand at different points along the path and describe what time of day it is at their location. Repeat on different days and note if the path changes (seasonal variation). This connects to 2-ESS1-1 (patterns of Earth events) and introduces the idea that patterns can predict outcomes.\n\n2. **Sunrise/Sunset Journal:** Create a multi-week classroom project where students observe and sketch the sunrise or sunset (or a designated time sky view) once a week for 4-6 weeks. Document the date, time, colors, and cloud formations. Create a class \"Sky Pattern Book\" and look for patterns in colors, cloud types, or sun position over time. This deepens understanding of predictable patterns in Earth events.\n\n3. **Landscape Around Us:** Photograph the same spot from your classroom window (or a designated outdoor location) at three different times of day (early morning, midday, late afternoon). Display these photos in sequence and have students compare the light, shadows, colors, and landscape features. Connect this to 2-ESS2-2 (shapes and kinds of land) by noting how the same landscape looks different depending on the sun's position, but the land itself doesn't change—only the light does.\n\n---",
