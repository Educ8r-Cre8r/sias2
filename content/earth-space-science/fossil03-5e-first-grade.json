ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about rocks and what they might contain.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of fossil printed large (11\" × 14\" or displayed via projector)\n- Real rocks collected from outside (5-7 smooth and varied rocks, passed around in a small basket)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Introduce:** Show the large photograph without explanation. Pass around 2-3 plain rocks from the basket as students sit in a circle and examine them (30 seconds each).\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see when you look at this rock in the picture?\" *(Point to the center fossil.)*\n   - \"Does this look like a rock you've ever found? What's different about it?\"\n   - \"What do you think made this pattern inside the rock? Could it be from something that was alive?\"\n   - \"If rocks come from the ground, what else might be hiding inside rocks?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \n   - Display the fossil photo again. Say: \"This rock has something special inside it. It's called a **fossil**. Today, we're going to become rock detectives and learn about the stories rocks tell. What do YOU think we'll discover?\"\n   - Record 2-3 student predictions on chart paper (e.g., \"A dinosaur was stuck in it,\" \"An animal left a mark\").\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Scientists study rocks to find out what animals and plants lived a very, very long time ago. Let's explore rocks like real scientists and find out what they can tell us.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rocks and fossil imprints through tactile exploration and model-making.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 6-8 smooth, varied rocks (one per student or pair)\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per 2 students)\n- Chart/observation sheet with simple labeled drawings (pre-drawn): different rock types, with lines for observations\n- Modeling clay (air-dry or regular, one 2-oz ball per student)\n- Small plastic or toy animals/insects (ants, beetles, snails—optional but helpful)\n- Paper plates\n- Pencils and crayons\n\n**Activity — Two-Part Investigation:**\n\n**Part A: Rock Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute Materials:** Give each student or pair a rock and magnifying glass.\n\n2. **Student Directions (read aloud and demonstrate):**\n   - \"Look closely at your rock with the magnifying glass. Is it smooth or bumpy? What color is it? Can you see any lines, stripes, or marks on it?\"\n   - \"Feel your rock. Is it heavy or light? Rough or smooth?\"\n   - \"Talk to your partner: Does your rock remind you of anything? Does it look like it could have something hiding inside?\"\n\n3. **Documentation:** Students draw or color on the observation sheet what they see. Teacher circulates and asks: \"What textures do you feel? Do you see any patterns?\"\n\n**Part B: Make Your Own Fossil (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Demonstrate First:** \n   - Place a small plastic animal on a paper plate.\n   - Press gently into a ball of clay. Show students the imprint left behind.\n   - Remove the animal. Say: \"This is how fossils form! Over millions of years, dead animals get pressed into soft mud and rock. The imprint they leave behind is a fossil—a clue that the animal was here long ago.\"\n\n2. **Student Directions:**\n   - \"Roll your clay into a ball about the size of a golf ball.\"\n   - \"Press your toy animal (or your finger, or a leaf) into the clay gently. Press hard enough to make a mark, but don't push all the way through.\"\n   - \"Carefully lift the animal away. Look at the imprint left behind—that's YOUR fossil!\"\n   - \"Draw a picture of your fossil on your paper plate and label it with the animal's name or what left the mark.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What shape is your imprint?\" \"Does it look like the animal that made it?\" \"How long do you think it would take for this to turn into real rock?\"\n- Encourage students to compare imprints: \"Is your fossil the same as your neighbor's?\"\n- Resist telling students the \"right\" answer—allow discovery.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce a clay fossil model with visible impressions.\n- Students observe and record details about real rocks.\n- Students begin to understand that imprints in materials can preserve shapes of living things.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts; connect Explore discoveries to the original photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Fossil photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary\n- Real fossils or fossil replicas (if available, optional)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share and Compare (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 students to show their clay fossils to the group.\n   - Ask: \"What animal or thing made your fossil? How do you know?\"\n   - Point out similarities: \"Look—everyone's fossils show the shape of what pressed into them. Real fossils in the ground work the same way!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Display words on chart paper with simple drawings:\n\n   | **Vocabulary** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Fossil** | A mark or imprint left in a rock that shows us what a plant or animal looked like a long, long time ago. |\n   | **Rock** | A hard, solid object that comes from the Earth. Rocks can be different colors, sizes, and textures. |\n   | **Imprint** | A shape or mark pressed into something soft (like clay or mud) that shows what pressed into it. |\n   | **Natural** | Something that comes from nature and was not made by people. Rocks are natural. |\n   | **Evidence** | A clue that helps us learn something. Fossils are evidence that animals lived long ago. |\n\n   - **Teaching Tip:** Point to the fossil photograph. Trace your finger over the imprint. Say: \"This is a **fossil**—see the **imprint**? It shows us an animal that lived on Earth long, long ago. This is **evidence**. It's a clue!\"\n\n3. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Can you point to the fossil in this picture?\" *(Students point.)*\n   - \"What do you think this **imprint** tells us?\" *(Accept responses like \"An animal was here\" or \"Something pressed into the rock.\")*\n   - \"Is the fossil a **natural** object? Why?\" *(Yes—it came from Earth, not made by people.)*\n\n4. **Connect to Real World:**\n   - Show pictures of a paleontologist (if available) or simply explain: \"Scientists called paleontologists dig up rocks with fossils inside. They study fossils to learn about animals and plants that lived before people. Your clay fossils helped you think like a paleontologist!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the term **fossil** correctly to describe an imprint in a rock.\n- Students understand that fossils are evidence of living things from long ago.\n- Students recognize that rocks come from Earth and can preserve imprints.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply concepts to a new context; deepen understanding through sorting, prediction, and storytelling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 10-15 rocks of varying types (with and without visible fossils or imprint possibilities)\n- Index cards with pictures of ancient animals (dinosaur, trilobite, ammonite—simple clip art)\n- 2-3 pictures of places where fossils are found (beach, cliff face, quarry—simple illustrations)\n- Chart paper: \"Where Might We Find Fossils?\"\n- Crayons and drawing paper\n\n**Activity — Choose One:**\n\n**Option A: Rock Detective Sorting (15 minutes)**\n\n1. Display rocks and fossil pictures.\n2. **Student Task:** \"Which rocks might have fossils inside? Look carefully. Choose a rock and explain to a partner why you think a fossil might be hiding in it.\"\n3. Sort rocks into two groups: \"Rocks that might have fossils\" and \"Rocks that might not.\"\n4. **Discussion:** \"Fossils are usually found in certain rocks. Why do you think rocks from the ocean or rocks that are very, very old are good places to find fossils?\"\n5. **Teacher Input:** Explain simply: \"Fossils form where animals died long ago, like at the bottom of oceans or lakes. Soft mud turned into rock over millions of years. That's why we find fossils in certain places.\"\n\n**Option B: Fossil Storytelling (15 minutes)**\n\n1. Show the fossil photograph again and place it in the center of the circle.\n2. **Prompt:** \"This fossil is evidence of an animal that lived long ago. Create a story about this animal. What did it eat? Where did it live? What did it look like when it was alive?\"\n3. Students draw the ancient animal and dictate or write 1-2 sentences: \"This animal was ___. It lived ___.\"\n4. Share stories in pairs or small groups.\n5. **Connection:** \"Fossils are like nature's clues. They help us tell stories about animals that lived on Earth before we did.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without leading—accept all reasonable hypotheses.\n- Ask: \"Why did you choose that rock?\" \"What clues helped you decide?\"\n- Validate stories: \"That's a great theory based on what we know about fossils!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply fossil concepts to new rocks and contexts.\n- Students make reasonable predictions about where fossils form.\n- Students use evidence to support their thinking.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossils, rocks, and evidence from nature.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessments (ongoing during lesson):**\n- Observation of student clay fossil models and descriptions\n- Listen to student responses during rock observations (Explore, Part A)\n- Note vocabulary usage during Explain phase\n- Circulate during Elaborate and listen for reasoning (\"I chose this rock because...\")\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\n**Give each student a simple sheet with three tasks (teacher can read aloud; students respond orally, draw, or write):**\n\n1. **Draw or circle:** \"Show me where you might find a fossil. Is it A) In a brand-new rock from the ground today, or B) In a very old rock?\" \n   - *(Correct answer: B — old rocks)*\n\n2. **Oral or Written Response:** \"What is a fossil? Use the word **evidence** in your answer.\"\n   - *(Acceptable responses: \"A fossil is evidence of an animal that lived long ago,\" \"A fossil is a mark that shows something that was alive.\")*\n\n3. **Show and Tell:** \"If you found this rock [show fossil photo], what would you do? Who would you tell?\"\n   - *(Acceptable responses: \"Show a scientist,\" \"Tell my teacher,\" \"Show a paleontologist,\" \"Put it in a museum.\")*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies that fossils are found in old rocks.\n- ✓ Student describes a fossil as evidence or an imprint of something that lived long ago.\n- ✓ Student demonstrates understanding that fossils are important and worth sharing with others.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 70% of students will correctly identify fossils as evidence from the past.\n- Students can use the term **fossil** and **rock** in context.\n- Students express curiosity about fossils and ancient life.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Chart:** Provide a visual vocabulary sheet with each word paired with a picture. Students point to images instead of using complex language.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Sheet:** Pre-fill portions of the observation chart, leaving only blanks for color and texture. Example: \"My rock is _____ (color) and feels _____.\"\n\n3. **Adult-Assisted Clay Fossil:** Pair the student with a classroom aide or peer buddy. Provide pre-flattened clay and a simple toy/leaf to press. Reduce decisions: \"Press here. Hold still. Lift gently.\"\n\n4. **Sentence Starters for Elaboration:** Provide sentence frames like \"I think this rock has a fossil because _____\" or \"This fossil was made by a _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deep Question Exploration:** Ask: \"If fossils take millions of years to form, what would a fossil of YOU look like in a million years? What would it show about your life today?\" Students draw and explain.\n\n2. **Fossil Classification:** Provide pictures of 5-6 different fossil types. Challenge students to sort by characteristics: \"Which fossils came from animals with shells? Which came from creatures with no shells?\"\n\n3. **Paleontologist Interview:** Have advanced students create 3-4 interview questions they would ask a real paleontologist. Example: \"Where do you dig to find fossils?\" Record their questions on a chart to potentially send to a local museum.\n\n4. **Timeline Thinking:** Introduce a simple timeline showing \"Now,\" \"Long Ago,\" and \"A Very Long Time Ago.\" Challenge students to place pictures of modern animals and fossils on the timeline and explain their choices.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### Extension 1: Fossil Museum Display\n**Time:** 30 minutes (can span 2-3 days)\n\nStudents set up a classroom \"Fossil Museum.\" Display clay fossil models, drawn pictures of ancient animals, the observation sheets, and labels made by students explaining what each fossil shows. Invite another class or parents to visit. Students serve as museum guides and explain their fossils to visitors.\n\n**Teacher Prep:** Print simple museum labels. Set up a table. Create a \"Welcome\" sign with students.\n\n---\n\n### Extension 2: Real Rock Search\n**Time:** 45-60 minutes (outdoor investigation + follow-up)\n\nTake students on a supervised outdoor exploration of the school grounds or local park to search for rocks. Students collect rocks in bags, bring them inside, and investigate with magnifying glasses. Create a class display: \"Rocks We Found.\" Discuss: \"Do any of our rocks look like they could have fossils inside? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Teacher Prep:** Scout the location beforehand for safety. Prepare collection bags. Plan for hand-washing afterward.\n\n---\n\n### Extension 3: Story of a Fossil (Take-Home Family Activity)\n**Time:** 30 minutes (can be completed at home over a week)\n\nProvide a template with the prompt: \"My Fossil Story.\" Students take home their clay fossil (in a bag) and a sheet asking them to:\n- Draw what they think the animal looked like when it was alive\n- Write or dictate 2-3 sentences about the animal: \"Where did it live? What did it eat? Why do you think it became a fossil?\"\n- Return the fossil and story to share with the class\n\n**Connection:** This bridges home and school learning and allows families to engage with the concept.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Photograph as Anchor:** Return to the fossil photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. Consistency builds memory and connection.\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Use key words (fossil, imprint, evidence, natural) deliberately and repeatedly. First graders need 10+ exposures to solidify vocabulary.\n- **Sensory Engagement:** First graders learn through touch, sight, and movement. Passing rocks, feeling textures, and making imprints are critical to understanding.\n- **Pacing:** If time is limited, combine Explain and Elaborate into a single session. The core Engage-Explore sequence is the non-negotiable foundation.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson positions fossils as evidence of natural history, directly aligned to First Grade Earth and Space Science expectations about observing and describing patterns in the natural world.",
