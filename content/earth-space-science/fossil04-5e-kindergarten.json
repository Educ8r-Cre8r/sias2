ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture curiosity about fossils and what they reveal using the fossil photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (large poster size, 11\" × 14\" or larger, projected if possible)\n- Whiteboard/chart paper\n- Markers (various colors)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster at child eye-level. Do NOT explain it yet.\n\n2. **Invite students to gather** in a comfortable circle around the image. Say: \"Scientists found this special picture. Look very carefully. What do you see?\"\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing 30 seconds for responses each):\n   - \"What do you notice in the sand? Does it look smooth or bumpy?\" *(Prompts visual observation)*\n   - \"Do you see something that looks different from the rest of the sand? What could it be?\" *(Draws attention to the fossil shell impression)*\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this at the beach or in dirt outside?\" *(Connects to prior experience)*\n   - \"Why do you think this shape is in the sand? Who or what might have made it?\" *(Encourages prediction and wonder)*\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper. Write their exact words (e.g., \"Is it a shell?\", \"A bug lived there?\", \"It's very old?\"). Validate all responses.\n\n5. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what lived on Earth a very, very long time ago. Today, we're going to be fossil detectives and find out what stories rocks and sand can tell us!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore and find our own fossil treasures to discover what these clues mean.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate textures, impressions, and features in sand/sediment to discover how fossils form and appear.\n\n**Materials (per pair/small group of 3-4):**\n- Shallow plastic bin or container (8\" × 10\" minimum)\n- Sand (play sand, kinetic sand, or beach sand) — 2-3 cups per bin\n- Small shells, pasta shapes, or plastic toy animals (5-7 items)\n- Spoons or small scoops\n- Magnifying glasses (one per pair)\n- Wet sand option: spray bottle with water\n- Small \"fossil record sheet\" (paper with 3 boxes for drawing)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute bins and materials.** Say: \"You are fossil scientists. Your job is to bury treasures in the sand and then dig to find them. But first, draw what you're going to hide.\"\n\n2. **Step 1 (3 minutes):** Students choose a shell or toy object and draw it on their fossil record sheet in Box 1 (labeled \"What I Buried\").\n\n3. **Step 2 (5 minutes):** Each student/pair gently presses their object into the sand, creating an impression. They then carefully remove the object, leaving a trace behind.\n   - **Teacher guidance:** \"Press gently. Don't squish it. We want to see the shape.\"\n   - **Observation prompt:** \"Look at what's left behind. Can you still see the shape of what was buried, even though it's gone?\"\n\n4. **Step 3 (4 minutes):** Before looking, students predict what they'll find. They draw their prediction in Box 2 (\"What I Think I'll Find\").\n\n5. **Step 4 (6 minutes):** Students use magnifying glasses to examine their impression closely. They can dig slowly with a spoon to uncover part of it.\n   - **Teacher circulating:** Ask: \"What bumps do you see? What lines? How is this like the picture we looked at?\"\n   - Students draw what they actually found in Box 3 (\"What I Really Found\").\n\n6. **Optional extension:** Lightly spray one bin with water to show how sediment hardens. Say: \"When sand gets wet and sits for a very long time, it becomes hard like rock. Fossils form this way!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group every 2-3 minutes.\n- Ask open-ended questions (\"What do you notice?\" rather than \"Is that right?\").\n- Encourage use of magnifying glasses.\n- Help students observe details (ridges, curves, depth).\n- Do NOT tell students what they've made—let them discover.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create clear impressions and observe them with tools.\n- Students compare predictions to actual results.\n- Students describe features using words like \"bumpy,\" \"smooth,\" \"deep,\" \"lines,\" \"shape.\"\n- Student fossil record sheets show understanding that impressions preserve shapes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce fossil vocabulary and connect exploration to the photograph and Earth's history.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Fossil photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures (printed or hand-drawn)\n- Re-usable sticky notes or mini whiteboards for checking understanding\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Gather students with their fossil record sheets.\n   - Ask 4-5 volunteers: \"What did you bury? What did you find? Did it look the same?\"\n   - Celebrate observations: \"You all made fossils! You made traces just like scientists find.\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with K-friendly definitions (8 minutes):**\n   Display each term with a picture. Say the definition in simple words.\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Fossil:** A trace or mark left by a plant or animal that lived a long, long time ago. (Show picture: shell in rock, footprint)\n   - **Impression:** A shape or print left in sand or rock when something presses into it. (Show their work + photo fossil)\n   - **Rock:** Hard material made of sand and soil that gets squeezed together over many, many years. (Show a real rock)\n   - **Sand:** Tiny pieces of rock that can move and be shaped. (Show sand in hand)\n   - **Long Ago:** A very, very, very long time before we were born—when different animals lived on Earth. (Draw timeline: now vs. dinosaur time)\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (4 minutes):**\n   Display the fossil image again. Say: \"This is a real fossil! See this shape? A long time ago, an animal or plant left this trace in sand, just like you did in your bins. The sand became hard rock, and the fossil stayed inside for millions of years. Scientists dug it up and found this story about the past.\"\n\n   Point to the impression in the photo. Ask: \"Does this remind you of the shape you made in your sand?\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (1 minute):**\n   Use a **thumbs-up, thumbs-sideways, thumbs-down** signal.\n   Say: \"A fossil is a trace left by something that lived a long time ago. Thumbs up if that makes sense. Sideways if you're not sure. Down if you don't understand yet.\" (No judgment—just data for you.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can point to the shell impression in the photograph.\n- Students understand \"fossil\" = old animal/plant trace.\n- Students use the word \"impression\" to describe what they made.\n- Students recognize sand and rocks as Earth materials.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply fossil knowledge to a new context and think about what fossils teach us.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Playdough (store-bought or homemade)\n- Small natural objects: leaves, twigs, feathers, pine cones, pebbles\n- Paper plates\n- Magnifying glasses (reused)\n- Chart paper labeled \"What We Learned from Fossils\"\n- Picture cards: ancient animals (simple: dinosaurs, early fish, early plants)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Fossil Time Travel Story (3 minutes):**\n   Gather students. Say: \"Fossils are like messages from long, long ago. An animal stepped in mud, or fell into sand, and left a trace. Now we can learn about animals that aren't here anymore. Let's make a pretend fossil with playdough and see what happens.\"\n\n2. **Playdough Fossil Making (8 minutes):**\n   - Give each student a ball of playdough.\n   - Students choose a natural object (leaf, feather, twig) and press it gently into their playdough, then remove it.\n   - Ask: \"What story does this fossil tell? What was the animal or plant doing?\"\n   - Students share: \"A leaf fell down,\" \"A feather blew away,\" \"A bug landed here.\"\n\n3. **What Can Fossils Tell Us? (5 minutes):**\n   Display picture cards of ancient creatures. Say: \"Fossils help us know what lived on Earth a long time ago. We found fossils of dinosaurs, ancient fish, and early plants. Now we know these animals lived here. Fossils are like detective clues.\"\n\n   Ask: \"What do you want to know about animals from long ago? What would you ask them?\"\n   Record ideas on chart paper: \"Did they eat plants?\" \"How big were they?\" \"Where did they sleep?\"\n\n4. **Optional: Fossil Museum (2 minutes setup, ongoing throughout day):**\n   Students can arrange their sand impressions and playdough fossils on a \"museum shelf\" with labels they help write (teacher scribes): \"Shell fossil,\" \"Feather fossil,\" \"Made by: [Student Name].\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What story does this tell?\" vs. providing answers.\n- Encourage creative storytelling about ancient life.\n- Validate all questions and ideas; record them even if you can't answer fully.\n- Help students use magnifying glasses to examine texture details.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create multiple impressions using different objects.\n- Students articulate ideas about what fossils teach us: \"We know dinosaurs were real,\" \"Plants lived back then too.\"\n- Students ask genuine questions about ancient life.\n- Students engage in imaginative play connecting fossils to organisms.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of fossil concepts and ability to observe and describe Earth materials.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation checklists:** Note which students:\n  - Use magnifying glasses appropriately and describe details.\n  - Connect their impressions to the photograph fossil.\n  - Use vocabulary words (fossil, impression, rock, sand, long ago) in sentences.\n  - Ask questions about ancient life.\n  - Engage in pretend fossil-making with intent to create impressions.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes, end of Session 2):**\n\nConduct a brief **individual or small-group interview** using these prompts. Record student responses with initials on a simple checklist.\n\n1. **Show the fossil photograph again.** Ask: \"What do you see here? What do you think it is?\" \n   - *Look for:* Student names the shape as a shell or fossil; describes bumps/lines; shows curiosity.\n\n2. **Hold up a rock or shell.** Ask: \"Is this a fossil? Why or why not?\"\n   - *Look for:* Student explains that a fossil is a trace left by something that lived long, long ago; this is just a rock/shell now.\n\n3. **Ask:** \"What did we learn that rocks and sand can tell us?\"\n   - *Look for:* Student connects rocks/sand to past life; mentions animals, plants, or \"long ago.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n✓ Student can identify an impression as a fossil or fossil-like object.\n✓ Student describes features of fossils (shape, texture, details).\n✓ Student understands fossils show us about the past.\n✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary word correctly (fossil, impression, rock, sand, or long ago).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most Kindergarteners will recognize the photograph as showing an animal trace in rock/sand.\n- Most will explain that fossils help us learn about the past.\n- Students will vary in vocabulary use; early talkers will use multiple terms; others will point and describe.\n- All students will have engaged in hands-on fossil creation and observation.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners/English language learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary + visuals:**\n   - Use only 2-3 core terms: \"fossil,\" \"sand,\" and \"long ago.\"\n   - Display large labeled pictures of each concept throughout the lesson.\n   - Pair ELL students with bilingual peers or provide visual anchor charts with images, not words.\n\n2. **Reduced complexity in Explore:**\n   - Provide pre-made impressions in sand (teacher makes them before class) so students focus on observation and naming.\n   - Offer a **choice of 2 objects only** (e.g., shell or leaf) to reduce decision fatigue.\n   - Use a hand-over-hand technique to help students press objects gently if fine motor skills need support.\n\n3. **Guided questioning instead of open-ended:**\n   - Ask yes/no questions: \"Is this bumpy? Is it a shell?\" instead of \"What do you see?\"\n   - Offer sentence frames: \"I see a ___.\" \"This is ___.\" \"It feels ___.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Deeper investigative questions:**\n   - Ask: \"If we buried many different objects in sand and waited a very long time, how would they change? Would they all look the same?\"\n   - Encourage prediction: \"If a fossil is from 100 million years ago, what do you think the Earth looked like then? Was it hot or cold? Wet or dry?\"\n\n2. **Extended fossil creation:**\n   - Challenge students to make a \"fossil sequence\": bury an object, remove it, bury it again in a new layer, and discuss layering.\n   - Introduce the idea of **strata (layers):** \"Fossils are found in different layers of rock. Older fossils are deeper down.\"\n\n3. **Connecting to modern animals:**\n   - Ask: \"If someone found your footprint in sand 100 million years from now, what would they learn about you? What if your favorite toy turned into a fossil?\"\n   - Encourage drawing: \"Draw a fossil of you or your pet and explain what it tells.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil Hunt Walk (outdoor or around school grounds):**\n   - Take students on a nature walk to look for natural impressions: leaves in dirt, animal tracks, or imprints in pavement after rain.\n   - Bring magnifying glasses and sketch or photograph findings.\n   - Return and discuss: \"Are these real fossils? No—but they're like fossils because they're traces.\"\n   - Connect to NGSS K-ESS2-1 (observing local environment patterns).\n\n2. **Create a Classroom Fossil Museum:**\n   - Display all student-made fossils and playdough impressions on a shelf or table.\n   - Students create museum \"labels\" (teacher scribes): name of fossil, what made it, where found.\n   - Invite another kindergarten class to tour and ask questions.\n   - Deepens understanding through teaching others.\n\n3. **Fossil Story Writing / Drawing (homework or follow-up):**\n   - Send home a simple **Fossil Storybook Template** (4-6 boxes) with prompts:\n     - \"Long ago, [animal name] lived here.\"\n     - \"One day, it [action].\"\n     - \"It left a mark in the sand.\"\n     - \"The sand became rock.\"\n     - \"Scientists found the fossil.\"\n   - Students draw pictures; families help write captions.\n   - Builds home-school connection and reinforces narrative understanding of fossil formation.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Safety reminder:** Ensure all materials (shells, playdough, sand) are clean and free of contaminants. Supervise magnifying glass use to prevent excessive sun focus.\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Use fossil words consistently throughout both days. Repetition builds retention in Kindergarten.\n- **Flexible pacing:** If students are highly engaged in Explore or Elaborate, extend by 5-10 minutes and reduce another phase slightly.\n- **Cultural connection:** If any students have family members who collect rocks or fossils, invite them to share (photo or object). This validates the activity and builds family engagement.\n- **Real fossil option:** If possible, borrow a real fossil (ammonite, trilobite, or leaf fossil) from a natural history museum or geology department. Even briefly passing it around enhances authenticity.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson anchors abstract concepts (deep time, fossilization) in concrete, hands-on experience appropriate for Kindergarten while meeting ESS standards through careful observation of Earth materials and patterns.",
