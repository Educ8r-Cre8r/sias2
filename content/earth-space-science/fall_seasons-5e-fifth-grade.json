Explain that seasonal changes in temperature and daylight hours cause visible changes in plants, such as leaf color changes in fall.\n2. Describe how Earth's tilt affects the angle and intensity of sunlight reaching different parts of Earth at different times of year.\n3. Model and identify how the geosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere interact to create seasonal phenomena visible in the photograph.\n4. Collect and organize data about seasonal changes (such as temperature, daylight hours, or leaf color) and represent the data in a graph or chart.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by examining the fall photograph and wondering about seasonal changes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital display of the fall leaves photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks or paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image on the board or distribute printed copies to small groups. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation first—no talking, just looking.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (Ask these in order, pausing for student responses):**\n   - \"What do you notice about the colors of the leaves in this photograph? Why do you think some leaves are red, yellow, and brown instead of green?\"\n   - \"What time of year do you think this picture was taken? How do you know?\"\n   - \"Why don't leaves stay green all year long? What has to change for this to happen?\"\n   - \"If we took this same picture in January, what would it look like? What would be different?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what has to happen in the air, the soil, and the sunlight to make leaves change colors. Let's investigate!\"\n\n4. **Document Student Ideas:** Write student predictions and wonderings on chart paper titled \"What We Think About Fall.\" (Do not correct misconceptions at this point.)\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore what happens to plants when the seasons change, and discover why Earth's tilt is the reason behind it.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate seasonal change through a hands-on model activity that demonstrates how Earth's tilt affects sunlight intensity.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- One flashlight (or desk lamp with incandescent bulb—safer for this age)\n- One sheet of white poster board or paper\n- A protractor or angle measurer (or pre-drawn angle guides on a worksheet)\n- Thermometer (optional, for temperature measurement)\n- Ruler\n- Pencil\n- \"Sunlight Angle Investigation\" worksheet (teacher-created, see directions below)\n\n**Activity: Investigating Sunlight Angle**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Darken your work area slightly (close blinds or turn off overhead lights partially).\"\n\n2. \"Hold your flashlight above your white paper at a **90-degree angle** (straight up and down, like the sun is directly overhead). Turn on the flashlight. Trace the circle of light on your paper with a pencil. Label it 'Direct Sun (90°).'\"\n\n3. \"Now, tilt your flashlight to a **45-degree angle** (lean it partway). Shine it on the same paper and trace the new shape of light. Label it 'Tilted Sun (45°).'\"\n\n4. \"Finally, tilt your flashlight even more to a **30-degree angle** (very slanted). Trace this light shape and label it 'Very Tilted Sun (30°).'\"\n\n5. \"Look at all three shapes you drew. **Discuss with your partner:** Which light circle is brightest? Which is biggest? Why do you think the light spreads out more when the flashlight is tilted?\"\n\n6. **(Optional Extension):** Use a thermometer to measure which position heats the paper fastest. Record temperatures at 1-minute intervals.\n\n7. **Record:** On your worksheet, draw or write:\n   - The three light patterns you created\n   - Which angle gave the brightest, most concentrated light\n   - A prediction: \"When sunlight hits Earth at a steep angle, the energy is _______ concentrated. When it's tilted, the energy is _______ spread out.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and listen to student conversations without correcting.\n- Ask prompts like: \"What do you notice about the size of the light spot?\" or \"Why do you think that happens?\"\n- Ensure flashlights are held steady and safely.\n- Guide students to discover (not tell them) that tilted light spreads over a larger area and is less intense.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should discover that:\n- Direct light (90°) creates a small, bright circle.\n- Tilted light (45° and 30°) creates larger, dimmer ovals.\n- The more tilted the light, the more spread out and less intense it becomes.\n- Connection idea: \"Maybe when Earth is tilted away from the sun, we get less intense sunlight, and that's why it's colder in fall and winter.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain how Earth's tilt causes seasons using the photograph and Explore data.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms\n- Globe or Earth model\n- Diagram showing Earth's tilt at different seasons (teacher-created or from curriculum resource)\n- The original fall leaves photograph\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Observations (5 minutes):** Ask 2-3 student pairs to share their flashlight results. Display their traced circles on the board. Ask: \"How is what you discovered about light angles related to the photograph of fall leaves?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Concepts (10-12 minutes):**\n\n   Use a globe or Earth model to demonstrate:\n   - Earth is tilted at an angle (about 23.5°) as it revolves around the sun.\n   - When your hemisphere (Northern or Southern) tilts **toward** the sun, you get summer—more direct, intense sunlight, longer days.\n   - When your hemisphere tilts **away** from the sun, you get winter—less direct, weaker sunlight, shorter days.\n   - Fall and spring are the \"in-between\" times when the tilt is neither toward nor away.\n\n   **Make the connection:** \"In fall, the Northern Hemisphere is tilting away from the sun, so the sunlight is more spread out, like in your flashlight experiment. This means fewer daylight hours and cooler temperatures. Plants sense these changes and get ready for winter. Leaves stop making green food, and the other colors that were always there—red, yellow, orange—show through. That's why we see such beautiful colors in fall!\"\n\n3. **Refer Back to Photograph:** \"Look at this fall picture again. Those colorful leaves are nature's way of telling us that Earth is moving to a part of its orbit where sunlight is weaker and days are shorter.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:** Ask:\n   - \"Why are there fewer hours of daylight in fall?\" (Earth's tilt makes the sun's path across the sky shorter.)\n   - \"How is the flashlight experiment like what's happening to Earth in fall?\" (The tilted light = less intense sunlight.)\n   - \"What does a leaf's color change tell us about Earth's position?\" (It's tilting away from the sun.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Axis** | An imaginary line through Earth that it spins around, like a spinning top. Earth's axis is tilted. |\n| **Tilt** | When something leans at an angle instead of standing straight up. Earth's tilt changes which hemisphere gets more sunlight. |\n| **Season** | A time of year with a certain kind of weather and temperature. We have spring, summer, fall, and winter because of Earth's tilt. |\n| **Daylight** | The time each day when sunlight reaches your location on Earth. Daylight hours change with the seasons. |\n| **Photosynthesis** | The process plants use to make their own food using sunlight, water, and air. In fall, plants slow down this process. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should understand that:\n- Earth's tilt is the reason for seasons.\n- Fall happens when their hemisphere tilts away from the sun.\n- Less direct sunlight and shorter days trigger leaf color change.\n- The flashlight experiment showed how angle of light affects intensity—just like Earth's tilt.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of seasonal change to predict and analyze real-world seasonal data.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Temperature data table or graph (teacher-provided, showing monthly average temperatures)\n- Daylight hours data table (showing number of daylight hours per month)\n- Graph paper or digital graphing tool (e.g., simple spreadsheet)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Ruler\n- \"Seasonal Patterns\" worksheet\n\n**Activity: Graphing Seasonal Data**\n\n1. **Introduce Real Data (3 minutes):** Show students a data table with:\n   - **Months** (January through December)\n   - **Average temperature** (in °F or °C)\n   - **Average daylight hours**\n\n   Example data (temperate Northern Hemisphere):\n   | Month | Avg. Temp (°F) | Daylight Hours |\n   |-------|---|---|\n   | January | 32 | 9 |\n   | February | 35 | 10 |\n   | March | 45 | 12 |\n   | April | 60 | 13.5 |\n   | May | 70 | 14.5 |\n   | June | 78 | 15 |\n   | July | 82 | 14.5 |\n   | August | 80 | 13.5 |\n   | September | 70 | 12 |\n   | October | 58 | 10.5 |\n   | November | 45 | 9.5 |\n   | December | 35 | 8.5 |\n\n2. **Task (12-15 minutes):** Working in pairs, students will:\n   - Choose **one** data set (temperature OR daylight hours) to graph.\n   - Create a line graph with months on the x-axis and their chosen variable on the y-axis.\n   - Use different colors to mark the seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter).\n   - Label the seasons on their graph.\n\n3. **Guided Questions:**\n   - \"What pattern do you see in the temperature throughout the year?\"\n   - \"When is it coldest? Which season is that?\"\n   - \"When do we have the fewest daylight hours? What season is that?\"\n   - \"Why does fall have fewer daylight hours and cooler temperatures than summer?\"\n   - \"How does this graph help explain why leaves change color in October?\"\n\n4. **Connection Back to Photograph:** \"The fall leaves in that photograph appeared in a month (probably September or October on this graph) when daylight hours were getting shorter and temperatures were dropping. The leaves were responding to these Earth system changes!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Provide pre-made data tables (don't require students to find data independently).\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions rather than correcting graph errors immediately.\n- Help students see the pattern: fall = decreasing daylight + decreasing temperature + leaves change color.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should:\n- Successfully create a line graph showing seasonal patterns.\n- Identify that fall has shorter daylight and cooler temperatures.\n- Make a visual connection between the graph data and the photograph.\n- Write or verbally explain: \"Leaves change color in fall because of shorter days and cooler temperatures caused by Earth's tilt.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of seasonal change, Earth's tilt, and the interaction of Earth's systems.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n\n- Observe student conversations during the flashlight experiment.\n- Listen to students' explanations during the Explain phase discussions.\n- Check student graphs for accuracy and correct axis labeling.\n- Ask probing questions: \"If Earth's tilt were different, how would fall be different?\"\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket**\n\nProvide each student with a card (digital or paper) and ask them to respond to **one or both** of the following questions (choose based on class level):\n\n**Option A (Visual/Concrete):**\n\"Draw or label a picture showing:\n- Earth\n- The sun\n- The direction Earth is tilted in fall\n- Why the sun's rays are less direct in fall\nInclude one sentence: 'In fall, leaves change color because ___________.' \"\n\n**Option B (Written/Analytical):**\n\"Explain: Why does fall happen in the Northern Hemisphere around September and October? Use the words **tilt**, **sunlight**, and **daylight hours** in your explanation.\"\n\n**Success Criteria (How to Know Students Met Objectives):**\n\n✓ **Students understand the cause of seasons:**\n- They correctly explain that Earth's tilt is the reason for seasonal change.\n- They describe how tilt affects sunlight intensity and daylight length.\n\n✓ **Students connect Earth systems to visible phenomena:**\n- They explain that leaves change color because of shorter days and cooler temperatures.\n- They recognize that temperature, daylight, and plant behavior are connected.\n\n✓ **Students can represent data:**\n- Their graphs are labeled correctly with months and the chosen variable.\n- They can identify the pattern and match it to seasons.\n\n✓ **Students use appropriate vocabulary:**\n- Exit tickets use terms like *tilt*, *season*, *daylight*, or *axis* correctly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nMost fifth graders should be able to:\n- Explain that Earth's tilt causes seasons.\n- Describe how tilt affects sunlight angle and daylight hours.\n- Make a connection between shorter days/cooler temperatures and leaf color change.\n- Create and interpret a simple graph of seasonal data.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Flashlight Experiment:**\n   - Pre-draw the three angle positions (90°, 45°, 30°) on their paper so they only need to trace and observe.\n   - Provide a sentence frame: \"When the flashlight is tilted, the light is _________ [spread out / bright]. When it's straight up, the light is _________ [concentrated / bright].\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Picture Cards:**\n   - Provide cards with pictures and one-word labels for *axis*, *tilt*, *daylight*, and *season*.\n   - Have students match pictures to definitions during the Explain phase.\n\n3. **Guided Graph Construction:**\n   - Provide a partially completed graph with axes already drawn.\n   - Number the plot points 1–12 (for months) so students only need to plot points and connect them.\n   - Ask yes/no questions instead of open-ended ones: \"Is it colder in January or July?\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Investigate Hemisphere Differences:**\n   - Provide temperature data for both Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\n   - Ask: \"Why are the seasons opposite in the Southern Hemisphere? When it's fall (October) in the North, what season is it in the South?\" \n   - Have them create overlapping graphs to show the inverse relationship.\n\n2. **Model Earth's Orbit:**\n   - Ask students to predict and test what would happen if Earth's tilt were 0° (no tilt) or 45° (extreme tilt).\n   - Have them write a prediction: \"If Earth were tilted at 45°, would we still have seasons? Would fall be more extreme or less extreme?\"\n\n3. **Research Latitude Connection:**\n   - Introduce the concept that places closer to the equator experience less dramatic seasonal changes.\n   - Provide data comparing daylight hours and temperatures at different latitudes (e.g., Miami vs. Minneapolis vs. Anchorage).\n   - Ask: \"Why does the Northern Hemisphere city farthest north have shorter daylight in fall?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seasonal Leaf Collection and Observation (Homework or Follow-Up):**\n   - Students collect leaves from outside (or use photos) showing different fall colors.\n   - They press or photograph leaves and create a \"Fall Color Journal\" over 2-3 weeks, dating each leaf and recording the temperature and daylight hours for that day.\n   - They graph their observations and write a reflection: \"How did the weather change as the leaves changed colors?\"\n   - **Connection:** Reinforces the data collection and graphing skills while extending the phenomenon across multiple weeks.\n\n2. **Create a Seasonal Calendar (Art + Science Integration):**\n   - Students design a 12-month calendar showing the four seasons.\n   - For each month, they include: an illustration of what plants/leaves look like, the approximate daylight hours (as a simple bar or clock diagram), and a sentence explaining why that month looks that way based on Earth's tilt.\n   - Display in hallway as a visual reference for the whole school.\n   - **Connection:** Deepens understanding of cyclical seasonal patterns and communicates learning to a wider audience.\n\n3. **Interview/Observe Seasonal Impact (Real-World Application):**\n   - Students interview a gardener, farmer, or grounds keeper about how they prepare for fall and winter.\n   - They ask: \"When do leaves start changing? When do you stop planting? How do you know when it's time?\"\n   - Students record the answers and create a presentation or poster: \"How Do Humans Prepare for Seasonal Change?\"\n   - **Connection:** Links abstract Earth science concepts to community knowledge and real-world decision-making (5-ESS3-1 connection).\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson works best spread across two 45-minute sessions (Engage/Explore in Session 1; Explain/Elaborate/Evaluate in Session 2). Alternatively, it can be condensed into a single 90-minute block.\n- **Prerequisite Knowledge:** Students should have a basic understanding of Earth's orbit around the sun (typically covered in Grade 1-2).\n- **Safety:** When using flashlights or lamps, ensure cords are away from water and students handle them appropriately. LED flashlights are safest; incandescent bulbs can get warm.\n- **Cultural Connections:** In some climates, fall is not prominent. If teaching in a region without distinct seasons, substitute with local seasonal phenomena (dry/rainy seasons, monsoons, etc.) and adjust photograph examples accordingly.\n- **Data Source:** For temperature and daylight data, use NOAA.gov or weather.gov historical climate data for your region, or use simplified, age-appropriate sources from your curriculum.",
