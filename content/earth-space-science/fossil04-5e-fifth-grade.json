Explain what a fossil is and describe how fossils form in sedimentary rock.\n2. Use fossils as evidence to infer what Earth's environment was like in the past.\n3. Identify how geoscientists use fossils to understand changes in Earth's systems over time.\n4. Create a model of fossil formation to show their understanding of this geological process.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of fossil (displayed on projector or printed copies)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Initial Observation (3 minutes):** Project or display the fossil photograph on the screen. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Guided Discussion Questions (7 minutes):**\n   - \"What do you see in this photograph? Describe the shapes and patterns.\"\n   - \"What do you think this object is, and why might it look this way?\"\n   - \"How do you think something like this could get pressed into rock?\"\n   - \"What does this tell us about what was living on Earth a long, long time ago?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt (2 minutes):** \"If we found this fossil, what could it teach us about Earth millions of years ago? What questions do you have?\" Record student wonderings on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become paleontologists—scientists who study fossils—and discover how these ancient clues are created and what they teach us about our planet's past.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover fossil formation concepts through hands-on simulation.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- Shallow plastic container or aluminum pan (approximately 8\" × 6\")\n- 2-3 cups of plaster of Paris (premixed with water to a thick, peanut butter consistency)\n- Variety of small \"organism\" models: shells, toy dinosaurs, plastic insects, fish shapes, or pasta shapes (rigatoni, shells)\n- Sand or fine sediment (potting soil works well)\n- Water in spray bottle\n- Newspaper or plastic tablecloth for work surface\n- Spoons for pressing objects into plaster\n- Pencil or craft stick\n- Small labels and markers\n\n**Activity: Fossil Formation Simulation**\n\n1. **Setup (2 minutes):** Students spread newspaper on their work surface and place their container in the center. Distribute plaster mixture evenly (approximately 1.5 inches deep).\n\n2. **Embedding Organisms (5 minutes):** Students select 3-4 \"organism\" models and gently press them into the plaster layer, leaving impressions. They should press about halfway into the plaster—not all the way through.\n\n3. **First Layer Complete (2 minutes):** Using a spray bottle, students lightly mist the plaster to help it set. While waiting (1-2 minutes), they sketch the objects they embedded and predict what their fossil layer will look like.\n\n4. **Adding Sediment Layer (5 minutes):** Students sprinkle sand or sediment over the plaster layer (approximately 0.5 inches), gently pressing it down. Lightly mist with water.\n\n5. **Second Plaster Layer (5 minutes):** Add another 1-1.5 inches of plaster mixture on top of the sediment layer, covering everything. This represents millions of years of rock burial and compaction.\n\n6. **Documentation (3 minutes):** Students label their model with the date and draw what they think their \"fossil bed\" looks like inside. They predict what they'll see when they excavate it (this will happen in the next session).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to ensure plaster is spreading evenly and objects are pressed appropriately.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What does this represent?\" \"How is this like real fossils forming?\" \"What do you think will happen when this hardens?\"\n- Do not explain the process; let students discover how layers build up.\n- Ensure models are labeled and stored in a safe place to harden overnight.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a layered model showing how organisms become buried under sediment and rock.\n- Students record predictions about what their fossil layer will contain.\n- Students begin to understand that time and layering are essential to fossil formation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and Earth science concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student fossil models (partially set from previous session)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms and definitions\n- Images of real fossils (ammonites, trilobites, plant fossils)\n- Diagram showing rock layer formation and fossil preservation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out from Explore (4 minutes):** Ask 2-3 groups to describe what they embedded and predict what they'll find. Write predictions on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce Fossil Formation Vocabulary (6 minutes):** Using the actual fossil photograph and students' models, introduce these terms:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Fossil:** The preserved remains or trace of an organism that lived long ago, found in rock. (Show the photograph: \"This is a fossil—the hard shell of an ancient sea creature pressed into rock.\")\n   - **Sediment:** Small pieces of rock and minerals that are carried by water and wind and pile up in layers. (Point to sand layer in student model: \"This sand is like sediment that covered organisms.\")\n   - **Sedimentary Rock:** Rock made from pressed and cemented layers of sediment over millions of years. (Explain: \"The plaster and sand together act like sedimentary rock forming.\")\n   - **Paleontologist:** A scientist who studies fossils to learn about ancient life and Earth's past. (Note: \"These are the scientists who find and examine fossils like the one in our photograph.\")\n   - **Extinction:** When all members of a species die out and no longer exist on Earth. (Explain: \"Fossils help us know about organisms that went extinct long ago.\")\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (5 minutes):** Examine the fossil photograph together. \"This fossil shows us that millions of years ago, an ocean creature lived here. The creature died and was quickly buried by sediment. Over millions of years, the sediment turned into rock, and the creature's shell became a fossil. Now we can study it and learn about Earth's past environment.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):** Ask students:\n   - \"In your model, what part is like sediment? What part is like rock?\"\n   - \"Why do you think fossils form in sedimentary rock and not in other rocks?\"\n   - \"What can fossils tell us about Earth?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that fossils are preserved remains of ancient organisms.\n- Students can explain the basic process of fossil formation (burial, compression, hardening over time).\n- Students recognize that fossils provide evidence of past life and environments.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by interpreting real fossils and their environmental context.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student fossil models (now hardened enough to carefully excavate)\n- Soft tools for excavation: craft sticks, soft brushes, plastic spoons (no metal tools)\n- Copies or images of different environments: ocean scene, forest scene, desert scene, swamp scene\n- Index cards with descriptions of past environments\n- Large paper or poster board\n\n**Activity: Fossil Excavation and Environmental Interpretation**\n\n1. **Careful Excavation (7 minutes):** Students use soft tools to carefully expose their embedded \"organisms\" from their model. Demonstrate proper technique: gently chip away at plaster and sediment, brush away debris, and preserve the fossils. Provide guidance: \"Imagine you're a paleontologist in the field. How would you carefully remove these precious fossils?\"\n\n2. **Fossil Documentation (4 minutes):** Students:\n   - Sketch their excavated fossils\n   - Describe what organism they think each fossil represents\n   - Record where in their model each fossil was found (top layer, middle, bottom)\n\n3. **Environmental Reconstruction (7 minutes):** \n   - Present 4 different past environment images/descriptions (ancient ocean, tropical forest, desert, swamp).\n   - Students examine their fossils and match them to the environment where that organism likely lived.\n   - Example prompt: \"Your fossil looks like a shell. Which environment had water where this creature lived? How do you know?\"\n   - Students create a simple poster or diagram showing: their fossil, the environment it came from, and 2-3 clues from the fossil that tell them about that environment.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask questions: \"What does this fossil tell you? How do you know what environment it lived in?\"\n- Challenge students: \"Could this fossil have lived in multiple environments? Why or why not?\"\n- Guide students to think about how organisms need specific conditions (water, food, temperature).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully excavate their models while understanding the careful work paleontologists do.\n- Students infer past environments based on fossil type and location in rock layers.\n- Students create a representation connecting fossils to the environments where organisms once lived.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossil formation and interpretation.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Do students understand that layering takes time and that organisms become embedded?\n- Questioning during Explain: Can students define key vocabulary and connect it to the photograph and their model?\n- Documentation during Elaborate: Do student sketches and descriptions show understanding of fossil types and environments?\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket containing these three tasks:\n\n**Task 1 (Comprehension):** \"Look at this photo of a fossil. Write or draw what you think this fossil is and how it got into the rock.\"\n\n**Task 2 (Application):** \"A fossil of a fish is found in rock high up on a mountain. What does this tell us about that area long ago? Explain your thinking.\"\n\n**Task 3 (Reflection):** \"How did your model help you understand how fossils form? What surprised you?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student accurately defines fossil and describes the formation process (using vocabulary: sediment, layers, time).\n- ✓ Student uses fossil evidence to infer past environmental conditions.\n- ✓ Student demonstrates understanding that Earth's environments and life have changed over time.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students who demonstrate mastery will explain fossil formation as a multi-step process and use fossil evidence to reconstruct past environments.\n- Students who need support will identify what a fossil is and recognize that fossils show us about ancient life, with prompting.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners):\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Provide a vocabulary card with pictures and simple definitions at each student's workspace during Explore and Explain phases. Use consistent, repeated language.\n2. **Guided Excavation:** Work one-on-one or in a small group during Elaborate, modeling the excavation process step-by-step and asking supportive questions: \"What do you see? Is this a fossil or sediment?\"\n3. **Structured Environmental Matching:** Provide laminated environment cards with pictures and only 2 choices (ocean vs. land, for example) for students to match their fossils, rather than 4 options.\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners):\n1. **Layer Analysis:** Have students number their rock layers and infer the sequence of events: \"Which fossil is oldest? Newest? Why?\" Introduce the concept of **relative dating** in simple terms: \"Fossils lower down are older than fossils higher up.\"\n2. **Extinction and Adaptation:** Provide real fossil images from different time periods and ask: \"Why did these organisms disappear? What organisms replaced them? What changed about Earth?\" Connect to how species adapt to changing environments.\n3. **Create a Fossil Field Guide:** Challenge students to research 3-4 real fossils and create a \"paleontologist's guide\" including illustrations, descriptions of each fossil, the environment it lived in, and what Earth was like at that time.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Virtual Fossil Museum Tour:** Use online museum databases (e.g., Smithsonian, local natural history museums) to explore real fossils. Students select one fossil and research its organism, time period, and environment. Create a \"museum placard\" with illustrations and facts.\n\n2. **Timeline of Life on Earth:** Provide a large timeline and images of fossils from different geological periods (Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, etc.). Students place fossils on the timeline, note which organisms appeared and disappeared, and discuss how Earth's life changed over time. Connect to why environments changed (5-ESS2-1).\n\n3. **Fossil Story Investigation:** Present a scenario: \"A paleontologist found three different fossils in the same layer of rock: a fish, a fern, and an insect. Write a story about what Earth was like when these organisms lived together. What was the environment? What did they eat? How did they survive?\" This encourages creative thinking grounded in science reasoning.\n\n4. **Rocks and Fossils Nature Walk:** Take students on a school grounds or neighborhood walk to observe rocks, soil layers, and sediment. Discuss where fossils might be found and what conditions are necessary for their formation. Photograph examples and create a classroom display.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Timing:** The Explore phase requires plaster to harden, so this lesson is designed as two 45-minute sessions with overnight drying time. You may also use fast-setting plaster or clay alternatives (air-dry clay) if needed.\n- **Safety:** Ensure plaster is non-toxic and that students wash hands afterward. Use plastic, not glass, containers to prevent breakage during excavation.\n- **Real Fossil Connection:** If possible, invite a local paleontologist, geologist, or museum educator to discuss their work with fossils. Many communities have natural history museums or university departments that can provide lending collections of safe, real fossils for classroom observation.\n- **Photo Revisit:** Return to the original fossil photograph throughout the lesson to maintain connection to the authentic inquiry anchor.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson places fossils firmly within Earth and Space Science (ESS domain) by focusing on how Earth's geosphere and biosphere interact over time, how evidence (fossils) informs our understanding of Earth's changing systems, and how this knowledge helps us understand our planet's history and resources.",
