Describe how rocks change over time due to weathering caused by water and weather.\n2. Explain why moss grows on some rocks and identify the environmental conditions moss needs to survive.\n3. Identify different types of rocks and observe how their characteristics affect what can grow on them.\n4. Make a claim about how understanding rock weathering helps us understand Earth's landscapes and protect them.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected photograph of moss-covered rock (or printed copies)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Ask students to sit in a circle or gather closely so all can see clearly.\n\n**Say:** \"Today, we're going to be detectives! Look very carefully at this photograph. What do you see growing on these rocks? What colors do you notice? Why do you think these green fuzzy things are growing here?\"\n\n**Ask these specific discussion questions (pause for responses after each):**\n1. \"What are the different colors you see on the rock? Why might the rock have different colors?\" *(Elicit observations: pink, gray, brown, green)*\n2. \"The green fuzzy stuff is called moss. Have you ever seen moss before? Where was it?\" *(Accept real-world examples: logs, wet areas, shaded places)*\n3. \"Why do you think moss grows on this rock and not on a dry rock in the sun?\" *(Guide thinking toward moisture and shade)*\n4. \"Look closely—does the rock look smooth or rough? How might a rough rock be different from a smooth rock?\" *(Introduce texture as observable)*\n\n**Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what happens to rocks over many, many years. Do you think rocks stay exactly the same forever, or do they change? Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"To find out how rocks change and why moss can live on them, we're going to do some hands-on exploring.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (for each group of 3-4 students):**\n- Several small rock samples (different types if possible: granite, sandstone, limestone, or any local rocks—pre-collected by teacher)\n- Paper towels\n- Spray bottles filled with water\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per student or shared)\n- Small containers or shallow trays\n- Recording sheet (provided below)\n- Pencils or crayons\n- Optional: moss samples from outside (kept moist in a container to observe)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Divide students into small groups.** Give each group a \"Rock Investigation Station\" with 2-3 different rock samples.\n\n**Student Directions (post on chart or read aloud):**\n\n1. **Observe and describe:** Pick up each rock. Look at it carefully with your magnifying glass. Draw or write what you see:\n   - What color is it?\n   - Is it smooth or rough?\n   - Does it feel wet, damp, or dry?\n\n2. **Test for water:** Take one rock and spray it lightly with water from the bottle. What happens? Does the water stay on top or soak in? Where does the water go?\n\n3. **Texture test:** Gently rub the rock with a paper towel. Do tiny bits of rock come off on the paper towel? (This shows weathering in action!)\n\n4. **Moss observation (if available):** If your teacher provided moss, observe it closely. Is it wet or dry? Does it need water? Gently spray moss with water and observe what happens.\n\n5. **Predict:** Look at the rough, wet rock. Do you think moss could grow here? Why or why not? Write or draw your prediction.\n\n**Recording Sheet for Students:**\n\n| Rock Sample | Color | Texture (Smooth/Rough) | Water Test—What Happened? | Could Moss Grow Here? Why? |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Rock 1 | | | | |\n| Rock 2 | | | | |\n| Rock 3 | | | | |\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups without providing answers.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice about how the water moves on the rough rock?\"* *\"Why might a plant like moss prefer a damp, rough rock?\"*\n- Encourage students to test their predictions by spraying water on different rocks and observing.\n- Redirect students who are off-task: *\"Let's focus on how the rock feels and how water moves on it.\"*\n- Ensure all students have a chance to observe and handle materials.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should discover that rough, porous rocks absorb water while smooth rocks may not.\n- Students should observe that water stays on damp rocks longer, creating conditions for moss.\n- Students should record observations showing they understand that texture, moisture, and rock type differ.\n- Students should predict that moss grows where it is damp and rough, not dry and smooth.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Photograph (redisplayed)\n- Vocabulary cards with definitions (pre-written)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n- Ask groups to share one discovery: *\"What did your rocks feel like? What happened when you sprayed water on them?\"*\n- Record observations on a class chart: \"What We Learned About Rocks\"\n- Point out patterns: \"Many groups found that rough rocks felt damp and held water.\"\n\n**Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\nDisplay each term on a card. Use student-friendly language and point to the photograph frequently.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n1. **Weathering:** When rocks slowly break into smaller pieces because of water, wind, and rain. It's like the rock is getting worn down over time—kind of like how your shoes get worn from walking a lot.\n\n2. **Erosion:** When small pieces of broken rock are carried away by water or wind, changing the shape of the land. The water on the rock doesn't just break it; it carries the pieces away.\n\n3. **Moss:** A small green plant that doesn't have roots or seeds. It needs moisture and shade to grow. Moss grows on rocks, logs, and damp places.\n\n4. **Habitat:** A place where a living thing lives and finds everything it needs to survive, like food, water, and shelter. For moss, a damp, shady rock is a perfect habitat!\n\n5. **Climate:** The regular weather a place gets—like if it's usually wet or dry, hot or cold. Moss grows in climates that are wet and cool.\n\n**Make Connections (5 minutes):**\n- Point to the photograph: *\"See how the moss only grows on certain parts of the rock? The green, fluffy moss is growing on the damp, rough parts where water can stay. The pink and gray rock without moss is smoother or drier.\"*\n- *\"Over many years, weathering breaks down rocks like this one. The rough surface gives moss a place to live. The water keeps the moss alive. It's like the rock and the moss help each other!\"*\n- *\"The climate here must be wet—maybe it rains a lot or it's shady. That's why moss can live here.\"*\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Ask: *\"If I showed you a dry, smooth rock in the desert, would moss grow on it? Why not?\"* (Expected answer: No moss because it's too dry and the rock is smooth.)\n- Ask: *\"What does weathering do to a rock?\" *(Expected answer: It breaks it into smaller pieces.)*\n- Ask: *\"What does moss need to be healthy?\"* *(Expected answer: Water and shade.)*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that weathering changes rocks over time.\n- Students can explain that moss is a plant that grows on rocks when it's wet and shady.\n- Students connect the rock's texture and moisture to the moss habitat.\n- Students know that climate (wet/dry) affects where moss can live.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Scenario cards (printed or written on chart paper)\n- Magazines or printed images of different landscapes (optional)\n- Blank paper and colored pencils\n- Large container with soil, pebbles, and spray bottle\n\n**Activity: \"Designing the Perfect Habitat for Moss\"**\n\n**Present a real-world scenario:**\n\n*\"Imagine the city is building a new park. There are old stone walls and sidewalks that never see sunlight because trees shade them. The city workers are worried about the rocks breaking apart and the wall becoming unsafe. They discovered that moss actually slows down weathering by protecting the rock from water damage. Your job is to design a solution: How can we help moss grow on these old stone walls to protect them from weathering?\"*\n\n**Student Task (in pairs or small groups):**\n\n1. **Plan:** On paper, draw and label a design that would help moss grow on a shaded stone wall. Include:\n   - Where you would spray water\n   - How you would keep the rock shady\n   - What conditions moss needs to survive\n\n2. **Build (optional):** Using soil, pebbles, and a spray bottle, create a mini-habitat model that shows the conditions moss needs.\n\n3. **Justify:** Write or tell why your design would work. Use vocabulary: weathering, moss, habitat, moisture, climate.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide scenario cards if students need extra support.\n- Ask probing questions: *\"What would happen if we sprayed the wall with water every day?\"* *\"Would moss grow better in a sunny spot or a shady spot? Why?\"*\n- Encourage students to use their observations from Explore.\n- Provide sentence starters: *\"Moss will grow on our wall because...\"* *\"We can reduce weathering by...\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply their understanding of moss habitat to a real-world problem.\n- Student designs show that moss needs water and shade.\n- Students make a claim connecting moss growth to slowing weathering.\n- Student explanations use vocabulary and reasoning based on earlier observations.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation checklist: Do students correctly identify texture, moisture, and color differences on rocks?\n- Group discussions: Are students using vocabulary (weathering, moss, habitat, climate) appropriately?\n- Recording sheets: Do drawings and written observations show understanding of rock weathering and moss needs?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of lesson):**\n\nGive each student a slip of paper with these questions. Students can draw, write, or tell their answers.\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Look at this picture of a wet, rough rock.** Would moss grow here? Circle: **YES** or **NO**. Why? (Accept drawings or 1-2 sentence answers.)\n\n2. **What is weathering?** (Acceptable answers: Rocks breaking into smaller pieces; water and weather wearing down rocks; rocks changing over time.)\n\n3. **Why is moss a good habitat for shady, wet rocks?** (Acceptable answers: Moss needs moisture and shade; moss protects rocks; moss likes damp places.)\n\n4. **Make a claim:** Moss helps _______________. (Acceptable completions: protect rocks from weathering; slow down erosion; make a habitat on rocks; keep rocks damp.)\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies that moss grows on damp, rough rocks.\n- ✓ Student can explain weathering in simple terms (rocks break down).\n- ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary term correctly (moss, weathering, habitat, or climate).\n- ✓ Student makes a logical claim about moss and rock protection.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will be able to identify the conditions moss needs.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that weathering changes rocks.\n- Students will show they can apply concepts to new scenarios (the park wall).\n- Exit tickets will reveal which students need reinforcement on vocabulary or concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Provide a vocabulary anchor chart** with pictures and definitions that remains visible throughout the lesson. Include the photograph labeled with key terms (moss, rock, water, weathering).\n\n2. **Pair with a peer** during Explore phase. Assign the stronger reader/observer as the \"recorder\" while the peer does the hands-on observation. Switch roles mid-activity.\n\n3. **Simplify the recording sheet:** Instead of a table, provide a simple three-box template: *\"My rock looks like...\"* / *\"When I sprayed water, it...\"* / *\"Moss could/could not grow here because...\"* Students draw or dictate answers.\n\n4. **Use multisensory cues:** Let students feel the moss, rocks, and spray bottle water. Emphasize texture and moisture verbally as they explore.\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research extension:** Provide images of landscapes with and without moss (forests, deserts, mountains). Ask: *\"In which climates would moss grow? Why? What does this tell us about the climate where moss lives?\"* (Connects to 3-ESS2-2.)\n\n2. **Cause-and-effect reasoning:** Ask: *\"If weathering breaks rocks into smaller pieces, what do you think happens to those pieces over many years? Where do they go? Could they form new rocks or soil?\"* Introduce erosion as a deeper concept.\n\n3. **Design challenge extension:** *\"Design a way to protect a stone statue in a city from weathering without using moss. What other solutions could work? Draw your design and explain your reasoning.\"* (Connects to 3-ESS3-1 on design solutions.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Moss Collection and Long-Term Observation (1–2 weeks):**\n   - Collect small moss samples from around campus (with permission).\n   - Keep in a covered container with moist soil and pebbles.\n   - Observe daily or weekly: Does it grow? What happens if you let it dry out? What happens if you keep it wet?\n   - Record observations with drawings or photos.\n   - This reinforces understanding of moss habitat and weathering as an ongoing process.\n\n2. **Weathering Simulation Experiment:**\n   - Fill two clear containers with chalk pieces or sugar cubes (representing rocks).\n   - Add water and agitation (stirring) to one container over several days.\n   - Leave the other dry and undisturbed.\n   - Compare: Which \"rocks\" broke down faster? Why?\n   - This directly models weathering caused by water and movement.\n\n3. **Local Rock and Moss Hunt Walk:**\n   - Take students on a short outdoor walk around the school or nearby park.\n   - Give each student a clipboard and checklist to find: smooth rocks, rough rocks, rocks with moss, wet rocks, dry rocks, rocks in shade, rocks in sun.\n   - Take photos or sketch findings.\n   - Return to class and discuss: *\"Did moss grow only in certain places? What was similar about all the places where we found moss?\"*\n   - This connects classroom learning to the real world and reinforces observation skills.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Prior preparation:** Collect rock samples a few days before the lesson. Include at least 2–3 different types (granite, sandstone, or local varieties). If possible, find one with a small amount of moss or lichen already on it.\n- **Safety:** Ensure spray bottles are set to a light mist. Supervise water use to prevent slipping.\n- **Vocabulary reinforcement:** Use the photograph repeatedly across all phases. Label it during Explain phase and refer back to it during Elaborate and Evaluate.\n- **Connection to NGSS:** This lesson introduces the concept that rocks and landscapes change over time (weathering/erosion) and that living things (moss) depend on specific climate conditions. This foundational understanding supports later ESS standards about Earth's systems and how humans affect them.",
