ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph while building curiosity about rocks and natural materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the stratified rock (or printed copies, 1 per table)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Students' own eyes and sensory awareness\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or smartboard. Show it large so all students can see details clearly. Alternatively, print 1 color copy per table and have students gather around.\n\n2. **Introduce with wonder:** Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. This is a real rock that someone found outside. I want you to be rock detectives today. What do you notice about this rock?\"\n\n3. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause for 5-7 seconds after each; accept all answers):\n   - \"What colors do you see in this rock?\"\n   - \"Does this rock look smooth or bumpy? How do you know?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this rock has stripes or lines across it?\" (Accept predictions without correction.)\n   - \"Have you ever seen a rock like this one? Where?\"\n\n4. **Activate prior knowledge:** Ask: \"Who has found a rock before? What did your rock feel like? What did it look like?\" Encourage 2-3 brief student shares.\n\n5. **Create wonder statement:** Point to the broken edges and ask: \"I wonder... how did this rock get so jagged and broken? Can rocks change? Let's find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be rock scientists. We'll explore rocks up close, discover what they're made of, and learn why rocks look the way they do.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rock properties through hands-on observation and sorting activities, discovering that rocks have measurable, observable characteristics.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 bag per table of mixed rocks (8-12 rocks of varying sizes, colors, and textures) – *collect 2 weeks prior from playground, garden, or purchase smooth/rough rock variety packs from nature stores*\n- 1 large piece of butcher paper per table\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- 1 magnifying glass per pair of students (optional but recommended)\n- Handout: \"Rock Detective Checklist\" (see below)\n- Small containers or cups (optional, for sorting)\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Set up exploration stations.** Divide the class into table groups (3-4 students per table). Give each group a bag of rocks and a large sheet of butcher paper.\n\n2. **Free exploration (5 minutes).** Say: \"Open your bag and feel the rocks. Pick them up. Look at them carefully. Don't sort yet—just explore! Notice how they feel, what colors they are, and if they're bumpy or smooth. If you have a magnifying glass, take a close look.\"\n\n3. **Guided observation (10 minutes).** Distribute the \"Rock Detective Checklist\" (see below). Read aloud each item and have students investigate:\n   - **Color:** \"What colors do you see? Point to the brightest color. Point to the darkest color.\"\n   - **Texture:** \"Feel the rock. Is it rough or smooth? Can you find a bumpy rock and a smooth rock?\"\n   - **Size:** \"Is it big or small? Find the biggest rock and the smallest rock in your bag.\"\n   - **Shape:** \"Is it round, pointy, flat, or irregular?\"\n   - **Weight:** \"Pick it up. Is it heavy or light? Can you hold it in one hand?\"\n\n4. **Drawing activity (5 minutes).** Say: \"Pick your favorite rock from the bag. Draw it on your paper. Color it the same color as your real rock. Add details—show if it's bumpy or smooth, big or small.\"\n\n5. **Sorting challenge (5 minutes, if time allows).** Ask: \"Can you sort your rocks into groups? You pick the rule. You might group by color, by smooth vs. bumpy, or by size. How did you decide to sort them? Why?\"\n\n**Rock Detective Checklist (teacher-prepared handout for visual reference):**\n\n| Property | My Observation |\n|----------|---|\n| **Color** | What colors do I see? |\n| **Texture** | Is it rough or smooth? |\n| **Size** | Is it big or small? |\n| **Shape** | What shape is it? |\n| **Weight** | Is it heavy or light? |\n\n*(Create with pictures/icons for emerging readers.)*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- **Circulate constantly** to each table. Ask guiding questions: \"Tell me about that rock. What do you notice?\" Do *not* give answers.\n- **Encourage sensory language:** \"You said it's bumpy—show me with your finger where it's bumpy.\"\n- **Document observations** by listening and jotting notes on which properties students naturally notice (this informs the Explain phase).\n- **Manage manipulatives:** Remind students rocks stay on the table/paper. Rocks are fragile—don't throw or drop them.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will identify and name at least 3 observable properties of rocks (color, texture, size).\n- Students will draw/represent a rock with some accurate details.\n- Students will be able to explain one way they sorted their rocks and why.\n- Teacher will have documented the language students use (smooth, bumpy, hard, heavy, light, colors, shapes) for use in Explain phase.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and cement understanding of rock properties using the Explore discoveries and the original photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The original rock photograph\n- 1-2 sample rocks (ideally similar to the photo rock—tan/brown, layered, rough)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures (teacher-made or printed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on the carpet.** Show the original photograph again. Say: \"Now let's talk like rock scientists. You discovered that rocks have different colors, textures, sizes, and shapes. Let's learn the special words for what we found.\"\n\n2. **Group share-out (5 minutes).** Ask: \"What did you discover about rocks? Who found a smooth rock? Who found a bumpy one? What colors did you see?\" Record student responses on chart paper with simple drawings. Affirm: \"You're observing like real scientists!\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary (8 minutes).** Present each term using the photograph and sample rocks:\n\n**Vocabulary with First Grade-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n- **Rock:** A hard, solid material that comes from the Earth. It doesn't grow like plants—it's just here naturally. *(Hold up a sample rock.)*\n\n- **Texture:** How something feels when you touch it. Rocks can be smooth or rough, bumpy or flat. *(Let students touch the sample rock.)*\n\n- **Color:** The way a rock looks. The same rock can have many different colors mixed together. *(Point to the striped rock in photo.)*\n\n- **Layer:** A stripe or band of material on top of another stripe. *(Point to the horizontal lines in the photograph rock.)*\n\n- **Natural material:** Something that comes from nature and Earth—not made by people. Rocks are a natural material we find outside.\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph (4 minutes).** Point to specific features:\n   - \"This rock has layers—see these stripes? They show different colors and materials stacked up.\"\n   - \"The texture is rough and bumpy. If you touched this rock, what would it feel like?\"\n   - \"This rock is tan and brown and white. It has many colors!\"\n   - \"Notice the broken, jagged edges. Rocks can break. That's part of how rocks change on Earth.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:** Ask individual students:\n   - \"Show me a smooth rock from our group. Show me a rough rock.\"\n   - \"What color is this rock?\"\n   - \"If I said a rock was a 'natural material,' what do I mean?\" *(Accept: \"It's from nature\" or \"It's from Earth\" or \"Not made by people.\")*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will use 3-4 vocabulary words correctly (rock, texture, color, layer).\n- Students will be able to identify whether a rock is smooth or rough.\n- Students will understand that rocks come from nature/Earth.\n- Students will observe that rocks can be different colors and textures.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply learning to a new context and deepen understanding by connecting rocks to real-world locations and changes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper: \"Places We Find Rocks\"\n- Rocks from around the school (collected beforehand)\n- Optional: Photos of rocks in nature (beaches, mountains, driveways, etc.)—printed or projected\n- \"Rock Hunt\" checklist (student handout)\n\n**Activity: Rock Hunt Around School**\n\n1. **Set context (2 minutes).** Say: \"Rocks are everywhere on Earth. They're on the ground, in gardens, on driveways, on playgrounds. Let's be rock detectives and find rocks around our school. When we find them, we'll describe what they look like.\"\n\n2. **Pre-hunt discussion (3 minutes).** Ask: \"Where do you think we'll find rocks around our school? Our playground? Near the building? In the garden?\" Record ideas on chart paper.\n\n3. **Guided rock hunt (8 minutes).** Take the class on a 5-minute walk around the school grounds (or stay in one area like the playground). \n   - Point out 2-3 different rocks in different locations.\n   - Ask: \"What color is this rock? Is it smooth or rough? Is it big or small?\"\n   - Let students *look* but do not collect rocks (unless you pre-collected them).\n   - Emphasize: \"Rocks are natural materials. They're all around us!\"\n\n4. **Indoor application activity (5 minutes).** Return to the classroom. Show 2-3 photographs of rocks in different settings (beach rocks, mountain rocks, driveway rocks) or describe scenarios:\n   - \"Rocks at the beach are smooth and round because water moves them.\"\n   - \"Rocks on the playground are different colors.\"\n   - \"Garden rocks are often smaller pieces.\"\n\n   Ask: \"Why do you think rocks in different places look different?\"\n\n5. **\"Rocks Change\" discussion (2 minutes).** Refer back to the original photograph's broken edges. Say: \"See how this rock is jagged and broken? Rocks can change. Wind, water, and rain break rocks into smaller pieces. Sometimes rocks roll down hills. All these things change how rocks look. Rocks are always slowly changing on Earth!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- **Facilitate the hunt** safely—establish boundaries and behavior expectations.\n- **Ask open-ended questions** rather than giving information: \"What do you observe about this rock?\"\n- **Validate observations:** \"You noticed this rock is gray. Good observation!\"\n- **Connect to Explore:** \"Remember when we found smooth rocks and rough rocks? Here's another example!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will identify rocks in multiple locations around school.\n- Students will describe observed rocks using learned vocabulary (color, texture, size).\n- Students will begin to understand that rocks exist in nature everywhere.\n- Students will make a connection between the original photograph and rocks in their own environment.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rock properties, vocabulary, and the concept that rocks are natural materials from Earth.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n\n- **Observation checklist:** As students explore and elaborate, note whether they:\n  - Use sensory language (rough, smooth, bumpy, etc.)\n  - Identify colors and properties\n  - Ask questions about rocks\n  - Engage with the rock samples appropriately\n\n- **Questioning:** Ask individual students throughout the lesson and listen for use of vocabulary and understanding of concepts.\n\n- **Drawings and sorting:** Review the rock drawings and sorting choices from Explore—do they show accurate observation?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (10 minutes)**\n\nAdminister one of the following, depending on your class's literacy level:\n\n**Option 1: Oral Exit Questions (Teacher asks individually or in small groups)**\n\nShow the original rock photograph and ask:\n1. \"What do you see in this picture? What colors are there?\"\n2. \"Use your fingers to show me: Is this rock rough or smooth?\"\n3. \"Rocks are a _____ material.\" (Choices: natural / toy)\n4. \"Can rocks change or stay the same forever?\" (Accept: \"They can break\" or \"They change.\")\n\n**Success Criteria:** Students answer 3 out of 4 questions correctly, demonstrating:\n- Observation of the rock's color and texture\n- Understanding of the term \"natural\"\n- Recognition that rocks can change\n\n**Option 2: Picture-Based Exit Ticket (for visual/emerging readers)**\n\nProvide a handout with three drawings:\n- A smooth rock and a rough rock (circle one)\n- A rock in nature and a toy (circle the natural material)\n- A whole rock and a broken rock (circle which one changed)\n\nStudents circle or point to the correct answers.\n\n**Option 3: Quick Drawing + Caption**\n\nSay: \"Draw a rock you saw or explored today. Tell me one thing about it—its color, if it's smooth or rough, or if it's big or small.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- **Proficient:** Students can name 2+ properties of rocks, use 2+ vocabulary words correctly, and explain that rocks are natural materials.\n- **Developing:** Students can name 1 property and use 1 vocabulary word; understand rocks are natural.\n- **Emerging:** Students can point to or identify rocks but need support with vocabulary; may not yet distinguish properties.\n\n**How to Determine Success:**\n\n- Most students (80%+) should be able to identify rock color and texture.\n- Most students should use the word \"rock\" and \"smooth\" or \"rough\" correctly.\n- All students should recognize that rocks come from nature/Earth.\n- If students struggle, this indicates a need for more hands-on exploration in follow-up lessons before moving to more complex Earth science concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on 2-3 key terms only (rock, smooth, rough). Introduce others later.\n   - Use only \"smooth\" and \"bumpy/rough\" for texture.\n   - Pre-teach vocabulary with visual supports (photos/icons) before the lesson.\n\n2. **Provide sensory scaffolding:** \n   - Pair struggling students with a buddy during Explore.\n   - Provide 1-2 sample rocks that clearly show smooth vs. rough for repeated comparison.\n   - Allow extra time to handle and explore rocks without pressure to record or sort.\n\n3. **Simplify the sorting task:**\n   - Instead of \"create your own sort,\" offer a choice: \"Sort by smooth and bumpy\" or \"Sort by big and small.\"\n   - Use large containers (cups) to make sorting manipulative and concrete.\n   - Accept partial sorting (doesn't need to be perfect).\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Add a deeper investigation layer:**\n   - Challenge students to sort rocks by *three* properties (e.g., \"Find rocks that are rough AND brown AND big\").\n   - Ask: \"If rocks have stripes/layers like the photo, what do you think made those stripes?\" (Accept predictions; no need for correct geology.)\n\n2. **Extend the observation:**\n   - Provide a hand lens or magnifying glass and ask: \"What tiny details do you see on your rock that you can't see with just your eyes?\"\n   - Challenge them to estimate: \"How many colors are in your rock? Can you count them?\"\n\n3. **Real-world application connection:**\n   - Ask: \"Why might people care about rocks? Where do we use rocks?\" (Driveway, building, playground, decorations.)\n   - Have them sketch a place in their community where rocks are important.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rock Art and Sorting Gallery (Following Day or Homework)**\n   - Students bring a rock from home and paint or decorate it with non-toxic paint.\n   - Create a classroom \"rock display\" where students describe their rock's properties on a card.\n   - Sort the class collection by color, size, and texture as a visual display.\n   - Learning connection: Reinforces observation and vocabulary while building community.\n\n2. **Rock Collection Observation Log (Ongoing)**\n   - Create a simple \"Rock Journal\" where students sketch and describe rocks they find over a week or month.\n   - Each page has: a space to draw the rock, spaces to circle color and texture, and a line to write/dictate where they found it.\n   - This develops observational skills and connects to real-world exploration.\n   - Learning connection: Extends learning beyond the classroom and encourages sustained inquiry.\n\n3. **Comparing Rocks and Other Natural Materials (Integrated Activity)**\n   - Gather samples: rocks, leaves, sticks, soil, sand, shells.\n   - Create a Venn diagram or sorting chart comparing \"smooth and hard\" (rocks) vs. \"rough and soft\" (leaves/sticks) vs. \"grainy\" (sand/soil).\n   - Ask: \"Which natural materials are hard? Which are soft? Which can break easily?\"\n   - Learning connection: Deepens understanding of diverse Earth materials and properties beyond rocks alone.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure rocks are free of sharp edges. Supervise handling to prevent throwing or dropping on feet.\n- **Timing:** This lesson can be split across two days—Engage/Explore on Day 1, Explain/Elaborate/Evaluate on Day 2.\n- **Sensory considerations:** Some students may not enjoy touching rocks; offer alternatives (observe with magnifying glass, point to features in photos).\n- **Connection to photo:** Return to the original rock photograph multiple times throughout the lesson to build observational skills and reference points.\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Use learned words naturally and often throughout the day to build automaticity.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson lays a strong foundation for Grade 1 Earth and Space Science by helping students observe and describe natural materials found on Earth, preparing them for more complex explorations of landforms, weathering, and Earth systems in later grades.**",
