Observe and describe the circular rings found on a tree cross-section and explain that each ring shows one year of tree growth.\n2. Identify trees as natural resources that humans use for wood and other materials.\n3. Explain that cutting down trees changes the land and discuss ways to protect trees in their community.\n4. Make observations about how tree rings can look different (different colors, widths, marks) and wonder what causes these differences.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about trees and growth using the wood cross-section photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large digital display or printed color copies (8.5\" × 11\") of the wood log photograph\n- Poster board or chart paper\n- Markers (various colors)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the image of tree logs prominently. Give students 30-45 seconds of silent looking time. Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see?\"\n\n2. **Facilitate Discovery Through Questions:** Ask students these questions in order, allowing think-pair-share (students turn to a partner) before sharing:\n   - \"What do you notice about the circles inside the wood? What do those circles remind you of?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a tree that was cut down? What did it look like?\"\n   - \"Why do you think there are circles? What could they be telling us?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this wood came from? What was it before it was cut?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Write on chart paper: \"I wonder why trees have rings inside them?\" Read it aloud and ask: \"Has anyone ever thought about this before? What do you think the answer might be?\" Accept all responses without judgment. Tell students: \"Today, we're going to discover the secret that tree rings hold!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's get our hands on a piece of wood and explore what we find inside!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate tree structure and growth through hands-on observation and modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Wood cookies or cross-sections (2-3 per pair of students; these can be obtained from craft stores, florists, or tree service companies; alternatively, use paper plates to create a model—see below)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per pair)\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- Paper plates (1 per student) as a backup/modeling material\n- Crayons\n- Tape\n- Chart for recording observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Real Wood Exploration (Preferred)**\n\n1. **Distribute Materials:** Give each pair a wood cookie and a hand lens.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Directions:** Give students these specific directions:\n   - \"Hold your wood piece up to the light. Look at the middle.\"\n   - \"Use your hand lens. Can you see circles or rings?\"\n   - \"Touch the wood gently. What does it feel like? Is it smooth or rough?\"\n   - \"Look at the outside edge. What color is it? What color is the middle?\"\n\n3. **Student Documentation:** Provide each student with a simple observation sheet (template below) with spaces to:\n   - Draw what they see (circles/rings)\n   - Count the rings out loud with their partner\n   - Color-code the rings (outside lighter, inside darker, center darkest)\n\n4. **Recording Sheet Template:**\n   ```\n   I see circles in my wood!\n   I counted _____ rings.\n   The outside is _________________ (color)\n   The middle is __________________ (color)\n   The wood feels _________________ (texture)\n   ```\n\n**Option B: Paper Plate Ring Model (If wood is unavailable)**\n\n1. **Distribute Materials:** Give each student a white paper plate, markers, and a hand lens.\n\n2. **Guided Creation:** \n   - \"Draw a small dot in the very middle of your plate.\"\n   - \"Around that dot, draw a circle. This is like one year of growing!\"\n   - \"Draw another circle around it. That's year two!\"\n   - \"Keep going until you reach the edge. Count your circles as you go.\"\n   - \"Color the middle one color and the outside rings a different color.\"\n\n3. **Student Documentation:** Students label their ring count and share with a partner.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each pair and ask open-ended questions: \"Tell me what you're noticing.\" \"Are all the rings the same size?\" \"What do you think made this ring?\"\n- Do not explain; listen and encourage more observation.\n- Use hand lens with students who need help seeing details.\n- Record on a class tally chart how many rings students count in each wood sample.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe and count rings.\n- Students will notice that rings vary in color, width, and position.\n- Students will create or document a visual record showing rings.\n- Students will express curiosity about what causes rings to form.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and the science behind tree rings after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Photograph of tree logs\n- Picture of a living tree (optional visual)\n- Vocabulary word cards with images\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Observations (5 minutes):** \n   - Ask 4-5 student pairs to share what they observed: \"What did you find? How many rings did you count?\"\n   - List counts on the board. Celebrate that different logs have different numbers of rings.\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think some have more rings than others?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):** \n   - Present each term with a Kindergarten-friendly definition and a visual representation. Write on chart and leave posted.\n   - Point to the photograph and Explore materials as you teach.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition | Visual Connection |\n|------|---------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Tree Ring** | A circle made of wood that shows how much a tree grew in one year. Each ring = one year of the tree's life. | Point to rings in photo and student work |\n| **Year** | How long it takes Earth to go around the sun one time. It's 12 months long. | Show calendar; explain \"this year\" |\n| **Growth** | Getting bigger and larger. Trees grow new rings every year. | Show hand growing taller; show log photo |\n| **Natural Resource** | Something from nature that people can use, like wood from a tree. | Show wood logs; discuss items made from wood in classroom |\n| **Harvest** | To cut down or gather something from nature to use. | Explain: \"These logs were harvested from trees.\" |\n\n3. **Direct Teaching (5 minutes):**\n   - Say: \"Every year, a tree adds a new ring. The rings are made of wood. The tree grows a little bit bigger each year. Look at our photo—these trees were cut down. When people cut down trees, they harvest the wood to make things we use.\"\n   - Show or draw a simple tree on the board, then draw a cross-section showing rings.\n   - Ask: \"If this tree has 10 rings, how many years old do you think it is?\" (10 years!)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can anyone point to a ring in our photo?\" (Use pointer/stick)\n   - Ask: \"What does one ring tell us?\" (One year of growing)\n   - Ask: \"If you counted 15 rings, how old was that tree?\" (15 years old)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name what they observed (rings).\n- Students understand that one ring = one year.\n- Students can explain that wood comes from trees (natural resource).\n- Students recognize that cutting trees changes where they grow.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by connecting tree rings to how trees meet our needs and exploring conservation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Items made from wood (pencil, wooden spoon, block, paper, book, toy, etc.)—collect 5-6 items\n- Chart paper titled \"Things Made from Trees\"\n- Picture cards of forests and harvested areas (optional)\n- Markers\n- Large paper for drawing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-World Application (7 minutes):** \n   - Show students the collection of items made from wood/trees.\n   - Ask: \"Where do you think this pencil came from? This spoon? This book?\"\n   - Explain: \"All of these were made from trees. The wood was harvested—cut down—and then made into things we use.\"\n   - Create a class chart together:\n     ```\n     Things Made from Trees\n     - Pencils\n     - Wooden spoons\n     - Books\n     - Paper\n     - Building blocks\n     - Furniture\n     ```\n\n2. **Caring for Trees & Forests (8 minutes):**\n   - Say: \"Cutting down trees gives us materials we need, but we need to protect trees, too. Trees help animals find homes and shade. They clean our air. We need to make smart choices about trees.\"\n   - Ask: \"What can we do to help trees stay healthy in our community?\"\n   - Record student ideas on chart paper:\n     - Plant new trees\n     - Don't pick off branches\n     - Rake leaves gently (don't hurt roots)\n     - Use less paper\n     - Keep trees safe from harm\n   - Ask: \"Why is this important?\" (To keep the world healthy; animals need trees; we need trees)\n\n3. **Student Application—Drawing Activity (5 minutes):**\n   - Give each student large paper and markers.\n   - Prompt: \"Draw a picture showing what YOU can do to help trees grow and stay healthy.\"\n   - Students draw and may dictate a sentence to you or a peer helper.\n   - Display on classroom wall with title: \"We Care for Trees!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide discussion toward specific, realistic actions kindergarteners can do.\n- Model respectful language about nature: \"We are helpers of Earth.\"\n- Validate all contributions and thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name items made from wood/trees.\n- Students articulate at least one way to protect trees.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that humans need trees AND trees need our help.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of tree rings, tree growth, and environmental responsibility.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** As students explore, observe and note:\n  - Can they count rings? ✓\n  - Do they notice rings are different? ✓\n  - Can they explain a ring = a year? ✓\n  - Do they understand wood comes from trees? ✓\n\n- **Questioning Strategy:** During Explain and Elaborate phases, ask individual students:\n  - \"Show me a ring. Tell me what it means.\"\n  - \"What is this wood made of?\"\n  - \"How can you help trees?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nChoose ONE format based on your class:\n\n**Option A: Drawing Exit Ticket**\n- Give each student a half-sheet with the prompt: \"Draw tree rings. How many years old is your tree?\"\n- Students draw rings and write/say the number.\n- **Success Criteria:** Student draws at least 3 distinct circles representing rings.\n\n**Option B: Verbal Exit Ticket (Interview format)**\n- Ask each student individually:\n  1. \"Point to the rings in this picture. How many do you see?\"\n  2. \"If there are 5 rings, how old is this tree?\"\n  3. \"Name one thing we can do to help trees.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student correctly identifies rings, counts (approximately), and names one conservation action.\n\n**Option C: Observation Checklist**\nStand with a checklist as students exit. Have them respond:\n- \"Show me with your fingers how many rings you counted.\" ✓\n- \"Tell me: wood comes from _____ (trees).\" ✓\n- \"Tell me one way to help trees.\" ✓\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can identify and count rings in a photograph or model.\n- 80% of students can explain that one ring = one year of growth.\n- 75% of students can name at least one way to protect trees (demonstrating understanding of K-ESS3-3).\n- Most students can identify that wood/trees are natural resources humans use (K-ESS3-1).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce Complexity in Explore:**\n   - Pair student with stronger peer for wood exploration.\n   - Provide a wood sample with very clear, distinct rings.\n   - Use the paper plate model instead of real wood—more controlled, easier to see.\n   - Pre-draw rings on a plate; student colors only.\n\n2. **Simplify Vocabulary:**\n   - Use only three key terms: *ring, tree, year.*\n   - Use the photo heavily; point and repeat: \"See the rings? They show how the tree grew.\"\n   - Create a simple, 2-page vocabulary booklet with pictures and one word each.\n\n3. **Scaffold Observation Recording:**\n   - Instead of written/drawn observations, use a checklist:\n     - □ I saw rings\n     - □ I counted them\n     - □ I felt the wood\n   - Student checks boxes instead of writing.\n\n4. **Visual Support in Explain:**\n   - Use a large, color-printed ring poster during vocabulary instruction.\n   - Show a slow, step-by-step animation or video of how a tree ring forms (search \"tree ring formation for kids,\" 1-2 minutes).\n   - Use real objects (pencil, wooden spoon) in front of student while explaining.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Exploration:**\n   - Ask: \"Are all the rings the same size? Why might some be thicker and some thinner?\" \n   - Introduce that thick rings mean the tree grew a lot that year (lots of rain, good conditions); thin rings mean less growing (drought, cold).\n   - Challenge them to order log samples by age (most rings to least).\n\n2. **Extended Application:**\n   - Ask students to predict: \"If we plant a tree today, how many rings will it have in 5 years? In 10 years?\"\n   - Have them create a poster about \"How to Start a Tree Garden\" with multiple conservation ideas.\n\n3. **Research & Presentation:**\n   - Assign: \"Find out what your favorite wooden item is made from. Draw it and tell where the wood comes from.\"\n   - Have them present to the class in 30 seconds.\n\n4. **Math Connection:**\n   - If students counted 8 rings, ask: \"Your tree is 8 years old. How many more years until it's 10? Can you show me with your fingers?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Tree Ring Timeline Walk (Indoor or Outdoor)**\n   - Create a hallway or outdoor timeline with large cards showing 1 ring, 2 rings, 3 rings, etc., up to 10 or 15.\n   - Tape a picture of a progressively larger tree at each stage.\n   - Students walk the timeline and stand at their age, discussing: \"Is a 5-year-old tree taller than a 2-year-old tree?\"\n   - Reinforces K-ESS3-1 (environment changes with growth).\n\n2. **Tree Needs Investigation (Science Station)**\n   - Set up a station with pictures of different trees (oak, pine, willow, fruit trees).\n   - Include pictures of what animals use each tree for (shelter, food, shade).\n   - Students match animals to trees and discuss: \"What does a tree need to grow? (Water, sunlight, soil.) What does a bird need from a tree? (Home!)\"\n   - Connects to K-ESS3-1 (relationship between plants and animals and their habitat).\n\n3. **Community Tree Hunt & Documentation**\n   - Take students on a short nature walk around school or nearby park.\n   - Ask: \"Can you find a tree? Is it big or small? Do you think it's old or young? Why?\"\n   - Give each student a clipboard and paper to draw or trace a tree leaf or sketch the tree.\n   - Return to class and create a class map: \"Trees in Our Neighborhood.\"\n   - Discuss: \"How are we helping trees stay safe?\" Connects to K-ESS3-3.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** If using actual wood logs, ensure no splinters are present. Sand edges if needed. Supervise hand lens use (no pointing at eyes).\n- **Material Sourcing:** Wood cookies are available from craft stores (Michaels, Joann), floral supply shops, or local arborists/tree service companies (often free!).\n- **Timing:** If lesson extends beyond 90 minutes, split across three 30-minute sessions or extend to a full week of rotating stations.\n- **Cultural Connection:** Discuss how trees are important to different cultures; some cultures celebrate or respect certain trees. Invite family stories.\n- **Interdisciplinary Link:** Connect to Literacy by reading *The Tree* by Dana Lyons or *Fall Leaves* by Loretta Holland. Connect to Math: counting rings, comparing sizes, age sequencing.",
