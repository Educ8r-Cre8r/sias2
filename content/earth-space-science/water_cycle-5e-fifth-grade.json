  "content": "# Winter Wonder: Exploring the Water Cycle in Changing Seasons\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Phase changes of water:** The photograph shows snow (solid water) on plant surfaces, demonstrating how water exists in different states and can transition between solid, liquid, and gas phases depending on temperature conditions.\n\n- **Interaction between atmosphere and biosphere:** Cold air temperatures cause water vapor to condense and freeze on living plants, illustrating how the atmosphere directly interacts with and affects living organisms.\n\n- **Seasonal variations and Earth systems:** The winter scene demonstrates how seasons affect weather patterns, temperature, and the movement of water through Earth's systems, including how frozen precipitation affects the landscape.\n\n- **Energy from the sun's role in the water cycle:** Although snow covers the plants, the photograph represents a moment where reduced solar energy (winter conditions) has caused water to freeze rather than evaporate, showing the sun's influence on water states and cycle processes.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Frozen Water: How Seasons Change the Water Cycle**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 50-minute sessions (100 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-ESS2-1 (Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact)\n  - 5-ESS2-2 (Describe and graph the amounts and percentages of water and fresh water in various reservoirs to provide evidence about the distribution of water on Earth)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Explain how the water cycle operates differently in winter versus other seasons** by describing how cold temperatures cause water to freeze on surfaces and in the atmosphere.\n\n2. **Identify and model the interactions between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere** by demonstrating how frozen precipitation forms on plants and soil.\n\n3. **Represent data about water in different forms and locations on Earth** by creating a visual chart showing where water exists as solid, liquid, and gas during winter and warmer seasons.\n\n4. **Use evidence from the photograph to support an explanation of how energy from the sun influences water's state of matter** throughout the year and in different seasons.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n---\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital display of the photograph (snow-covered daffodil)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Whiteboard or projector\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently on the board or projector without any introduction. Allow students 30 seconds to observe silently.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions** to activate curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about this flower? Describe everything you see.\"\n   - \"Where did the white covering on the leaves and buds come from?\"\n   - \"Why is the flower still blooming even though it's covered in snow/ice?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen plants or the ground look like this? When and where?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations** on chart paper. Do not correct; simply capture their thinking.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... if the sun is shining on this plant right now, why is it covered in ice instead of being melted?\" Write this question visibly and tell students: \"Today, we're going to investigate how water moves and changes in winter, and why the same water that falls as rain in summer becomes snow and ice in winter.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's design an experiment to see how temperature changes the water around us, just like in this snowy garden photo.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how temperature affects water's state through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Ice cubes (prepared ahead)\n- Warm water (in cups, about 40–50°C)\n- Cold water (in cups, room temperature or cooler)\n- Paper towels\n- Thermometers (one per group)\n- Observation sheets (printed or digital)\n- Clear containers or trays\n- Optional: salt, sugar, food coloring\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. Work in small groups of 3–4 students.\n\n2. **Set up three stations** (or rotate through one station with assigned roles):\n   - **Station A – Melting:** Place ice cubes in warm water. Predict what will happen. Observe and record every 2 minutes for 10 minutes. Record the temperature of the water.\n   - **Station B – Freezing (simulation):** Place water in a clear container. Add ice cubes around the outside to simulate freezing. Observe if the water cools and what happens at the surface.\n   - **Station C – Evaporation:** Place a small puddle of water on a paper towel in a warm location (near a window or heat source). Predict what will happen. Observe and record what the water looks like after 15 minutes.\n\n3. **Record observations** on an observation sheet with columns for:\n   - Time\n   - What the water/ice looks like\n   - Changes you notice\n   - Temperature (if using thermometers)\n\n4. **Draw or describe** the water in each form (solid ice, liquid water, and any water vapor you notice).\n\n**How This Connects to the Photograph:**\nExplain: \"In the photo, the plant was covered in snow because the air temperature dropped below freezing. The water that fell as precipitation froze on the leaves and buds. You're watching the same process—water changing states based on temperature.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"What do you think is happening to the ice right now?\" \"Why do you think the water level changed?\" \"If we left this water puddle here for a week, what might happen?\"\n- Do not provide answers; encourage students to make observations and form their own explanations.\n- Help students with thermometer readings if needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe ice melting in warm water (physical change, solid to liquid)\n- Students observe water cooling near ice (interaction of different temperatures)\n- Students notice water \"disappearing\" from the puddle (evaporation, though may not use the term yet)\n- Students record data showing temperature changes over time\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration; connect to Earth systems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Diagram of the water cycle (with seasonal variations, if available)\n- Printed vocabulary cards or digital slide\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask each group to share one observation from their station.\n   - Record findings on a master chart visible to all.\n   - Note patterns: Ice melted in warm water, water cooled near ice, water disappeared from the puddle.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   Present each term with a student-friendly definition and connect it to what students observed:\n\n   - **Evaporation:** The process where liquid water turns into water vapor (an invisible gas) and rises into the air. *\"The water in your puddle didn't disappear—it became a gas and floated up into the atmosphere, just like in the photograph area, water from snow and ice evaporates even on cold days.\"*\n\n   - **Condensation:** The process where water vapor cools down and turns back into liquid water. *\"When warm air rises and meets cold air high up, the water vapor condenses into tiny droplets that form clouds or frost on plants.\"*\n\n   - **Freezing:** The process where liquid water cools to 0°C (32°F) and becomes solid ice. *\"This is what happened in the photograph—water vapor in the air froze directly onto the cold plant surfaces.\"*\n\n   - **Melting:** The process where solid ice warms up and becomes liquid water. *\"This is what you watched happen in the warm water at your station.\"*\n\n   - **The Water Cycle:** The continuous movement of water between Earth's surface (geosphere and biosphere) and the atmosphere through evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. *\"Water is always moving—it changes form and travels between the ground, living things, the air, and back again. In winter, this cycle still happens, but water freezes into snow and ice instead of falling as rain.\"*\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the image again.\n   - \"Let's trace the water cycle in this winter scene:\n     - Where did the snow come from?\" (Evaporated water that rose, condensed high in the cold atmosphere, and fell as frozen precipitation)\n     - \"The flower is still alive—why?\" (It stored energy and water; roots absorbed water from soil; the plant adapted to survive winter)\n     - \"What happens next?\" (The sun will warm the air, the snow will melt, the water will evaporate or soak into the ground, and the cycle continues.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   Ask students to **turn and talk** with a partner: \"In the photo, explain how you think the snow got on the daffodil using the words evaporation, condensation, and freezing.\"\n\n**Vocabulary Summary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|-----|\n| **Evaporation** | When liquid water turns into invisible gas and floats into the air |\n| **Condensation** | When water gas cools down and becomes liquid water droplets |\n| **Freezing** | When liquid water gets so cold (below 0°C) it turns into solid ice |\n| **Melting** | When solid ice gets warm and turns into liquid water |\n| **The Water Cycle** | The never-ending movement of water changing forms and traveling between Earth's surface and air |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define and use the four vocabulary terms correctly.\n- Students can identify which processes happened in their experiments.\n- Students can explain (verbally or in writing) how water in the photograph changed states.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by modeling Earth systems interactions and data representation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster paper or chart paper (one per group)\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Printed water distribution data (or pre-made chart):\n  - Example: \"97% of Earth's water is salt water. Of the 3% that is fresh water, about 69% is frozen in ice caps and glaciers, 30% is groundwater, and less than 1% is in lakes, rivers, and the atmosphere.\"\n- Rulers, protractors, or circle templates (for creating pie charts)\n- Water cycle diagram template (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Model Earth Systems Interaction (10 minutes):**\n   - Divide students into groups of 3–4.\n   - Assign each group one season: **Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall.**\n   - **Task:** Create a visual model of the water cycle during your assigned season. Include:\n     - The geosphere (ground, soil, snow/ice if winter)\n     - The hydrosphere (water in oceans, lakes, rivers, clouds, precipitation)\n     - The biosphere (plants, animals, and how they interact with water)\n     - The atmosphere (clouds, sun, air)\n     - **Arrows showing how water moves** between these spheres in your season\n     - **Labels for evaporation, condensation, freezing, melting, or precipitation**\n   \n   - Provide a sentence frame: *\"In [season], water moves through Earth's systems by... The sun's energy causes... Plants and animals interact with water by...\"*\n\n2. **Represent Water Distribution Data (7 minutes):**\n   - Show students the water distribution statistics.\n   - Ask: \"If Earth has so much water, why is fresh water important and limited?\"\n   - Have students create a **simple pie chart or bar graph** showing:\n     - Salt water vs. fresh water\n     - Where fresh water is located (frozen, groundwater, liquid in lakes/rivers)\n   - Challenge students to predict: \"How does winter affect these percentages? (More water freezes into ice caps.)\"\n\n3. **Gallery Walk (optional, if time allows):**\n   - Post completed seasonal water cycle models around the room.\n   - Students walk and observe, noting similarities and differences between seasons.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide data sheets and templates.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"Why would there be MORE frozen water shown in your winter diagram?\" \"Which season has the most evaporation?\" \"How does this connect to the frozen flower in our photo?\"\n- Encourage students to think about how the sun's energy varies by season and affects the water cycle.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create visual models showing how geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere interact during a specific season.\n- Students represent water distribution data in graphic form.\n- Students explain (verbally or in writing) how their season's water cycle differs from other seasons.\n- Students make connections between data representation and real-world examples (e.g., \"In winter, more water is frozen, so there's less liquid water available for plants and animals\").\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of water cycle processes, Earth systems interactions, and data representation.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n- **Engage phase:** Listen to student predictions and prior knowledge recorded on chart paper.\n- **Explore phase:** Observe student recordings and note whether they accurately describe changes in water state and temperature.\n- **Explain phase:** Listen to \"turn and talk\" partner discussions; assess use of vocabulary and explanations.\n- **Elaborate phase:** Examine seasonal water cycle models for accuracy and inclusion of all four Earth systems; review data representations for correct interpretation.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with this assessment (can be written, drawn, or oral):\n\n**Prompt 1:** \"Look at the frozen flower photo one more time. Explain what happened to the water that froze on the plant. Use at least two of these words: evaporation, condensation, freezing, atmosphere, geosphere.\"\n\n**Prompt 2:** \"In the winter, less rain falls and more snow falls. Describe how this affects the water cycle and where water is stored on Earth during winter. (You may use your seasonal water cycle model or data chart to help you.)\"\n\n**Prompt 3 (Optional Data Question):** \"If 97% of Earth's water is salt water and only 3% is fresh water, why is it important that we protect freshwater sources? How does freezing change where fresh water is stored?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Proficiency:**\n\n✓ Student accurately describes at least two processes of the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, freezing, melting, or precipitation).\n\n✓ Student identifies interactions between at least two Earth systems (atmosphere + biosphere, atmosphere + hydrosphere, etc.).\n\n✓ Student uses correct vocabulary terms to explain the photograph or seasonal water cycle.\n\n✓ Student represents or interprets data about water distribution or seasonal changes correctly.\n\n✓ Student makes a connection between winter conditions and changes in the water cycle.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- **Proficient students** will explain the winter water cycle, use vocabulary accurately, and describe how seasonal temperature changes affect where and how water moves.\n- **Developing students** may describe one or two processes correctly but need support connecting them; may use vocabulary with minor errors.\n- **Advanced students** may explain how the water cycle varies by latitude or climate, predict long-term effects of freezing on water availability, or propose solutions related to water conservation.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create and display a large, illustrated anchor chart with the four key vocabulary words (evaporation, condensation, freezing, melting) with student-drawn pictures and arrows showing the sequence. Allow students to reference this throughout the lesson and when completing the exit ticket.\n\n2. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Provide a multiple-choice or sentence-stem version of the exit ticket:\n   - \"The snow on the flower came from water that _______ (evaporated / froze / melted) in the clouds.\"\n   - \"In winter, the water cycle is different because _______ (it's colder / there's more rain / the sun is brighter).\"\n   - Provide sentence starters: \"The water on the plant froze because...\" or \"In winter, water is stored as ice in...\"\n\n3. **Partner Exploration:** During the Explore phase, pair struggling learners with strong observers. Assign them specific roles (e.g., timekeeper, recorder, observer) so they actively contribute without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n---\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate Sublimation:** Introduce the concept of **sublimation** (solid ice turning directly into water vapor without melting first, common in very cold, dry conditions). Have students research whether sublimation happened in the photo or design an experiment to test it (e.g., observing ice in a freezer over time). Ask: \"Could the snow on the plant have turned into water vapor directly without melting first?\"\n\n2. **Data Analysis & Climate Prediction:** Provide students with real climate data (average precipitation and temperature by month for a winter climate zone). Have them create multiple graphs and predict: \"If temperatures warm by 2°C each winter, how would the amount of snow change? How would the water cycle change? What might this mean for freshwater supplies?\"\n\n3. **Explore Fresh Water Distribution in Detail:** Have advanced students research and present on where fresh water is found globally (Antarctica ice sheets, mountain glaciers, groundwater, lakes, rivers). Create a more detailed pie chart or infographic. Ask: \"Why is so much fresh water 'locked up' in ice? What human activities depend on liquid fresh water?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seasonal Water Cycle Comparison Project:**\n   Students choose two seasons and create side-by-side water cycle diagrams or posters showing how the cycle differs. They include:\n   - Average temperatures for each season\n   - Types of precipitation (rain vs. snow)\n   - How plants and animals behave differently\n   - Where water is stored (frozen, liquid, or vapor)\n   \n   This reinforces 5-ESS2-1 by deepening understanding of Earth systems interactions across time.\n\n2. **Winter Water in Your Community:**\n   Students research and report on how their local community prepares for and manages winter water (e.g., salt on roads, snow removal, protecting water pipes from freezing, winter water conservation). They create a poster, presentation, or brief written report explaining how science helps communities adapt to winter. This connects to 5-ESS3-1 (ways communities use science to protect resources).\n\n3. **Frost Formation Lab:**\n   Set up a simple experiment where students create frost on a cold surface (e.g., cold metal can filled with ice, or a freezer-safe container taken outside on a cold day). Observe and document frost formation over 10–15 minutes. Discuss: \"Is this condensation, freezing, or both? How is this similar to the frost on the flower in the photo?\" This hands-on exploration deepens understanding of condensation and freezing in real time.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis lesson uses a striking photograph of a snow-covered daffodil to make the winter water cycle tangible and observable. By having students manipulate water in different temperatures during the Explore phase, they directly experience the phase changes they'll see happening in nature. The emphasis on **Earth systems interaction** (geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere) ensures students understand water as a dynamic, interconnected part of our planet, not just a simple cycle. The data representation and seasonal modeling activities prepare students for more advanced Earth science work while meeting the performance expectations for fifth-grade ESS standards.",
