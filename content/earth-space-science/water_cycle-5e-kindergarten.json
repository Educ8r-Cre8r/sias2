ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about seasons and snow using the photograph.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Large color printout or projection of the photograph (water_cycle.jpg)\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Optional: cotton balls or white tissue paper to display on a bulletin board\n\n- **Activity:**\n  Display the photograph on the board or projector. Allow students to look at it silently for 10-15 seconds before speaking. Then ask:\n\n  1. **\"What color is this flower? Have you ever seen yellow flowers like this? When did you see them?\"**\n     (Expected response: yellow, in spring or summer)\n\n  2. **\"Look at what's all around the flower and the leaves. What is that white, fluffy stuff? Have you seen this before?\"**\n     (Expected response: snow, ice, or frost)\n\n  3. **\"How do you think this flower feels right now? Is it hot or cold?\"**\n     (Expected response: cold, freezing, icy)\n\n  4. **\"Why do you think the flower is still yellow and blooming even though it's covered with snow? What do you think helps it stay alive?\"**\n     (This is a wonder prompt—accept all responses without judgment)\n\n  Record student observations and wonderings on chart paper. Celebrate their curiosity.\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be weather scientists and plant detectives. We're going to explore what happens to plants when winter comes and snow falls. Let's see if we can discover how plants stay alive in the cold!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate how snow and cold weather affect plants through hands-on exploration and observation.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Potted plant or fresh plant clippings (with leaves and stems) available for observation\n  - Small cup of snow or crushed ice (prepared ahead or brought from outside)\n  - White powdered sugar or chalk dust (to simulate snow)\n  - Plant leaves (fresh, from outside if available)\n  - Paper towels\n  - Crayons and paper\n  - Optional: thermometer to show cold vs. warm temperatures\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Station 1 — Observing Snow on Plants (10 minutes):**\n  - Display a potted plant or fresh plant clippings on a table.\n  - Give small groups turns to carefully sprinkle powdered sugar or chalk dust on the leaves to simulate snow (or use real snow if available).\n  - Ask students: \"What do you notice? Does the plant still look green under the 'snow'? Can you still see the leaf shape?\"\n  - Students should observe that the plant is still there, still alive, but covered.\n  - Have them draw or paint a picture of a plant with \"snow\" on it on their paper.\n\n  **Station 2 — Feeling the Cold (5-10 minutes):**\n  - Provide a cup of snow or crushed ice.\n  - Let students carefully touch the snow/ice with their fingertips (brief contact only—safety first).\n  - Ask: \"Is it cold? What happens when snow sits on a warm leaf? Does it melt?\"\n  - If time allows, place a leaf on the snow and observe over a few minutes to see if frost forms.\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"What's happening?\" \"Why do you think that is?\"\n  - Do not provide answers; instead, guide observations with questions.\n  - Ensure safety (brief contact with snow, no eating).\n  - Help students record their observations through drawing and verbal descriptions.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students observe that plants still exist under snow.\n  - Students feel and describe coldness.\n  - Students create drawings or paintings showing plants in snow.\n  - Students begin to understand that plants can survive winter conditions.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and scientific concepts based on student discoveries.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper with vocabulary words\n  - Picture cards or photograph showing seasons\n  - Optional: calendar or seasonal poster\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n  - Invite students to share what they observed at each station.\n  - Celebrate all observations: \"I noticed the plant was still green under the white powder!\" \"It was very cold!\"\n  - Ask: \"Did the plants die when we put snow on them? What does that tell us about plants?\"\n\n  **Vocabulary Introduction (5-7 minutes):**\n  Introduce these terms using visual supports and the photograph:\n\n  - **Snow:** Cold, white precipitation (frozen water) that falls from the sky in winter.\n  - **Season:** A time of year with certain weather patterns (winter is cold and snowy; spring is warm).\n  - **Weather:** What it's like outside—hot, cold, rainy, snowy, sunny.\n  - **Winter:** The coldest season when plants rest and snow falls.\n  - **Plant needs:** Plants need sunlight, water, and soil to survive—even in winter, plants get water from snow and ice.\n\n  **Connection Back to Photo (3-5 minutes):**\n  - Return to the original photograph.\n  - Point to the yellow flower: \"This flower is blooming in winter under the snow! That's special. The plant still has the water it needs from the snow. The plant is still getting some sunlight. Even though it's cold, the plant survives.\"\n  - Point to the snow-covered buds: \"These buds are waiting for spring. When it gets warmer, they will open into beautiful flowers, just like the yellow one.\"\n\n  **Check for Understanding:**\n  Ask: \"Can someone tell me what season it is in this picture? How do you know?\" (Look for: cold, snowy, white, winter)\n  Ask: \"Does the plant need water in winter? Where does it get water?\" (Accept: snow, rain, ice, melting snow)\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Snow:** Frozen water that falls from clouds as white, cold flakes in winter.\n  - **Season:** A time of year with certain weather patterns.\n  - **Weather:** How hot or cold it is outside, and whether it's sunny, rainy, snowy, or windy.\n  - **Winter:** The coldest season when snow falls and plants rest.\n  - **Plant needs:** Things a plant needs to live and grow: sunlight, water, and soil.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students can point to snow in a picture and name it.\n  - Students understand that winter is a cold, snowy season.\n  - Students begin to understand that plants need water even in winter (from snow).\n  - Students recognize that plants survive winter conditions.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding of seasons, weather, and plant survival to a new context.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Large paper or poster board (one per small group or individual, depending on class size)\n  - Crayons, markers, colored pencils\n  - Magazines (optional, for cutting pictures)\n  - Cotton balls, white tissue paper, or paper snowflakes (to create a winter scene)\n  - Glue and scissors\n  - Optional: small plant to include as a model\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Create a Winter Garden Scene (15-20 minutes):**\n  - Explain: \"We're going to create our own snowy garden picture, just like the one in the photograph. We'll show a plant in winter with snow around it.\"\n  - Provide each student or small group with materials to create a collage or drawing.\n  - Prompt them:\n    - \"Draw or paint a plant with leaves and flowers.\"\n    - \"Add snow around your plant using cotton balls, tissue paper, or white markers.\"\n    - \"Think about what your plant needs to survive the winter. Can you show sunlight? Can you show water?\"\n  - As students work, ask questions:\n    - \"Tell me about your plant. What season is it?\"\n    - \"How is your plant getting water?\"\n    - \"Will your plant come back when spring comes?\"\n\n  **Optional Real-World Connection:**\n  - If possible, go outside briefly (or look out a window) and observe plants in your school garden or neighborhood during winter.\n  - Ask: \"Do we see any plants still alive outside? How are they surviving the cold?\"\n  - Discuss: \"What do you think humans can do to help plants survive winter?\" (water them, protect them, not step on them, etc.)\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate and ask guiding questions about student choices and understanding.\n  - Encourage students to explain their thinking: \"Why did you choose to put cotton balls there?\"\n  - Support fine motor skills as needed (cutting, gluing).\n  - Listen for evidence that students understand plants survive winter with water and sunlight.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students create a representation of a winter garden.\n  - Students show evidence of understanding that plants need water (snow) and can survive cold weather.\n  - Students can explain their artwork and the needs of their plant.\n  - Students begin to think about human responsibility toward plants (not harming them, helping them survive).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of weather patterns, seasons, and plant survival.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n  Throughout the lesson, observe and listen for evidence:\n  - Do students identify snow in the photograph and describe its appearance?\n  - Can students explain that the plant is still alive under the snow?\n  - Do students recognize that winter is cold and snowy?\n  - Do students understand that plants get water from snow?\n\n  **Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes):**\n  At the end of the lesson, ask each student (or small group) to respond to one or both of these prompts:\n\n  1. **Show and Tell:** \"Show me a plant covered in snow. Now tell me: Does this plant need water? Where does it get water in winter?\"\n\n  2. **Picture Prompt:** Display the original photograph again. Ask: \"What season is this? How do you know?\" and \"Do you think this plant will be okay? Why or why not?\"\n\n  - Accept verbal responses for kindergarteners (they can point to pictures or use words).\n  - Kindergarten students may draw or dictate answers if writing is not yet developed.\n\n  **Success Criteria:**\n  Students demonstrate understanding if they can:\n  ✓ Identify snow in a picture and describe it as cold or white.\n  ✓ Recognize that plants still live under snow.\n  ✓ Explain that plants get water from snow or rain.\n  ✓ Identify winter as a cold, snowy season.\n  ✓ Create a simple representation of a plant in winter.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students show evidence of observing and describing weather (snow, cold, winter).\n  - Students demonstrate understanding that plants have needs (water, sunlight) that are met even in winter.\n  - Students can explain a simple connection between seasons and plant survival.\n  - Students are beginning to think about caring for plants and the environment.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support:**\n  1. **Use real objects and hands-on materials:** Provide actual snow or ice, potted plants, and tactile materials (cotton balls). Kindergarteners learn through touch and sight; concrete materials are essential.\n  2. **Simplify vocabulary:** Use shorter, simpler sentences. Instead of \"precipitation,\" say \"rain and snow.\" Repeat key words (snow, winter, cold, plant, water) frequently with visual supports.\n  3. **Provide sentence starters:** For students struggling with language, offer prompts: \"I see...,\" \"It is...,\" \"The plant needs...,\" \"Winter is...\"\n\n- **Challenge:**\n  1. **Extend to water cycle thinking:** Ask advanced students: \"Where does snow come from? What happens when snow melts?\" Guide them to think about clouds, water, and the cycle.\n  2. **Investigate plant adaptations:** Ask: \"Why do some plants lose their leaves in winter? Why does this plant still have leaves? What's different about it?\" Introduce the idea that plants adapt to survive.\n  3. **Create a seasonal sequence:** Have students draw or arrange pictures of the same plant in all four seasons, describing what changes in weather and what the plant looks like.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Winter Nature Walk Journal:** Take students on a walk around the school or neighborhood (or observe from a window). Have them draw or dictate observations of real plants in winter. Ask: \"Is the plant alive? How can you tell? What do you see on the plant (frost, snow, ice)?\" Create a classroom book: *Our Winter Plants.*\n\n2. **Melting Ice Experiment:** Place ice cubes or snow in a clear container in the classroom. Over several days, observe and record what happens as it melts. Ask: \"Where does the water come from? Where does it go? Is this water plants can use?\" This introduces the water cycle in a concrete way.\n\n3. **Create a Classroom \"Four Seasons\" Bulletin Board:** Display photographs or student artwork showing the same plant (or a similar plant) in all four seasons. Label each season and describe the weather and what the plant looks like. Reinforce pattern recognition and seasonal change.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\nThis lesson honors kindergarteners' natural curiosity about their environment while building foundational understanding of weather, seasons, and basic plant ecology. The photograph is powerful because it shows life and beauty even in harsh conditions—a message that resonates with young learners. Emphasize concrete observations and real materials. Use the photograph repeatedly as an anchor and reference point. Celebrate student wondering and encourage them to notice patterns in their own neighborhood as seasons change.",
