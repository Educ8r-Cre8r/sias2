The Sun is positioned right behind one of the tall buildings, creating a dramatic lens flare effect. You can see many skyscrapers of different heights and colors - some glass buildings reflecting light, others in shadow. In the foreground are trees and smaller structures. The sky has a soft, hazy quality from the sunlight streaming through.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates how the Sun provides light and energy to Earth. The Sun is our nearest star, located about 93 million miles away! Despite this huge distance, the Sun's energy reaches Earth in just 8 minutes, traveling as light and other forms of radiation. The position of the Sun in the sky changes throughout the day as Earth rotates, causing sunrise, noon, and sunset. The dramatic lighting we see here occurs when the Sun is low on the horizon - its light must travel through more of Earth's atmosphere, which scatters the blue light and allows warm colors to dominate. The Sun is the ultimate source of almost all energy on Earth!\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Solar Energy**: Energy from the Sun in the form of light and heat that powers life on Earth.\n\n2. **Earth's Rotation**: Earth spins on its axis once every 24 hours, causing day and night.\n\n3. **The Sun as a Star**: The Sun is a star - a massive ball of hot gas that produces light and heat through nuclear reactions.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate a \"Sun's Path\" tracking activity!
