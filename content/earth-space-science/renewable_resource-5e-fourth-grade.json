Identify natural resources used in the construction of human shelters and explain why each material is chosen.\n2. Describe how humans extract and use renewable resources from the environment to meet their needs.\n3. Compare multiple solutions for reducing the environmental impact of building materials and construction practices.\n4. Explain the connection between material properties and how well a structure protects people from weather and natural events.\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about building materials and natural resources through the photograph of a structure under construction.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Digital or printed photograph of the shed/building interior\n- Projector or large display screen\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the screen. Allow students to observe silently for 30 seconds. Ask them to notice what they see without talking yet.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What materials do you see in this building? Where do you think they came from?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the builders chose wood for the frame and that thick, fluffy material for the walls? What job does each material do?\"\n   - \"If we cut down trees to make this building, what happens to the forest? Is that a problem?\"\n   - \"Can we use wood again and again, or do we run out? How?\"\n\n3. **Show a short clip or image sequence** (30 seconds) showing: a forest → trees being cut → wood being processed → the final structure. Ask: \"What do you notice happened to get from the forest to this building?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we didn't have wood to build shelters. What would we use instead? Would it work as well?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore what natural resources are, why builders choose certain materials, and how we can use these resources in ways that don't hurt our environment.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate natural materials, test their properties, and determine which materials work best for specific building purposes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Samples of building materials: small pieces of wood, insulation material (or cotton batting), glass or clear plastic, cardboard, aluminum foil, paper, straw\n- Thermometers (3-4)\n- Lamps or heat source (optional, teacher-controlled)\n- Rulers\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Data recording sheet (provided by teacher)\n- Construction paper and tape for creating mini-structures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into groups of 3-4.** Assign each group a \"building material station\" with different samples.\n\n2. **Provide each group with a data recording sheet** with these tests:\n   - **Strength Test:** Can the material hold weight? (Place small objects on the material; record if it bends or breaks)\n   - **Insulation Test:** Does it keep heat in or out? (Place thermometer under the material; measure temperature after 5 minutes with and without a heat source nearby)\n   - **Water Resistance Test:** Does it absorb water or repel it? (Spray lightly with water; observe what happens)\n   - **Light Test:** Does it block light or let light through? (Hold it up to light; record observations)\n\n3. **Give these step-by-step directions to students:**\n   - \"Test each material using the four tests listed on your sheet.\"\n   - \"For each test, make a prediction first: 'I think this material will... because...'\"\n   - \"Then do the test. Write down what actually happened.\"\n   - \"Discuss as a group: Which material was best for this test? Why?\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:** Circulate among groups. Ask guiding questions: \"Why do you think the wood didn't bend?\" \"What does this material do really well?\" \"Would you want this material in your roof? Why or why not?\" Do not provide answers; help students think deeper.\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n   - Students complete a data sheet showing which materials performed best for each test.\n   - Groups identify 1-2 materials that would work best for specific parts of a building (roof, walls, insulation).\n   - Students discover that different materials have different strengths and weaknesses.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and explain how natural resources are used in building and why material selection matters.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary (prepared beforehand)\n- Photograph of the shed\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Picture cards showing: forest, lumber mill, tree harvest, finished building\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Conduct a group share-out:** Ask 2-3 groups to briefly share one discovery: \"What did you learn about [wood/insulation/glass]? When would you use it in a building?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary using the photograph as reference:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Natural Resource:** A material found in nature (like trees, water, or stone) that humans use to meet their needs. *Example: Wood is a natural resource because it comes from trees.*\n   - **Renewable Resource:** A natural resource that can be replaced or regrown in a reasonable amount of time. *Example: Trees are renewable because we can plant new trees where old ones were cut.*\n   - **Non-renewable Resource:** A natural resource that cannot be replaced quickly once it's used up. *Example: Fossil fuels like oil take millions of years to form.*\n   - **Material Properties:** The characteristics of a material that make it useful for a certain job, such as strength, flexibility, or ability to keep heat in. *Example: Wood has the property of being strong, so it's good for building frames.*\n   - **Sustainable Building:** Using natural resources in ways that don't damage the environment and allow the resources to be available in the future. *Example: Planting new trees after cutting old ones is sustainable.*\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the wooden frame: \"This wood is a renewable natural resource. It came from trees. The builder chose wood because it's strong (material property). If new trees are planted where these trees were cut, the forest can regrow.\"\n   - Point to the insulation: \"This fluffy material is designed to keep heat and cold from entering the building. That's its material property. It protects people inside from extreme temperatures.\"\n   - Point to the window: \"Glass lets light in but keeps weather out. Different material properties for a different job.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can anyone name a natural resource we use at home or at school?\" (Collect 3-4 answers.)\n   - \"Which of these is renewable: trees, oil, water, coal?\" (Guide students to understand trees and water can regrow; oil and coal cannot.)\n   - \"Why did the builders use wood instead of plastic for the main frame?\" (Wood is stronger; it's a natural resource; it comes from a renewable source if managed well.)\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n   - Students can define and give examples of natural resources and renewable resources.\n   - Students understand that builders choose materials based on their properties.\n   - Students recognize that sustainable practices (like replanting trees) allow humans to use natural resources responsibly.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a solution that reduces environmental impact when using natural resources for building.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or short descriptions of different building scenarios\n- Chart paper and colored markers\n- Optional: Building materials (craft sticks, cardboard, newspaper, tape, string) for design prototypes\n- Rubric for evaluating solutions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present a Real-World Problem:** \n   \"A community wants to build 100 new homes to house families, but they're worried: If we cut down too many trees, the forest will disappear. Animals will lose their habitat. The forest won't be able to regrow. How can we build homes in ways that protect the environment?\"\n\n2. **Organize students into new groups of 3-4.** Each group receives one of these scenarios:\n   - **Group 1:** Reducing tree cutting: How can we use less wood? What other materials could replace it?\n   - **Group 2:** Replanting and regrowth: How do we make sure forests grow back after we harvest trees?\n   - **Group 3:** Energy efficiency: How can we design buildings that don't need as much heating or cooling (so fewer resources are used overall)?\n   - **Group 4:** Recycling materials: How can we reuse old building materials instead of always using new ones?\n\n3. **Give these directions:**\n   - \"Your group must come up with 2 solutions to your problem.\"\n   - \"For each solution, explain: What is it? How does it reduce environmental damage? Could it actually work? What are the challenges?\"\n   - \"Draw a picture or diagram showing your solution.\"\n\n4. **Teacher Role:** Provide guiding questions without answers:\n   - \"What happens to the environment if we harvest trees? How does your solution reduce that impact?\"\n   - \"Who would need to help make this solution work—builders, government, communities, or all of them?\"\n   - \"Is your solution practical (can we really do it)? Why or why not?\"\n\n5. **Gallery Walk (final 5 minutes):** Post all solutions around the room. Students do a quick walk to see other groups' ideas. Ask: \"Which solution do you think would work best? Why?\"\n\n6. **Expected Student Outcomes:** \n   - Students create 2 solutions for reducing environmental impact of building.\n   - Solutions show understanding that natural resources must be managed carefully.\n   - Students can explain trade-offs (solutions that work well but have challenges).\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of natural resources, material properties, and sustainable building practices.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student participation and accuracy during Explore activities (material testing).\n- Listen to group discussions in Elaborate phase for evidence of understanding.\n- Use observation checklist: Can students identify renewable resources? Do they understand why materials are chosen? Can they suggest sustainable solutions?\n\n**Exit Ticket Assessment (end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (printed or digital) with these three questions:\n\n1. **Identify:** \"Write down two natural resources used in buildings. For each one, write whether it is renewable or non-renewable.\"\n\n2. **Explain:** \"Why did the builders in the photograph choose wood for the frame instead of plastic? (Hint: Think about material properties.)\"\n\n3. **Apply:** \"A company wants to build a new school. How could they reduce the environmental impact of using trees and other natural resources?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- ✓ Students correctly identify at least 2 natural resources and classify 1 as renewable and 1 as non-renewable.\n- ✓ Students explain that wood is stronger than plastic, or that it comes from renewable sources (or both).\n- ✓ Students suggest at least one realistic solution, such as: planting new trees, using less wood, recycling old materials, or building with recycled materials.\n- ✓ Students show reasoning: their explanation connects their idea to reducing environmental impact.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most fourth graders will identify common resources (wood, water, stone) and understand the basic difference between renewable and non-renewable.\n- Students will recognize that material choice depends on what job the material needs to do.\n- Students will generate at least one practical idea for sustainable building.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visuals:** Provide picture cards with labels for vocabulary terms (natural resource, renewable, sustainable). Use photos of real-world examples (trees → lumber → house) as visual reference throughout the lesson.\n\n2. **Guided group work:** Assign these students to mixed-ability groups. Provide a sentence starter for discussions: \"We chose [material] because it is good at [property like: being strong, keeping heat out, etc.]\"\n\n3. **Modified exit ticket:** Reduce the number of questions or provide multiple-choice options. Example: \"Wood is renewable because: A) We can plant new trees, B) It's cheap, C) It's pretty.\" Pair the exit ticket with a brief teacher conversation to clarify understanding.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research and present:** Ask students to research and report on one of these topics: \"How do countries manage forests sustainably?\" \"What are some alternatives to wood for building that are environmentally friendly?\" or \"How do modern green buildings reduce their environmental impact?\" Have them present findings to the class.\n\n2. **Cost-benefit analysis:** Provide information about the cost and environmental impact of different building materials. Ask: \"Which material is most sustainable overall if we consider cost, environmental damage, and how long the building lasts?\" Have students defend their choice using data.\n\n3. **Design challenge:** Challenge students to design a miniature structure (using craft materials) that uses the least amount of material possible while still being strong. Measure and calculate: \"Which design used the fewest resources but still worked well?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Interview a Builder or Architect:** Invite a local carpenter, contractor, or architect to visit (in person or via video call) to discuss: \"How do you choose building materials? Do you try to use sustainable resources? What challenges do you face?\" Students prepare 3-5 questions in advance.\n\n2. **Compare Homes Around the World:** Show photographs of traditional shelters from different cultures and climates (igloo, mud brick home, bamboo hut, log cabin). Discuss: \"What natural resources were available in each place? How did that affect what materials people used to build?\" Students create a comparison chart showing materials, local resources, and climate challenges each design solved.\n\n3. **Design a Sustainable Classroom Addition:** Present the scenario: \"Our school needs a new classroom. Design a building plan that uses natural resources wisely. Show what materials you'd use, why, and how you'd reduce environmental impact.\" Students create a labeled diagram or written proposal with drawings. Display projects in the hallway or present to school administration.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
