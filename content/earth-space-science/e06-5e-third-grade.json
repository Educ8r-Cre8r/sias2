Water that once filled soil is now absent, showing one part of the water cycle (evaporation).\n- **Weather and Climate Patterns:** Prolonged drought (very dry weather over a long time) causes soil to lose moisture and crack. This demonstrates the connection between weather conditions and changes to Earth's surface.\n- **Soil as a Natural Resource:** Soil is essential for plant growth and life. When soil cracks and dries, it can no longer support healthy plants, as shown by the sparse vegetation visible in the cracks.\n- **Resilience of Life:** Small plants are still attempting to grow in the harsh, dry conditions, showing how some organisms adapt and survive in difficult environments.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**When Earth Gets Thirsty: Exploring Drought and Dry Soil**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or 90 minutes total if combined)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 3-ESS2-1 (Represent data about weather conditions)\n  - 3-ESS2-2 (Obtain and combine information about climates)\n  - 3-ESS3-1 (Make a claim about design solutions to weather hazards)\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Explain what happens to soil when there is very little water (drought) and describe how this affects plants.\n2. Collect and record observations about soil moisture and cracking patterns using pictures, drawings, and words.\n3. Identify ways that communities can prepare for and respond to periods of very dry weather.\n4. Predict how different amounts of water affect soil and plant growth over time.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the cracked, dry soil photograph and connect it to their own experiences with water, soil, and weather.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image (photograph e06.jpeg) or printed copies (1 per pair/small group)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: spray bottle with water\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Initial Observation (3 minutes):**\n   - Project the photograph on a screen or display it on a document camera. Alternatively, distribute printed copies to pairs.\n   - Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. What do you notice about the ground?\"\n   - Allow 30-45 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions (5-7 minutes):** Ask these questions one at a time, allowing 20-30 seconds of think time before students respond:\n   - \"Why do you think the ground is so cracked and broken into puzzle pieces?\"\n   - \"What do you think is missing from this soil?\" (Guide toward: water)\n   - \"Have you ever seen soil or dirt look like this? When? Where?\"\n   - \"Do you see any plants trying to grow here? Why would plants find it hard to grow in this soil?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Write on chart paper: \"What happens to soil when there is no water for a long time?\"\n   - Say: \"Today, we're going to become soil scientists and figure out what happens when the Earth gets too dry. We'll do an experiment to see how water changes soil.\"\n\n4. **Optional Hook:** \n   - Show students a spray bottle. Say: \"This bottle holds water — the same thing soil needs to stay soft and healthy. Watch what happens.\" Mist your hand lightly and talk about how water makes things wet and keeps them soft.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's explore what really happens to soil when it dries out, just like in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students conduct a hands-on investigation to discover how soil changes when water is removed.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- 1 clear plastic cup or small container\n- Potting soil or garden soil (about 2 cups per group)\n- Spray bottle filled with water\n- Paper towels\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring cracks)\n- Data collection sheet (see Activity section)\n- Pencil\n- Observation chart or notebook\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Creating Wet Soil (5 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute one cup of dry soil to each group.\n2. Say: \"First, we're going to make our soil wet, like soil would be after rain. Use the spray bottle to spray water onto the soil until it feels damp but not muddy. Keep track of how many sprays you use.\"\n3. Have students spray and mix the soil with a stick or pencil. They should record the number of sprays on their data sheet.\n4. Observe together: \"Look at your wet soil now. Is it cracked? Does it hold together? Can you squeeze it gently?\"\n\n**Part 2: Predicting What Happens (3 minutes)**\n\n1. Say: \"Now we're going to leave this soil alone for the next few days. Before we do, I want you to predict: What do you think will happen to this wet soil over time?\"\n2. Have students draw or write their prediction on their data sheet: \"I think the soil will _____.\"\n\n**Part 3: Daily Observations (10-15 minutes over 3-5 days)**\n\n1. Place soil cups in a warm location (near a window if possible—sunlight helps soil dry).\n2. Each day (or every other day), have students:\n   - **Look:** Observe the soil without touching it. Is it still wet? Do you see cracks forming?\n   - **Draw:** Sketch what the soil looks like on their data sheet.\n   - **Measure:** If cracks are visible, use a ruler to measure the width of a crack (in centimeters or by drawing a line).\n   - **Count:** How many cracks do you see today?\n   - **Compare:** Is it more cracked than yesterday? Less? The same?\n   - **Record:** Write or draw one thing they notice on a daily observation log.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What changed since yesterday?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\" \"What does the soil feel like now compared to when we started?\"\n- Do NOT say \"The water evaporated.\" Let students discover this through their observations.\n- Encourage detailed drawings and labels (use arrows to point to cracks, write \"dry\" and \"wet\" labels).\n- Keep a large class observation chart on the wall where one representative from each group adds their daily observation (simple drawing or tally of cracks).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe soil becoming progressively drier over days.\n- They notice and record cracks forming and widening.\n- They begin to infer that water is disappearing and soil is shrinking, causing cracks.\n- Drawings and notes show increasing detail and pattern recognition (e.g., \"More cracks each day\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and scientific concepts. Connect student observations to the original photograph and the water cycle.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary written large\n- The original drought photograph (projected or printed)\n- Pictures of drought-affected areas (optional: Google Images search \"drought soil\")\n- A simple diagram of the water cycle (sun → water evaporates → water disappears)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Group Share-Out (5 minutes)**\n1. Ask: \"What did you observe happening to your soil over the days we watched it?\"\n2. Call on 3-4 groups to share. Write key words on chart paper as they speak (e.g., \"cracks got bigger,\" \"soil was hard,\" \"no wet spots\").\n3. Say: \"Great! You all noticed that the soil changed from wet to dry, and cracks formed. This is exactly what happened in that photograph from the beginning of our lesson!\"\n\n**Step 2: Introduce Key Vocabulary (5-7 minutes)**\n\nDisplay and define these terms using student-friendly language:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Drought** | A long time with very little rain or water. The land gets very, very dry. |\n| **Evaporation** | When water disappears into the air because of heat from the sun. (Relate: \"This is what happened to the water in your soil—it went up into the air!\") |\n| **Soil** | The top layer of Earth where plants grow. It is made of rocks, minerals, and sometimes water. |\n| **Moisture** | Water that is in or on something. When soil has moisture, it feels damp. |\n| **Cracking** | When something hard breaks into pieces because it has lost water or shrunk. |\n\n**Step 3: Connect to the Photograph (3 minutes)**\n1. Display the original drought photograph again.\n2. Say: \"This photograph shows soil that has gone through a long drought—just like your soil did, but for a much longer time! The water evaporated from the soil because there was no rain. The soil dried out and cracked into these puzzle-piece shapes you see.\"\n3. Point to the small plants in the cracks. Say: \"See these tiny plants trying to grow? Even though the soil is dry and cracked, life is still trying to survive. Plants need water to grow big and strong, so these plants are struggling.\"\n\n**Step 4: Check for Understanding (2 minutes)**\nAsk these questions to gauge comprehension:\n- \"What is evaporation?\" (Wait for response: water going into the air)\n- \"Why do you think the soil cracked?\" (Prompt: What happened to the water? What happened to the soil when it dried out?)\n- \"Is a drought the same as one dry day? Why or why not?\" (Drought lasts a long time)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use the word \"evaporation\" to explain where water goes.\n- They understand that drought = no rain for a long time.\n- They can connect their observations (wet soil → dry soil with cracks) to the photograph.\n- They begin to understand that drought affects plant survival.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of drought and dry soil to a new context. Students explore solutions to drought challenges.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper (3 sheets)\n- Markers\n- Index cards or sticky notes\n- Pictures of solutions (irrigation, water collection, drought-resistant plants) — optional but helpful\n- Soil cups from Explore phase (still drying, for comparison)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Problem Solving:**\n\n1. **Present the Scenario (2 minutes):**\n   - Say: \"Imagine you are a farmer who grows food for your community. A drought has started in your area. It hasn't rained in two months. Your fields are starting to look like the soil in our photograph—dry and cracked. Your plants are dying. What would you do to help your plants survive?\"\n\n2. **Brainstorm Solutions (5 minutes):**\n   - Divide class into 3 groups.\n   - Give each group a piece of chart paper with one of these headers:\n     - **Group 1:** \"Ways to Save Water for Plants\"\n     - **Group 2:** \"Ways to Get Water to Dry Soil\"\n     - **Group 3:** \"Plants That Can Survive Drought\"\n   - Have groups brainstorm and draw/write as many ideas as they can in 4-5 minutes. Encourage wild ideas!\n   - Circulate and ask: \"Why would that help?\" \"Where would that water come from?\"\n\n3. **Share and Evaluate (5 minutes):**\n   - Each group shares their chart. Teacher writes or sketches key ideas.\n   - Ideas might include: digging wells, using sprinklers, collecting rainwater, planting cactuses or drought-resistant plants, using mulch, etc.\n   - Say: \"These are real solutions people use when droughts happen! Farmers, towns, and scientists all work together to save water and protect plants and people.\"\n\n4. **Design Challenge (Option, if time allows - 3-5 minutes):**\n   - Say: \"If you had one cup of water and needed to help a plant survive a drought, what would be the smartest way to use that water?\" \n   - Let students share quick ideas or sketch their thinking.\n\n5. **Compare to Real Solutions (1-2 minutes):**\n   - If available, show pictures of drip irrigation, rain barrels, or xeriscaping (drought-resistant gardens).\n   - Say: \"See? People have invented clever ways to help during droughts, just like your ideas!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Validate all ideas without judgment initially (\"That's a creative idea!\").\n- Ask follow-up questions to deepen thinking: \"Would that work forever?\" \"What materials would we need?\" \"Who would help make that happen?\"\n- Gently guide toward practical and realistic solutions while celebrating creative thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students generate realistic and creative solutions to drought problems.\n- They explain reasoning for their solutions (e.g., \"I would use a sprinkler because it spreads water to all the plants\").\n- They recognize that communities and individuals can take action to reduce drought impacts.\n- They understand that different plants need different amounts of water.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of drought, evaporation, soil changes, and drought solutions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore phase:\n  - ✓ Student records observations daily\n  - ✓ Student notices changes in soil (cracks, dryness)\n  - ✓ Student attempts to explain why changes occur\n- **Questions during Explain phase:**\n  - Can student define \"evaporation\"?\n  - Can student point to the photograph and explain what happened to the soil?\n- **Group brainstorm participation** during Elaborate phase:\n  - Is student contributing ideas?\n  - Are ideas connected to water and plant survival?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nGive each student an index card. They may draw, write, or both. Provide these sentence starters:\n\n**Option 1 (Drawing-Based, for students who prefer visuals):**\n- Fold paper in half.\n- Left side: \"This is what wet soil looks like\" (draw or label)\n- Right side: \"This is what dry soil looks like\" (draw or label)\n- Bottom: \"What happened to the water?\" (1-2 word answer)\n\n**Option 2 (Written, for students ready for short writing):**\nAnswer these questions (teacher reads aloud; students write or dictate):\n1. What is evaporation? (1-2 sentences)\n2. Why did the soil in the photograph have cracks? (1-2 sentences)\n3. Name one way to help plants survive a drought. (1 sentence)\n\n**Option 3 (Oral, for students who need verbal expression):**\n- Teacher or aide sits with student and asks:\n  - \"Show me in this photograph where evaporation happened.\"\n  - \"What happened to the water in your soil cup?\"\n  - \"If you were a farmer during a drought, what would you do?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n| **Standard/Learning Objective** | **Evidence of Mastery** |\n|---|---|\n| 3-ESS2-1: Represent data | Student daily observations show pattern recognition (cracks increase, soil gets drier). Data is recorded in words, drawings, or tallies. |\n| 3-ESS2-2: Describe climates | Student can explain that drought = long dry period and explain how it affects soil and plants. |\n| 3-ESS3-1: Claim about design solution | Student proposes and explains at least one realistic solution to drought (e.g., \"Use sprinklers because they spread water\"). |\n| Learning Objective 1 | Student can explain soil changes during drought and link to plant survival. |\n| Learning Objective 2 | Student records and describes observations using multiple modalities (drawing, words, numbers). |\n| Learning Objective 3 | Student identifies and explains a drought-response strategy. |\n| Learning Objective 4 | Student prediction (from Explore) is compared to actual results; student reflects on accuracy. |\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Objectives:**\n- **All 4 Learning Objectives Met:** Student completes exit ticket with clear explanations, participated fully in Explore, used vocabulary correctly in Explain, and contributed thoughtful solutions in Elaborate.\n- **3 of 4 Met:** Student shows understanding of most concepts but may need clarification on one (e.g., still confuses evaporation with something else).\n- **Support Needed:** Student struggles to explain evaporation or link observations to drought; needs pre-teaching or one-on-one review.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:**\n   - Instead of \"evaporation,\" use \"The water went away into the air\" or \"The sun drank the water.\"\n   - Pair \"drought\" with a simple picture (sun, no rain, dry land).\n   - Use \"wet\" and \"dry\" instead of \"moisture\" initially.\n\n2. **Concrete Observation Tools:**\n   - Provide a **picture checklist** for daily observations instead of open-ended journaling:\n     - ☐ Soil is wet / dry / in between\n     - ☐ I see cracks: yes / no\n     - ☐ Cracks are small / medium / big\n   - Student checks boxes instead of writing sentences.\n\n3. **Sentence Stems for Exit Ticket:**\n   - \"The water disappeared because ____________.\"\n   - \"The soil cracked because it lost ____________.\"\n   - \"A farmer could help plants by ____________.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Data Analysis Extension:**\n   - Have students graph the number of cracks or width of cracks over time (line graph or bar graph).\n   - Ask: \"On which day did the most cracks appear? Why?\"\n   - Challenge: \"Predict when the soil will be completely dry.\"\n\n2. **Comparative Investigation:**\n   - Provide two soil cups: one with sand, one with clay-rich soil.\n   - Question: \"Which type of soil cracks faster? Why do you think that is?\"\n   - Record and compare data for both soils.\n\n3. **Water Cycle Diagram:**\n   - Have student create a detailed diagram showing where water goes during a drought (evaporation, plant use, deeper underground).\n   - Label with arrows and vocabulary terms (evaporation, precipitation, etc.).\n\n4. **Research Connection:**\n   - Ask student to find one real example of a drought in the world or in your state's history.\n   - Have them report: Where was it? How long did it last? What did people do about it?\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Plant a Drought-Resistant Garden (Indoor or Outdoor):**\n   - If your school has outdoor space, work with students to plan a small garden with drought-resistant plants (succulents, sage, ornamental grasses).\n   - If indoors, plant small succulents in individual pots.\n   - Throughout the growing season, water them less than typical plants and observe their resilience.\n   - Graph and compare survival rates vs. a regular plant under the same neglect conditions.\n   - **Connection:** This extends 3-ESS3-1 by designing a solution (drought-resistant plant choice) to reduce drought impacts.\n\n2. **Water-Saving Audit at Home:**\n   - Send home a simple checklist: \"How does your family use water? Do you waste water? Where?\"\n   - Ask families to find one way to save water during a drought and report back.\n   - Create a class list of \"Water-Saving Tips\" and display in the classroom.\n   - **Connection:** Links science learning to community and home action; reinforces 3-ESS3-1.\n\n3. **Weather Data Collection for Your Region:**\n   - Over 2-4 weeks, have students track daily weather and rainfall for your area (using a simple daily weather chart or school weather station).\n   - Create a class graph showing rainy days vs. dry days.\n   - Discuss: \"Are we having a drought in our region? How do you know?\"\n   - Compare your region's rainfall to a region currently experiencing drought.\n   - **Connection:** Directly addresses 3-ESS2-2 (compare climates) and 3-ESS2-1 (represent weather data).\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Success\n\n- **Timing:** The Explore phase spans 3-5 days (requires advance planning). You can teach Engage and Explore on Day 1, then revisit soil cups daily for quick 5-10 minute observation sessions before continuing with Explain/Elaborate on Day 3-4 and Evaluate on Day 5.\n- **Setup:** Have soil cups prepared and water bottles ready before the lesson begins.\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wash hands after handling soil.\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Use new terms (drought, evaporation, soil) throughout the day and in other contexts to reinforce learning.\n- **Photograph Revisit:** Return to the original photograph repeatedly—at the start of each session and during explanations. Familiarity deepens understanding.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson is fully aligned to NGSS 3-ESS standards and designed for student-centered discovery. Happy teaching!**",
