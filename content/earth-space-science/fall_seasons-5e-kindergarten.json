ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about fall leaves and activate prior knowledge about seasonal change.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed large photograph of fall leaves on yard (displayed on screen, poster, or printout)\n- Optional: Real fall leaves collected from outside (2-3 leaves in different colors)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Say: \"Look at this picture! What do you notice on the ground? What colors do you see?\"\n\n2. **Ask these 4 discovery questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What colors are these leaves? Can you name some?\"\n   - \"Why do you think there are so many leaves on the ground instead of on the trees?\"\n   - \"Have you seen leaves like this before? When?\"\n   - \"What do you think happens to leaves when they sit on the ground for a long time?\"\n\n3. **Show real leaves (if available)** and pass them around carefully. Have students feel the texture and notice the colors.\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder what will happen to these leaves if they stay on the ground when it rains and gets cold. What do you think?\"\n\n5. **Capture wonder:** Write one student idea on chart paper (e.g., \"Leaves will turn brown\") to reference later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore fall leaves just like the ones in this picture. We're going to look at them, collect them, and discover what happens!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the properties of fall leaves and discover seasonal patterns through hands-on observation and collection.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1-2 bags per small group (6-8 students per group) to collect leaves\n- Paper or clipboard for each student\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but recommended)\n- Tray or shallow container per group to sort leaves\n- Real fall leaves in multiple stages of decay (if available—1-2 per group showing progression from fresh to crumbling)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Outdoor Collection (15 minutes):**\n\n1. **Assign groups** and give each group a collection bag.\n\n2. **Directions for students:**\n   - \"Walk slowly around the yard or outdoor area. Look for leaves on the ground in different colors.\"\n   - \"Pick up leaves carefully—they might be delicate!\"\n   - \"Try to find at least one red leaf, one yellow leaf, and one brown leaf for your group.\"\n   - \"Put them gently in your bag.\"\n   - \"Come back to the classroom when the teacher calls you.\"\n\n3. **Teacher role:** Walk with each group; ask questions like, \"What color is that leaf? Where did it come from?\" Encourage careful observation without heavy guidance.\n\n4. **Classroom sorting (10 minutes):**\n   - Return indoors. Each group places their leaves on a tray.\n   - Students sort leaves by **color** into separate piles on their tray.\n   - Give each student a sheet of paper and colored pencils.\n   - **Students draw or trace** one leaf from their collection, coloring it to match.\n   - Students may also **describe** their leaf by pointing (teacher scribes: \"This leaf is red and smooth\" or \"This leaf is crumbly and brown\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will have collected 3-5 leaves in various fall colors.\n- Students will have created a simple drawing/tracing showing leaf colors.\n- Students will have informally compared leaves by color, size, and texture.\n- Students will notice that some leaves are firm and others are breaking apart.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the science of seasonal change using student observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- The photograph from Engage phase\n- Student leaves from Explore phase\n- Optional: Simple diagram showing a tree in summer and fall\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Gather students in a circle with their collected leaves visible.\n   - Ask: \"What did you notice about the leaves? What colors did you find?\"\n   - Ask: \"Did all the leaves feel the same? Did you find any that were falling apart?\"\n   - Record responses on chart paper with simple drawings.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   - Use the photograph and real leaves to teach these terms:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Autumn (or Fall):** The season when the weather gets cooler and leaves change color and fall from trees.\n   - **Leaves:** The green parts of a plant that make food. In fall, they change colors.\n   - **Season:** A time of year with its own weather and plant changes (spring, summer, fall, winter).\n   - **Weather:** What it's like outside—hot, cold, rainy, sunny, or windy.\n   - **Decompose:** When something breaks down into smaller pieces and returns to the soil (use simple language: \"When leaves break apart and turn into soil\").\n\n3. **Make connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"Look at all these colorful leaves. This happens in autumn when it gets colder.\"\n   - Show one of the crumbly leaves: \"When leaves sit on the ground, they slowly break apart. This is decomposing. Eventually, they become part of the soil again.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think leaves change color? Is it because of the weather?\" (Guide students to understand: cooler temperatures trigger color change.)\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"What season are we in when we see leaves falling and changing color?\" (Autumn/Fall)\n   - Ask: \"What happens to leaves when they stay on the ground? Do they stay the same?\" (They break down/decompose)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the term **\"autumn\"** or **\"fall\"** to describe the season.\n- Students will understand that **leaves change color** when weather gets colder.\n- Students will recognize that **leaves break apart** over time.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply seasonal concepts to predict patterns and connect to their local environment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper (12\" x 18\") or poster board (one per group)\n- Glue sticks\n- Student leaves from Explore (cleaned and dried)\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- Optional: Leaf rubbing crayons and thin paper for texture rubbings\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Seasonal Pattern Poster (Collaborative Group Activity):**\n\n1. **Assign each group one of these scenarios:**\n   - **Group 1:** \"Our yard in summer\" (draw trees with green leaves)\n   - **Group 2:** \"Our yard in autumn\" (draw trees losing colorful leaves)\n   - **Group 3:** \"Our yard after all leaves have fallen\" (draw bare trees)\n   - **Group 4:** \"Ground in spring after winter\" (draw new green growth and soil)\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Work together to draw your season on your paper.\"\n   - \"Glue real leaves onto your poster to show what your season looks like.\"\n   - \"Use markers to draw trees, the ground, and the sun or clouds.\"\n   - \"Tell the class what happens to the leaves in your season.\"\n\n3. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask guiding questions:\n   - \"Why do you think leaves are on the ground in autumn?\"\n   - \"What do you think the weather is like in your season—hot or cold?\"\n   - \"Where will these leaves go next?\"\n\n4. **Gallery walk (5 minutes):**\n   - Display all four posters in sequence on the wall.\n   - Have students walk and view the progression of seasons.\n   - Ask: \"What do you notice? Does the yard change as we move from summer to spring?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create a visual representation of seasonal change.\n- Students will understand the **cyclical nature** of seasons (fall leaves become soil, which supports new spring growth).\n- Students will be able to explain their poster: \"In autumn, leaves fall and change colors\" and \"In spring, new leaves grow.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of seasonal patterns and leaf decomposition.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore: Did students collect leaves? Could they identify colors?\n- **Listen during discussions:** Can students say \"autumn\" and \"leaves change color\"?\n- **Review drawings:** Do student drawings show leaves falling or changing color?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of Day 2):**\n\n**Choose one format:**\n\n**Option A (Verbal—best for Kindergarten):**\nGather students. Ask individually or in small groups:\n1. \"What season do we see in our picture with all the colorful leaves?\" \n   - *Success: Student says \"fall\" or \"autumn\"*\n\n2. \"Why do the leaves change color and fall from trees?\"\n   - *Success: Student says something like \"It gets cold\" or \"The weather changes\"*\n\n3. \"What do you think happens to the leaves after they sit on the ground for a long time?\"\n   - *Success: Student says \"They break\" or \"They go into the soil\" or \"They disappear\"*\n\n**Option B (Visual/Kinesthetic):**\n- Show three pictures: (1) tree with green leaves, (2) ground with colorful fallen leaves, (3) tree with no leaves\n- Ask: \"Which picture shows autumn? Point to it.\"\n- Ask: \"What happens to the leaves? Show me with your hands\" (students can crumble motion or point to ground)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies fall/autumn as the season for falling leaves\n- ✓ Student connects seasonal change (cold weather) to leaf color change\n- ✓ Student recognizes that leaves break down and don't stay the same forever\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- **Mastery:** Student correctly identifies autumn, explains temperature/weather link to leaf change, and predicts decomposition.\n- **Developing:** Student identifies leaves are falling and know it's a season, but may not fully explain cause.\n- **Emerging:** Student can name fall colors but needs support understanding seasonal patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Scaffolding for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce verbalization demand:** Pair non-verbal or speech-delayed students with a buddy during collection and sorting. Use gesture and pointing to guide learning.\n\n2. **Pre-teach vocabulary:** Show vocabulary cards with pictures (tree with leaves + sun for \"summer\"; tree with colorful leaves falling + cloud for \"autumn\") the day before. Review these during Explain.\n\n3. **Simplify sorting:** Instead of sorting by color gradations, use just **two categories: \"Leaves still green\"** and **\"Leaves changed color.\"** This binary sort is developmentally easier.\n\n4. **Concrete decomposition model:** Show a real example: Place a fresh leaf in a cup of water. Show a crumbly leaf next to it. Say simply: \"Fresh leaf. Broken leaf. This happens when leaves get wet and cold.\"\n\n### Challenge (Extensions for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Leaf life cycle documentation:** Have students create a 4-picture sequence showing a leaf from tree → ground → decomposing → soil, using drawings or leaf rubbings. Ask them to dictate or write captions: \"First the leaf was green. Now it's red. Soon it will break apart.\"\n\n2. **Weather pattern journal:** Over 2 weeks, have students draw the temperature (sun = hot, cloud = cold) and what they see in the yard (leaves still on tree? leaves on ground?). Look for patterns: \"When is it colder, are there more leaves on the tree or on the ground?\"\n\n3. **Decomposition experiment:** Start a small \"leaf compost\" jar with leaves, soil, and a little water. Observe weekly and photograph. Predict: \"When will these leaves disappear?\" This introduces the idea of timescales and natural cycles.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fall nature walk and seasonal scavenger hunt:**\n   Students take a walk outside and search for: one colorful leaf, one brown leaf, one leaf on the ground, one leaf still on a tree. Discuss why some leaves are still on trees and others aren't. Connects to **K-ESS2-1** (observing local patterns over time).\n\n2. **Leaf rubbing art and texture exploration:**\n   Place leaves under thin paper and rub with crayons to reveal leaf vein patterns. Discuss: \"Why do leaves have these lines?\" (They help the leaf get water and nutrients.) This introduces plant adaptations in an age-appropriate way.\n\n3. **Read-aloud connection — \"Leaf Man\" by Lois Ehlert or \"We Are Grateful: Otsaliheliga\" (Cherokee gratitude story about seasons):**\n   After reading, have students create art from fallen leaves (collage). Discuss: \"How does nature use fall leaves? What happens to them?\" Connects to **K-ESS3-1** (how plants and animals use their environment).\n\n4. **Home connection — Family leaf collection:**\n   Send home a note asking families to collect leaves with their child during the week and bring them to school. Create a classroom \"leaf rainbow\" display showing color progression from green to red to brown. Each family shares: \"Where did we find our leaf? What color is it?\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Preparation Notes\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson works best in actual fall (September–November in Northern Hemisphere). If teaching during another season, collect and preserve fall leaves in summer, or use the photograph as your primary reference.\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wash hands after handling outdoor materials. Check for pests or mold on collected leaves.\n- **Accessibility:** Have students with limited mobility participate in the collection by staying in a designated area where you bring leaves to them, or partner with a peer helper.\n- **Prior knowledge:** This lesson assumes students have basic color recognition and can follow 2-3 step directions. Adjust language and pacing as needed for your classroom.\n\n---\n\n**End of 5E Lesson Plan**",
