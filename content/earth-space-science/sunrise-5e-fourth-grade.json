ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about sunrise patterns and establish prior knowledge about solar energy as a natural resource.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed image of the sunrise photograph (large enough for all students to see clearly)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: video clip of a 30-second sunrise time-lapse (1-2 minutes maximum)\n\n**Activity:**\n\nDisplay the sunrise photograph prominently. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation before asking questions.\n\n**Discussion Questions:**\n1. \"What do you notice about the colors in the sky? Why do you think the sky looks different at the horizon than it does higher up?\"\n2. \"If you've seen a real sunrise, describe what it felt like or what you noticed. What made it special?\"\n3. \"Where is the sun in this picture, and how did it get there?\"\n4. \"What do you think happens to Earth's temperature as the sun rises higher in the sky?\"\n\nAfter discussing, ask: **\"Where does all that light and warmth come from? What is the sun, really?\"** Encourage predictions and write student ideas on chart paper.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate how the sun's energy gets to Earth and why that energy is so important to our planet. Let's explore what we can learn from sunrise patterns.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how sunlight intensity and color change during sunrise, and collect data about daily solar patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Thermometers (one per student pair or small group)\n- Containers of water (clear glasses, ~200 mL each)\n- Stopwatch or timer\n- Recording sheets (provided below)\n- Optional: colored filters (red, orange, blue, clear cellophane)\n- Outdoor access or sunny windowsill in classroom\n- Pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Sunrise Temperature Investigation**\n\n1. **Setup (5 minutes):** Place water containers in direct sunlight (or simulate with a lamp positioned at different angles). Have students place thermometers in each container.\n\n2. **Observation & Recording (10 minutes):** Students record the water temperature at the start, then every 3-5 minutes for 15-20 minutes. They sketch the sky colors they observe (or the color changes in the water containers as light filters through at different angles).\n\n3. **Data Documentation (5 minutes):** Students record their observations on a simple data sheet:\n   - \"How did the water temperature change?\"\n   - \"What colors did the water look like as light hit it?\"\n   - \"Did the light feel stronger or weaker as time passed?\"\n\n**Part B: Sunrise Color Exploration** (if time allows)\n\nIf using colored filters: Have students place different filters over the thermometer containers and observe which color (representing sunrise colors) warms the water fastest.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What's happening to the temperature?\" and \"How does that connect to what we saw in the sunrise photo?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answers; instead, ask them to describe their observations using specific details.\n- Encourage students to make predictions before each time interval.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students discover that sunlight intensity increases over time, causing temperature to rise.\n- Students observe color changes in light and water.\n- Students record data showing the relationship between increasing sunlight and increasing temperature.\n- Students begin connecting daily sunrise to energy delivery to Earth.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts about solar energy as a natural resource and explain sunrise patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Printed or projected diagrams showing Earth's rotation and sun's position (simple: sun on one side, Earth rotating)\n- Student notebooks or paper for note-taking\n- The original sunrise photograph (displayed again)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\nInvite 2-3 student groups to share their thermometer findings and what they observed about color changes. Ask: \"What does your data tell us about how sunlight energy reaches Earth?\"\n\n**Vocabulary Introduction & Direct Instruction (10 minutes):**\n\nDisplay and define these terms on chart paper:\n\n1. **Solar energy** — Energy that comes from the sun and travels to Earth as light and heat. *\"Every warm day and every plant that grows gets energy from the sun.\"*\n\n2. **Natural resource** — Something from nature that people use and need to live. *\"Water, air, soil, and sunlight are all natural resources.\"*\n\n3. **Renewable energy** — Energy from sources that can be used over and over again without running out. *\"The sun will keep shining every day for billions of years, so it's renewable.\"*\n\n4. **Sunrise** — The moment when the sun appears above the horizon and light reaches your location on Earth. *\"Sunrise happens because Earth is spinning, and your part of Earth is turning toward the sun.\"*\n\n5. **Atmosphere** — The layer of air around Earth. *\"Sunlight travels through the atmosphere to reach us, and sometimes the atmosphere changes how the light looks (like the orange colors in our photo).\"*\n\n**Connections to Photograph & Exploration:**\n\nPoint to the sunrise photograph and say: \"In this photo, we see an orange and pink sky. That's because the sun is low on the horizon, and its light is traveling through more atmosphere. The atmosphere scatters (bends and spreads) the blue light but lets the orange and red light through. That's why sunrise looks like a painting!\"\n\nThen connect to data: \"When we measured temperature rise in our containers, we were measuring how the sun's energy warms Earth. As the sun rises higher in the photo, more direct energy hits Earth, and things get warmer.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n\nAsk individual students:\n- \"What is solar energy?\"\n- \"Why is the sun a natural resource?\"\n- \"Why do you think the sky changes color at sunrise?\"\n\nListen for use of vocabulary and understanding of the energy concept.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Solar energy** | Energy that comes from the sun as light and heat |\n| **Natural resource** | Something from nature that people need and use (like water, air, soil, or sunlight) |\n| **Renewable energy** | Energy from a source that doesn't run out and can be used again and again |\n| **Sunrise** | When the sun appears above the horizon and the sky becomes light because Earth has rotated toward the sun |\n| **Atmosphere** | The layer of air surrounding Earth that lets sunlight through but can change how it looks |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that solar energy is a natural renewable resource from the sun.\n- Students can explain why the sky looks different colors during sunrise.\n- Students connect their temperature data to the concept of solar energy reaching Earth.\n- Students use vocabulary appropriately in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply knowledge of solar energy as a resource by exploring real-world uses and connecting to their own lives.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos showing solar energy uses (solar panels, solar ovens, greenhouses, clothes drying, plants growing, solar-powered lights, etc.)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: printable worksheet showing solar uses around the home/school\n- Index cards for sorting activity\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Solar Energy Uses Around Us (10 minutes)**\n\nDisplay or distribute pictures of solar energy uses. In small groups, students sort and categorize the pictures:\n- **Direct uses:** Where we use sunlight directly (drying clothes, plants growing, solar ovens cooking food)\n- **Stored uses:** Where the sun's energy was stored long ago (fossil fuels like oil and coal—teachers note: this is a bridge to understanding how ancient sunlight became fuel)\n- **Technology uses:** Where we catch sunlight and change it into other forms (solar panels making electricity, solar-powered lights)\n\nHave each group pick one picture and discuss: \"How does the sun's energy help with this activity? What would happen if we didn't have the sun?\"\n\n**Part B: Drawing Solar Energy in My Day (5 minutes)**\n\nStudents draw or write about **one way they use solar energy in their own life today**. Examples:\n- The sun warmed my breakfast toast (energy from plants the sun grew)\n- I walked to school in sunlight (the sun gave me light to see)\n- I played outside and felt warmth from the sun\n- Plants in our classroom need sunlight to live\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate group discussions by asking: \"How is the sun important to this activity?\"\n- Guide students to see that solar energy appears in many ways, not just as direct sunlight.\n- Validate all observations, even indirect connections.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students recognize multiple ways solar energy is used in nature and by humans.\n- Students make personal connections to solar energy in their daily lives.\n- Students begin to understand that solar energy is essential and valuable.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of solar energy as a natural resource and its role in Earth's systems.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student participation during discussions and group work.\n- Review thermometer data sheets for accurate recording and observations.\n- Listen for correct use of vocabulary (solar energy, natural resource, renewable) in conversations.\n- Check group sorting activity for reasoning about how solar energy is used.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) — Choose one format:**\n\n**Option 1: Written Response (5 minutes)**\nStudents answer on an index card or half-sheet:\n1. \"What is solar energy? Give an example.\"\n2. \"Why is the sun a natural resource?\"\n3. \"Look at this sunrise photo again. Explain why the sky has different colors.\" (Redisplay photograph)\n\n**Option 2: Quick Draw & Label (5 minutes)**\nStudents draw and label:\n- The sun\n- Earth\n- A sunrise\n- One way solar energy helps people or nature\n- Label the colors they see in a sunrise\n\n**Option 3: Three-Sentence Summary (5 minutes)**\n\"The sun provides ____________. Solar energy is important because ____________. In the future, I could use solar energy by ____________.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Define solar energy accurately and identify it as a natural resource\n- ✓ Explain that solar energy is renewable and comes from the sun\n- ✓ Describe how solar energy affects Earth's temperature or supports life\n- ✓ Use appropriate vocabulary (solar energy, natural resource, renewable, sunrise, atmosphere)\n- ✓ Make at least one real-world connection to solar energy\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents who meet criteria understand that:\n- Solar energy is a renewable natural resource that comes from the sun\n- Solar energy reaches Earth as light and heat, following predictable daily patterns\n- Solar energy is essential for warming Earth and supporting life\n- Humans can use solar energy directly or indirectly in many ways\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary list:** Provide a picture-word chart with just three terms (sun, solar energy, natural resource) with clear images. Students can reference this during activities and assessments.\n\n2. **Guided data recording:** Provide pre-made thermometer recording sheets with numbers already filled in; students only need to circle or highlight the temperature they observe rather than write it. This reduces fine motor and reading demands.\n\n3. **Sentence frames for sharing:** Provide frames like \"The sun gives us _____\" or \"Solar energy helps _____ because _____.\" Students fill in the blank rather than generating complete sentences.\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Offer multiple-choice or match options instead of open-ended writing. Example: \"Solar energy comes from: (A) the moon (B) the sun (C) stars\" with pictures.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper exploration of atmospheric effects:** Have advanced students research why different colors scatter differently in the atmosphere (blue scatters more easily than red). They can create a mini-poster or explanation showing wavelengths.\n\n2. **Energy calculation:** Ask students to predict how temperature would change if they left the container in sunlight for 30 minutes instead of 15. Have them design an extended experiment to test the prediction.\n\n3. **Renewable vs. non-renewable comparison:** Have students research and compare solar energy to one fossil fuel (coal, oil, natural gas). Create a Venn diagram showing similarities and differences, emphasizing why solar is renewable and others are not.\n\n4. **Real-world solar applications project:** Students choose a location (their home, school, a desert, a farm) and design where they would place solar panels or a solar oven, explaining their reasoning based on sunrise patterns and sun position.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Sunrise Time-Tracking Over the School Year:** Students record sunrise time each month (from a calendar, newspaper, or website). Graph the data to observe that sunrise time changes with seasons. Discuss how Earth's tilt affects when the sun rises in different seasons. This extends to 5-ESS1-2 (patterns of daily changes in shadows and seasonal appearance).\n\n2. **Shadow Investigation Project:** Using the sunrise photo as inspiration, students measure shadows at sunrise, midday, and sunset. Record measurements and create a diagram showing how shadow length changes as the sun moves across the sky. This demonstrates how solar position changes throughout the day and relates to Earth's rotation.\n\n3. **Design a Solar Cooker or Solar Oven:** Students design a simple solar cooker using a shoebox, aluminum foil, plastic wrap, and dark paper. They predict what temperature it could reach based on their thermometer exploration, then test it. This applies solar energy knowledge to problem-solving and connects to 4-ESS3-2 (generate solutions to reduce impacts of natural processes).\n\n4. **Interview or Letter to a Solar Engineer:** Students write interview questions for or a letter to someone who works with solar energy (solar panel installer, renewable energy engineer). They can research answers online or invite a guest speaker. This builds real-world career connections to Earth systems.\n\n5. **Comparative Sunrise Study:** If possible, students from different geographic locations (different latitudes or climates) share sunrise photos and times. Compare how sunrise looks and when it occurs in different places. Discuss why latitude and location affect the sun's path.\n\n---",
