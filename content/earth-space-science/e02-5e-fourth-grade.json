Identify evidence of water erosion and weathering on hillsides by observing landscape features in photographs and real-world environments.\n2. Explain how water movement can change the shape of land over time using observations and simple investigations.\n3. Describe the role that vegetation plays in slowing down erosion and protecting hillsides.\n4. Apply their understanding of erosion to predict problems humans might face when building homes on steep slopes.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the hillside house photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- (Optional) Video snippet of a landslide or mudslide (30 seconds max)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or projector. Allow 1-2 minutes of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (pose one at a time, pausing for responses):\n   - \"What do you notice about the shape of the ground in this picture? Why do you think the land looks like this?\"\n   - \"If I poured a bottle of water at the very top of this hill, where would it go? What would happen to the soil as the water flows down?\"\n   - \"Why do you think someone built such a big house on a steep, slopy hill? What problems might they face during a big rainstorm?\"\n   - \"Look closely at the green areas — the trees and plants. How might they help keep the hill from sliding down?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen to a hillside that has no plants or trees covering it versus one that has a forest. Let's investigate and find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions, scientists! Now we're going to become erosion detectives and build our own model hillsides to see how water really shapes the land.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- One aluminum baking pan or large plastic tray (at least 9\" × 13\")\n- 3-4 cups of soil or sand\n- 1 cup of mulch, moss, or plant material (dried leaves, grass clippings)\n- Small rocks and pebbles\n- Water in a spray bottle (or pitcher)\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Notebook or data sheet (see below)\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide class into 4 groups.** Each group will build TWO model hillsides side-by-side in their baking pan:\n   - **Hillside A (No vegetation):** Soil and rocks only\n   - **Hillside B (With vegetation):** Soil, rocks, AND a layer of plant material (mulch/leaves)\n\n2. **Step-by-step student directions** (write these on a poster or handout):\n   - Fill your pan halfway with soil, then mound it slightly on one side to create a sloped hillside shape.\n   - On the left side of your pan, build Hillside A: just soil and small rocks. Leave it bare (no plants).\n   - On the right side, build Hillside B: soil and rocks PLUS a layer of mulch, dried leaves, or grass clippings on top (like a forest).\n   - Use your ruler to measure the HEIGHT of each hillside. Record this in your notebook.\n   - Make a small mark or line at the BASE of each hillside to show where erosion will begin.\n\n3. **The erosion investigation:**\n   - Using your spray bottle, slowly spray water onto the top of Hillside A (the bare one) for 30 seconds. Observe and describe what happens.\n   - Record: Does the soil wash down? Does it move far or stay close? How does the water travel?\n   - **WAIT 1 minute.** Now spray Hillside B (the vegetated one) for 30 seconds the same way.\n   - Record: How is this different? Does the plant material slow down the water? Does soil wash away as easily?\n   - **Prediction:** Which hillside will lose MORE soil? Why do you think so?\n\n4. **What students should record/document:**\n   - **Data sheet observations** (simple chart with drawings):\n     - How far did water travel on Hillside A?\n     - How far did water travel on Hillside B?\n     - Which hillside lost MORE soil?\n     - Draw BEFORE and AFTER pictures of each hillside.\n   - Measurement of how much soil moved (rough estimate: \"a little\" / \"a medium amount\" / \"a lot\")\n   - Written explanation: \"Plants help/don't help stop erosion because...\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between groups, asking guiding questions rather than giving answers:\n  - \"What do you observe happening to the soil right now?\"\n  - \"Why do you think the water is moving differently on the two hillsides?\"\n  - \"If this were a real hillside, where would all that washed-away soil end up?\"\n- Manage water cleanup; provide towels.\n- Ensure all groups collect data, even if results aren't dramatic.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that water erodes bare soil more visibly and quickly than vegetated soil.\n- Students recognize that plants slow water movement and hold soil in place.\n- Students produce visual data (drawings/measurements) showing differences between the two hillsides.\n- Students begin to infer why the house in the original photograph might be at risk on a steep, possibly eroding hillside.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary written out\n- Photograph of the hillside house (displayed again)\n- Picture cards or simple diagrams showing erosion processes (teacher-provided or drawn on whiteboard)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out** (5-7 minutes):\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to briefly describe their results: \"Show us your before-and-after drawings. What did you discover?\"\n   - Highlight commonalities: \"Everyone saw that the bare hillside lost MORE soil. Why?\"\n   - Acknowledge surprises: \"Did anyone's plants NOT slow the water? Let's think about why that might be.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with Fourth Grade-friendly definitions (write on chart paper and point to each during explanation):\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Erosion** | When water, wind, or ice moves soil and rocks from one place to another, changing the shape of the land. |\n   | **Weathering** | The breaking down of rocks and soil into smaller pieces by rain, ice, wind, or plant roots over a very long time. |\n   | **Vegetation** | Plants and trees that grow in an area; they help hold soil together with their roots. |\n   | **Slope/Topography** | The shape and angle of the land; steep slopes (like hills and mountains) let water flow down faster and cause more erosion. |\n   | **Sediment** | Tiny pieces of rock and soil that are carried away by water or wind. |\n\n3. **Connections back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the hillside in the original photo: \"This landscape has VALLEYS and GULLIES — channels carved by water erosion over many, many years. Water running downhill over centuries created these deep paths, just like what happened in your experiment today.\"\n   - Trace the valleys with your finger: \"See these dark areas? Vegetation helps protect against erosion. These areas are still covered with trees.\"\n   - Discuss the house: \"This house is built on a hillside where erosion HAS happened. If a big rainstorm comes, water will rush down this slope just like in our experiment. The family needs to be careful!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"What IS erosion? Show me with your hands how water moves soil downhill.\"\n   - Ask: \"How do plants stop erosion? Turn and tell a partner.\"\n   - Ask: \"If we planted MORE trees on our model hillsides, what would happen in our next experiment?\"\n\n**Vocabulary Display:**\nKeep the vocabulary chart visible for the rest of the lesson.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly define erosion and weathering.\n- Students explain that vegetation slows erosion by holding soil with its roots.\n- Students recognize the landscape features in the original photograph as evidence of erosion.\n- Students understand that steep slopes + water + lack of plants = faster erosion and more problems for humans.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large map of a hillside region (use Google Earth screenshot, topographic map, or teacher-drawn contour map showing slopes)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Index cards with scenarios (see below)\n- (Optional) Photos of different landscapes: desert hillside, forest hillside, residential slope, agricultural slope\n\n**Activity:**\n\nChoose one of these applications (based on your class):\n\n**Option A: \"Design a Safe Hillside\" (Recommended for most Fourth Grade classes)**\n\n1. Display a simple slope map showing a residential hillside (or use a printed Google Earth image of a neighborhood on a slope).\n\n2. Ask: \"City planners need to decide where to build new houses and where to plant trees. Based on what you learned about erosion, where should trees be planted to prevent problems?\"\n\n3. Give each student or pair an index card with a slope map showing:\n   - A proposed house location\n   - Areas marked for possible tree planting\n   - A rainy season marked on a calendar\n\n4. **Student task:**\n   - Color the areas where you think trees SHOULD be planted to protect the hillside.\n   - Draw arrows showing where water will flow downhill.\n   - Write 1-2 sentences explaining: \"Why did you plant trees there? How will they help prevent erosion?\"\n\n5. **Share solutions** on a classroom map, discussing why different placements work or don't work.\n\n**Option B: \"Predict Erosion Patterns\" (For visual learners)**\n\n1. Show topographic maps or 3D hill diagrams with contour lines showing steep and gentle slopes.\n\n2. Ask: \"Which hillsides will erode faster — the steep ones or the gentle slopes? How do you know?\"\n\n3. Mark areas with \"FAST EROSION\" or \"SLOW EROSION\" based on slope angle.\n\n4. Discuss: \"If water comes off a VERY steep slope like in our photograph, what happens to the soil at the BOTTOM of the hill?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate thinking by asking:\n  - \"Why would planting trees on the UPPER part of the hill help the houses at the BOTTOM?\"\n  - \"What would happen if all the trees were cut down?\"\n  - \"Is building a house on a steep slope a good idea? Why or why not?\"\n- Validate creative thinking while grounding responses in what they observed in the Explore phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply erosion concepts to a new scenario (urban planning).\n- Students demonstrate understanding that vegetation placement matters and can reduce erosion.\n- Students recognize real-world consequences of erosion for human communities.\n- Students can explain trade-offs: \"We want to build houses for people, but we also need to protect the land from erosion.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student predictions during Explore phase: Do they anticipate that vegetation will slow erosion?\n- Listen to explanations during Explore: Can students describe what's happening in their own words?\n- Monitor Elaborate activity: Can students apply erosion concepts to a new context?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment) — Administer at the end of Session 2:**\n\nProvide each student with a small card or sticky note with these questions (read aloud for support):\n\n**Question 1 (Multiple Choice):**\n\"What causes erosion on a hillside? Choose one:\n- A) Plants growing on the hill\n- B) Rain and water flowing downhill\n- C) Houses being built\n- D) Snow falling in winter\"\n*(Correct answer: B)*\n\n**Question 2 (Short Answer — 1-2 sentences):**\n\"Look at this picture of a bare, steep hillside with no trees. During a heavy rainstorm, what will happen to the soil on this hillside? Why?\"\n*(Expected answer: Water will wash the soil down the hillside / Erosion will happen because there are no plant roots to hold the soil together.)*\n\n**Question 3 (Application):**\n\"Imagine you are a city planner. A developer wants to build a neighborhood on a steep hillside. What is ONE thing you would tell them to do to prevent erosion problems?\"\n*(Expected answers: Plant trees, keep vegetation, plant on gentler slopes, build terraces, etc.)*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies water as a cause of erosion (Q1)\n- ✓ Student explains that vegetation or roots help prevent erosion (Q2 and Q3)\n- ✓ Student applies learning to a real-world scenario (Q3)\n- ✓ Student uses vocabulary (erosion, vegetation, slope, weathering) appropriately\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- **LO1 (Identify evidence of erosion):** Student correctly answers Q1 and Q2; can point to erosion evidence in the original photograph during discussion.\n- **LO2 (Explain water's role in erosion):** Student clearly states that water movement changes the land in Q2; Explore data sheet shows clear observations.\n- **LO3 (Describe vegetation's role):** Student explains vegetation's protective role in Q2 and Q3; demonstrated this in their model hillside.\n- **LO4 (Predict human impacts):** Student thoughtfully answers Q3 with a realistic solution; Elaborate activity shows application of concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards** with images: Provide picture-word cards for erosion, vegetation, slope, and sediment. Students can reference these during discussions and writing tasks.\n\n2. **Pre-recorded script for Exit Ticket:** Read all questions aloud slowly, and allow students to draw pictures or dictate answers instead of writing.\n\n3. **Guided observation sheet for Explore phase:** Provide a partially filled data chart where students only need to check boxes or circle answers instead of writing full sentences:\n   - \"Did soil move on Hillside A? YES / NO\"\n   - \"Did soil move on Hillside B? YES / NO\"\n   - \"Which one had MORE erosion? A / B\"\n\n4. **Partner assignment:** Pair struggling learners with strong communicators during group investigations so they can contribute to observations while hearing peer explanations.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **\"Erosion Over Time\" investigation:** Ask advanced students to predict what WOULD happen if they repeated the water spray experiment 5 MORE times on each hillside. Have them sketch the expected changes and explain why erosion would increase (or stop) with additional water.\n\n2. **Real-world research:** Assign advanced students to research a famous landslide or erosion event (e.g., California mudslides, Mount St. Helens erosion) and present 2-3 key facts about how erosion affected that landscape and nearby communities.\n\n3. **Design a solution:** Challenge students to invent and sketch a device or structure (inspired by real-world options like terracing, retaining walls, or drainage systems) that would protect a steep hillside from erosion. Have them label and explain how it works.\n\n4. **Analyze topographic maps independently:** Provide a topographic map with contour lines and ask students to:\n   - Identify the steepest slopes (lines closest together)\n   - Predict where erosion is fastest\n   - Explain why contour lines help scientists understand erosion risk\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Build a Terraced Hillside\"** (hands-on, 30-45 minutes):\n   - Students recreate their model hillside but add \"terraces\" — flat, step-like platforms cut into the slope (use clay dividers or cardboard strips).\n   - They test erosion again and discover how terracing, used in real agriculture, slows water runoff and erosion.\n   - Connection: This is used worldwide to protect farmland on hillsides.\n   - **Homework option:** Have students find a photo of terraced hillsides (rice paddies in Asia, vineyards in California) and bring it in to discuss.\n\n2. **\"Erosion Around Our School\"** (observation walk, 30 minutes):\n   - Take students on a brief nature walk around school or nearby park.\n   - Ask them to spot evidence of erosion: worn paths, gullies in dirt, bare spots, roots showing, etc.\n   - Have them photograph or sketch these features and compare to the photograph from the lesson.\n   - **Discussion:** Why is this erosion happening? What could reduce it?\n   - **Writing prompt for homework:** \"I found erosion near my school. Here's what I saw... This could be fixed by...\"\n\n3. **\"Rain Gauge & Erosion Data Collection\"** (long-term, ongoing):\n   - Set up a simple rain gauge and erosion observation site on school grounds (or use a designated outdoor model hillside).\n   - After rainstorms, measure rainfall and observe erosion changes.\n   - Create a class chart showing: \"More rain = More erosion?\" and collect data over 4-6 weeks.\n   - **Real-world connection:** Scientists use this method to predict mudslide risk in hilly regions.\n   - **Presentation:** Students present findings to the class and write a conclusion about the relationship between rainfall and erosion.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Timing flexibility:** If you have only one 45-minute block, combine Explore and Explain into one session (shorten each activity slightly) and move Elaborate to a second day.\n- **Cleanup:** This lesson uses water and soil. Have paper towels, a mop, and a designated cleanup crew (rotating pair) ready. Consider doing this lesson near a sink or outdoors if possible.\n- **Safety:** Ensure wet pans are stable; supervise water use. Remind students not to splash water on others.\n- **Engagement tip:** The original photograph works best if projected large. Take 1-2 minutes for students to really *look* at it before asking questions — this silent observation often generates the best wondering.\n- **Connection to 4-ESS2-2:** The discussion of topographic patterns and the map-reading activities in Elaborate explicitly address analyzing Earth's features via maps, as required by this standard.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson positions Fourth Graders as environmental scientists investigating a real-world problem visible in the photograph, while building toward deeper understanding of Earth systems and human-environment interactions.",
