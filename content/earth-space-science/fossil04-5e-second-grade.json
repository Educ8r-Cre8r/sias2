Identify what a fossil is and explain that fossils are the remains or imprints of plants and animals that lived long ago.\n2. Describe how fossils provide evidence that Earth changes over time, sometimes slowly.\n3. Observe and compare different rock and sediment samples to understand that rocks are made of smaller pieces and particles.\n4. Create a model fossil to demonstrate how organisms can be preserved in sediment and rock.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about fossils and activate prior knowledge about rocks and natural objects.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of fossil (projected on board/screen or printed copies)\n- Real fossil (if available) or fossil replica for students to observe up close\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording student ideas\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Observe:** Project or hold up the fossil photograph. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Spark Wonder:** Ask students to turn to a partner and share: \"What do you see in this picture? What is this thing?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate Discussion** using these specific questions:\n   - \"What do you notice about this shape? Does it look like anything you've ever seen before?\"\n   - \"Do you think this came from something that was alive? Why do you think that?\"\n   - \"How do you think a shape like this got stuck in the rock?\"\n   - \"Where do you think we might find this?\"\n\n4. **Make a Prediction:** Ask students to draw and write (or verbally share) their answer to: \"How do you think a shell or animal became part of the rock?\" Record student predictions on chart paper—affirm curiosity without correcting misconceptions yet.\n\n5. **Real Artifact Moment:** If available, pass around a fossil replica or real fossil for 10-15 seconds so students can feel the texture and see fine details. This makes the learning personal and tangible.\n\n**Transition:** \"You've made some great guesses! Let's do an activity to see how something might get trapped in rock—we'll make our own fossil.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how organisms can be preserved in sediment through hands-on fossil creation.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Shallow cup, small container, or paper bowl\n- Air-dry clay or molding compound (enough to fill cup ½ inch deep)\n- Small natural objects: seashells, leaves, twigs, imprints of small bones or plastic replicas\n- Water in small cup (for moistening clay if needed)\n- Craft stick or pencil for pressing\n- Newspaper or plastic sheet to protect surfaces\n- Hand wipes or paper towels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and demonstrate each step):**\n\n1. \"Place your clay in the bottom of your cup. Smooth it flat with your finger.\"\n2. \"Choose one natural object—a shell, leaf, or stick.\"\n3. \"Press your object gently into the clay. Count to 10 slowly while you press.\"\n4. \"Carefully lift your object straight up. Look at the shape left behind—that's your fossil imprint!\"\n5. \"Observe the detail: Can you see bumps, lines, or ridges from the shell or leaf?\"\n6. \"Use your craft stick to label your fossil with your name (press gently into clay).\"\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** Say: \"In real nature, this is what happened to the shell in our photograph. It pressed into soft sediment (tiny bits of sand and rock). Over a very, very long time, the sediment turned hard and became rock. The shell's shape stayed behind as a fossil.\"\n\n**Recording/Documentation:**\n- Students draw their fossil in a science notebook or on a worksheet, labeling the object used and the imprint it left.\n- Optional: Take a photograph of each student's clay fossil for a class display.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the details you can see? Is the imprint smooth or rough? Which parts are deepest?\"\n- Resist explaining *why* this is like real fossilization—let students observe and wonder.\n- Support students who struggle with fine motor control by allowing them to use larger objects or pre-softened clay.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each student creates a clear imprint of their chosen object in clay.\n- Students observe and can articulate observations: \"The bumpy shell left bumpy marks,\" or \"I can see the leaf's lines.\"\n- Students begin to connect the activity to the photograph: \"This is like what happened to that shell.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and explain how fossils form, connecting to evidence that Earth changes slowly.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary written in large print\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student clay fossils from Explore phase\n- Optional: Diagram or simple illustration of fossil formation stages\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Observations (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 volunteers to show their fossil and describe what they see: \"What object did you use? What details can you see in the imprint?\"\n   - Affirm observations: \"You're noticing details just like scientists do!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Display and define these terms using student-friendly language:\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|\n   | **Fossil** | The shape or remains of a plant or animal that lived a very, very long time ago and got saved in rock. |\n   | **Sediment** | Tiny pieces of rock, sand, and shells that get packed down together. |\n   | **Imprint** | A shape or mark pressed into something soft, like mud or clay. When it hardens, the imprint stays. |\n   | **Preserved** | Kept safe and saved so that something doesn't disappear; fossils are animals and plants preserved in rock. |\n   | **Very Long Ago** | So much time that we can barely imagine it—thousands and thousands of years. |\n\n3. **Connect to Photograph (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the fossil in the photograph. \"This shell lived in the ocean a very, very long time ago. When the shell died, it fell into soft sediment—sand and mud on the ocean floor. More and more sediment piled on top of it. Over thousands of years, all that sediment got packed down and turned into hard rock. The shell stayed inside as a fossil. That fossil is evidence that the ocean was here long, long ago.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can anyone show me with your hands what an imprint is?\" (Students mime pressing and lifting.)\n   - Ask: \"Why do we call the shell in the rock a fossil?\" (Affirm: It's the remains of something that lived long ago and is saved in rock.)\n   - Ask: \"How long did it take to make a fossil like this?\" (Affirm: A very, very long time—much longer than we've been alive.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and name the key vocabulary in context.\n- Students understand that a fossil is evidence of something that lived long ago.\n- Students grasp that fossilization is a slow process, connecting to 2-ESS1-1 (Earth events can occur slowly).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply fossil knowledge to recognize that fossils tell us about Earth's changes and environments.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photographs or printed images of 5-6 different fossils (ammonites, trilobites, plant fossils, fish, etc.)—search \"fossil images for kids\"\n- Chart paper with two columns: \"What It Might Have Been\" and \"What It Tells Us\"\n- Student notebooks or paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Fossil Detective Gallery Walk (10-12 minutes):**\n   - Display 5-6 fossil images around the room (or on the board as a slideshow).\n   - Explain: \"These are all real fossils found by scientists. Each one tells us a story about what lived on Earth a long time ago.\"\n   - Guide students on a visual \"walk\" (seated or standing) through the images.\n   - For each fossil, ask: \"What do you think this was? What animal or plant might it be? What does it tell us about Earth back then?\"\n   - Jot student ideas on the chart: \"This was a spiral shell…so there was ocean here.\" / \"This was a fern…so plants lived here.\"\n\n2. **Group Discussion (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What do you notice? All these different fossils—what does that tell us?\" (Affirm: Earth had different plants and animals long ago. Earth has changed. It's been different in different places.)\n   - Say: \"Fossils are like a story book that rocks tell us. They show us that Earth is always, slowly changing.\"\n\n3. **Student Recording:**\n   - Students draw their favorite fossil from the gallery and write (or tell an adult to write): \"What do you think this fossil tells us about Earth long ago?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide observations without leading too much; let students construct ideas.\n- Validate all responses and encourage second-grade level thinking: \"That's a good guess because…\"\n- Emphasize the connection: slow change, evidence of past life, Earth's history.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different fossils represent different organisms.\n- Students begin to infer that fossils provide evidence of Earth's changes over time.\n- Students make simple connections: \"If there are ocean shells here, there was an ocean.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossil concepts and connections to slow Earth change.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during Engage and Explore):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** As students create clay fossils, note who is making clear imprints and who can verbally explain what they're doing.\n- **Questioning:** During Explain and Elaborate, listen to student responses to gauge vocabulary retention and conceptual understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nUse one of these formats based on your class's communication level:\n\n**Option A: Drawing with Label (Non-reader/Early Reader)**\n- Students draw: \"What is a fossil?\"\n- Students point to or circle the correct answer: Is a fossil from something that lived (long ago / today)?\n\n**Option B: Sentence Frames (Transitional Reader)**\nProvide a paper with these sentence stems:\n- \"A fossil is _________________________.\"\n- \"Fossils help us know that Earth _________________ long ago.\"\n- \"My clay imprint was like a real fossil because _________________.\"\n\n**Option C: Short Answer (Proficient Reader)**\nAsk:\n1. \"What is a fossil? Explain in 1-2 sentences.\"\n2. \"How does your clay fossil look like a real fossil?\"\n3. \"Why do you think scientists study fossils?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n✓ Student correctly identifies a fossil as remains/imprint of something that lived long ago.\n✓ Student makes a connection between their clay imprint and real fossilization.\n✓ Student articulates that fossils show Earth is old and has changed (in own words, age-appropriate).\n✓ Student shows curiosity or asks follow-up questions about fossils.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can define \"fossil\" in their own words.\n- 75%+ of students recognize the clay imprint as similar to how real fossils form.\n- 70%+ of students articulate that fossils are evidence of old life on Earth.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only 2-3 key terms (fossil, imprint, long ago) in early repetitions. Write and display them consistently with images.\n\n2. **Tactile-First Approach:** Let students feel actual fossils or replicas, or provide pre-made clay imprints for observation before creating their own. This builds confidence before the hands-on activity.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Discussion:** Provide oral response frames: \"I think this fossil was _____ because _____.\" This scaffolds thinking and language production.\n\n4. **Paired or Adult-Supported Fossil Making:** Allow a student to work with a peer or aide during Explore so there's immediate feedback and support for fine motor skills and understanding.\n\n5. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Use a picture-matching format: Show images of three items (a modern shell, a fossil, a rock). Ask: \"Which one is a fossil?\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Fossil Identification Task:** Provide images of 8-10 fossils and ask students to sort them by category (shells, plants, fish, etc.) and predict what environments they came from. Ask: \"Which fossils might have lived together?\"\n\n2. **Time Sequencing:** Introduce a very simple geologic time concept. Display fossils and ask: \"If we found this fossil deep in the rock and this fossil near the top, which one is older?\" Discuss why (deeper = older = more time passed).\n\n3. **Design a Fossil Hunt:** Ask students to design a fossil hunt for the classroom or outdoor area. Where would they look? What would they search for? Why? (Encourages application of knowledge.)\n\n4. **Comparative Fossil Study:** Provide 4-5 fossils of the same animal (e.g., different ammonite shells) and ask: \"What's the same? What's different? Why might there be different sizes?\" (Introduction to variation and adaptation.)\n\n5. **Research and Share:** Allow a student to choose a favorite fossil and research one interesting fact to share with the class. Provide a simple template with images (uses research skills and deepens engagement).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil Casting Activity (Follow-up Session):**\n   - Use the clay imprints from Explore as \"molds.\"\n   - Press a second piece of clay or use plaster of Paris poured into the mold to create a \"cast\"—a replica of the original fossil.\n   - Discuss how the cast is like a new fossil, similar to how scientists sometimes find both molds and casts of real fossils.\n   - **Connection:** This demonstrates the two types of fossils (molds and casts) in a tactile way.\n\n2. **Nature Collection and Fossil Prediction (Homework or Outdoor Activity):**\n   - Send students on a nature walk to collect small rocks, shells, leaves, and twigs.\n   - Ask: \"If these became fossils, what would they look like? What story would they tell about Earth?\"\n   - Students draw predictions of what their objects would look like as fossils.\n   - **Connection:** Deepens observation skills and reinforces the relationship between current organisms and fossil evidence.\n\n3. **Create a Class Fossil Timeline or Museum Display:**\n   - Combine all student clay fossils into a \"museum exhibit.\"\n   - Label each with the object, student name, and a simple sentence: \"This fossil shows that ______ lived long ago.\"\n   - Add the photograph of the original fossil and other fossil images to create a gallery.\n   - Invite another class for a \"tour\" led by your students.\n   - **Connection:** Builds communication, review, and pride in learning; extends vocabulary and understanding.\n\n4. **Rock and Sediment Investigation Station (Follow-up Hands-On):**\n   - Set up a sensory station with different sediments: sand, fine gravel, clay, soil, crushed shells.\n   - Students feel, observe, and compare textures.\n   - Ask: \"Which of these sediments do you think would best preserve an imprint? Why?\"\n   - Connect to the photograph: \"The rock in this fossil was once sediment like this.\"\n\n5. **Read-Aloud Connection:**\n   - Pair the lesson with grade-appropriate fossil picture books such as *Fossils Tell of Long Ago* by Aliki or *The Fossil Book* by Caroline Arnold.\n   - After reading, discuss: \"What did the book teach us that we discovered in our activity?\"\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Success\n\n- **Pacing:** This lesson works best over two days—Engage through Explore on Day 1, Explain through Evaluate on Day 2. This allows clay to dry and students to process concepts.\n- **Real Fossil Access:** If you can borrow a fossil from a local museum, nature center, or geology department, it dramatically increases engagement. Even a replica is powerful.\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Use fossil-related language consistently throughout the week (fossil, imprint, sediment, preserved, long ago) in casual classroom moments to reinforce learning.\n- **Connection to 2-ESS1-1:** This lesson directly addresses the standard by using fossils as evidence that Earth changes over very long periods (slowly). You can explicitly state: \"Fossils teach us that Earth changes slowly—so slowly it takes thousands of years.\"\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
