The warning sign serves as evidence that humans observe and predict patterns in their environment.*\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Make observations about changes in Earth's landscape and explain why warning signs are needed.\n2. Use the photograph to describe patterns they observe (water, land, sky, and human structures).\n3. Predict what might happen to the land near the water based on observations and patterns.\n4. Explain why people create warning signs to help others stay safe from Earth's natural features.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of a coastal warning sign.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (or projected image) of the \"CAUTION DROP OFF\" sign at the beach\n- Chart paper and marker\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Hook:** Show students the photograph without any explanation. Ask them to look carefully for 30 seconds and notice everything they see.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me everything!\"\n   - \"What is that red and white sign trying to tell people? Why do you think someone put a sign there?\"\n   - \"Look at the water. What's happening? Does it look calm or wild?\"\n   - \"Why would a person need to be careful at this place?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder why the land ends so suddenly and the water is so close. What do YOU wonder about?\"\n\n4. **Record Observations:** Write 2-3 student observations on chart paper to reference later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to be Earth scientists and explore what happens to land when water is nearby. Let's discover why that sign is so important!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how water can change land through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large aluminum pans or shallow containers (one per pair of students)\n- Kinetic sand or damp sand (enough to fill pans halfway)\n- Water in spray bottles or containers for pouring\n- Small toy figures or blocks to represent buildings/people\n- Rulers or craft sticks\n- Paper towels\n- Small cups\n- Observation worksheets (picture-based, with lines for simple sentences)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup:** Explain: \"We're going to make a beach with land next to water, just like in the picture. We'll see what happens when water moves.\"\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Directions for Students:**\n   - \"Use your sand to make a tall cliff or hill at one end of your pan. Pack it down firmly.\"\n   - \"Place your toy figures or blocks on top of the sand hill—they represent people and buildings.\"\n   - \"Now slowly pour water into the other end of the pan. Watch carefully! What happens to the sand?\"\n   - \"Keep pouring more water and watch the pattern. Does the water change the shape of the land?\"\n   - \"Draw or write what you observe on your worksheet.\"\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:** \"Just like in the picture at the beach, water is always moving and changing the land. The sign was put there because people noticed this pattern happening over and over.\"\n\n4. **Recording:** Students draw or write simple observations: \"The water made the sand move\" or \"The cliff got smaller.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What's happening to the sand? Where is it going? Is your toy person still safe?\"\n- Avoid saying \"erosion\"—instead use child-friendly language: \"The water is washing the sand away,\" \"The land is getting smaller.\"\n- Encourage students to slow down and notice patterns rather than rushing.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that water causes sand to move and land to change shape.\n- Students discover that objects on top of the \"cliff\" can become unsafe if the land erodes.\n- Students make simple predictions: \"The water will wash more sand away,\" \"My toy person might fall.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (16 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to real-world coastal safety.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Picture cards showing different Earth features and changes\n- Anchor chart paper for vocabulary\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** \n   - Ask 3-4 students: \"What did you discover about what water does to land?\"\n   - Record responses on chart paper with simple drawings.\n\n2. **Key Vocabulary (with student-friendly definitions):**\n   - **Erosion:** When water, wind, or ice slowly wears away land and moves it to a different place.\n   - **Cliff:** A tall, steep wall of rock or earth that drops down sharply.\n   - **Coastline:** Where the land meets the water at the beach or ocean.\n   - **Pattern:** Something that happens again and again in the same way.\n   - **Warning sign:** A sign that tells people about something dangerous so they can stay safe.\n\n3. **Connections:**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"This is a real coastline. Just like in your sand experiment, water is always moving and changing the land here. That's why there's a warning sign.\"\n   - Explain: \"The land is getting smaller and smaller because of erosion. The sign tells people, 'Don't get too close! The land might not hold you up!'\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"What makes that sign important?\" (Students should mention water, danger, or land changing.)\n   - Ask: \"How is your sand experiment like the real beach in the picture?\" (Water moves both; land changes both.)\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create and display a chart with simple drawings and one-word/two-word labels of each vocabulary term.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that erosion is when water changes land.\n- Students connect their sand experiment to the real photograph.\n- Students can explain why a warning sign is useful at a dangerous coastline.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a solution to protect people from coastal hazards.\n\n**Materials:**\n- New pans with sand setup (same as Explore phase)\n- Art supplies: popsicle sticks, blocks, strips of paper/fabric, tape, markers\n- Toy figures representing people\n- Water and spray bottles\n- \"Before and After\" recording sheet (picture-based)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario Introduction:** \"Now you're a helper for the town. People love the beach, but the erosion is making it dangerous. Can you build something to slow down the water and protect the land? You could build a wall, a dam, a fence, or something else. It's up to you!\"\n\n2. **Design Challenge:**\n   - Students design and build a protective structure using available materials (sticks, blocks, tape).\n   - They place the structure in their sand pan between the cliff and the water.\n   - They test it by pouring water and observing whether it slows erosion.\n   - They adjust and improve their design if needed.\n\n3. **Recording:** Students draw or write: \"My structure was/was not helpful because...\"\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:** \"Towns actually do this! They build sea walls and barriers to protect their beaches. You just designed like a real engineer!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Encourage experimentation and improvement without judgment.\n- Ask: \"What happened? Does your design work? What could you change?\"\n- Avoid directing students toward a \"correct\" answer; celebrate multiple solutions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design at least one protective structure and test it.\n- Students observe whether their design slows water movement or erosion.\n- Students understand that humans problem-solve to protect themselves from Earth's natural processes.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of erosion, coastal hazards, and human responses.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- Observe during Explore: Do students notice water moving sand? Can they describe what's happening?\n- Listen during Explain share-out: Do students use vocabulary correctly and connect to the photograph?\n- Watch during Elaborate: Do students design purposeful structures and test them?\n\n**Exit Ticket (end of Lesson 2):**\nProvide a simple picture card showing the photograph or a beach scene. Ask students to respond (orally or with drawings/words):\n1. \"What is happening to the land at the beach?\" (Expected: Water is moving it / making it smaller / erosion)\n2. \"Why did someone put a warning sign there?\" (Expected: To keep people safe / because the land is dangerous / because it changes)\n3. \"What could help protect the land?\" (Expected: A wall / something to stop water / a barrier)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student observes and describes water changing land (using words like \"wash away,\" \"move,\" \"change\")\n- ✓ Student connects the sand experiment to the real photograph\n- ✓ Student explains that warning signs help keep people safe\n- ✓ Student demonstrates understanding that humans respond to Earth changes with solutions\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most first graders will successfully observe water moving sand and make simple predictions.\n- Students will understand that signs warn about dangers from Earth's natural processes.\n- Students will show evidence of creative problem-solving in the design challenge.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n1. **Guided observation:** Provide sentence frames: \"The water makes the sand ____.\" / \"The sign tells people to ____.\" Students fill in one word.\n2. **Simplified recording:** Instead of writing, have students point to picture options (water, land, cliff, sign) and circle or match them.\n3. **Structured exploration:** Reduce variables—pour water in the same way each time; use uniform sand; provide pre-made toy figures so students focus only on the water's effect.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n1. **Prediction and variables:** Ask: \"What if you pour water faster? Slower? Will erosion happen differently?\" Have students test multiple scenarios and compare.\n2. **Extended vocabulary:** Introduce terms like \"sediment\" (the sand that moves) and \"deposition\" (where sand settles). Have them predict where sediment will go.\n3. **Real-world research:** Have students sketch and label other coastal protection structures (sea walls, jetties, barriers) using picture books or photos, then explain how each one works.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Observation Over Time:** Take a photograph of the sandy/water area in your sand pan. Create a time-lapse sequence (pour water, photograph, repeat) and create a simple picture book showing how the land changed step-by-step. Display it in the classroom.\n\n2. **Beach Safety Poster:** Students design their own warning sign for a dangerous place. They draw the hazard and write or dictate what the sign should say. Display in the classroom as a gallery.\n\n3. **Local Erosion Investigation:** If your school is near water or has a sloped area with water runoff, take students on a guided walk to observe real-world erosion patterns (ruts in paths, sand washed away, etc.). Have them draw what they observe and discuss why those patterns exist.\n\n---",
