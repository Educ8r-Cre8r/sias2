ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity about the moss-covered rock and activate prior knowledge about rocks and plants.\n\n#### Materials\n- Printed or displayed photograph of moss-covered rock (large, visible to all students)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: real rock sample (with or without moss) to pass around carefully\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display & Introduction:**\n- Show the photograph on a large screen, document camera, or printed poster where all students can see clearly.\n- Say: \"Look closely at this special rock. Something interesting is growing on it. What do you notice?\"\n- Give students 30 seconds of quiet looking time before talking.\n\n**Discussion Questions (calibrated for Kindergarten):**\n1. \"What color is the fuzzy stuff on this rock? Have you ever seen something like this before?\"\n2. \"Do you think the green fuzzy stuff is alive, like you and me? Why or why not?\" (Accept all responses; don't correct yet.)\n3. \"Why do you think this green stuff is growing on the rock and not somewhere else?\"\n4. \"If this rock is in a shady, wet place, how might that help the green stuff grow?\"\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n- \"Let's wonder together: What would happen to the moss if the rock moved to a sunny, dry place? Do you think it would still grow? Let's investigate!\"\n\n#### Transition\n\"I want you to become rock detectives! We're going to explore rocks and plants and find out why moss loves rocks so much.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate rocks and moss (real or represented) to discover the conditions where moss grows and why.\n\n#### Materials\n- Real rocks collected from school grounds (5–8 rocks of different textures; if moss is unavailable, that's okay—the lesson still works)\n- Hand magnifying glasses (one per pair or small group)\n- Spray bottles filled with water\n- Paper towels\n- Observation recording sheet with simple pictures (optional)\n- Small pieces of moss or moss photos if rocks don't have real moss\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Setup:**\n- Divide students into small groups of 3–4.\n- Give each group one rock, a magnifying glass, and a spray bottle.\n- Arrange stations around the room so groups rotate.\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud; post images showing each step):**\n\n1. **Examine the rock closely.** Use the magnifying glass to look at it. Touch it gently. Does it feel rough or smooth? Is it wet or dry? Draw or tell what you see.\n\n2. **Look for moss or other small plants.** If your rock has green, fuzzy stuff on it, that might be moss! If it doesn't, that's okay. We'll learn about moss anyway.\n\n3. **Spray your rock lightly with water.** Watch what happens. Does it look different? Feel different? Does the moss (if present) look darker or greener?\n\n4. **Talk about it.** Ask your group:\n   - Where on the rock did we find moss (or might moss grow)?\n   - Was that part wet, damp, or dry?\n   - Was it in sunlight or shade?\n   - Do you think the rock needs to be damp for moss to grow?\n\n5. **Record your thinking.** Draw a picture of your rock, or point to words like \"wet,\" \"dry,\" \"rough,\" \"smooth,\" \"green,\" \"brown\" that describe it.\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate to each group.\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice? Where is the moss? What do you think moss needs?\"\n- Do NOT give answers; instead, guide with wonder: \"I'm curious—why do you think the moss is growing on this shady side and not the sunny side?\"\n- If students struggle, show them the photograph again and ask them to find the same thing on their rock.\n- Encourage all observations without judgment.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students discover that moss is found on rocks in damp, shaded places.\n- Students observe textures and moisture differences on rocks.\n- Students make connections between water and moss growth (when they spray the rock).\n- Students produce drawings or recorded observations identifying rock features.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and solidify understanding through guided discussion and teacher-led instruction.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper with the vocabulary terms (with simple pictures)\n- Photograph of moss-covered rock (to revisit)\n- Optional: real moss sample in a clear container with water and shade label\n- Whiteboard or chart for recording student responses\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\n- Gather students on the carpet.\n- Ask: \"What did you discover about the rocks? Where did we find moss? What did the moss need?\"\n- Record responses on chart paper using words and pictures. (Examples: \"Moss grows where it's wet,\" \"Moss likes shade,\" \"Moss is green and fuzzy.\")\n\n**Introduce Vocabulary:**\nWrite and illustrate each term on chart paper. Say the word multiple times and use it in a sentence with the photograph and their discoveries.\n\n**Vocabulary (with Kindergarten-friendly definitions):**\n\n1. **Rock:** A hard, natural object made of stone that comes from the ground. It doesn't grow like plants do.\n\n2. **Moss:** A tiny green plant with no roots like big plants have. It's soft and fuzzy. Moss grows on rocks, logs, and wet places.\n\n3. **Habitat:** The place where a plant or animal lives and finds everything it needs to grow and stay alive.\n\n4. **Damp/Wet:** Full of water or moisture. Moss loves damp places because it needs water to live.\n\n5. **Shade:** A cool, dark place where sunlight doesn't shine very much. Moss grows better in shade.\n\n**Connect Back to the Photograph & Exploration:**\n- Point to the photograph: \"See this moss? It's growing on the rock because the rock is in a shady, damp place. The moss gets the water it needs, and the rock keeps it safe. That's the moss's habitat!\"\n- Say: \"Just like you need a home with water to drink and a safe place to sleep, moss needs a home too. For moss, a damp, shady rock is the perfect home!\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Ask: \"Where does moss like to live?\" (Expect: \"On rocks,\" \"In wet places,\" \"In shade.\")\n- Ask: \"Why does moss need water?\" (Expect: \"To drink,\" \"To grow,\" \"To stay alive.\")\n- Ask: \"Is moss alive?\" (Expect: \"Yes,\" with reasoning like \"It grows\" or \"It's a plant.\")\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students correctly name moss, rocks, and habitat.\n- Students explain (in simple words) that moss grows on rocks in damp, shady places.\n- Students understand that moss is a living plant with specific needs.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nApply and deepen understanding by representing a rock habitat and thinking about how moss changes its environment.\n\n#### Materials\n- Craft materials: construction paper, tissue paper (green and brown), glue, scissors, markers\n- Pre-drawn rock outlines (simple large rock shapes) on cardstock\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Optional: shallow trays, real soil, small plants, water for a 3D habitat model\n- Chart paper titled \"How Moss Changes the Rock\"\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Represent a Moss Habitat (Choose one option based on time/materials):**\n\n**Option A: Habitat Drawing/Collage**\n1. Give each student a pre-drawn rock shape on paper.\n2. Ask: \"Make moss grow on your rock! Show where the moss lives and what it needs.\"\n3. Students glue green tissue paper, moss-colored paint, or markers onto their rocks.\n4. Students draw or write one thing moss needs: water (add blue marks), shade (color it dark), or the rock itself.\n5. Display with the title \"Our Mossy Rocks Habitats.\"\n\n**Option B: 3D Rock Habitat Model (if time allows)**\n1. Provide a shallow tray or cup with soil.\n2. Place a rock or rock-shaped object in the soil.\n3. Students spray the rock and soil with water.\n4. Students carefully place small green craft pieces or real moss clippings (if available) on the rock.\n5. Place in a shaded location. Observe over several days.\n\n**Discuss Change:**\n- Ask: \"How does moss change the rock?\" Record ideas on chart paper.\n- Expect answers like: \"It covers the rock,\" \"It makes the rock wet,\" \"It protects the rock,\" \"It makes the rock green.\"\n- Say: \"Moss is so small and soft, but over a long, long time, moss can break rocks into tiny pieces. Moss changes its home!\"\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate and ask: \"What is your moss's habitat? What does it need?\"\n- Help students think about cause and effect: \"If we move this rock to a sunny, hot place, what would happen to the moss?\"\n- Encourage creativity while keeping focus on moss's needs.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students create a visual or 3D representation of a rock habitat for moss.\n- Students identify at least one thing moss needs (water, shade, rock).\n- Students make simple connections between moss and environmental change (e.g., \"Moss covers the rock,\" \"Moss makes things look green\").\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of moss, rocks, habitats, and the conditions plants need.\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- Observe students during Explore: Do they identify damp, shady areas? Do they notice textures and moisture?\n- Listen during Explain: Can they use the vocabulary (rock, moss, habitat, damp, shade) correctly?\n- Review during Elaborate: Do their habitat representations show moss on a rock with indication of water or shade?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (choose one):**\n\n**Option A: Picture Identification (non-readers)**\n- Show students three images: (1) a dry, sunny rock, (2) a wet, shady rock, (3) a rainy, dark corner.\n- Ask: \"Point to the place where moss would like to live best. Why?\"\n- Success: Students point to the wet, shady option and give a reason (even one word: \"wet\" or \"shade\").\n\n**Option B: Simple Interview**\nAsk each student:\n1. \"What is moss?\" (Success: \"A tiny plant,\" \"Green fuzzy stuff on rocks,\" \"A living thing.\")\n2. \"Where does moss grow?\" (Success: \"On rocks,\" \"In wet places,\" \"In shade,\" \"Where it's dark.\")\n3. \"Why does moss live there?\" (Success: \"It needs water,\" \"It likes shade,\" \"The rock is a home for it.\")\n\n**Option C: Draw & Tell**\n- Ask students to draw or point to a place in the photograph where moss grows and explain why moss likes that spot.\n- Success: Student identifies a damp, shaded area and mentions water or shade as a reason.\n\n#### Success Criteria\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they can:\n- Name moss and rocks correctly.\n- Identify at least TWO conditions moss needs (dampness/water and shade).\n- Explain in simple words that moss is a living plant that grows in specific places.\n- Create or point to a habitat representation that shows moss on a rock in a damp or shady setting.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\nMost Kindergarteners will:\n- Use vocabulary: rock, moss, habitat, wet, shade.\n- Identify that moss grows on rocks in damp, shady places.\n- Explain one reason why (e.g., \"It needs water\" or \"It likes shade\").\n- Create a simple visual representation showing moss on a rock.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Use Real Objects:** If abstract thinking is difficult, provide real rocks and moss for tactile, hands-on exploration. Let students touch, spray, and observe without heavy documentation.\n\n2. **Simplify Vocabulary:** Focus on just three words: **rock, moss, wet**. Repeat these constantly and pair with images. For students still developing language, accept pointing and one-word responses (\"Wet!\" \"Moss!\").\n\n3. **Pair with a Buddy:** Assign a more verbal or advanced student to each struggling learner during exploration. The buddy can model observation and discussion while the student observes and participates at their level.\n\n4. **Repeat the Photograph:** Return to the photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. Ask the same simple questions repeatedly so students build confidence and recall.\n\n---\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Questioning:** Ask higher-order questions like:\n   - \"If moss grows in wet places, what would happen if it didn't rain for a month?\"\n   - \"Moss helps break rocks into smaller pieces. Over many years, could moss change the shape of a mountain?\"\n   - \"Where else in our school or playground might we find moss? Why?\"\n\n2. **Habitat Comparison:** Provide images of different habitats (forest, desert, mountain, river) and ask: \"Where would moss grow best? Why? What would moss need that these places have?\"\n\n3. **Care for Real Moss:** If available, give advanced students responsibility for a real moss sample. Have them:\n   - Predict what happens if they don't spray it (hypothesis).\n   - Check daily and record observations (wet/dry, color, growth).\n   - Explain findings to the class: \"Moss needs water or it dies.\"\n\n4. **Illustration & Labeling:** Invite advanced students to create a labeled diagram of a rock habitat, naming the rock, moss, water, and shade.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Moss Hunt\" Nature Walk**\n   - Take students on a supervised walk around the school grounds or nearby natural area.\n   - Challenge them to find rocks or logs with moss and photograph or sketch them.\n   - Create a class map showing \"Moss Homes in Our Neighborhood.\"\n   - Discuss why they found moss in certain locations (shade, moisture, nearwater).\n\n2. **Grow Your Own Moss Garden (Observation Project)**\n   - Provide each small group with a shallow container, soil, a rock, and a moss clipping (or store-bought moss).\n   - Students set it in a shaded, cool location and spray with water every 2–3 days.\n   - Over 2–3 weeks, students observe and record whether the moss grows, stays the same, or shrinks.\n   - Graph results: \"What did the moss need to grow?\" (Reinforce the lesson concepts through real-time observation.)\n\n3. **Rocks and Weathering Story Time + Sensory Activity**\n   - Read a simple picture book about rocks and erosion (e.g., *Over and Under the Pond* by Kate Messner, or a custom story about \"Rocky's Rock and His Moss Friends\").\n   - After the story, give students a smooth rock and a rough rock to handle.\n   - Ask: \"Which rock has been around longer? Which one might moss like better?\" Discuss how water and moss slowly change rocks.\n   - Students sort rocks by smoothness or texture, building schema for weathering and change over time.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Moss availability:** If moss is not growing on local rocks, you can purchase a small container of moss from a garden store or educational supplier. Real samples are more engaging than photos alone, even if scarce.\n- **Timing:** This lesson can be adapted to one long session or spread across two days (Engage & Explore on Day 1; Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate on Day 2).\n- **Safety:** Remind students to touch rocks gently and not eat any moss or soil. Ensure spray bottles are kept away from electrical outlets.\n- **Cross-curricular connection:** This lesson pairs well with a **Life Science** focus on \"living things\" (K-LS1) and a **reading connection** using nature observation journals or picture books about habitats.\n\n---\n\n**Happy teaching! This lesson brings the wonder of small, overlooked plants into focus for young learners while grounding exploration in real Earth science concepts.**",
