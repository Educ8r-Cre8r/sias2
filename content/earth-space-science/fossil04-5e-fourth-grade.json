ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about fossils and ancient landscapes by connecting the photograph to students' experiences.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph or digital display (projector/screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Picture of a modern shell or beach setting to compare\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display & Initial Observation:** Project the fossil photograph on the board. Tell students: \"This is a real photograph from Earth. What do you see? What surprises you?\"\n\n2. **Guided Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What is this object in the rock? Where have you seen something like it before?\" *(Connect to shells at the beach or aquariums)*\n   - \"How do you think a shell got inside solid rock? Could this happen today in your backyard?\"\n   - \"If this shell has been in the rock for a very, very long time, what does that tell us about where this rock came from?\"\n   - \"Look at the bumpy, cracked texture around the shell. What might have caused those marks?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... if we could travel back in time to where this fossil came from, what would we see? What kind of place was it?\" Invite students to write or draw one prediction on a sticky note.\n\n4. **Display Predictions:** Post sticky notes on a \"Wonder Wall\" that will be referenced in the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"To figure out the answers to these questions, we're going to become fossil detectives and investigate real rocks and shells—just like the paleontologists (fossil scientists) do!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover how fossils form and observe weathering effects through hands-on investigation.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 clear shallow container (plastic storage tub or tray, ~6\" × 8\" minimum)\n- Sand or fine soil (enough to fill container 2-3 inches deep)\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Small objects to \"fossilize\": shells (purchased from craft store or clean shells from home), toy dinosaurs, imprints of leaves, or plaster molds\n- Plaster of Paris (pre-mixed or dry with water available)\n- Spoon for mixing\n- Small rocks or pebbles (some to embed in sand, some to observe for weathering)\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per student)\n- Observation sheet (see below)\n- Optional: Pictures of modern shells or organisms for reference\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Creating a Fossil Model (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** and assign roles: Material Manager, Water Keeper, Recorder.\n\n2. **Step-by-step directions for students:**\n   - \"Press your shell gently into damp sand so it leaves a clear impression. Don't bury it yet.\"\n   - \"Observe the impression closely with your magnifying glass. How deep is it? What details can you see?\"\n   - \"Now carefully remove the shell. The impression stays in the sand—this is called a *mold*.\"\n   - \"Mix plaster of Paris with a little water to make a thick paste (like peanut butter).\"\n   - \"Spoon the plaster gently into the sand mold to fill it completely.\"\n   - \"Let it set for 2-3 minutes, then carefully lift out your plaster fossil. This is called a *cast*—it's the opposite of the mold!\"\n   - \"Sketch and label your fossil on the observation sheet. What details do you see?\"\n\n**Part B: Observing Weathering (8-10 minutes)**\n\n3. **Transition activity:** While plaster sets, students observe weathering.\n\n4. **Weathering observation directions:**\n   - \"Look at the small rocks in your container with your magnifying glass. Do any have cracks, different colors, or rough spots?\"\n   - \"Spray a rock lightly with water and observe. What changes, even slightly?\"\n   - \"Rub a rock gently on concrete or rough ground for 5 seconds. Look at the dusty powder that comes off. This is weathering—rocks break down into smaller pieces!\"\n   - \"Record what you observe: Draw the rock before and after, and write one sentence about what happened.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate with guiding questions: \"What details does your fossil mold show?\" and \"What made that dust come off the rock?\"\n- Do NOT tell students what fossils are—let them describe what they observe.\n- Help with plaster mixing but allow students to pour and shape.\n- Prompt: \"How is your fossil like the one in the photograph?\" to build the connection.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a fossil cast showing shell details.\n- Students observe and record evidence of weathering on rocks.\n- Students recognize that rocks change over time.\n- Observation sheets include sketches and written observations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and connect observations to Earth's processes and the fossil photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original photograph (projected again)\n- Anchor chart or poster paper\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Word cards: fossil, mold, cast, weathering, sedimentary rock, paleontologist, landscape, erosion\n- Optional: Real fossil or high-quality fossil replica to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 groups to show their fossil casts and describe what they created.\n   - Ask: \"How is your fossil like the one in the photograph?\"\n   - Display observation sheets for the class to see weathering evidence.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary with Anchor Chart (8-10 minutes):**\n   \n   Build an anchor chart collaboratively. For each term, show the definition, a sketch, and connect it to what students observed:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Fossil:** The preserved remains or trace of an organism that lived long ago. (Show the photograph. Explain: This shell died, got buried in sand and mud, and hardened into rock over millions of years. Now we can study it!)\n   - **Mold:** An impression left in rock or sediment when an organism dissolves or breaks down. (Reference their sand impressions.)\n   - **Cast:** A fossil made when sediment or plaster fills a mold and hardens, creating a copy of the organism's shape. (Show their plaster fossils.)\n   - **Weathering:** The slow breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by wind, water, ice, or sun. (Reference the dust they rubbed off rocks and the cracks visible in the photograph.)\n   - **Sedimentary Rock:** Rock made from layers of sand, mud, and gravel that are pressed and cemented together over time. (The rock in the photograph is sedimentary—it's made of compressed sand and silt with fossils inside.)\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (3-5 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at the fossil shell in this photograph again. It's like the casts you made, but it's real and millions of years old!\"\n   - \"The rough, cracked texture around the fossil shows **weathering**. Wind, rain, and frost have been breaking down this rock for a long time.\"\n   - \"This fossil tells us: A long time ago, this place was covered with water. Shells and sand were here. The sand got pressed into rock. And over time, the rock surface changed because of weathering.\"\n   - \"People called **paleontologists** study fossils like this to learn what Earth was like in the past.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to a partner and explain: How did a shell get inside solid rock?\" \n   - Listen for student explanations and correct misconceptions gently.\n   - Ask: \"How is weathering different from fossilization?\" (One breaks rock down; the other preserves organisms.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary correctly in explanations.\n- Students connect their model fossils to the real fossil in the photograph.\n- Students understand that weathering and fossilization are both slow processes that shape Earth over time.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply fossil and weathering concepts to a new context—interpreting fossil layers and Earth's changing landscapes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Laminated \"Rock Layer Cards\" or colored paper strips (prepared by teacher beforehand, see setup below)\n- Fossil pictures (3-5 simple line drawings of different organisms: fish, trilobite, fern, ammonite, brachiopod)\n- Scissors\n- Glue sticks\n- Chart paper labeled \"Our Fossil Timeline\"\n- Optional: Picture books showing ancient oceans, deserts, and forests (e.g., *Dinosaurs Love Underpants* or *What Do You See in a Rock?*)\n\n**Activity Setup (Prepare Before Class):**\nCreate a \"Rock Layer Model\" poster showing 5 horizontal colored strips labeled from bottom to top:\n- **Layer 5 (bottom, dark brown):** \"Oldest rocks—ocean environment\"\n- **Layer 4 (tan):** \"Sandy layer—beach environment\"\n- **Layer 3 (light brown):** \"Clay layer—river environment\"\n- **Layer 2 (gray):** \"Mixed rocks—mountain environment\"\n- **Layer 1 (top, light tan):** \"Newest rocks—desert environment\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the \"Rock Layer Challenge\" (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Paleontologists find different fossils in different rock layers. Each layer tells them something different about Earth's past.\"\n   - \"Your job: Figure out what the environment was like when each layer of rock formed!\"\n\n2. **Sorting Activity (10 minutes):**\n   - Display fossil pictures and the rock layer model together.\n   - Ask: \"If we find a fish fossil, which layer would it most likely be in? Why?\" (Layer 5, the ocean layer.)\n   - \"If we find a fern fossil, which layer? Why?\" (Layer 3 or 4, where water and plants were present.)\n   - \"If we find a fossil of a desert animal, which layer?\" (Layer 1, the top desert layer.)\n   - In small groups, students match fossil pictures to layers using reasoning and glue them onto a copy of the layer chart.\n\n3. **Group Discussion (5-8 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at the layers from bottom to top. What story do they tell about how this landscape changed?\"\n   - Guide students to notice: The environment changed from ocean to land to desert. This happened slowly over millions of years.\n   - \"How do you think paleontologists know this? They look for fossils and use weathering patterns to figure out when rocks formed.\"\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - \"In your town or state, what fossils do you think scientists have found? What does that tell us about what your area was like a long time ago?\"\n   - Invite students to research (or show them) what ancient fossils have been found in your state or region.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group discussion without providing answers; ask guiding questions.\n- Affirm correct reasoning: \"Yes! Fish lived in water, so we'd find fish fossils in ocean layers.\"\n- Help students see that **landscapes change over deep time** and **fossils are evidence of those changes**.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly match fossils to environment-appropriate layers with reasoning.\n- Students articulate how rock layers show Earth's changing landscape.\n- Students recognize fossils as historical evidence.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess mastery of learning objectives and understanding of fossils, weathering, and Earth's changing landscapes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Did students accurately create fossil molds and casts? Did they observe weathering?\n- **Vocabulary Check (Explain phase):** Did student explanations include correct use of fossil, weathering, and sedimentary rock?\n- **Partner talk (Explain phase):** Listen to student explanations about how shells become fossils.\n- **Layer sorting accuracy (Elaborate phase):** Did students match fossils to correct layers with reasoning?\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes, end of Session 2):**\n\nDistribute exit tickets with these questions (read aloud for struggling readers; students may draw or write):\n\n1. **\"In the photograph, you see a fossil shell in a rock. Explain how you think the shell got inside the rock. Use the words *fossilization* or *buried* in your answer.\"**\n   - *(Success: Student describes burying, layering, and hardening over time)*\n\n2. **\"The surface of the rock looks bumpy and cracked. What caused these features? Use the word *weathering* in your answer.\"**\n   - *(Success: Student mentions wind, water, time, and explains that rocks break down slowly)*\n\n3. **\"If you found fossils of ocean animals in the rock layer below fossils of desert animals, what does that tell you about how Earth's landscape changed?\"**\n   - *(Success: Student explains that the environment changed from ocean to desert, or describes the landscape as different long ago)*\n\n4. **Drawing Prompt:** \"Draw and label a fossil, a mold, and a cast. What's the difference?\"\n   - *(Success: Student draws and labels all three accurately)*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly explains fossilization (burial + time + hardening).\n- ✓ Student identifies weathering as the cause of rock surface changes.\n- ✓ Student connects fossil layers to landscape change over time.\n- ✓ Student accurately distinguishes between mold and cast.\n- ✓ Student uses 2+ vocabulary terms correctly.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- **Objective 1 (Identify fossil features):** Exit ticket question 1 + observation sheets show detailed observations.\n- **Objective 2 (Describe weathering):** Exit ticket question 2 + Explore phase observations of rock changes.\n- **Objective 3 (Compare layers):** Exit ticket question 3 + Elaborate phase layer sorting with reasoning.\n- **Objective 4 (Explain fossils as evidence):** Exit ticket question 3 + group discussions show understanding that fossils reveal Earth's past.\n\n**Scoring:**\n- **3 points:** Student meets all criteria for the question (complete, accurate, uses vocabulary).\n- **2 points:** Student partially meets criteria (mostly correct, minor gaps).\n- **1 point:** Student shows emerging understanding (attempts answer, needs clarification).\n- **0 points:** Student does not attempt or answer is off-task.\n\n*Target: Students should score 2-3 on all four exit ticket items.*\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary Anchors:** Provide students with a vocabulary card with pictures and simple definitions for fossil, weathering, and sedimentary rock. Students can reference these during explanations.\n\n2. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Offer multiple-choice or sentence-frame versions:\n   - \"A shell got inside the rock because it was _____ under sand and mud for a long time.\" (buried / eaten / painted)\n   - \"Weathering is when rocks _____ into smaller pieces over time.\" (break / grow / hide)\n\n3. **Paired Investigation:** During Explore, pair a struggling reader with a strong reader. Assign the strong reader to read directions aloud; both students participate in hands-on work.\n\n4. **Visual Supports:** During Explain, use large, labeled diagrams of fossils, molds, and casts. Point to each image as you say the word to reinforce vocabulary.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Paleontologist Deep Dive:** Provide students with pictures of 5-6 real fossils from different geological periods (Cambrian, Ordovician, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous). Ask: \"Order these fossils from oldest to newest based on what you see. What clues help you decide?\" Encourage research into actual fossil dating methods.\n\n2. **Weathering Rates Investigation:** Challenge students to design a mini-experiment: \"If you bury shells in different materials (sand, clay, wet sand, dry sand), which would preserve a fossil best?\" Have them predict, test, and explain results using evidence.\n\n3. **Landscape Change Scenario:** Provide a complex rock layer diagram (6+ layers with various fossils). Ask students to write a short narrative describing what Earth was like at each stage: \"When Layer 5 formed, Earth's climate was _____. The landscape had _____. Animals like _____ lived there. By Layer 1, Earth had changed to _____.\"\n\n4. **Research Extension:** \"Find out what fossils have been discovered in our state. Write a paragraph explaining what that tells us about what our area was like millions of years ago.\" Students can present findings to the class.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil Dig Simulation (Indoor or Outdoor):**\n   - Bury plastic toy animals, shells, and rocks in a sandbox or large tray of sand/clay (prepared before class).\n   - Provide students with small brushes, spoons, and hand picks.\n   - Have them carefully \"excavate\" fossils as paleontologists do.\n   - Record: Where did they find each fossil? How deep? What was around it?\n   - Discussion: \"Does the location of the fossil tell us anything about the environment?\"\n\n2. **Rock Weathering Time-Lapse:**\n   - Place chalk (a soft rock) outdoors in a designated spot.\n   - Photograph it daily for 1-2 weeks, noting cracks, dust, and color changes.\n   - Create a photo sequence showing how weathering occurs over time.\n   - Display with captions: \"Day 1: Smooth chalk. Day 5: Tiny cracks forming. Day 10: Chalk is crumbly.\"\n\n3. **\"Then and Now\" Landscape Comparison:**\n   - Show a map of your region as it was 100 million years ago (e.g., shallow sea, tropical forest).\n   - Compare it to a current map of your area.\n   - Ask: \"What fossils might we find here? What has changed? What caused those changes?\"\n   - Students create a poster or digital slide showing \"Landscape Then\" vs. \"Landscape Now.\"\n\n4. **Visit to a Natural History Museum (or Virtual Tour):**\n   - If possible, visit a museum with a fossil collection.\n   - If not, explore online virtual tours (e.g., Smithsonian, American Museum of Natural History).\n   - Students sketch 2-3 fossils they see and write a sentence about each: \"This fossil tells us _____.\"\n\n5. **Fossil Model Art Project:**\n   - Have students create detailed fossils using air-dry clay.\n   - Encourage realistic details (ribs on a shell, segments on a trilobite, veins on a leaf).\n   - Display with labels and short descriptions of what organism it is and what environment it lived in.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson works best across two 50-minute sessions: Session 1 = Engage + Explore (25-30 min), Session 2 = Explore conclusion + Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate (70-75 min). Alternatively, compress into one 90-minute block if you have extended science time.\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure plaster of Paris is handled with clean hands and kept away from eyes. Supervise water use during weathering observations to prevent spills.\n\n- **Inclusivity:** The photograph is visible but small details may be hard to see. Provide a large printed version and describe details aloud: \"You see a shell shape with clear ridges...\" to support students with visual processing needs.\n\n- **Connection to NGSS:** This lesson directly addresses 4-ESS1-1 (evidence of changes over time using fossils) and 4-ESS2-1 (effects of weathering). The photograph serves as authentic evidence throughout, anchoring abstract concepts in visible reality.\n\n- **Prior Knowledge:** Students should have basic familiarity with rocks and shells. If not, conduct a brief \"What is a fossil?\" discussion before Engage.",
