ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity about rock layers and change by using the photograph to activate wonder about how rocks form and change.\n\n#### Materials\n- Large printed color photograph (or projected image) of the stratified rock\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: hand lens for close viewing of the photo\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Introduction (3 minutes):**\nDisplay the photograph prominently where all students can see it clearly. Ask students to sit in a circle or gather on the carpet.\n\nSay: *\"Look carefully at this special rock. It's not smooth and plain—it has stripes and layers, like a sandwich! I'm wondering... what do you notice?\"*\n\nAllow 10-15 seconds of silent looking time.\n\n**Discussion Questions (8 minutes):**\n\n1. **\"What do you see when you look at this rock? What colors and patterns do you notice?\"** \n   - *Expected responses:* Stripes, layers, brown, white, tan colors, bumpy texture.\n   - *Affirm all observations.*\n\n2. **\"Why do you think this rock has all these layers? Where might these layers come from?\"**\n   - *Listen for ideas about stacking, building, sand, dirt, etc. Don't correct—just affirm curiosity.*\n\n3. **\"This rock is sitting in a pile of small rocks and gravel. Do you think the big rock used to be different? What might have happened to it?\"**\n   - *Guide toward ideas of breaking, wearing away, changing shape.*\n\n4. **\"Can you think of other rocks or land that changes? How does it change?\"**\n   - *Prompt with examples if needed: \"Have you seen a rock path that gets bumpy? A dirt hill that washes away?\"*\n\n**Prediction Prompt (1 minute):**\nSay: *\"In this lesson, we're going to find out how rocks get their layers, how they change slowly, and how we might stop them from changing. Let's explore!\"*\n\n#### Transition\n*\"First, let's do a hands-on activity where you'll build your own layers and see how they change.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents discover how layers form and how erosion changes rocks through hands-on investigation.\n\n#### Materials\n\n**Per small group (2-3 students):**\n- 1 clear plastic cup or small clear container\n- Sand (light color)\n- Dark soil or cocoa powder\n- Small pebbles or gravel\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Spoon or stick for layering\n- Paper towel\n- Small paintbrush or old toothbrush\n- Shallow tray or cookie sheet (to contain water/mess)\n- Pencil and paper for recording observations\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part A: Building Layers (10 minutes)**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **\"Take turns adding materials to your cup in layers.**\n   - First layer: 1 inch of sand (spread it flat with your spoon)\n   - Second layer: ½ inch of dark soil (press gently)\n   - Third layer: Small pebbles (arrange so you can see them)\n   - Fourth layer: More sand (flat layer)\n   - Keep your layers visible from the side.\"\n\n2. **\"Look at your cup from the side. Draw or write: What layers do you see? What colors?\"**\n   - *Students sketch or dictate observations onto a recording sheet.*\n\n3. **\"This is like real rocks underground! Rocks form in layers over a very long time.\"**\n\n**Part B: Erosion Investigation (12 minutes)**\n\n4. **\"Now we're going to see what happens when water and wind hit rocks. This is called erosion. Place your cup on a tray.\"**\n\n5. **\"Gently spray water on one side of your cup with the spray bottle (about 5-10 sprays). What happens to your layers?\"**\n   - *Students observe water moving through, particles shifting, layers mixing.*\n   - *Affirm all observations: \"Yes, the water is moving the materials around! The layers are changing!\"*\n\n6. **\"Now use the paintbrush or toothbrush like wind. Brush one side of your cup gently 10 times. What happens?\"**\n   - *Students see dry materials shift, mixing of colors.*\n   - *Ask: \"Is the rock still the same? What changed?\"*\n\n7. **\"Let's do the water AND wind together. Spray a few times, then brush. How is it different now?\"**\n\n8. **\"Draw or write: How did your rock layers change? Are they still in nice layers, or are they mixed up?\"**\n\n#### Teacher Role\n\n- **Circulate and observe** without immediately helping—let students discover through play.\n- **Ask guiding questions:** \"What do you think is happening to the layers?\" \"Is the rock changing fast or slow?\" \"If we did this for a long time, what might happen?\"\n- **Encourage peer discussion:** \"What did your partner notice that was different?\"\n- **Do NOT say:** \"You're doing erosion\"—let students use their own words; introduce the term during Explain.\n- **Manage expectations:** It's okay if layers mix significantly; that's the point.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students observe that layers can shift, mix, and change when water and friction are applied.\n- Students begin to notice cause and effect: *water caused the layers to move; wind caused materials to shift.*\n- Students produce a visual record (drawing/writing) showing \"before\" and \"after\" states.\n- Students use language like \"mixed up,\" \"wet,\" \"moved,\" \"changed\" to describe what happened.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nFormalize student discoveries with vocabulary, connect to the photograph, and build understanding of slow/fast changes and erosion.\n\n#### Materials\n- Photograph of the rock (from Engage)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Vocabulary cards (printed or handwritten) with pictures\n- Student recording sheets from Explore phase\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out (6 minutes):**\n\n1. **Invite 3-4 students to share their observations:**\n   - *\"What did you notice when you added water?\"*\n   - *\"What happened when you used the brush?\"*\n   - *Have students show their drawings; affirm all descriptions.*\n\n2. **Ask: \"Our cup experiment was quick—we saw changes in just a few minutes. But look at this real rock from our photograph. Do you think this rock's layers took a few minutes to change, or a much longer time?\"**\n   - *Guide toward: \"Much, much longer—hundreds or thousands of years!\"*\n\n**Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\nDisplay vocabulary cards one at a time. Use the photograph and student experiments as examples.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n1. **Erosion** – When wind, water, or weather slowly wears away and moves rocks, soil, or land. *Example: \"The water in your cup moved the sand. Over a long time, water in a river moves SO much rock and soil!\"*\n\n2. **Weathering** – When rocks break apart, crumble, or change because of sun, rain, wind, or freezing. *Example: \"This rock has cracks because sun and rain broke it apart slowly.\"*\n\n3. **Layers** – Flat, stacked pieces or bands of different materials. *Example: \"Your cup had layers of sand and soil. This rock has layers of different colored stone.\"*\n\n4. **Fast change** – Something that happens quickly (in seconds, minutes, or hours). *Example: \"When a rock falls and breaks—that's fast!\"*\n\n5. **Slow change** – Something that takes a very long time (days, years, or thousands of years). *Example: \"Wind and water wearing down a mountain—that's slow!\"*\n\n**Connection to Photograph (3 minutes):**\n\nSay: *\"This rock in our photograph has beautiful layers like your cups did. But look—some parts are worn away at the top. The wind and water have been eroding this rock for a very, very long time. That's a SLOW change. But a single rock breaking when it falls—that's a FAST change.\"*\n\nAsk: *\"Can you point to a part of this rock that looks like it's been worn away by erosion?\"*\n\n#### Check for Understanding (1 minute)\n\n**Ask one simple question to the whole group:**\n*\"Is erosion something that happens fast or slow? Turn to a partner and say the word 'erosion' together.\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students correctly use \"erosion\" and \"weathering\" in sentences when prompted.\n- Students can point to evidence in the photograph of slow changes.\n- Students understand that rocks change, both quickly and slowly.\n- Students connect their hands-on experiment to real-world rock changes.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply their understanding by designing and testing a solution to slow erosion, connecting to the real-world problem of protecting land.\n\n#### Materials\n\n**Per group:**\n- 2 clear cups with layered materials (from Explore, or fresh ones)\n- One cup = \"control\" (no protection)\n- One cup = \"protected\" (students will add a barrier)\n- Materials for barriers: plastic wrap, small rocks, sticks, leaves, cloth scraps, cardboard pieces\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Paintbrush\n- Shallow tray\n- Pencil and paper\n- Picture card showing erosion problem (eroded hillside, washed-away path, etc.)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Problem Introduction (3 minutes):**\n\nSay: *\"Imagine farmers have a hillside where they grow food. Wind and rain keep washing away the soil—that's erosion. We need to stop it or slow it down. You're going to be erosion scientists and test ideas!\"*\n\nShow a picture of erosion damage or describe: *\"People have found ways to protect the land. Some plant trees. Some build walls. Some use rocks. Today, you'll test your own idea.\"*\n\n**Challenge (12 minutes):**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **\"Look at your two cups of layered materials. One will stay the same—that's our 'control.'\"**\n\n2. **\"For the second cup, choose ONE material from our materials pile to protect the top layers. You might use:**\n   - **Rocks** (to block wind and water)\n   - **Cloth** (to slow water)\n   - **Plastic wrap** (to shield from water)\n   - **Sticks and leaves** (like plants growing on soil)\"\n\n3. **\"Carefully place your protective material on top of the protected cup. Keep it in place so we can test.\"**\n\n4. **\"Now spray both cups 10 times with water. Brush both with the paintbrush 10 times.\"**\n\n5. **\"Compare: Which layers changed more? Which one is still layered? Which one is mixed up?\"**\n\n6. **\"Draw or write: What protected the rock better? Why do you think that worked?\"**\n\n**Group Discussion (2-3 minutes):**\n\nInvite groups to share:\n- *\"What did you choose to protect your rock?\"*\n- *\"Did it work? How do you know?\"*\n- *\"Where do people use this idea in real life?\"*\n- *Examples to share if students don't generate: Trees on hillsides, walls along rivers, rocks under buildings, fences to stop wind.*\n\n#### Teacher Role\n\n- **Facilitate material selection** without directing which is \"best.\"\n- **Ask open questions:** \"Why do you think that material might work?\" \"What happened differently?\"\n- **Affirm all results** (even failed designs)—*\"That's interesting! It didn't slow erosion much. Why do you think that is? Real scientists learn from trying things that don't work!\"*\n- **Connect to real world:** *\"Farmers actually use rocks and plants just like you did!\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students test a fair comparison (control vs. protected).\n- Students observe differences in erosion between the two conditions.\n- Students use evidence from their test to explain what worked.\n- Students recognize that solutions exist to slow down natural changes.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess whether students understand rock layers, erosion, and slow/fast changes through multiple formative and summative strategies.\n\n#### Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson)\n\nUse these **observation checkpoints:**\n\n1. **During Explore:** Can students describe what they observe when water and wind interact with their layers? (Listen for vocabulary use and cause-effect thinking.)\n\n2. **During Explain:** When asked, can students point to evidence in the photograph of erosion?\n\n3. **During Elaborate:** Does the student test a reasonable solution and make a comparison between protected and unprotected materials?\n\n#### Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket\n\n**Administer at the end of the lesson (or split across two days if needed).**\n\n**Print or write on paper; students can respond by drawing, writing, or dictating to you.**\n\n---\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n**Question 1 (Concept Understanding):**\n*\"Show me in a picture or with words: What are layers in rocks? Where might they come from?\"*\n\n- **Success Criteria:** Student shows stacked/striped layers; mentions stacking, building, or materials forming over time.\n\n**Question 2 (Vocabulary/Process Understanding):**\n*\"What is erosion? Can you give an example from what you did today or saw in our photograph?\"*\n\n- **Success Criteria:** Student describes wind or water wearing away or moving rock/soil; references their experiment or the photo.\n\n**Question 3 (Application/Thinking):**\n*\"If you were protecting a garden from rain washing away the soil, what would you use? Why?\"*\n\n- **Success Criteria:** Student names a reasonable barrier (rock, cloth, plant, wood) and gives a reason (blocks water, slows it down, protects soil).\n\n**Question 4 (Slow vs. Fast - Optional Verbal):**\n*\"Is erosion a fast change or a slow change? Why?\"*\n\n- **Success Criteria:** Student says \"slow\" and explains it takes a long time (or gives example).\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n**Students have met learning objectives if they:**\n\n- ✓ Can describe rock layers and explain they form over time (Objective 1)\n- ✓ Can compare fast changes (rock breaking) to slow changes (erosion) with examples (Objective 2)\n- ✓ Use \"erosion\" or \"weathering\" correctly and point to evidence in photo or their experiment (Objective 3)\n- ✓ Propose a protective solution and can explain why it might work (Objective 4)\n\n#### Recording Results\n\nCreate a simple class checklist:\n\n| Student Name | Describes Layers | Uses Erosion Vocab | Identifies Slow Change | Tests Solution |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| ✓ = Yes, ✗ = Developing, — = Not yet observed | | | | |\n\nThis allows you to quickly see who needs follow-up or reteaching.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only \"erosion\" (not \"weathering\") and pair each use with a visual. Provide laminated vocabulary cards with pictures during the lesson so students can reference them.\n\n2. **Guided Exploration:** Provide a step-by-step photo sequence showing each layer-building and erosion step. Students can follow the pictures rather than verbal directions.\n\n3. **Reduce Recording Demands:** Instead of writing, have students:\n   - Dictate observations to a peer or adult\n   - Point and say aloud what they observe\n   - Arrange picture cards showing \"before\" and \"after\" instead of drawing\n\n4. **Hands-On Modeling:** Pre-build one sample cup with clear layers; let struggling students observe your model being \"eroded\" before attempting their own.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multiple Variables:** Have students test TWO different protective materials simultaneously on separate cups and compare results. Ask: *\"Which one stopped erosion better? Why might that be?\"* Introduce idea of **fair testing**.\n\n2. **Extended Time Frame:** Have students *predict* what would happen if erosion continued for a week. Place cups in a safe location and observe daily changes. Create a **prediction chart** and compare predictions to actual outcomes.\n\n3. **Real-World Connection:** Challenge students to find or photograph erosion in the school yard, local park, or their neighborhood. Create a class poster titled *\"Erosion in Our Community: Places We Found It.\"* Discuss what could protect those areas.\n\n4. **Cause-and-Effect Depth:** Ask: *\"What causes erosion to happen faster or slower?\"* Have students investigate: Does a steeper slope erode faster? Does more water erode more? Design a follow-up experiment.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n**For Early Finishers, Homework, or Follow-Up Lessons:**\n\n### 1. **Erosion in the Schoolyard Hunt**\nStudents go on a short outdoor walk (with supervision) to spot evidence of erosion: worn paths, exposed soil on hillsides, washed-away areas under downspouts, tree roots showing. They sketch or photograph 2-3 examples and label them *\"Slow Change\"* or *\"Fast Change.\"* Share findings in a class collage or presentation.\n\n### 2. **Design a Protective System for a Model Hillside**\nStudents create a small model hillside using sand in a baking pan, tilt it slightly, and design a system to protect it from water flowing down (you'll spray water to simulate rain). They can use plants (grass, seeds), rocks, cloth, or other materials. Test by sprinkling water and measure/observe: How much soil washed away? This is an excellent pre-STEM engineering activity.\n\n### 3. **Stone Layering Art + Science**\nProvide smooth rocks/stones in various colors. Students arrange them in a striped pattern (like the photograph) to create a decorative tower or flat pattern. On the back, they write or draw: *\"This rock has layers because...\" and \"Erosion can change this rock by...\"* Display as a class science art gallery. This reinforces the visual concept of stratification in a creative way.\n\n### 4. **Read-Aloud Connection: \"Everybody Needs a Rock\" (by Byrd Baylor) or Similar**\nPair this lesson with a short book about rocks (age-appropriate). After reading, discuss: How do rocks form? What can change them? Have students bring a small rock from home, observe its characteristics, and guess its history (smooth or rough? Layers? Colors?).\n\n### 5. **Time-Lapse Erosion Observation**\nSet up a \"long-term\" erosion station in the classroom or outdoors: a cup with layered soil/sand exposed to daily weather or light water sprinkling over 1-2 weeks. Students sketch it every few days and create a \"time-lapse\" poster showing changes. Compare to their quick experiment: *\"Which one showed bigger changes? Why?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Connections to Real World\n\nThis lesson connects to:\n- **Farming/Agriculture:** Soil erosion is a major concern; farmers use rocks, trees, and special plowing to protect topsoil.\n- **City Planning:** Erosion control (riprap, terracing, vegetation) protects roads, buildings, and waterways.\n- **Geology/Earth Science:** Understanding how landscapes change over time.\n- **Climate and Weather:** Rain and wind are agents of erosion; climate changes affect erosion rates.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n1. **Safety:** Supervise spray bottles and ensure no water gets on electrical outlets. Use non-toxic materials (sand, soil, natural items).\n\n2. **Prep Ahead:** Pre-gather materials in labeled bins. Have a drying station ready for wet materials.\n\n3. **Pacing:** This lesson spans two days comfortably (Day 1: Engage + Explore; Day 2: Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate). Adjust based on your students' pace.\n\n4. **Language Development:** Pair verbal explanations with visuals and real objects. Repeat key vocabulary multiple times in context.\n\n5. **Engagement Tip:** Many second graders love the \"destruction\" phase of Explore—spraying and brushing the cups. This is pedagogically valuable; allow time for playful discovery before redirecting to observation.\n\n6. **Documentation:** Take photos of student cups at different stages (before, during, after). These become powerful visual aids for review and for sharing with families.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly aligns with the photograph by using its visible features (layers, colors, exposed erosion) to drive student inquiry and builds a complete understanding of how rocks change over time.",
