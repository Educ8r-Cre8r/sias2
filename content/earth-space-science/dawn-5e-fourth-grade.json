Describe how water moves through the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation) using the fog in the photograph as evidence.\n2. Explain how water erodes and shapes the land by observing patterns of erosion in landscapes.\n3. Identify and describe different landforms and Earth features visible in a landscape, including water bodies, soil, and vegetation.\n4. Evaluate how humans interact with water and land resources and explain why water is important for farming and communities.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed or projected image of the dawn photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Sticky notes (one per student)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image on a screen or display a large printed version. Dim the classroom lights slightly to make the photo more dramatic and immersive.\n\n2. **Prompt with Observation:** Say: *\"Look carefully at this photograph taken early in the morning. What do you notice? What looks different or unusual compared to a normal sunny day?\"*\n\n3. **Discussion Questions (calibrated for Fourth Grade):**\n   - *\"What is that white, cloudy stuff covering the field? Where do you think it came from?\"*\n   - *\"Why might the water and the field look different at sunrise compared to midday?\"*\n   - *\"What do you see beyond the field—what landforms or features can you identify?\"*\n   - *\"If you were standing in this field right now, what might you feel or experience?\"*\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** Ask students to write or draw on a sticky note: *\"I wonder why fog appears in the morning...\"* or *\"I wonder where the water in that river came from...\"* Collect these and display on a \"Wonder Wall\" to reference throughout the lesson.\n\n5. **KWL Chart:** On chart paper, create three columns: **Know | Wonder | Learned**. Facilitate a quick 2-minute discussion: *\"What do you already know about fog, water, or how water shapes land?\"* Record student responses in the Know column.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Great questions! Today, we're going to become water detectives. We'll explore how water moves, how it shapes the land, and why it's so important to all living things.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3–4 students):**\n- Shallow aluminum pans or clear plastic containers\n- Hot water (teacher-prepared in advance; use caution)\n- Ice cubes in a plastic bag\n- Cotton balls or cheesecloth\n- Soil samples and sand (in sealed containers)\n- Small water droppers or spray bottles\n- Paper towels\n- Data recording sheet (see below)\n- Thermometer (optional, if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station 1: Fog Formation (Condensation)**\n1. Distribute the shallow pan with hot water to each group.\n2. Student instructions: *\"Carefully hold the bag of ice about 2 inches above the hot water. Observe what happens. What do you see forming on the bottom of the ice bag? Where is the water coming from?\"*\n3. After 2–3 minutes, remove the ice and discuss: *\"The warm water turned into invisible water vapor. When it touched the cold ice, it turned back into tiny water droplets—that's fog! This is what we see in the photograph.\"*\n4. Students record observations: *\"When warm water rose and touched something cold, _____ formed.\"*\n\n**Station 2: Erosion by Water (Weathering and Erosion)**\n1. Provide each group with a small slope of soil/sand in a pan and a spray bottle of water.\n2. Student instructions: *\"Spray water gently on the soil slope. What happens to the soil? Does it move? Where does the water go? Spray again—what changes do you notice?\"*\n3. After 3–4 gentle sprays, students observe the channels or pathways the water carved: *\"Water is moving the soil. This is called erosion. The flowing water in the photograph's river does this over many years!\"*\n4. Students draw a before-and-after sketch on their data sheet showing how water moved the soil.\n\n**Station 3: Landforms and Land Features**\n1. Provide a sealed container of soil, sand, and water mixed together (representing different layers).\n2. Student instructions: *\"Look at the layers in this container. Can you see different types of material? In the photograph, we see a river, a field, and forests. Each of these is a different landform. What do you think each one is made of?\"*\n3. Students discuss and record: *\"The river has ___. The field has ___. The forest has ___.\"*\n4. Show a simple hand-drawn map or diagram of the photograph's landscape on paper, and have students label the features they see.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between stations with guiding questions rather than answers:\n  - *\"What do you observe changing?\"*\n  - *\"Why do you think that happened?\"*\n  - *\"How is this like what we see in the photo?\"*\n- Allow 5–7 minutes at each station (rotate groups if there are three stations).\n- Use a timer to manage transitions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and record evidence of fog formation through condensation.\n- Students see water moving and shaping soil (erosion in action).\n- Students identify and label at least three landforms from the photograph (water, soil, vegetation).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed or projected photograph\n- Anchor chart (pre-made or co-created with students)\n- Index cards with vocabulary words\n- Digital thermometer or water cycle diagram (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2–3 groups to briefly share what they discovered at each station.\n   - Display observations on a table or poster: *\"What we discovered about fog,\" \"What we discovered about erosion,\" etc.*\n   - Affirm scientific thinking: *\"You just observed the same processes that happen every day in nature!\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Use the photograph as a visual reference while teaching each term with Fourth Grade–friendly definitions:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Condensation:** When warm water vapor (invisible gas) cools down and turns into water droplets (tiny water we can see). *Point to the fog in the photo.* \"This fog is condensation!\"\n   - **Evaporation:** When water from rivers, lakes, and oceans warms up from the sun and turns into invisible water vapor that rises into the air. *\"The river in the photo is always evaporating, even if we can't see it.\"*\n   - **Erosion:** When water, wind, or ice slowly wears away and moves soil and rock. *Point to the banks of the water.* \"Over time, the river erodes the land around it.\"\n   - **Weathering:** The slow breakdown of rock and soil by wind, water, ice, or living things. *\"Weathering is what makes rocks smaller and softer.\"*\n   - **Landforms:** Natural features of Earth's surface, such as hills, rivers, fields, and valleys. *\"Everything in the photo is a landform!\"*\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the fog: *\"This is condensation. Where did the water come from? From evaporation! This is part of the water cycle.\"*\n   - Point to the river: *\"This water is constantly eroding the banks and moving soil. Over hundreds of years, this river shaped the valley we see.\"*\n   - Point to the field and forests: *\"These landforms are made of soil, rock, and plants. All of these work together.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   Ask quick comprehension questions with hand signals (thumbs up = yes, sideways = kind of, down = no):\n   - *\"Is fog condensation?\"* (Thumbs up expected)\n   - *\"Does water cause erosion?\"* (Thumbs up)\n   - *\"Is a river a landform?\"* (Thumbs up)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary to describe the water cycle and erosion.\n- Students connect abstract vocabulary to visible features in the photograph.\n- Students demonstrate understanding through gesture-based response checks.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheets of construction paper (1 per student pair)\n- Colored pencils, markers, and crayons\n- Printed or digital images of local landscapes (optional; can be sourced from Google Earth or your local tourism board)\n- Water cycle diagram template (pre-drawn or blank)\n- Rulers\n- Scissors and glue sticks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Choice 1: Design Your Own Landscape (for most students)**\n1. Provide each pair of students with a large sheet of construction paper.\n2. Prompt: *\"You are landscape designers! Draw your own landscape that includes: a river or water body, a field or farmland, forests or hills, and soil/rock layers. Label each landform.\"*\n3. Students sketch and label their landscape, showing:\n   - A water feature (river, lake, or ocean)\n   - Evidence of erosion (like the banks in the photo)\n   - At least two different types of vegetation\n   - Soil or rock layers\n4. Encourage students to think: *\"Where would fog form in your landscape? How would water move through it?\"*\n\n**Choice 2: Complete the Water Cycle Diagram (for students needing more support)**\n1. Provide a pre-drawn or partially completed water cycle diagram.\n2. Students label and color the stages: evaporation (from the water body), condensation (forming clouds/fog), and precipitation.\n3. Students draw arrows showing the water's journey.\n4. Students answer: *\"How does this cycle connect to the photograph?\"*\n\n**Choice 3: Erosion Prediction Challenge (for advanced learners)**\n1. Provide a simple map or cross-section of a river landscape.\n2. Prompt: *\"If this river flows for 100 years, how will erosion change the landscape? Draw what you predict the land will look like.\"*\n3. Students sketch changes and explain their reasoning: *\"The river will erode here because...\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions:\n  - *\"What would happen if it rained a lot here?\"*\n  - *\"How did you show erosion in your drawing?\"*\n  - *\"Where does the water go after precipitation?\"*\n- Provide visual reference anchors (the photograph, vocabulary posters) for struggling students.\n- Encourage peer discussion and comparison of designs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create visual representations of landforms incorporating water cycle and erosion concepts.\n- Students demonstrate understanding by labeling and explaining features.\n- Students make predictions about how landscapes change over time due to water.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of water cycle, erosion, landforms, and connections to the photograph.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- Observation checklist during Explore phase: Can students identify evidence of condensation, erosion, and landforms?\n- Listen to explanations during Elaborate: Are students using vocabulary correctly and connecting ideas to the photo?\n- Thumb signal checks during Explain phase (thumbs up/sideways/down).\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (provide at the end of Session 1 or 2):**\n\nDistribute a half-page exit ticket with the following questions. Students may draw, write, or use a combination:\n\n1. **Water Cycle:** *\"Trace the path of a water droplet. It starts in the river in the photograph. Where does it go next? Draw and label its journey.\"*\n   - Success Criterion: Student shows evaporation, condensation, and return to Earth (precipitation or collection).\n\n2. **Erosion:** *\"How does the river in the photograph change the land around it? Explain or draw what erosion does.\"*\n   - Success Criterion: Student identifies water moving soil or shaping the banks.\n\n3. **Landforms:** *\"Name at least two landforms you see in the photograph and describe what they are made of.\"*\n   - Success Criterion: Student correctly identifies a water body and field/forest and describes their composition.\n\n4. **Reflection:** *\"What surprised you most about water and how it shapes Earth?\"*\n   - Success Criterion: Student reflects on a learning experience (no \"right\" answer, but should reference lesson concepts).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding of the water cycle by tracing water's path.\n- Students explain erosion as a process caused by flowing water.\n- Students identify and describe at least two landforms and their composition.\n- Students reflect meaningfully on Earth's water systems.\n\n**Scoring Guide:**\n- **Proficient:** Student answers 3–4 questions correctly with clear explanations or drawings, using vocabulary appropriately.\n- **Developing:** Student answers 2 questions correctly with some explanation; vocabulary use is emerging.\n- **Beginning:** Student attempts 1–2 questions; explanations are unclear or lack vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Station Rotation:** Assign struggling students to Station 1 (Fog Formation) first, as it's the most visually dramatic and requires minimal reading. Provide sentence starters on their data sheet: *\"When ice touched hot water, I saw ___.\"*\n\n2. **Vocabulary Cards with Pictures:** Create index cards with each vocabulary word paired with a simple drawing or photo. Allow struggling students to reference these during discussions and writing tasks. Reduce the number of vocabulary terms to 3 (condensation, erosion, landforms).\n\n3. **Paired Elaborate Activity:** For Choice 2 (Water Cycle Diagram), pair struggling students with a strong peer, or have them complete the diagram with teacher support, reducing independent demands.\n\n4. **Modified Exit Ticket:** Offer a multiple-choice or matching version of exit ticket questions instead of open-ended responses.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Erosion Rate Investigation:** Ask advanced students to design an experiment that tests how the *rate* of erosion changes. *\"Does a faster-flowing water stream erode soil more quickly than a slow stream? Design an experiment to test this.\"* Provide additional materials (water in bottles with different flow rates, soil samples, timers).\n\n2. **Local Landscape Analysis:** Provide a map or aerial photo of your local area (Google Earth or your city's GIS website). Ask: *\"Can you identify erosion, water features, and landforms near our school? What evidence do you see in the photo?\"* Students present findings to peers.\n\n3. **Water Resource Impact Project:** Prompt advanced students to research and present on how human use of water (farming, cities, dams) affects erosion and landscape change. *\"How does farming change the landscape like in the photograph?\"*\n\n4. **Extended Water Cycle:** Ask students to diagram a complete water cycle including more stages (infiltration, groundwater flow, transpiration from plants). Challenge them to explain: *\"What happens to rainwater that falls on the field in the photo?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Sunrise/Sunset Photography Walk:** On a clear morning or evening, take students outside (or view photos from your school's outdoor spaces) to observe and photograph fog, shadows, and light. Have students explain what they observe using water cycle and erosion vocabulary. Students create a photo journal with captions explaining Earth's features and processes.\n\n2. **River Model Challenge:** Using a water table, sandbox, or large tray, have students build a landscape model with hills, a water source (watering can or hose), and soil/sand. They observe and measure erosion over time, taking photos at 5-minute intervals. Students present findings: *\"How did the water shape our model landscape?\"*\n\n3. **Local Water Cycle Mapping:** Work with your community to map local water sources (rain collection, rivers, wells, wastewater). Create a large classroom poster showing where water comes from, how it's used in your town, and where it goes. Connect this to the photograph: *\"Our water follows a cycle like the river in this image.\"*\n\n4. **Fog & Condensation at Home:** Assign as homework a simple observation task: *\"Look for condensation in your home (bathroom mirror, car windows, drinking glass). Draw and label what you see. Explain why it happens using what you learned.\"*\n\n5. **Erosion Prevention Design:** Present a problem: *\"A farmer worries about erosion washing away topsoil from a field like in the photograph. Design a solution to slow or prevent erosion.\"* Students research and present on methods like terracing, tree-planting, or grass strips. Connect to NGSS 4-ESS3-2 (multiple solutions).\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety Reminder:** When working with hot water in the Explore phase, always supervise carefully. Prepare hot water yourself—do not allow students to heat water. Use water at a safe temperature (warm to touch but not boiling).\n- **Timing Flexibility:** If a 45-minute period is insufficient, Session 1 can include Engage and Explore, with Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate in Session 2.\n- **Real-World Connection:** If your region has recent flooding, erosion, or water events, reference these respectfully to help students understand the real-world impact of water processes.\n- **Visual Supports:** Keep the photograph displayed throughout the lesson as a reference point. Refer back to it frequently in each phase: *\"Remember the fog in our photograph? That's condensation!\"*\n\nThis lesson plan directly addresses how water shapes Earth's landscapes through observable, hands-on investigation while honoring Fourth Grade students' developmental level and curiosity about the natural world.",
