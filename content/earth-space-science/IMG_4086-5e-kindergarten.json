ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on smartboard, document camera, or printed large-format poster\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently so all students can see clearly. Ask students to gather in a circle on the floor for comfortable viewing.\n\n2. **Show the image silently for 15-20 seconds.** Allow students to simply look and observe without talking.\n\n3. **Ask these specific questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you see in the middle of this picture? What is it made of?\" *(Allow students to identify the stacked rocks.)*\n   - \"Why do you think someone stacked all these rocks here? What could they be building?\"\n   - \"Have you ever touched a rock or picked one up? What did it feel like?\"\n   - \"Do you see anything growing on these rocks? What could that be?\" *(Point to visible moss/lichen if visible.)*\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"If you could stack rocks like this, what would you want to build? A tall tower? A house? A bridge? Turn to a partner and share your idea.\"\n\n5. **Record student ideas** on chart paper titled \"What We Think Rocks Can Do.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore rocks and learn how we can stack and build with them, just like in this picture!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- River rocks, smooth stones, or landscape rocks (various sizes—aim for 15-20 rocks per small group; can be collected from playground or purchased inexpensively)\n- Small trays or shallow containers (one per group of 3-4 students)\n- Hand lenses (optional, for closer observation)\n- Small twigs, leaves, or grass clippings to place near rocks\n- Observation clipboards with blank paper and crayons\n- One damp cloth per group for cleaning hands after activity\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Sit in your small group around your tray of rocks. Look carefully at the rocks without picking them up yet. What do you notice? Are they all the same color? The same size? Are some smoother than others?\"\n\n2. \"Now, gently pick up a rock in each hand. Feel it. Is it smooth? Rough? Heavy? Light? Rub it against another rock. What happens? What do you hear?\"\n\n3. \"Try to stack three rocks on top of each other. Which rock should go on the bottom? Why? Which should go on top? Can you balance them?\"\n\n4. \"Now, try stacking more rocks. How tall can you make your stack before it falls? What helps keep rocks stacked? (Flat surfaces? Heavy ones on bottom?)\"\n\n5. \"Draw or color a picture of your rock stack on your clipboard. Show how many rocks you used.\"\n\n6. \"Look at the real rocks from the photograph again (show on screen). Can you find a rock from your pile that looks similar to one in the pile from the photo?\"\n\n**Connection to photograph:** \"The person in this picture stacked rocks just like you did. They wanted to create something. Maybe it marks a special place. Maybe it creates a wall. Maybe it's decoration!\"\n\n**What students should record:**\n- Drawings of their rock stacks\n- Observations about rock textures (smooth, rough, bumpy)\n- How many rocks they stacked before the tower fell\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking open-ended questions: \"What happens when you put a round rock on top? What about a flat one? Why do you think the tall pile fell over?\"\n- **Do not tell students the \"right way\"** to stack—allow experimentation.\n- Encourage tactile exploration: \"How does that rock feel different from the first one you picked up?\"\n- Use hand lenses with interested students to examine rock surfaces more closely.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that flat rocks are easier to stack than round ones.\n- Students learn that heavier rocks on the bottom make stacks more stable.\n- Students connect their hands-on stacking to the photograph.\n- Students begin to understand that rocks are useful materials for building.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student drawings/documentation from Explore phase\n- Optional: A few additional visual aids (pictures of rock structures: bridges, walls, rock gardens)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 volunteers to hold up their drawings and describe their rock stacks.\n   - Ask other students: \"How is your stack like theirs? How is it different?\"\n   - Highlight key discoveries: \"I heard that flat rocks are easier to stack!\" or \"Some of you found that heavy rocks help keep the stack from falling over!\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (8-10 minutes):**\n\n   Teach these five terms using student-friendly definitions and concrete examples:\n\n   - **Rock:** A hard, natural material that comes from Earth. We can hold it in our hand. *(Show a rock.)*\n   - **Stack:** To put things on top of each other, one after another. *(Demonstrate by stacking two blocks.)*\n   - **Balance:** When something doesn't tip over because the weight is even. *(Demonstrate with a pencil balanced on one finger, then tipping it.)*\n   - **Natural Resource:** Something from nature that people use and need. Rocks are a natural resource! *(Point to the photograph—rocks are a natural resource the person used to build.)*\n   - **Structure:** Something that is built. Your rock stack is a structure. The cabin in the photograph is a structure. *(Show both.*)*\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again.\n   - \"Look at the big rock pile in this picture. Someone stacked these rocks, just like you did!\"\n   - \"Why do you think they used rocks? What could this structure do?\" *(Allow responses: mark a place, create a decoration, hold back soil, etc.)*\n   - \"Rocks are a natural resource. People use them to build homes, walls, gardens, and decorations. The plants and trees around the rocks are also natural. The person who lives here used nature to make a beautiful space!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Quick thumbs-up/middle/down check: \"Show with your thumb if you understand that rocks are natural materials we can stack and build with.\"\n   - Ask one or two students to share: \"Can you tell me in your own words what a rock is?\" or \"Why do you think people use rocks to build things?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Rock** | A hard, natural material from Earth that we can hold and touch. |\n| **Stack** | To put things on top of each other in a pile. |\n| **Balance** | When something is steady and doesn't tip or fall over. |\n| **Natural Resource** | Something from nature that people use and need, like rocks, trees, and water. |\n| **Structure** | Something that is built. It can be big (like a building) or small (like your rock stack). |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use new vocabulary in context (e.g., \"I made a rock stack that was balanced\").\n- Students explain that humans use rocks (a natural resource) to build and design spaces.\n- Students understand that the photograph shows someone using Earth's natural materials.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Natural building materials: rocks (from Explore), soil, sand, small twigs, leaves, grass, flowers (if available)\n- Large trays or shallow containers (one per group)\n- Picture cards or photographs of natural spaces (rock gardens, stone pathways, natural structures)\n- Chart paper titled \"How Rocks Help People and Animals\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Display photographs of natural spaces (rock gardens, stone paths, bird feeders made of stacked stones, etc.) or describe them.\n   - \"We learned that humans use rocks to build and create spaces. But rocks also help animals and plants! Look at the cabin picture again—there are plants growing around the rocks. The rocks might give shade, hold soil in place, or create a habitat for bugs and small animals.\"\n\n2. **Design a \"Natural Space\" (10-12 minutes):**\n   - \"Now, you're going to be a designer! Your job is to create a small space using rocks and natural materials. You can make a rock garden, a home for a bug, a path, or whatever you imagine!\"\n   - \"As you build, think about this: How does your design help people? How might it help animals or plants?\"\n   - Provide each group with materials in a tray and allow 8-10 minutes to design.\n   - Circulate and ask questions: \"Tell me about your design. Who lives here? What does it do?\" or \"How did you use rocks in your design?\"\n\n3. **Gallery walk and discussion (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Students walk around briefly to see other designs.\n   - Ask 2-3 students to share: \"What natural materials did you use? Why did you choose those materials?\"\n\n4. **Connect to environmental responsibility (1-2 minutes):**\n   - \"These designs use natural materials from Earth. We need to take care of Earth and use its resources carefully. When we're done, we can return these rocks and materials to nature.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions rather than suggesting specific designs.\n- Validate diverse creations—there is no \"right\" design.\n- Highlight connections: \"You used rocks at the bottom and leaves on top—like the photo shows rocks with plants growing around them!\"\n- Ensure students are thinking about *why* they're placing materials where they are.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a functional design using rocks and natural materials.\n- Students explain how their design uses rocks as a natural resource.\n- Students begin to understand that designs can serve both human and environmental purposes.\n- Students can articulate why rocks are useful in their design (hold things up, support, mark space, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Did students attempt to stack rocks? Did they notice that flat rocks balance better than round ones? Did they handle rocks respectfully?\n- **Listen during group share-out (Explain):** Can students describe their rock stack? Do they use words like \"stack,\" \"balance,\" or \"structure\"?\n- **Observe during Elaborate:** Are students making intentional choices about material placement? Do they communicate reasoning (\"I put rocks here because...\") when asked?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes at end of Lesson 2):**\n\nUse **one of these three assessment options** depending on your class:\n\n**Option A: Verbal Exit Ticket (for younger K or emerging speakers)**\n- Gather students in a circle.\n- Ask each student one question from the list below as they leave:\n  1. \"Show me with your fingers—what size was your biggest rock?\" or \"Was it as big as my hand?\"\n  2. \"Can you point to something in the classroom that is a natural resource?\"\n  3. \"Why do you think people stack rocks?\" (Accept any reasonable answer: to build, to decorate, to mark a place.)\n\n**Option B: Drawing Exit Ticket (for all students)**\n- Provide each student with a half-sheet of paper.\n- Prompt: \"Draw a rock pile and show one place where an animal or plant could live.\" OR \"Draw something you could build with rocks.\"\n- Teacher collects and reviews for understanding.\n\n**Option C: Object Sorting Exit Ticket (hands-on)**\n- Place various objects on a table: a rock, a toy car, a plant, a plastic block, a pinecone, a crayon.\n- Ask each student: \"Point to the natural resources. Which ones came from nature?\" (Correct answers: rock, plant, pinecone.)\n- This assesses understanding that rocks are natural resources.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ Students can **identify rocks as natural materials** (shown by: selecting rocks when asked for \"things from nature,\" feeling and describing rocks, handling them respectfully).\n\n✓ Students **understand rocks can be stacked** (shown by: successfully stacking rocks without major frustration, trying different arrangements, discovering stable vs. unstable configurations).\n\n✓ Students **recognize humans use rocks to build and design** (shown by: explaining why they stacked rocks or built their natural space, connecting their activity to the photograph, using rocks in their design with purpose).\n\n✓ Students **use new vocabulary appropriately** (shown by: using words like \"stack,\" \"balance,\" \"rock,\" \"natural resource,\" or \"structure\" in conversation or drawings).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most students will demonstrate basic understanding that rocks are natural materials.\n- Most students will successfully stack at least 3 rocks and discover that flat rocks are more stable.\n- Students will make connections between their hands-on activity and the photograph.\n- Students will use at least 1-2 new vocabulary words correctly.\n- Students will understand that people use rocks to build and create spaces (even if articulation is simple: \"Rocks are for building\" or \"We use rocks to make things\").\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Pre-select flatter, more stackable rocks** for students who struggle with fine motor balance. Avoid very round rocks that won't balance.\n\n2. **Provide a \"rock stack\" example to copy.** Some students may benefit from replicating a 3-4 rock stack rather than inventing their own. This still builds understanding of balance and stacking.\n\n3. **Reduce verbal demands during Explore.** Instead of asking open-ended questions, ask yes/no questions: \"Is this rock smooth or rough?\" \"Can you stack this one?\" Allow students to demonstrate understanding through actions rather than words.\n\n4. **Pair with a more confident peer** during Elaborate phase. Partner students can build together and support one another.\n\n5. **Use real objects from the photograph.** If possible, show students actual rocks with moss or lichen to help them connect the concrete activity to the abstract photograph.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Introduce engineering concepts:** \"Can you build a rock stack that is taller than your hand? What makes it stable? Can you build a bridge using rocks and a twig?\"\n\n2. **Investigate weathering and change.** Show rocks with moss/lichen. Ask: \"Why do you think these rocks look different? What does weather do to rocks over a long time?\" Introduce the idea that rocks change slowly.\n\n3. **Design for function.** Challenge students to build a \"rock garden that is good for bugs\" or a \"rock shelter for a toy animal.\" They must explain their design choices.\n\n4. **Explore multiple structures.** \"You made a stack. Can you make a circle of rocks? A line? A wall? Which is the strongest? Why?\"\n\n5. **Document with writing/labeling.** Have students label their designs or draw arrows showing \"where water goes\" or \"where plants could grow\" in their rock structure.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### Extension 1: Classroom Rock Collection and Sorting\n**For early finishers or next day:**\n- Create a classroom rock collection station.\n- Students bring rocks from home or playground (if safe and appropriate).\n- Sort rocks by: color, size, smoothness, weight.\n- Create a chart: \"Our Classroom Rock Collection.\"\n- **ESS Connection:** Students observe that Earth provides many different types of natural resources.\n\n### Extension 2: Erosion Investigation (Rock and Water)\n**For next lesson (2-3 days later):**\n- Place a rock in a clear container with water.\n- Leave it for several days and observe.\n- Add another rock that has sand or soil on it.\n- Ask: \"Does the rock change? Does the water change? Why?\" *(Water becomes slightly cloudy; this is weathering/erosion.)*\n- Connect to photograph: \"In the picture, rain and weather touch the rocks. Over many years, weather can change rocks slowly.\"\n- **ESS Connection:** K-ESS2-1 (patterns and weather effects).\n\n### Extension 3: \"Rocks in Our Community\" Photo Hunt\n**For homework or community walk:**\n- Send home a sheet asking families to find and photograph (or draw) **five ways rocks are used in your neighborhood**: sidewalks, driveways, landscaping, building walls, decorative rock gardens.\n- Students bring back photos or drawings.\n- Create a class collage: \"Rocks Around Us!\"\n- Discuss: \"How many ways do people use rocks?\"\n- **ESS Connection:** K-ESS3-1 (how humans change and use the environment).\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure rocks are smooth and free of sharp edges. Supervise rock handling. Remind students to walk carefully when carrying materials.\n- **Sourcing rocks:** Ask families to contribute rocks, check a local landscaping supply, or collect from your playground/local creek (with permission).\n- **Timing flexibility:** This lesson can be condensed into one extended 60-minute session if needed, or spread across three shorter sessions.\n- **Photo display:** Keep the photograph visible throughout the unit so students can reference it and make connections.\n- **Real-world connection:** If possible, take a photo walk around your school or neighborhood to identify how rocks are used locally before or after this lesson.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson honors Kindergarten's need for concrete, tactile, sensory learning while building foundational understanding of natural resources, environmental change, and human interaction with Earth's materials—all central to K-ESS standards.",
