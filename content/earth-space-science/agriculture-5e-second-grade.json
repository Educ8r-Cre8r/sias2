ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large photograph of the green tractor on farmland (displayed via projector, document camera, or printed poster)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: short 2-minute video clip of a tractor plowing (YouTube has farm footage suitable for K–2)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is that big machine doing?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the farmer is moving all that brown dirt around?\"\n   - \"Look at the ground—what do you notice about how it looks different where the tractor has been?\"\n   - \"If you were standing in that field right now, what do you think the soil would feel like? Would it be hard like concrete or soft like something else?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder... what happens to the land when a big machine like this tractor pushes through it? Turn to a friend and share your ideas.\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper. Accept all ideas without judgment. Phrases like \"We think the dirt gets moved around\" or \"The ground changes shape\" are perfect at this level.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Let's become soil scientists and discover what really happens to soil and land when they're disturbed. We're going to make our own 'farm' in the classroom to investigate.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover soil properties and how land changes through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One shallow plastic tray (approximately 11\" × 14\", or similar; one per pair of students, or one demo per small group)\n- Potting soil or garden soil (enough to fill trays 3–4 inches deep)\n- Small toy tractors, toy bulldozers, or blocks to simulate farm equipment\n- Water in spray bottles or small watering cans\n- Wooden craft sticks or rulers\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but recommended)\n- Paper towels and hand wipes\n- Recording sheets (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Undisturbed Soil Observation (5 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute trays filled with undisturbed soil to each pair or small group.\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Look at your soil without touching it yet. What do you see? Is it flat or bumpy? What colors do you notice?\"\n   - Use magnifying glasses to look very closely. \"Can you see small rocks or pieces in the soil?\"\n   - Gently touch the soil. \"How does it feel? Is it wet, dry, hard, or soft?\"\n   - Record observations on the **\"Soil Detective\" chart** (see below).\n\n3. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Tell me what you're noticing. What colors do you see? Are all the pieces the same size?\" Avoid correcting; accept all observations.\n\n**Part A Recording Sheet (simple template for students to draw or write):**\n```\nSoil Before the Tractor\nDraw or write what you see:\n[space for drawing/writing]\n\nHow does it feel? ☐ Soft  ☐ Hard  ☐ Crumbly\nColors I see: _____________\n```\n\n**Part B: Simulating Farm Activity (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Now you're going to be the farmer! Use your toy tractor (or block) to push through the soil, just like in the big picture we saw.\"\n   - \"Push the tractor back and forth across your soil. What happens?\"\n   - \"Look at the shapes and patterns the tractor makes.\"\n   - \"Now spray a little water on one part of the soil and push the tractor through it. Does wet soil act different than dry soil?\"\n\n2. **Teacher role:** \n   - Demonstrate with one tray first so students understand the motion.\n   - Observe student engagement; ask questions: \"What's happening to the soil shape? Is it heaping up anywhere? Spreading out?\"\n   - Encourage students to notice differences between wet and dry soil.\n\n**Part B Recording Sheet:**\n```\nSoil After the Tractor\nDraw what your soil looks like now:\n[space for drawing]\n\nWhat changed? Check the boxes:\n☐ The soil heaped up\n☐ The soil got pushed around\n☐ The surface looks bumpy\n☐ The soil spread out flat\n\nDid water change how the tractor moved? Yes / No\n(circle one)\n```\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that soil can be pushed, moved, and shaped.\n- Students notice that disturbed soil looks different (ridges, furrows, loose particles) than undisturbed soil.\n- Students discover that wet soil behaves somewhat differently than dry soil when disturbed.\n- Students produce simple drawings or descriptions of changes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to the photograph and Earth science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of the tractor (displayed again)\n- Soil samples in small clear containers (to show to whole class)\n- Chart with vocabulary (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"What did you discover about what happens when we pushed through the soil?\"\n   - Invite 3–4 student pairs to share one discovery: \"When we pushed the toy tractor, our soil...\"\n   - Record key phrases on chart paper (e.g., \"moved around,\" \"made bumps,\" \"got spread out\").\n\n2. **Connect to the photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Display the tractor photograph again.\n   - \"The real farmer is doing something very similar to what you just did. See how the soil in the photo is all turned up and loose? That happened because the big tractor pushed through it.\"\n   - Point to specific areas: \"Here you can see the soil got pushed. Here, it's loosened up.\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary with student-friendly definitions (5 minutes):**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Soil:** All the tiny bits of rock, dirt, and other broken-down things mixed together that plants grow in. (Show a handful or tray.)\n   - **Landform:** The shape of the land—like hills, flat areas, valleys, or ridges. (Gesture to your tray model.)\n   - **Erosion:** When wind, water, or movement changes the shape of the land by moving soil or rock. (Connect to the tractor activity.)\n   - **Disturb:** To move something around or change it. (Mime pushing with hands.)\n\n   **How to teach these:**\n   - Write each word on a large card.\n   - Say the word aloud three times with students repeating.\n   - Give a concrete example: \"Soil is what we played with in the trays. Erosion is what happened when the tractor pushed through the soil and changed its shape.\"\n   - Use gestures and visuals—do NOT just recite definitions.\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2–3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Show me with your hands—is soil hard like a rock, or made of tiny pieces?\"\n   - \"When we pushed the tractor through the soil and it changed shape, was that erosion or building something? (Pause for answer.) Yes! That's erosion—the soil changed because something moved it.\"\n   - \"Point to something in our classroom that's a landform.\" (Students may point to a pile of blocks, a desk edge, etc. Accept all responses; clarify gently: \"Yes, desks have a shape and form too!\")\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use the word \"soil\" to describe what they observed.\n- Students understand that \"erosion\" is when land changes shape.\n- Students recognize that the tractor activity and the farm photograph both show erosion happening.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to a new, real-world context and deepen understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Additional trays with soil (or reuse Explore trays)\n- Small fences, barriers, or craft sticks to place across soil\n- Spray bottles with water\n- Toy trees or plants made from sponges, twigs, and clay\n- Chart paper: \"How Can We Protect Land?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario Introduction (2 minutes):**\n\"Farmers want to keep their soil from washing away in the rain. What could they use to stop the soil from moving? Let's test some ideas.\"\n\n**Student investigation directions (12–15 minutes):**\n\n1. **Setup:** Divide students into small groups. Give each group a tray with soil.\n\n2. **Scenario:** \"We're going to spray water on the soil like rain. But first, we'll try two ways to protect it.\"\n\n3. **Test 1 – No protection:**\n   - Lightly spray water on bare soil.\n   - Observe and draw: \"What happens? Does the soil wash away?\"\n   - Record on simple chart: \"No fence: Soil stayed / moved around / washed away\" (circle response).\n\n4. **Test 2 – With a barrier:**\n   - Place craft stick fences or toy trees in another tray section.\n   - Spray water again.\n   - Observe and draw: \"Does the fence or plant stop the water and soil?\"\n   - Record: \"With fence/plant: Soil stayed / moved around / washed away.\"\n\n5. **Compare (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Which way protected the soil better—with nothing or with a fence/plant?\"\n   - Discuss: \"Real farmers plant trees and grass around their fields to stop wind and water from moving the soil. This slows down erosion!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and prompt thinking: \"What do you notice is different between the two trays?\"\n- Help students make the connection: \"That fence is like a real fence or row of trees on a farm.\"\n- Record student observations on chart paper.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that barriers (fences, plants) can slow or reduce soil movement.\n- Students make the connection between classroom models and real farming practices.\n- Students understand that people have ways to protect land from erosion.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of soil, landform changes, and erosion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing, throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage discussion questions.\n- Check Explore recording sheets for evidence that students noticed soil changes.\n- Listen for student use of vocabulary during Explain phase group share.\n- Observe which students make connections during Elaborate (e.g., \"The fence is like trees on a real farm!\").\n\n**Exit Ticket or Summative Assessment (10 minutes at lesson end):**\n\n**Option A: Drawing with labels (best for most Second Graders)**\n- Provide paper divided into two sections.\n- **Left side:** \"Draw soil BEFORE the tractor disturbed it.\"\n- **Right side:** \"Draw soil AFTER the tractor disturbed it.\"\n- Instruct: \"Draw one thing that is different. You can write one word if you want.\"\n\n**Option B: Three simple yes/no questions (for quicker assessment)**\n1. \"Did the soil change shape when we pushed the tractor through it? (Yes / No)\"\n2. \"Is soil made of tiny pieces of rock and dirt mixed together? (Yes / No)\"\n3. \"Can a fence help stop soil from washing away in rain? (Yes / No)\"\n\n**Option C: Observation rubric (for teacher notes)**\n**Student can:**\n- [ ] Describe a change in soil/land after disturbance\n- [ ] Use vocabulary (soil, erosion, or landform)\n- [ ] Explain why a barrier helps protect soil\n- [ ] Make a connection to the farm photograph\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding if they can:\n  - Describe soil as a material made of small pieces.\n  - Identify that the tractor and water changed the shape of the land.\n  - Recognize that barriers slow erosion.\n  - Draw or explain the difference between disturbed and undisturbed soil.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students can draw or describe soil change.\n- Students can answer at least 2 of 3 exit ticket questions correctly.\n- Students show awareness that land can be changed by human activity or water.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Provide a \"Soil Detective\" picture guide:**\n   - Before the lesson, create a visual guide showing: soil before/after, wet/dry soil, and soil with barriers.\n   - Point to images during the lesson to scaffold vocabulary and observation.\n\n2. **Use a partner model:**\n   - Pair students with stronger observers; assign one child as \"looker\" and one as \"recorder.\"\n   - Rotate roles so all students participate fully.\n\n3. **Simplify recording sheets:**\n   - Instead of writing, provide three pre-drawn pictures students can point to or circle (soil flat / soil bumpy / soil spread out).\n   - Allow drawing only, no writing required.\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extend the Elaborate phase:**\n   - Ask: \"What other things could protect soil besides fences? Could grass? Rocks? Logs?\" Have students test multiple barriers and compare results systematically.\n   - Challenge: \"Why do you think plants are better at protecting soil than just rocks?\"\n\n2. **Introduce the water cycle connection:**\n   - Ask: \"Where does the water go after it hits the soil? Does it soak in or run off?\" \n   - Connect to 2-ESS2-3: Discuss that water can be on land and in soil, and where water goes matters for erosion.\n\n3. **Real-world application research:**\n   - Provide pictures of different farming techniques (terracing, contour plowing, cover crops).\n   - Ask: \"What are farmers trying to do with these different methods?\" Encourage students to propose which method protects soil best and why.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Raindrop Race: Erosion Investigation**\n   - Create two trays: one bare soil, one with grass or moss planted.\n   - Gently drop water droplets from the same height on both.\n   - Observe where the water goes and how much soil moves.\n   - Discussion: \"Does grass help? Why might a real farmer plant grass between crops?\"\n\n2. **Build Your Own Farm Model**\n   - Provide a large shallow box, soil, toy fences, trees, tractors, and water.\n   - Students design their own farm, including erosion protection.\n   - Challenge: \"Explain why you placed the fence or trees where you did.\"\n   - Display as a class gallery walk.\n\n3. **Farmer Interview or Farm Visit**\n   - Invite a local farmer to visit or show a recorded interview (many farming extension offices have videos).\n   - Students prepare 2–3 questions: \"Why do you move the soil? How do you keep it from washing away? What does soil need for plants?\"\n   - Follow-up: Students draw or write one thing they learned about real farming.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n**Safety Reminders:**\n- Ensure students wash hands after handling soil.\n- Use potting soil or garden soil (not dirt from playgrounds, which may contain contaminants).\n- Supervise water use to prevent spills; have paper towels ready.\n\n**Materials Sourcing:**\n- Shallow plastic trays (dollar stores, cafeteria supply, or Amazon).\n- Toy tractors (dollar stores, or borrow from students).\n- Potting soil (hardware stores, usually inexpensive).\n- Magnifying glasses (classroom collections or dollar stores).\n\n**Timing Notes:**\n- This lesson can be split into two sessions: Session 1 (Engage + Explore) and Session 2 (Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate).\n- If time is limited, skip the full Elaborate water test and instead show a short teacher demo.\n\n**Connection to NGSS:**\n- **2-ESS2-1** is met through comparing undisturbed soil vs. soil with barriers (slow erosion).\n- **2-ESS2-2** is met through students modeling landform changes in trays and drawing before/after comparisons.\n- The lesson naturally introduces concepts from **2-ESS2-3** (water's role in erosion), which can be expanded in follow-up lessons.",
