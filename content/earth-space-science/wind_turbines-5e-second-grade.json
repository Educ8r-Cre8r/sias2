ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about wind and movement.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Wind turbine photograph (displayed on screen or printed for small group viewing)\n- Lightweight paper strips or ribbon (one per student)\n- Open space or fan to create breeze\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display & Introduce:** Show the wind turbine photograph. Ask students to sit in a circle and observe quietly for 20 seconds.\n\n2. **Hands-On Wonder:** Give each student a paper strip or ribbon. Ask them to hold it up and wave it gently, then observe what happens. Ask: \"What made the paper move?\"\n\n3. **Guided Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this big picture? What are those tall white structures?\"\n   - \"Do you see anything moving or spinning in the picture? What might be making it move?\"\n   - \"Have you ever felt wind push on you? What does wind feel like?\"\n   - \"What could we use wind for? Can wind help us do work?\"\n\n4. **Prediction & Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder if we could use wind to make something spin like a top. Turn and tell a partner: What would happen if we pointed a giant fan at a spinning wheel?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's investigate how wind moves things and discover how people use wind to create energy for our homes and schools.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how wind moves objects through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Paper cups or small plastic containers\n- Plastic straws or wooden skewers\n- Tape (masking or clear)\n- Paper cutouts (pre-cut pinwheel shapes or simple fan blades from construction paper)\n- Pencils or wooden dowels for spinning\n- Fan (classroom or personal fan) or students' own breath\n- Observation sheet with simple drawings (wind spinner diagram with blanks to fill)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set-Up:** Distribute materials. Show students a pre-made simple spinner/pinwheel as a reference model (but don't explain how it works yet). Hold it and let wind from the fan spin it.\n\n2. **Student Investigation Directions:**\n   - \"We're going to make a wind spinner that spins when air moves it.\"\n   - Step 1: Tape one paper blade to the straw or skewer so it sticks out from the center.\n   - Step 2: Hold the straw upright in your hand (or poke it into a cup so it stands up).\n   - Step 3: Ask a partner to gently blow on the blade or use the fan to move air toward it. What happens?\"\n   - Step 4: Blow harder. Does it spin faster? Try blowing from different directions.\"\n   - Step 5: Draw or write on your observation sheet: \"When I blow gently, the blade moves ___. When I blow hard, the blade moves ___.\"\n\n3. **Connection to Photograph:** \"The big white turbines in the picture work just like your spinner! Instead of your breath, giant turbines use wind from the sky to make the blades spin. The spinning makes electricity for homes and schools.\"\n\n4. **Recording:** Students draw or write: \"Wind made my spinner turn. Stronger wind made it spin faster/slower. The turbine in the picture probably spins in strong winds.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"What happens when you change how hard you blow?\" and \"Can you make it spin faster?\"\n- Encourage students to experiment with direction and force.\n- Model blowing at different speeds so students understand the connection.\n- Do NOT explain the energy conversion yet—let them observe the movement.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that moving air (wind/breath) causes objects to spin.\n- Students will recognize that stronger force creates faster spinning.\n- Students will begin to connect their spinner to the wind turbines in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts to explain what students observed.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Wind turbine photograph\n- Simple diagram showing: Wind → Blades Spin → Electricity Created (with pictures)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Vocabulary anchor chart (with pictures)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to show their spinners and demonstrate what happened.\n   - Ask: \"What made your spinner move? Could you control how fast it spun?\"\n   - Record student observations on chart paper: \"Wind is air that moves. Wind can push and move things.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   Create and post an anchor chart with these terms and simple illustrations:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Wind:** Moving air that we cannot see but can feel and that pushes objects.\n   - **Energy:** The power to make things move or work. Wind has energy we can use.\n   - **Turbine:** A machine with blades that spin when wind pushes them. Turbines use wind's energy to make electricity.\n   - **Electricity:** A type of energy that powers lights, computers, and things in our homes and schools.\n   - **Renewable Energy:** Energy that comes from natural things that don't run out, like wind and sun.\n\n3. **Connect to Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"Look at these turbines. They have three huge blades, just like your spinners. Wind from the sky pushes the blades and makes them spin in circles. When the blades spin very fast, the turbine creates electricity.\"\n   - Ask: \"What else do you notice about the turbines?\" (They're tall, they spin, there are many of them, power lines connect them.)\n   - Explain: \"Turbines are placed in windy areas where lots of wind blows. The stronger and more often the wind blows, the more electricity the turbine can make.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individually: \"What makes the turbine blades spin?\" (Wind)\n   - \"What does the spinning turbine create?\" (Electricity)\n   - Show your own spinner and ask: \"Is this like a real turbine? How is it the same? How is it different?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the parts of a turbine (blades, tower).\n- Students understand that wind pushes blades to make them spin.\n- Students know that spinning blades create electricity.\n- Students recognize that wind is a natural energy source.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing improvements and exploring real-world applications.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original spinner materials plus extras (different blade shapes, sizes, materials)\n- Paper, markers, colored pencils\n- Picture cards showing wind turbine farms, locations where turbines are built\n- Optional: Videos of real wind farms (30-second clip, 2-3 minutes max)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Design Challenge (10 minutes):**\n   - Pose the challenge: \"Wind turbines need to spin as fast as possible to make lots of electricity. Your job is to test different blade designs to see which one spins fastest in the wind.\"\n   - Provide options: Students can keep their original blade OR design a new blade shape using materials provided (wider blade, curved blade, longer blade, different materials).\n   - Students make ONE change to their spinner and test it with the fan or by blowing.\n   - Ask: \"Did your new blade spin faster, slower, or the same? Why do you think that happened?\"\n\n2. **Real-World Connection (5 minutes):**\n   - Show images or short video of a wind farm: multiple turbines working together in a windy location.\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think people build many turbines together? Where might wind be very strong?\" (Hills, open fields, near oceans, plains)\n   - Explain: \"Wind farms help give electricity to cities and towns. Wind energy is clean—it doesn't make pollution like some other ways we make energy.\"\n\n3. **Creative Response:**\n   - Students draw or write: \"My turbine design was successful because ___\" or \"I would build wind turbines in ___ because wind is strong there.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the design testing; ask open-ended questions: \"What changed? What stayed the same?\"\n- Validate all designs; discuss why different shapes might work in different conditions.\n- Connect student observations to real turbine engineering (without jargon).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students test a hypothesis about blade design and observe results.\n- Students understand that turbines are designed to maximize spinning in wind.\n- Students recognize wind energy as a practical, clean solution for powering communities.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of wind energy and turbine function.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n   - Observe during Explore: Do students correctly operate their spinners? Do they recognize cause and effect (wind → spinning)?\n   - Listen during Explain: Can students use vocabulary appropriately (wind, turbine, energy)?\n   - Monitor during Elaborate: Do students make logical predictions about blade design?\n\n2. **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (Provide one of the following at end of Day 2):**\n\n   **Option A (Drawing + Label):**\n   - Provide a simple outline drawing of a wind turbine.\n   - Students label: wind, blades, tower, electricity.\n   - Ask: \"Draw an arrow showing how wind moves the blades.\"\n\n   **Option B (Short Response):**\n   - \"What makes a wind turbine spin?\" (Accept: wind, moving air, breeze)\n   - \"What does a spinning turbine make?\" (Accept: electricity, power, energy)\n   - \"Why would a farmer build turbines in a big, open field?\" (Accept: more wind, wind blows harder, blades can spin more)\n\n   **Option C (Demonstration):**\n   - Student spins their turbine or shows the classroom fan spinning it.\n   - Student explains: \"Wind (or moving air) pushes the blades and makes them spin. This creates electricity.\"\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n   ✓ Student can identify wind as the force that moves turbine blades.\n   ✓ Student can describe that spinning blades create electricity.\n   ✓ Student recognizes turbines in windy locations make more energy.\n   ✓ Student can use the word \"turbine\" correctly in a sentence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- All students can explain in simple terms that wind pushes turbine blades.\n- Most students can describe turbines as tools that turn wind energy into electricity.\n- Students demonstrate understanding through models, drawings, or explanations.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Spinner Model:** Pre-assemble partial spinners (blade already attached) so students focus on observing and testing rather than construction. Provide a visual step-by-step card with pictures for reference.\n\n2. **Structured Observation Sheet:** Provide a fill-in-the-blank observation sheet with sentence frames:\n   - \"I blow gently, and the blade spins ___.\"\n   - \"I blow hard, and the blade spins ___.\"\n   - \"Wind comes from the ___.\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary Support:** Use picture cards for vocabulary terms (wind, turbine, electricity). Display these prominently and reference them repeatedly. Pair words with gestures (blow for wind, spinning motion for turbine).\n\n4. **One-on-One Check-In:** During Explain phase, meet briefly with struggling students to confirm they understand: \"Wind pushes the blades → Blades spin → Electricity is made.\"\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Advanced Design Engineering:** Challenge students to design and test TWO different blade shapes and compare results with data. Ask: \"Which design made the turbine spin faster? Why do you think so? If you were an engineer, which would you choose and why?\"\n\n2. **Wind Farm Planning:** Provide a simple map of a region (with terrain features: plains, hills, forests, ocean, city). Ask: \"Where would you place wind turbines to catch the most wind? Mark the best locations and explain your choices.\"\n\n3. **Energy Connections:** Ask students to research or discuss: \"What does electricity power in your home? How does wind turbine energy get to your house?\" (Connect to power lines in the photograph.) Create a simple diagram of the path: Turbine → Wires → Homes.\n\n4. **Alternative Energy Comparison:** Introduce the concept that wind is ONE way to make electricity. Ask: \"What are other ways we make electricity? How is wind energy different from using coal or oil?\" (Simple version: wind doesn't make pollution, wind is natural and won't run out.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Wind Speed Investigation (Homework or Follow-Up):**\n   - Send students home with a \"wind journal.\" Over 3-5 days, they observe and record when they feel wind (morning, afternoon, windy day, calm day). They draw or describe the wind's effect (leaves moving, flag flying, dust blowing, puddles rippling). Bring back observations and graph: \"Windy Days\" vs. \"Calm Days.\" Discuss: \"When would turbines make the most electricity?\"\n\n2. **Build a Wind Farm Model:**\n   - Using paper cups, straws, and tape, students work in small groups to create a wind farm with 5-6 spinners arranged in an open area. Test with a fan to see which positions spin best. Discuss: \"How should turbines be spaced? Does one turbine block wind from another?\" This connects to real wind farm design.\n\n3. **Community Energy Audit:**\n   - As a class project, research whether your area uses wind energy. Contact your local power company or search online: \"Does our town use wind turbines?\" Create a class poster showing: \"Energy Sources in Our Community\" (wind, solar, coal, natural gas). Discuss which sources are renewable and why wind energy is important. Invite a local utility representative or show a virtual tour of a regional wind farm (YouTube has excellent 2-5 minute videos for kids).\n\n---",
