Discovering Earth's Building Blocks**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 40-minute sessions (approximately 80 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - *1-ESS1-1* is not the best fit for this photograph\n  - *1-ESS1-2* does not directly apply\n  - **Note:** This lesson addresses First Grade Earth Science concepts foundational to later standards, focusing on observable properties of Earth materials (rocks, soil, weathering) which support the framework for Earth and Space Science inquiry\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Observe and describe** the physical properties of rocks (size, shape, color, texture)\n2. **Identify rocks as natural materials** that come from Earth and are used by people to build things\n3. **Demonstrate understanding** that rocks can be stacked and arranged to create structures and landforms\n4. **Explain** that rocks weather and break into smaller pieces over time through weather and movement\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity about rocks and structures by connecting them to the stunning rock pile in the photograph.\n\n#### Materials\n- Printed color copy or digital projection of the photograph (IMG_4086.jpeg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Small hand-sized rocks (5-6) in a basket\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display the Photograph:**\nProject the image on the screen or display a large printed version where all students can see clearly. Point to the tall stack of rocks in the center of the image.\n\n**Guiding Discussion Questions** (Ask in sequence, pausing for student responses):\n\n1. \"What do you see stacked up in this picture? What is it made of?\" *(Accept \"rocks,\" \"stones,\" \"piles\")*\n2. \"Why do you think someone stacked all these rocks so high? What could they be making?\" *(Accept predictions: \"a wall,\" \"a house,\" \"art,\" \"a mountain\")*\n3. \"Look at the rocks closely. Are they all the same color? Are they smooth or bumpy? What do you notice?\" *(Guide observation toward texture, shape, size)*\n4. \"Have you ever found a rock or held one? What was it like?\" *(Connect to personal experience)*\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n\"I'm wondering... what would happen if we tried to build our own rock stack? What do you think would be tricky? What would make it easier?\"\n\nWrite student ideas on chart paper titled \"What We Wonder About Rocks.\"\n\n#### Transition\n\"Today, we're going to become rock explorers! We'll collect rocks, study them up close, and try to stack them just like in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents investigate rocks through hands-on exploration and discover their properties and uses.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Per student or pair:**\n  - Hand magnifiers or simple plastic magnifying glasses\n  - 6-8 rocks of varying sizes (collected ahead of time or provided)\n  - Small paper bags or containers\n  - White drawing paper\n  - Colored pencils or crayons\n  - Tape or glue stick\n\n- **For class rock-building station:**\n  - 30-40 rocks of mixed sizes and weights (can be collected from school grounds)\n  - Shallow tray or board as a base\n  - Paper towels for cleanup\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Part 1: Close Observation of Rocks (10 minutes)**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. \"Pick up one rock. Feel it in your hands. Is it smooth? Bumpy? Rough? Warm or cool?\"\n2. \"Look at it with the magnifier. What colors do you see? Can you see tiny sparkles or stripes?\"\n3. \"Compare it to another rock. How are they different? Which is bigger? Which is smoother?\"\n4. \"Choose your favorite rock. Draw it on your paper and color it to match what you see.\"\n\n**Documentation:**\nStudents draw their rock and label it with 1-2 descriptive words (with teacher help): *smooth*, *bumpy*, *big*, *red*, *gray*, etc.\n\n**Part 2: Rock Stacking Challenge (12 minutes)**\n\n**Setup:** Gather students around the rock-building station. Place rocks, a tray, and paper towels in a central location.\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. \"We're going to try to stack rocks like the picture. Take turns placing one rock at a time.\"\n2. \"Try to make it as tall as you can without it falling.\"\n3. \"What happens when you add a heavy rock on top of a small rock?\"\n4. \"What happens if the rocks are not balanced?\"\n5. \"Notice which rocks work best at the bottom. Which rocks work at the top?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- **Do not give away solutions.** If a stack falls, ask: \"What happened? What could you try differently?\"\n- Encourage observation: \"Notice which rocks tumbled down. Why do you think that one fell?\"\n- Ask open questions: \"What shape rock works best on top?\"\n- Have students predict before placing each rock: \"Will this work? Why or why not?\"\n- Provide encouragement for persistence, not just success\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students discover that **flat, stable rocks work better at the base**\n- Students observe that **rocks are hard and don't break when moved** (unless deliberately struck)\n- Students realize that **balance and structure matter** when stacking\n- Students create mental models of how objects can be arranged to make structures\n- Drawings show individual rock characteristics and descriptions\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nFormalize observations with vocabulary and connect exploration to Earth science concepts.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- \"Rock Properties\" poster (teacher-made or printed)\n- Rock samples on a display table\n- Colored chart paper with vocabulary words\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n\nGather students in a circle. Ask:\n- \"What did you notice about the rocks when you held them?\"\n- \"What was easy about stacking rocks? What was hard?\"\n- \"What made a good stack stay up?\"\n\nRecord student observations on chart paper using simple sentences: *\"Flat rocks are better at the bottom.\" \"Heavy rocks squish light rocks.\" \"Bumpy rocks don't stack as well.\"*\n\n**Teacher-Led Instruction (8 minutes):**\n\nIntroduce vocabulary with concrete examples:\n\n| **Vocabulary** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Example from Activity** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Rock** | A hard, natural material that comes from Earth. Rocks don't break easily. | The rocks you stacked and drew |\n| **Properties** | Special things about an object—like color, shape, size, or how it feels. | Your rock was smooth OR bumpy, big OR small, gray OR red |\n| **Texture** | How something feels when you touch it. Rough, smooth, bumpy. | Feeling the rocks in your hands |\n| **Weathering** | When rocks slowly break into smaller pieces because of wind, water, rain, and time. | Old rocks that look worn down |\n| **Landform** | A shape of land made by rocks and soil, like a hill or mountain. | The tall rock pile in the picture is like a small mountain |\n\n**Connection Back to Photograph (5 minutes):**\n\nPoint to the image and say:\n- \"This pile of rocks is a **landform**. Someone stacked these **rocks** to make a **structure**.\"\n- \"Look at each **rock's properties**—some are big, some are small. Some have rough **texture**, some are smoother.\"\n- \"Do you see moss on some rocks? That's a sign of **weathering**—the rocks are slowly wearing down from rain and air over time.\"\n- \"Long ago, these rocks were probably broken into pieces by weathering. Then someone collected them and made this beautiful stack.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n\nAsk students to show with thumbs (up/sideways/down):\n- \"A rock is something hard that comes from Earth.\" ✓\n- \"Rocks all feel the same and look the same.\" (should be down)\n- \"Weathering is when rocks slowly break apart over time.\" ✓\n\n#### Vocabulary Summary\n\nWrite these on colorful cards and display throughout the lesson:\n\n1. **Rock** — A hard, natural thing from Earth\n2. **Properties** — Special things about something (how it looks, feels, size, color)\n3. **Texture** — How something feels (smooth, bumpy, rough)\n4. **Weathering** — When rocks break into smaller pieces slowly over time\n5. **Landform** — A shape of land made of rocks and soil (like a hill or mountain)\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n\n- Students use the word \"rock\" and 2-3 property words correctly\n- Students can point to examples of weathering or texture in the classroom or photograph\n- Students understand that rocks are natural Earth materials with different properties\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nApply rock knowledge to a new, real-world context: designing a rock garden or structure.\n\n#### Materials\n- Small pots or paper cups (6-8)\n- Pebbles and small rocks\n- Soil or sand\n- Small plants or plastic plants (optional)\n- Design paper (8.5\" x 11\")\n- Colored pencils\n- Real or printed images of rock gardens, pathways, or structures\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Introduction (2 minutes):**\n\nShow students real or printed images of:\n- A rock garden or zen garden\n- A rock pathway\n- A decorative rock arrangement\n- A rock wall or fence\n\nSay: \"People use rocks to make beautiful things! Today, you're going to design your own rock structure or garden.\"\n\n**Design Phase (8 minutes):**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n1. \"Think about what you want to make with rocks. A garden? A path? A tower? A picture?\"\n2. \"Draw your design on this paper. Show where you'll put rocks. What color will they be? What shape?\"\n3. \"Think about what you learned. Will you use big rocks on the bottom? Small rocks on top?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Why did you choose that spot for that rock?\" or \"What properties of rocks did you use in your design?\"\n- Encourage students to explain their thinking\n- Help students think about balance: \"Would these rocks stack well? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Building Phase (8 minutes):**\n\nProvide materials for students to build a small version:\n- Provide pots/containers and rocks\n- Students arrange rocks in their pot or on paper\n- They can add sand, soil, or a small plant\n- Optional: They create a small rock pathway using pebbles in a shallow tray\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Design showing intentional placement of rocks with size/color variety\n- A constructed mini rock garden or structure showing understanding of balance\n- Ability to explain: \"I put big rocks here because...\" or \"This rock is smooth, so...\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of rock properties, uses, and Earth science concepts.\n\n#### Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson)\n\n**Observation Checklist** (Teacher uses during Explore and Elaborate):\n\n| Behavior | Yes | Somewhat | No |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Student handles rocks and describes properties (color, texture, size) |   |   |   |\n| Student uses vocabulary: rock, property, texture, weathering |   |   |   |\n| Student demonstrates understanding that rocks are natural Earth materials |   |   |   |\n| Student shows awareness of balance/stability when stacking |   |   |   |\n\n**Questioning for Formative Feedback** (during all phases):\n- \"Tell me about this rock. What do you notice?\" (Listen for property words)\n- \"Why did you put that rock there?\" (Listen for reasoning about structure/balance)\n- \"What happened when the stack fell?\" (Listen for cause-and-effect thinking)\n\n#### Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes)\n\n**Administer at end of Session 2:**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal for students who need support):\n\n**Question 1 (Draw/Point):** \"Show me a rock from our collection. Tell me two things about it.\" \n- Success: Student identifies a rock and names at least one property (color, texture, size, or shape)\n\n**Question 2 (Verbal or Picture):** \"What is one way people use rocks?\"\n- Success: Student mentions building, stacking, making gardens, making pathways, or decorating\n\n**Question 3 (Verbal):** \"What makes rocks good for building? What have you learned?\"\n- Success: Student mentions at least one of: rocks are hard, rocks don't break easily, rocks can be stacked, flat rocks work better, heavy rocks go on bottom\n\n#### Alternative Summative Assessment (Photo Documentation)\n\nIf time is limited, use photography:\n- Take photos of each student's design and rock structure\n- Include student explaining their work in 1-2 sentences\n- Use this documentation to assess learning\n\n#### Success Criteria\n\n**Students have met the learning objectives if they can:**\n\n✓ **Observe and name** at least 2 properties of a rock (color, size, texture, shape)\n\n✓ **Identify rocks** as natural Earth materials\n\n✓ **Demonstrate** understanding through their stacking/structure (shows awareness of balance, size, or arrangement)\n\n✓ **Explain** (in simple words) one reason rocks are useful or one thing they learned about rocks\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-teach Vocabulary with Visuals**\n   - Before the lesson, introduce rock vocabulary using real rocks and picture cards\n   - Create a \"Rock Word Wall\" with photos of each vocabulary word (rough texture, smooth texture, big rock, small rock)\n   - During Explain phase, have these visuals available for reference\n\n2. **Guided Rock Observation**\n   - Pair struggling students with a peer or provide 1:1 teacher support during Explore\n   - Use a \"Rock Observation Sheet\" with prompts and pictures: \"This rock is ___ (color). It feels ___. It is ___ (size).\"\n   - Provide only 3-4 rocks instead of 8 to reduce overwhelm\n\n3. **Simplified Stacking Activity**\n   - Provide larger, flatter rocks that are easier to balance\n   - Allow students to stack just 3-4 rocks instead of building high\n   - Offer a low tray or board so rocks don't fall as far and feel safer\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deep Weathering Investigation**\n   - Provide students with \"before and after\" photos of rocks showing weathering\n   - Ask: \"What do you think happened to this rock? How long did it take?\"\n   - Challenge them to predict: \"If this rock is in the rain for 100 years, what will happen?\"\n   - Have them research and present findings about how rocks change\n\n2. **Architectural Rock Designs**\n   - Ask advanced students to create more complex designs: \"Design a rock wall that won't fall. What's the strongest way to stack rocks?\"\n   - Introduce the concept of **balance and gravity** informally: \"Heavy rocks pull down. Where should we put them?\"\n   - Have them test multiple designs and compare: \"Which design was strongest? Why?\"\n\n3. **Rock Collection Categories**\n   - Provide 15-20 mixed rocks and ask students to sort them by multiple properties: color, texture, size, shape\n   - Create a Rock Classification Poster: \"Our rocks are grouped by ___\"\n   - Challenge: \"Can you group them a different way? Show two different ways to organize them\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Rocks Around Our School\" Nature Walk**\n   - Take students on a guided walk to find rocks in the schoolyard, garden, or playground\n   - Collect 3-5 rocks and bring them back for a class collection\n   - Sort and label them: \"Found by the fence,\" \"Found under the tree,\" \"Found in the garden\"\n   - Create a \"Our School Rocks\" display with student labels describing where each was found\n\n2. **Rock Art and Painting**\n   - Provide smooth, flat rocks and washable paint\n   - Have students paint rocks with designs, patterns, or pictures\n   - Display painted rocks around the school garden or rock structure\n   - Write student names and a one-sentence \"Rock Story\" card: \"My rock is blue and has a sun painted on it. I found it under the big tree.\"\n\n3. **Weathering Experiment (Extended Observation)**\n   - Place rocks in a container with water and shake it daily for a week\n   - Have students observe and record: \"Do the rocks look different? What changed?\"\n   - Conclusion: \"This shows that water and movement can change rocks slowly over time—this is like weathering!\"\n   - Create a \"Rock Change Chart\" showing before/after observations\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure all rocks are free of sharp edges. Supervise stacking activities to prevent pinched fingers or falling rocks.\n- **Sourcing Rocks:** Collect rocks from school grounds, local parks, or garden supply stores ahead of time. Wash and sort by size before the lesson.\n- **Photography:** Document students' work with photos for portfolios and to show families what students learned.\n- **Connection to Later Learning:** This lesson builds foundation for Grade 2-3 studies of weathering, erosion, and how Earth changes over time.",
