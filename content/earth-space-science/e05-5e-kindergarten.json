Exploring Lichens and Moss\n\n---\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Weathering and Change:** Rocks are not unchanging; they can be broken down and covered by living things over time, demonstrating how Earth's surface changes.\n- **Living Things and Habitats:** Lichens and moss thrive in specific environmental conditions (moisture, shade, cool temperatures), showing how organisms adapt to where they live.\n- **Natural Materials and Resources:** Rocks are natural materials found in the local environment that support life and are shaped by weather and organisms.\n- **Observation of Local Environment:** The forest floor is a place where students can observe rocks, plants, and the interactions between them in their own community.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Fuzzy Rocks: What Grows on Stones?**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 30-minute sessions (60 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - K-ESS2-2 (how plants/organisms can change their environment and rocks)\n  - K-ESS3-1 (relationship between organisms and the places they live)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Observe and describe the fuzzy living things (moss and lichen) that grow on rocks.\n2. Identify that rocks in nature can be home to plants and other living things.\n3. Explain that rocks in wet, shady places are more likely to have moss and lichen growing on them.\n4. Predict where they might find fuzzy rocks in their own neighborhood or schoolyard.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about the fuzzy, colorful growth on rocks and activate prior knowledge about rocks and living things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the moss and lichen-covered rock (displayed on a screen, printed large, or on a document camera)\n- Real moss or lichen sample in a clear container (if available from outdoors)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Show the image to students and let them look quietly for 15-20 seconds.\n\n2. **Invite Wonder:** Say: \"Look closely at this rock. Something interesting is happening to it! What do you notice? What do you wonder?\"\n\n3. **Guided Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"Is this rock smooth like rocks we've seen before, or does it look different? What makes it different?\"\n   - \"Do you see anything green or white on the rock? What might that be?\"\n   - \"This fuzzy, colorful stuff—do you think it's alive or not alive? Why do you think that?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this fuzzy stuff is only on some parts of the rock and not all over?\"\n\n4. **Make a Prediction:** Ask students: \"If we had a rock like this at our school, where would we find it—in a sunny spot or in a shady spot? Why?\" Record responses on chart paper.\n\n5. **Sensory Hook:** If you have a real moss or lichen sample, pass it around in a clear container and let students describe how it looks and feels. (Do not let them touch live moss if it's wet—explain it's too delicate.)\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become rock scientists! We're going to look for fuzzy rocks outside and discover what makes rocks a home for these special living things.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rocks in their local environment and discover where moss and lichen grow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clipboards or hardboard with paper clipped on (one per student or pair)\n- Pencils and crayons\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but recommended)\n- A shaded outdoor area with rocks (schoolyard, garden, or nearby green space)\n- **Simple observation sheet** (pre-drawn or prepared):\n  - Two columns: one labeled \"Rocks with fuzzy stuff\" and one labeled \"Rocks without fuzzy stuff\"\n  - Space for drawing or marking with tally marks\n- Notebook or whiteboard for teacher notes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set Expectations:** Before going outside, explain: \"We're going to be rock detectives. We'll look for rocks and see which ones have fuzzy green or white stuff on them. We'll draw what we see.\"\n\n2. **Outdoor Investigation:**\n   - Take students to a shaded, damp area of the schoolyard or nearby garden where rocks or logs are visible.\n   - Ask them to walk slowly and look for rocks.\n   - When they find a rock, have them stop and observe: Is there fuzzy stuff on it? What color is it? Is it on the top, bottom, or sides?\n   - Students record by drawing a simple picture or marking a tally on their observation sheet.\n   - Encourage them to use magnifying glasses to see details up close.\n\n3. **Guiding Questions During Exploration:**\n   - \"Is this rock wet or dry?\"\n   - \"Is it in the sun or in shade?\"\n   - \"Do you see fuzzy stuff here? Where exactly?\"\n   - \"What do you think the fuzzy stuff needs to grow here?\"\n\n4. **Document Observations:**\n   - Students draw or mark their findings on the observation sheet.\n   - Teacher circulates and asks follow-up questions without correcting; simply record what students say verbatim.\n\n5. **Return Indoors:** Gather students and bring observation sheets back to the classroom.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Ask open-ended questions (\"What do you notice?\" rather than \"Do you see moss?\").\n- Observe where students are looking (sunny vs. shady spots) and guide them to multiple locations.\n- Encourage careful observation without providing answers.\n- Record student language and observations for use in the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that fuzzy growth (moss and lichen) appears more often on rocks in shaded, damp places.\n- Students create drawings or tallies showing rocks with and without fuzzy coverings.\n- Students begin to notice patterns (e.g., \"The fuzzy stuff is under trees\" or \"The wet rocks have more fuzz\").\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect observations to formal science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms and simple images\n- Optional: A small real moss or lichen specimen for demonstration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Out from Exploration:**\n   - Ask 4-5 students: \"What did you find? Show us your drawing. Where did you find fuzzy rocks?\" (Accept all accurate observations.)\n   - Mark patterns on the chart: \"Many of you found fuzzy rocks in the shade. Some of you found them on damp rocks. That's good noticing!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (with simple definitions and pictures):**\n\n   - **Moss:** A tiny green plant without roots or flowers that likes wet, shady places. It's soft and fuzzy.\n   - **Lichen (LY-kun):** A living thing that grows on rocks and looks crusty or bumpy—it's partly a plant and partly a fungus working together.\n   - **Rock:** A hard, solid piece of Earth made of minerals. Rocks are home to many living things!\n   - **Weather:** The temperature, rain, wind, and sun outside. Wet, shady weather helps moss and lichen grow.\n   - **Habitat:** A home for plants and animals—the place where they live and have what they need.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Display the original photo again. Point to different parts: \"Here's moss—see the soft, bright green? And here's lichen—see the crusty white and gray parts? This rock is their home!\"\n   - Explain: \"Rocks aren't just hard things on the ground. They're homes for moss and lichen. These fuzzy living things need water and shade, so they grow on rocks under trees where it's damp and cool.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Is moss alive or not alive?\" (alive—it grows and changes)\n   - Ask: \"Where do we find the most moss and lichen—in sunny spots or shady spots?\" (shady spots)\n   - Ask a student to point to moss and lichen in the photograph and name them.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Moss** | A tiny green fuzzy plant that grows on rocks and wet places. It has no roots. |\n| **Lichen** | A bumpy or crusty living thing that grows on rocks. It likes cool, damp places. |\n| **Rock** | A hard piece of Earth. Rocks can be a home for moss and lichen. |\n| **Habitat** | A home where plants and animals live and find what they need (water, shade, food). |\n| **Weather** | How hot or cold it is, and if it's rainy, sunny, or cloudy. Weather affects where things grow. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name moss and lichen and describe where they grow.\n- Students understand that rocks are habitats—homes for living things.\n- Students make the connection between wet, shady conditions and fuzzy rock growth.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to a new scenario and deepen thinking about organisms and their habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos of different outdoor locations (sunny meadow, shaded forest, wet creek area, dry desert, etc.)—can be drawn by teacher or printed\n- Real rocks or stone tiles (one per pair)\n- Water spray bottle\n- Optional: small containers of moss or lichen (if available)\n- Chart paper: \"Where Would Moss and Lichen Grow Best?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario-Based Thinking:**\n   - Show pictures of different places (sunny field, dark forest, desert, under a bridge, etc.).\n   - Ask: \"If we put a rock in the sunny field, would moss grow on it? Why or why not?\"\n   - Ask: \"If we put a rock in the dark, wet forest, what might happen?\"\n   - Students discuss in pairs or small groups.\n\n2. **Hands-On Rock Prediction Activity:**\n   - Give pairs a rock or tile.\n   - Ask them to predict: \"This rock will be home to moss and lichen if we put it in a [shady/wet/dark] place.\"\n   - Have them spray the rock lightly with water (to simulate damp conditions).\n   - Show them a moss or lichen sample and ask: \"Would it like to live here now? Why?\"\n\n3. **Create a Class Habitat Map:**\n   - Ask: \"Where on our schoolyard would be the BEST place to find fuzzy rocks?\"\n   - Students point to or describe locations (near the woods, under bushes, by the drain, in shade of the building).\n   - Draw a simple map together and mark these spots.\n   - Explain: \"Moss and lichen are like us—they need the right home. They need shade and water!\"\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - Ask: \"If you see fuzzy rocks at your house or in your neighborhood, where are they usually? Can you tell your family about it?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide thinking without leading to one \"right\" answer.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"What does moss need to be happy?\" \"Where is it cooler and wetter?\"\n- Celebrate observations that show pattern recognition.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students predict where moss and lichen are likely to grow based on conditions (shade, moisture).\n- Students articulate a simple understanding: \"Fuzzy rocks like wet, shady places.\"\n- Students begin to see that organisms have preferred habitats.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students met the learning objectives and understand basic concepts about organisms and habitats.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during Engage discussion questions.\n- Review observation sheets from Explore phase for evidence of noticing patterns.\n- Listen to student explanations during Explain and Elaborate phases.\n- Check for understanding using the questions listed in the Explain section.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson):**\n\nUse one or more of the following:\n\n1. **Picture Sort (Kinesthetic):**\n   - Show students 4 pictures: a shady rock with moss, a sunny dry rock, a wet log with lichen, a desert rock.\n   - Ask: \"Point to the place where fuzzy moss would grow. Why there?\"\n   - Students point and respond with one or two words or a short sentence.\n\n2. **Simple Verbal Assessment:**\n   - Ask each student individually: \"Where do we find moss and lichen—on rocks in the sun or rocks in the shade?\"\n   - Follow-up: \"Why does moss like shade?\"\n\n3. **Draw and Label:**\n   - Provide a simple worksheet: \"Draw a rock with moss on it. Show whether it's in sun or shade.\"\n   - Students draw and you observe whether they place fuzzy growth on a shaded rock.\n\n4. **Observation-Based Check:**\n   - Ask: \"If I found a rock outside right now with lots of fuzzy green stuff on it, what can I tell you about that rock?\" (Expected: It's in a shady place, it's wet/damp, etc.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies moss or lichen as living things that grow on rocks.\n- ✓ Student explains that fuzzy growth appears in shaded or damp places.\n- ✓ Student predicts where they might find fuzzy rocks based on conditions.\n- ✓ Student uses observation sheet or drawing to document findings with some accuracy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most students should demonstrate understanding that moss and lichen grow on rocks in damp, shady places.\n- Students should use the vocabulary (moss, lichen, rock, habitat) in context with some prompting.\n- Students should show curiosity about looking for fuzzy rocks in their own environment.\n- Some students may offer emerging explanations linking wetness and shade to growth.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Guided Observation:** Pair a student who needs support with a peer or the teacher during outdoor exploration. Ask simpler questions: \"Do you see green fuzz here? Can you touch it gently?\" Focus on one or two observation spots.\n\n2. **Visual Vocabulary:** Use real moss/lichen samples and the photograph as the primary vocabulary reference. Repeat terms frequently in context (\"This moss is soft.\" \"The lichen likes this damp rock.\") rather than relying on written definitions.\n\n3. **Simplified Recording:** Instead of drawing or tallying, allow students to simply point and say \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to \"Does this rock have fuzzy stuff?\" Teacher records for them.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Prediction and Testing:** Ask: \"If we took a dry rock and made it wet and kept it in the shade, would moss grow on it? How long might it take? What would happen first?\" Encourage them to sketch predictions or dictate ideas for a long-term observation.\n\n2. **Habitat Details:** Challenge students to describe the habitat of moss and lichen using more detail: \"Moss grows on rocks that are [wet/in shade/under trees/near water]. Lichen likes [cool/damp/rocky] places.\" Have them create a more detailed habitat map with multiple conditions.\n\n3. **Compare and Contrast:** Ask: \"How is moss different from lichen? How are they the same?\" Use a simple Venn diagram or two circles (drawn with chalk or paper) and have students suggest differences and similarities.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Long-Term Observation Project:**\n   - Place a rock in a designated shady, damp spot on the schoolyard (against a tree, near a downspout, etc.).\n   - Photograph it weekly or monthly.\n   - Create a simple timeline showing whether moss or lichen begins to grow over the school year.\n   - Display photos in the classroom with labels: \"Week 1,\" \"Month 2,\" etc.\n\n2. **Habitat Walk Around the Neighborhood:**\n   - Send home a simple note (with a photo of moss/lichen) asking families to look for fuzzy rocks during a neighborhood walk.\n   - Children report back with a drawing or verbal description of where they found them.\n   - Create a class chart: \"Fuzzy Rocks in Our Community—Where Are They?\"\n\n3. **Rock and Moss Art / Nature Craft:**\n   - Provide students with small rocks and materials to decorate them (paint, markers—not harming real moss).\n   - Alternative: Create a classroom \"rock garden\" in a shaded corner with collected rocks, and observe whether conditions support moss growth over time.\n   - Have students predict: \"Will moss grow in our classroom rock garden? What does it need that we can give it?\" (water, shade, time)\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Safety:** During outdoor exploration, review expectations about careful observation (looking, not picking; staying with the group; watching for wet surfaces).\n- **Outdoor Prep:** Scout your schoolyard or nearby area beforehand to identify locations with visible moss, lichen, or rocks. Choose a shaded, damp spot if possible.\n- **Time Flexibility:** If outdoor exploration is limited, bring in collected rocks with moss/lichen, or rely heavily on the photograph and a real sample.\n- **Language:** Use consistent language (always call it \"moss\" and \"lichen\") to reinforce vocabulary.\n- **Connection to Standards:** This lesson addresses K-ESS2-2 by showing how living things (moss, lichen) interact with and inhabit non-living things (rocks), and K-ESS3-1 by exploring the relationship between organisms and their habitats.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson grounds abstract ideas in direct observation and allows Kindergarteners to see their local environment as a place of scientific interest and discovery.",
