Discovering Earth's Hidden Treasures in the City**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fourth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - **4-ESS3-1**: Obtain and combine information to describe that energy and fuels are derived from natural resources and their uses affect the environment.\n  - **4-ESS2-2**: Analyze and interpret data from maps to describe patterns of Earth's features.\n  - **4-ESS2-1**: Make observations and/or measurements to provide evidence of the effects of weathering or the rate of erosion by water, ice, wind, or vegetation.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- **Identify and name** at least three natural resources used to construct buildings and infrastructure visible in an urban photograph.\n- **Explain** how natural resources from Earth (like stone, metal, and sand) are used to build human structures.\n- **Describe** how weather and time cause building materials to change, crack, or wear away (weathering).\n- **Propose** at least one way communities can reduce the environmental impact of using Earth's natural resources.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring what buildings are made of and where those materials come from.\n\n**Materials:**\n- City skyline photograph (displayed on projector, interactive board, or printed large-scale)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks or paper for predictions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation before asking questions.\n\n2. **Initiate discussion** with these carefully scaffolded questions:\n   - *\"What do you see in this picture? What are all these tall buildings made of?\"* (Activate observation skills; expect responses like \"metal,\" \"glass,\" \"concrete,\" \"stone\")\n   - *\"Where do you think the materials that make these buildings come from? Do they grow on trees, or do we get them from somewhere else?\"* (Connect to natural resources; guide thinking toward Earth)\n   - *\"If you could look inside the ground under this city, what do you think you might find? What materials might be hiding underground?\"* (Spark curiosity about mining and extraction)\n   - *\"What happens to buildings over a long, long time? Do they always look shiny and new?\"* (Introduce weathering concept)\n\n3. **Prediction prompt**: \"In your notebook, draw and label one building material you think is in this picture, and write or draw where you think it came from.\"\n\n4. **Capture responses** on chart paper under the heading \"Where Do Buildings Come From?\" for reference throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become detectives and discover which treasures from deep inside Earth help build our cities—and we'll find out what happens to these materials over time.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the properties of Earth materials used in building construction and observe how weathering affects them.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Sample natural building materials: small pieces of granite or marble, a steel bolt or nail, a clear glass marble, a small amount of concrete or cement brick (the size of a small stone), a piece of sand in a small container\n- Weathering simulation kit: white vinegar (for acid weathering), water, small paper cups, pipettes or droppers, paper towels\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per student)\n- Data collection sheet (provided below)\n- Outdoors access (optional): real rock or concrete sample to examine for visible weathering\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **Station 1—Observe Materials**: Distribute the building material samples to each group. Using hand lenses, have students examine each material closely.\n   - *What does each material look like up close?*\n   - *Is it smooth or rough? Shiny or dull?*\n   - *Which material do you think comes from deep underground?*\n   - Students record observations on the data sheet (drawings or words).\n\n2. **Station 2—Simulate Weathering**: Introduce the scenario: \"Over many years, rain, sun, and wind affect building materials. Let's see what happens when water and weak acid (like rain) touch these materials.\"\n   - Place a small piece of each material (except glass) in separate cups.\n   - Add a few drops of vinegar (simulating acidic rainwater) and water to each sample.\n   - Observe immediately and again after 5-10 minutes.\n   - *What changed? Did the material get softer, lose color, or produce bubbles?*\n   - Record observations: Which materials changed quickly? Which stayed mostly the same?\n\n3. **Station 3—Weathering Evidence Outdoors** (if time and weather permit):\n   - Take students outside to observe the bridge, building surfaces, or a concrete structure.\n   - Look for signs of weathering: cracks, discoloration, rust, loose pieces, water stains.\n   - Sketch or photograph one example of weathering they find.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: *\"What do you notice? How is this material changing? Why do you think that's happening?\"*\n- Do **not** explain the chemistry; let students describe their own observations.\n- Ensure safety: supervise vinegar use and prevent students from tasting or inhaling materials.\n- Record surprising observations for discussion in the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that different materials respond differently to weathering (some bubble or soften; others remain stable).\n- Students record data (drawings, words, observations) on the data sheet showing before-and-after comparisons.\n- Students develop initial ideas about why some materials last longer than others.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student observations to Earth science concepts about natural resources, weathering, and erosion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper for vocabulary display\n- Photograph displayed again (projected or visible)\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Word cards or visual anchor chart with vocabulary terms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out** (5 minutes):\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share one surprising observation from the Explore phase.\n   - Guide class discussion: *\"How does this help us understand how buildings change over time?\"*\n   - Record key student ideas on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary and concepts** using student-friendly language:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Natural resources**: Materials or energy that come from Earth (like stone, metal, water, or oil) that humans use to make things or provide energy.\n   - **Weathering**: When rocks and building materials slowly break down or change because of rain, wind, sunlight, and temperature changes over time.\n   - **Erosion**: The process of natural materials (like soil or rock) wearing away and being carried to a new location by water, wind, or ice.\n   - **Mining**: Digging deep into Earth to remove rocks, metals, or other valuable materials.\n   - **Extraction**: Taking natural resources out of the ground.\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph**:\n   - *\"This skyline is built from natural resources. The steel in those tall buildings came from mining iron ore deep underground. The glass came from sand found in deserts and on beaches. Even the concrete and stone blocks are made from materials that came from Earth.\"*\n   - Point to visible features: the river (water erosion), the bridge (human engineering using extracted materials), the buildings' varying colors and conditions (some materials weather faster than others).\n   - Show an image or simple diagram of mining, sand extraction, or stone quarrying (optional but recommended).\n\n4. **Check for understanding**:\n   - Ask: *\"If we built a statue from limestone and left it outside for 100 years, what would happen to it? Why?\"* (Students should recognize that weathering would slowly break it down.)\n   - Ask: *\"Where does the metal in a car's frame come from?\" (Students connect concept to familiar context.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define natural resources and weathering in their own words.\n- Students understand that buildings rely on Earth's natural resources.\n- Students recognize that all materials change over time due to weathering.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by analyzing how human choices affect the environment and proposing solutions to reduce resource impact.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Building Material Impact Cards\" (prepared by teacher—see below)\n- Map or diagram showing where different resources are extracted (simple, age-appropriate)\n- Paper and colored pencils for solution sketches\n- Optional: sample recyclable materials (aluminum cans, plastic bottles, scrap metal)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-based challenge:**\n\nPresent this situation: *\"A city wants to build ten new schools. Each school building needs lots of steel, concrete, glass, and stone. But mining and extracting these materials can damage the environment. What are some ways the city could build these schools while using less of Earth's resources and causing less harm?\"*\n\n**Student task:**\n\n1. **In small groups**, distribute \"Building Material Impact Cards\" (teacher-created index cards showing: steel mining requires drilling deep underground and uses lots of energy; concrete production releases harmful gases; glass-making heats sand at very high temperatures using lots of energy; recycling metals saves 95% of the energy used in mining).\n\n2. **Groups discuss**: Based on what each card says, **which material causes the biggest environmental impact?**\n\n3. **Generate solutions**: Have groups brainstorm at least **two ideas** to reduce the impact. Examples:\n   - Use recycled metal and plastic in buildings instead of mining new materials.\n   - Use smaller buildings so less material is needed.\n   - Use materials that grow back (like sustainably harvested wood) alongside mined materials.\n   - Build buildings designed to last longer (less weathering damage = less repair = fewer new materials needed).\n\n4. **Sketch and present**: Each group draws one solution and presents it to the class (1-2 minutes per group).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate brainstorming without judgment; validate all ideas.\n- Ask: *\"How would this solution reduce the impact on Earth?\"*\n- Guide groups to think about energy use, mining damage, and long-term effects.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students propose at least one realistic, actionable solution to reduce resource consumption.\n- Students explain why their solution would help Earth (e.g., \"Recycling uses less energy than mining\").\n- Students demonstrate understanding that human choices affect the environment.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of natural resources, weathering, and environmental impact through both formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **Observe** student responses during Engage and Explain phases (ability to identify natural resources and understand weathering).\n- **Check** data sheets from Explore phase for accurate observations and evidence of understanding material properties.\n- **Listen** to group discussions during Elaborate for evidence of causal thinking (e.g., \"Mining uses energy, which comes from fossil fuels\").\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket** (5-8 minutes, end of Session 2):\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (half-sheet of paper) with the following prompts:\n\n1. **Draw and label** two natural resources used to build the city in the photograph we studied. Write where each one comes from.\n\n2. **Explain** in 2-3 sentences: *\"What is weathering, and how does it change buildings over time?\"*\n\n3. **Circle the best answer**: If a building is made from recycled metal instead of newly mined metal, how does this affect the environment?\n   - A) It damages Earth more.\n   - B) It uses less energy and causes less mining damage.\n   - C) It makes the building weaker.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate proficiency if they:\n- ✓ Correctly identify at least **two natural resources** and explain their Earth origin.\n- ✓ Define **weathering** accurately as the breakdown/change of materials over time.\n- ✓ Propose **at least one environmentally conscious solution** that shows causal reasoning.\n- ✓ Select **correct answer (B)** on the multiple-choice question, showing understanding of recycling's environmental benefit.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets reveal student mastery of NGSS 4-ESS3-1 (natural resources and environmental impact) and 4-ESS2-1 (weathering effects).\n- Teacher notes gaps: students who struggle with weathering concepts or environmental connections for targeted small-group review.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Explore phase**: Provide only **two material samples** (stone and metal) instead of five. Focus observation on one weathering variable (water only, no vinegar).\n\n2. **Vocabulary anchor chart**: Create a visual chart with pictures and simple words for natural resources (iron ore → steel, sand → glass) posted throughout the Explain phase.\n\n3. **Paired exit ticket**: Allow students to respond verbally to a peer or teacher, who records answers, rather than writing independently. Focus on prompts 2 and 3 only (omit drawing).\n\n4. **Guided Elaborate**: Provide **only two pre-printed solution options** (recycling vs. mining; smaller buildings vs. larger buildings) and ask: *\"Which one helps Earth more? Why?\"* instead of open-ended brainstorming.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extend Explore**: Add a **time variable**. Ask: *\"If we let these materials soak in vinegar for 24 hours, will weathering happen faster? Design a hypothesis and prediction.\"* Have students check samples the next day.\n\n2. **Elaborate extension**: Ask advanced groups to **research** one material used in the photograph (e.g., \"Where does the steel in this building come from? What country mines it? How does it get to the construction site?\"). Have them create a simple **resource journey map** (extraction → transport → use).\n\n3. **Real-world analysis**: Provide a **simple data table** showing energy use in mining vs. recycling (e.g., mining steel = 1000 energy units; recycling steel = 50 energy units). Ask: *\"Based on this data, how much energy could the city save if half the new schools used recycled metal?\"* (Develop quantitative reasoning.)\n\n4. **Higher-level exit ticket**: Replace multiple-choice question with open-ended prompt: *\"Imagine you are a city engineer designing a school that will last 200 years. What materials would you choose and why? How would you reduce environmental impact?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Local resource investigation**: Take students on a **walking or virtual tour** of your school or neighborhood to identify building materials and signs of weathering. Create a photo documentation project: *\"Weathering in Our Community—Find It, Photograph It, Describe It.\"* Students record location, material type, and evidence of weathering (cracks, rust, discoloration). Compile into a class book.\n\n2. **Recycling audit and data analysis**: Conduct a **school-wide audit** of recyclable materials (aluminum cans, plastic, metal). Weigh or count materials collected over one week. Calculate how much energy was \"saved\" compared to mining new materials using a provided conversion chart. Create a bar graph or poster: *\"Our School's Environmental Impact.\"* Connect to 4-ESS3-1 (environmental effects of resource use).\n\n3. **Historical landscape comparison**: Use **Google Earth or topographic maps** to compare an urban area's \"before\" (50+ years ago, if available) and \"after\" (current) to show how human development has modified Earth's surface. Ask: *\"What landforms were changed? How did erosion or construction reshape the landscape?\"* Create a Venn diagram comparing natural vs. human-modified features. (Connects to 4-ESS2-2: using maps to describe Earth's features.)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Pre-lesson prep**: Gather building material samples 1-2 weeks in advance. Check local stone suppliers, hardware stores, or your school's maintenance office for spare concrete blocks and metal pieces.\n- **Safety reminders**: Supervise vinegar use (irritant risk). Ensure students wash hands after handling concrete dust.\n- **Photograph engagement**: Print or project the skyline image in multiple locations in your classroom during the unit. Refer back to it frequently to reinforce connections.\n- **Vocabulary retention**: Consider a \"Word Wall\" featuring the five vocabulary terms with pictures and definitions throughout the lesson and into future units.\n- **Community connection**: If possible, invite a local construction worker, engineer, or geologist to discuss resource use in your community—powerful authentic engagement.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson centers students' learning on Earth's natural resources and human impacts, grounded in the observable features of the urban photograph while maintaining rigorous alignment with Grade 4 Earth and Space Science standards.",
