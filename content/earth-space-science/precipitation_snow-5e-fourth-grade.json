Observe and describe what happens to rocks, soil, and buildings when snow accumulates and melts.\n2. Explain how snow and melting ice can change Earth's landscape through weathering and erosion.\n3. Identify ways that heavy snowfall impacts human structures and activity, and propose solutions to reduce these impacts.\n4. Predict how repeated freeze-thaw cycles with snow and ice affect materials over time.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image (photograph of snowing courtyard with brick buildings)\n- Document camera or screen display\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or projector. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking—just observe.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** (one at a time, pausing for responses):\n   - \"What do you see happening in this picture? What's falling from the sky?\"\n   - \"If snow keeps piling up on that brick building and courtyard, what might happen to them?\"\n   - \"What do you notice about the ivy and plants growing on the walls? How might snow and ice affect them?\"\n   - \"Where does all that snow go when it melts in spring?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \n   - Show the photo again and say: \"Here's a mystery: Over many winters, snow and ice can actually damage buildings, crack rocks, and change the shape of land. How do you think tiny snowflakes and water can be powerful enough to break hard materials like rock and brick?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper with the heading \"Our Predictions About Snow and Earth.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become snow scientists and test what snow and ice actually do to different materials in our own classroom!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how water (as ice and snow) affects different materials through hands-on testing.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3–4 students):**\n- Ice cube trays\n- Water\n- Small clay blocks (or air-dry clay pieces, ~2\" × 2\")\n- Small rock samples (pieces of concrete, brick fragments, or natural stone—check school safety stock or break apart a spare brick carefully, or purchase packs of tumbled stones)\n- Paper towels\n- Plastic cups or small containers\n- Salt (table salt)\n- Freezer access (or use prepared ice cubes brought from home)\n- Masking tape and markers for labeling\n- Observation sheets (printed or drawn on paper)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud, then post on anchor chart):**\n\n1. **Fill ice cube trays** with water and freeze them overnight (or bring pre-made ice cubes). Prepare salt and water mixture in a cup if available.\n\n2. **Set up three test stations** with your group:\n   - **Station 1 (Ice on Clay):** Place an ice cube on a clay block. Wrap it in a paper towel.\n   - **Station 2 (Ice on Rock):** Place an ice cube on a rock sample. Wrap it in a paper towel.\n   - **Station 3 (Salt and Ice on Clay):** Sprinkle salt on an ice cube and place it on a second clay block. Wrap in a paper towel.\n\n3. **Predict first:** Before starting, write or draw what you think will happen to each material after 10–15 minutes.\n\n4. **Observe every 3–5 minutes:** Look for changes. Does the material crack, crumble, or change shape? Is water dripping? Record what you see with words or sketches.\n\n5. **After 15–20 minutes**, remove the ice and carefully examine each test material. Feel it. Does it look different? Are there cracks or soft spots?\n\n6. **Record observations** on your sheet with drawings and labels (e.g., \"Clay with ice got soft,\" \"Rock had a small crack,\" \"Salt made ice melt faster\").\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups and ask guiding questions: *\"What changes do you see in the clay? Is it the same as before? What do you think caused that change?\"*\n- Do NOT explain; ask students to interpret their own observations.\n- Encourage use of descriptive words: cracked, softened, melted, expanded, shrunk.\n- Ensure safety—students should not touch materials excessively or taste anything.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that ice melts and creates water that seeps into porous materials (clay, rock).\n- Clay shows visible softening or crumbling when ice melts on it.\n- Salt accelerates ice melting and causes more water to penetrate materials.\n- Students document changes through drawings and simple written descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to earth science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary definitions\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Real-world image cards (optional): photos of cracked sidewalks, weathered building stones, potholes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather the class** and ask each group to share one discovery: *\"What happened to your materials? Show us your observation sheet.\"* List their findings on the board.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (post definitions on chart paper and keep visible for reference):\n\n   - **Weathering:** When wind, water, ice, and weather slowly break down rocks, soil, and building materials into smaller pieces.\n   - **Erosion:** When water, ice, or wind moves broken pieces of rock and soil from one place to another, changing the shape of land.\n   - **Freeze-thaw cycle:** When water freezes into ice, then melts back to water, over and over. This can crack rocks and damage materials.\n   - **Precipitation:** Water that falls from clouds to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - \"In our picture, snow is falling—that's precipitation. When it piles up and freezes, then melts, then freezes again, that freeze-thaw cycle is causing weathering to the brick building and the rocks in the courtyard, just like what happened to your clay and rocks.\"\n   - Point to the brick building: \"Real bricks are made from clay and rock. Our activity shows what happens over many winters!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If snow melts into water and seeps into a tiny crack in a rock, then freezes again, what do you predict will happen?\"* (The ice expands, pushing the crack wider—this causes the rock to break apart.)\n   - Have students show thumbs up/sideways/down to indicate comfort with the concept.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Weathering** | The slow breaking down of rocks and Earth materials by water, ice, wind, and weather over time. |\n| **Erosion** | The movement of broken rock and soil pieces from one place to another by water, ice, wind, or gravity. |\n| **Freeze-thaw cycle** | When water freezes into ice, then melts back into water, over and over again—this process can break rocks apart. |\n| **Precipitation** | Any water that falls from clouds to Earth (rain, snow, sleet, hail). |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that snow and ice cause weathering of rocks and human-made materials.\n- Students can explain that repeated freezing and melting of water is a powerful force that breaks things down.\n- Students connect their hands-on observations to real-world examples (the brick building in the photo).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to real-world problems and develop solutions to reduce snow and ice damage.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper divided into problem/solution columns (or digital document if available)\n- Images or descriptions of winter damage (cracks in sidewalks, roof damage, potholes, salt-damaged plants)\n- Building materials samples (optional): cardboard, plastic, wood, brick, concrete pieces\n- Markers and colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario:** *\"You are an engineer hired by a school district to prevent winter weather damage to buildings, sidewalks, and playgrounds. You need to come up with solutions!\"*\n\n1. **Identify problems** (whole group brainstorm, 5 minutes):\n   - Ask: *\"What damage happens to buildings and land because of snow, ice, and freeze-thaw cycles?\"*\n   - Record ideas: cracked sidewalks, broken pipes, roof damage, broken playground equipment, dead plants, dangerous ice, eroded gardens.\n\n2. **Generate solutions** (small group work, 10 minutes):\n   - Divide the class into 3–4 groups. Assign each group one winter damage problem.\n   - Ask: *\"How could we prevent this damage or fix it so it doesn't get worse?\"*\n   - Groups brainstorm 2–3 solutions and sketch or write them on chart paper.\n   - Examples of solutions:\n     - Use salt or sand (but discuss the trade-off: it harms plants)\n     - Build covered areas to keep snow off\n     - Design drainage systems to move water away\n     - Use special concrete that resists freeze-thaw damage\n     - Plant ice-resistant plants (like the ivy in the photo!)\n\n3. **Gallery walk or share-out** (5 minutes):\n   - Groups present one solution. Other students ask questions: *\"Why would that work? What's the problem with that idea?\"*\n\n4. **Reflection:**\n   - Ask: *\"Which solutions were best? Why? Could we use more than one solution together?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate brainstorming without steering too much.\n- Ask follow-up questions: *\"Would that really work? What might be a downside?\"*\n- Encourage creative thinking (e.g., *\"What if we used a special coating? What material could we test?\"*).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students propose realistic, multiple solutions to winter weather damage.\n- Students consider trade-offs (e.g., salt helps prevent ice but can harm plants).\n- Students apply their understanding of weathering and erosion to problem-solving.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of weathering, erosion, and the impact of snow/ice on Earth and human structures.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase (check for evidence of observations and predictions)\n- Thumbs up/sideways/down during Explain phase\n- Small group discussions during Elaborate phase—listen for accurate use of vocabulary and logical reasoning\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nGive each student a slip of paper or digital form with these questions:\n\n1. **Draw or write:** What happens to a rock when water gets into a tiny crack, freezes, and then melts? *[Student should show or explain expansion and cracking.]*\n\n2. **Choose the best answer:**\n   - Snow falling on a building is an example of:\n     - A) Weathering     B) Erosion     C) Precipitation     D) A freeze-thaw cycle\n   \n   *[Correct answer: C, but A is also acceptable if student explains.]*\n\n3. **Real-world thinking:** \n   - If you were building a new school in a cold place where it snows a lot, what is one thing you would do to prevent snow and ice from damaging the building? *[Student should propose a solution and explain why it would help—examples: roof drainage, special concrete, salt use, covered areas.]*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student accurately describes weathering or erosion and connects it to snow/ice\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies precipitation or freeze-thaw cycle\n- ✓ Student proposes at least one logical solution with a reason\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify precipitation and can explain one way snow affects Earth materials\n- Students can draw or describe the freeze-thaw cycle's effect\n- Students propose at least one reasonable solution to winter damage with a clear explanation\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for students struggling to grasp concepts)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary anchor chart:** Keep a visual display with pictures for weathering, erosion, precipitation, and freeze-thaw cycle. Allow students to point to pictures to answer questions instead of using words only.\n\n2. **Paired observations during Explore:** Pair struggling learners with stronger peers. Have the pair focus on one test station instead of three, allowing more time for observation and recording.\n\n3. **Sentence frame for explaining:** Provide sentence starters for observations: *\"When the ice melted, the [clay/rock] became _____. I think this happened because _____.\" \"The freeze-thaw cycle broke the rock by _____.\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Freeze-thaw cycle simulation:** Ask students to predict how many freeze-thaw cycles it takes to visibly crack a rock sample, then design a multi-day experiment using a freezer and measuring cracks with rulers. Have them graph results and compare rocks of different types (granite vs. limestone, etc.).\n\n2. **Real-world research:** Assign students to research one winter weather disaster (e.g., potholes forming on highways, burst water pipes, bridge damage) and present findings about the role of weathering and erosion. Challenge them to find articles or videos and present to the class.\n\n3. **Engineering challenge:** Provide small samples of different materials (clay, concrete, plastic, foam, metal) and ask students to design a \"freeze-thaw resistant building material.\" Have them test their designed material against the freeze-thaw cycle and compare results to standard materials.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Long-term freeze-thaw experiment:** Set up a multi-week experiment where students freeze and thaw the same clay and rock samples repeatedly (2–3 times per week) and record changes over time with photos and measurements. Create a graph showing visible damage progression. Connect this to real landscapes that have been weathered over thousands of years.\n\n2. **Water cycle poster:** Have students create a labeled diagram showing how snow fits into the water cycle—from evaporation from the courtyard/building surfaces, to precipitation (snow), to melting and runoff, back to evaporation. Include how weathering and erosion move rock particles as part of the water cycle.\n\n3. **Winter weather impacts in your community:** Take photos of local winter damage (cracked sidewalks, salt damage, eroded areas) or have students draw maps of places in the school/neighborhood that are affected by freeze-thaw cycles. Write captions explaining the weathering/erosion happening there and propose solutions (could become a community science project or letter to local government).\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Implementation Tips\n\n- **Safety:** If breaking real bricks or collecting rock samples, wear safety glasses. Ensure no sharp edges. Pre-break materials if needed.\n- **Preparation:** Freeze ice cubes the day before. Gather rock and clay samples in advance.\n- **Timing:** This lesson works well across 2–3 sessions (Engage + Explore = Session 1; Explain + Elaborate = Session 2; Evaluate = integrated or Session 3).\n- **Real-world connection:** If your region experiences winter weather, this lesson will feel especially relevant. Use local examples of sidewalk damage or building weathering that students have actually seen.\n- **Vocabulary reinforcement:** Keep anchor charts posted throughout the unit to reinforce freeze-thaw cycle, weathering, and erosion as you revisit them in future lessons.",
