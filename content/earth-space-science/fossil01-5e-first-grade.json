ENGAGE (12-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about fossils and rocks by connecting to students' prior experience with finding things in nature.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, clear image of the fossil photograph (printed or projected on whiteboard/screen)\n- A small collection of rocks from outside (5-6 various rocks for passing around)\n- Chart paper and marker\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph prominently** where all students can see it clearly. Leave it visible for 30-45 seconds without explanation—allow students to look and wonder silently.\n\n2. **Facilitate a short observation conversation:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What do these look like?\"\n   - \"Have you ever found rocks outside? What did they look like?\"\n   - \"Do you see any shapes or pictures in these rocks? Can you point to them?\"\n   - \"What do you wonder about how these shapes got there?\"\n\n3. **Pass around 1-2 small rocks** from your collection (smooth and bumpy examples). Let students feel them and pass them quickly.\n\n4. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** Say: *\"These rocks have bumpy parts and lines in them, like little pictures. Today, we're going to be rock detectives and figure out what these rocks are trying to tell us about Earth. What do you think these rocks might have been?\"* \n\n   Record 3-4 student responses on chart paper without correcting them.\n\n5. **Transition:** \"Let's explore some rocks up close like real scientists and see what we can discover!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22-28 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rocks and fossils through hands-on observation and tactile exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student pairs: one hand lens or magnifying glass (or small ziplock bag filled with soapy water to act as a magnifier)\n- 3-4 actual rock/fossil specimens (or high-quality printed images laminated, if real fossils unavailable)\n- Observation recording sheet (simple worksheet with: \"Draw what you see,\" \"How does it feel?\" checklist: bumpy/smooth/hard)\n- Pencils, crayons, colored pencils\n- Chart showing the photograph, with labels: \"Shells,\" \"Imprints,\" \"Hard Rock\"\n\n**Activity — Step-by-Step Directions for Students:**\n\n1. **Partner setup:** Pair students strategically (mixed ability). Give each pair a rock/fossil and a hand lens.\n\n2. **Station rotation (if multiple rocks available):** Explain that each pair will look at one rock for about 4-5 minutes, then move to another. If only one fossil is available, do this as a small-group carousel or whole-group examination with a document camera under a projector.\n\n3. **Student exploration steps:**\n   - \"Look at your rock with the hand lens. What shapes do you see?\"\n   - \"Feel the rock carefully. Is it bumpy or smooth? Does it have lines?\"\n   - \"Do you see anything that looks like it came from a living thing? (shell, animal print, leaf shape?)\"\n   - \"On your paper, draw what you see on the rock. Use your crayons to show the colors and textures.\"\n   - \"Write or draw: How does your rock feel?\"\n\n4. **Teacher facilitation:**\n   - Circulate and ask open-ended questions: *\"What does that bumpy part remind you of?\" \"Where do you think this shape came from?\" \"Have you ever seen anything like this before?\"*\n   - Use think-aloud: *\"I see curved lines here—that looks like it might have been a shell!\"*\n   - Do NOT tell students it's a fossil yet—let them make their own observations.\n   - Help students with labeling on their sheets (teacher scribes if needed).\n\n5. **Document findings:** Students place their drawing in a class \"Rock Detective Folder\" or display area.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Sketches showing observed details (bumps, lines, curves)\n- Tactile descriptions (hard, bumpy, cold)\n- Initial ideas about origins (some may say \"shell,\" \"animal home,\" \"old thing,\" etc.)\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (16-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect student observations to formal explanations about fossils and Earth's age.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original photograph, still visible\n- Chart paper\n- Picture cards or simple drawings showing: shell, fossil, rock, imprint, long-ago\n- Vocabulary word cards (printed or on poster board)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Bring class back together** and show the photograph again.\n\n2. **Share student observations:** *\"You found so many cool things! Tell us what you discovered. Does anyone want to share your drawing?\"*\n   - Call on 3-4 students to briefly describe one thing they saw and felt.\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions:**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Fossil:** The remains or imprint of a living thing from a very, very long time ago that got pressed into rock. (Show with picture: *\"This is what's left of a shell after millions of years.\"*)\n   - **Imprint:** A shape or print left in rock that shows where something was. (Demonstrate by pressing a finger into playdough: *\"See how my finger left a mark? That's an imprint!\"*)\n   - **Shell:** The hard outside covering that some sea animals have to protect them. (Show picture of snail or clam.)\n   - **Long ago:** A very long time in the past—so long that even your great-great-great-great grandparents weren't alive then.\n   - **Rock:** A hard natural thing we find in the ground made of minerals.\n\n4. **Connect to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the fossil: *\"This rock has shells and imprints in it. That tells us that long, long ago, living things—maybe snails or clams—were here. Over millions and millions of years, they got covered by dirt and sand, and the dirt turned into rock. Now we can see these imprints and know what lived here before.\"*\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:** Ask yes/no and quick-answer questions:\n   - \"Can a fossil tell us about things from long ago?\" (Yes!)\n   - \"Are these rocks just rocks, or do they have a story?\" (They have a story!)\n   - \"If we found a shell shape in a rock, what do you think that tells us?\" (A shell animal lived here long ago.)\n   - \"Thumbs up if you think this is cool!\" (gauge enthusiasm and comfort)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name what a fossil is in simple terms.\n- Students understand that fossils are evidence of long ago.\n- Students can identify imprints and shells in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (16-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding by creating their own \"fossil imprints\" and connecting to real-world examples.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Air-dry clay or playdough (enough for each student to have a ball about the size of a golf ball)\n- Small objects to press into clay: shells, leaves, sticks, pasta shapes, toy animals, buttons\n- Shallow trays or paper plates\n- Plastic knives (for smoothing)\n- Paper for labeling (index cards or sticky labels)\n- Optional: shallow tray with salt dough recipe prepared ahead\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the hands-on task:**\n   *\"Scientists don't always find fossils lying around. Some scientists make their own imprints in the lab to study how fossils form. Today, you're going to be fossil scientists and create your own fossil imprints!\"*\n\n2. **Step-by-step directions for students:**\n   - \"Take a ball of clay and flatten it gently on your tray, about as thick as a cookie.\"\n   - \"Choose one small object (shell, leaf, button) and press it gently into the clay.\"\n   - \"Press down carefully for about 3 seconds, then lift it up slowly.\"\n   - \"Look at the imprint! Does it look like what you pressed?\"\n   - \"Draw and label your fossil imprint: *What did I press? What does my imprint look like?*\"\n\n3. **Real-world connection discussion:**\n   - *\"In real life, shells and animals got pressed into mud and dirt over millions of years. Your clay imprint is like a mini version of that!\"*\n   - Show pictures of real fossils from websites or books (ammonites, trilobites, leaf fossils).\n   - *\"People dig these fossils out of rocks all around the world. Every fossil tells a story about Earth a long, long time ago.\"*\n\n4. **Gallery walk (optional, if time):**\n   - Display all clay imprints where students can see them.\n   - Do a quick 5-minute \"fossil gallery\" where students walk and point out their favorites.\n\n5. **Teacher role:** Circulate, ask guiding questions (*\"What made that imprint?\" \"What do you think this fossil tells us?\"*), and photograph or document student creations for assessment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create clear imprints showing cause and effect (object pressed = imprint made).\n- Students can explain in simple terms: *\"This is like a real fossil because...\"*\n- Evidence of understanding the concept of \"long ago\" and how Earth changes over time.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossils, rocks, and Earth's history through multiple methods.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe student handling of rocks (careful observation, using hand lens correctly).\n- Listen to responses during whole-group discussions—note who uses vocabulary and who doesn't.\n- Review drawings and written responses on observation sheets for evidence of close observation.\n- Ask individual students: *\"Tell me one thing you learned about rocks today.\"*\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (3-5 minutes at lesson end):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal for pre-readers). Options:\n\n**Option A (Drawing + Label):**\n- Show the fossil photograph again.\n- Ask: \"Draw one thing you see in this fossil rock and tell me what it is.\"\n- Teacher scribes response or student writes simple word.\n\n**Option B (3-Question Verbal Interview):**\nAsk each student individually or in small groups:\n1. \"What is a fossil?\" (Listen for: *\"Something from long ago,\" \"An old shell,\" \"A print in rock.\"*)\n2. \"How did we make our clay fossils today?\" (Listen for: *\"We pressed something in,\" \"We made an imprint.\"*)\n3. \"Why do you think scientists look at fossils?\" (Listen for: *\"To learn about long ago,\" \"To see what animals were here.\"*)\n\n**Option C (Observation Checklist):**\nUse this rubric as you observe during Explore and Elaborate phases:\n\n| Indicator | Developing | Proficient | Advanced |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| **Observes closely** | Looks at rock briefly | Examines rock with hand lens for 2+ minutes | Notices multiple details (color, texture, shapes, patterns) |\n| **Uses vocabulary** | Does not use fossil/imprint words | Uses 1-2 vocabulary terms correctly | Uses 3+ vocabulary terms; explains meanings |\n| **Understands \"long ago\"** | Confused about time concept | Understands fossils are from the past | Explains fossils show Earth changes over time |\n| **Explains learning** | Cannot describe what they found | Describes one observation or imprint | Connects observations to what fossils tell us |\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Students can **identify** a fossil as remains or imprints from long ago.\n- ✓ Students can **observe and describe** at least two details about a rock or fossil.\n- ✓ Students can **explain** (in simple words) one thing a fossil tells us about Earth.\n- ✓ Students can **create** an imprint and connect it to how real fossils form.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students can name one thing in a fossil and describe what it looks like.\n- 70%+ of students can use the word \"fossil\" or \"long ago\" in a sentence.\n- All students can show evidence of careful observation (drawings, descriptions).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n1. **Vocabulary scaffolding:** Pre-teach fossil and imprint with picture cards one day before the lesson. Use consistent, repetitive language (*\"This is a fossil. A fossil is from long, long ago.\"*). Pair visual cards with objects students can touch.\n\n2. **Modified observation sheets:** Provide pre-drawn images of fossil details (shell, line, bump) and have students circle or point to what they see instead of drawing from scratch. Offer sentence starters: *\"I see a ___.\" \"It feels ___.\"*\n\n3. **Paired exploration:** Pair struggling students with strong observers. Assign the more confident student as the \"describer\" and the struggling student as the \"recorder/pointer.\" Take turns.\n\n4. **Simplified clay activity:** Pre-flatten clay for students; provide only 2-3 safe pressing objects (large shell, leaf). Reduce fine motor demand by allowing hand pressing instead of precise placement.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n1. **Deeper investigation:** Provide images of 3-4 different types of fossils (ammonite, trilobite, plant fossil, dinosaur footprint). Ask: *\"Which fossil do you think came from an animal? A plant? How can you tell?\"* Have students sort and explain their reasoning.\n\n2. **Comparative fossil study:** Challenge students to examine the classroom fossil closely and identify 2-3 different organisms or parts (multiple shells, different textures). Ask: *\"Why do you think all these different things ended up together in one rock?\"* (Hint: *\"They might have lived in the same ocean!\"*)\n\n3. **Extended documentation:** Ask advanced learners to create a \"Fossil Detective Guide\" — a small booklet where they draw and label their own fossil, plus draw what they think the animal looked like when it was alive. Scaffold with sentence frames: *\"This fossil was a ___. It lived ___. It looked like ___.\"*\n\n4. **Prediction and inquiry:** Show a rock with NO visible fossils. Ask: *\"Do you think there are fossils inside this rock? How could we find out?\"* (Discuss careful breaking, erosion, etc. without actually breaking rocks.) Encourage research questions.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil Dig in a Sandbox or Sensory Bin:**\n   - Bury small shells, toy animals, and buttons in sand or kinetic sand mixed with plaster (prepared ahead).\n   - Students use plastic spoons or small brushes to carefully excavate items.\n   - They sketch what they find and label it as \"fossil\" or \"not fossil.\"\n   - Connects to real paleontology work; builds patience and fine motor skills.\n\n2. **Rock and Fossil Walk:**\n   - Take students on a nature walk around the school grounds or nearby park to search for rocks with interesting textures, colors, and shapes.\n   - Collect 2-3 rocks per student (check for safety; avoid breaking rocks from structures).\n   - Return to classroom and repeat the observation activity: hand lens examination, drawing, comparing features.\n   - Create a classroom \"Rock Museum\" display with student labels.\n\n3. **Story Writing/Illustration: \"If My Fossil Could Talk\":**\n   - Students choose one fossil from the lesson and imagine what its story is.\n   - They draw a picture of the animal when it was alive (teacher may provide a simple template or outline).\n   - They dictate or write a simple sentence: *\"Long ago, I was a ___. I lived in ___. Then I turned into a fossil.\"*\n   - Create a class book or bulletin board titled *\"Fossils Tell Stories.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Prior to lesson:** Source or image real fossil specimens. If fossils are unavailable, high-quality photographs printed and laminated work well. Websites like the Smithsonian, National Geographic Kids, or USGS have free fossil images.\n- **Safety:** Ensure all objects students handle (rocks, shells, clay tools) are smooth and appropriate for young learners. Supervise playdough/clay work; some students may try to eat it.\n- **Pacing:** If this is the first lesson, 90 minutes across two days works well. If following up on earlier lessons about rocks, may compress to 60-70 minutes.\n- **Engagement note:** First graders love \"detective\" language and the idea of discovering secrets. Lean into the detective metaphor throughout.\n- **Vocabulary reminder:** Use consistent, repetitive language. Say \"fossil\" and \"long ago\" many times across the lesson so it becomes familiar.\n\nThis lesson connects earth science observation skills, introduces historical thinking about Earth's changes, and builds foundational understanding that will support later geology and paleontology concepts.",
