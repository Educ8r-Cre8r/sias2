Describe what happens to soil when it loses water and dries out.\n2. Explain that Earth can change in slow ways (like soil drying and cracking over time).\n3. Predict and test how water affects soil by observing changes in soil samples.\n4. Identify that water is important for keeping soil soft and healthy.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout or digital display of the cracked earth photograph\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: small bowl of wet soil to pass around (let students feel it)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the cracked earth image prominently. Ask students to sit in a circle or gather close so all can see clearly.\n\n2. **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Ask students:\n   - \"What do you notice about this ground? Describe what you see.\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen dirt that looks like this? Where?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the soil has all these big cracks?\"\n   - \"What do you think happened to this ground before it looked like this?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Pass around a small sample of moist soil. Ask: \"What is different between this wet soil in your hand and the dry, cracked soil in the picture? Why do you think the wet soil doesn't have cracks?\"\n\n4. **Record Initial Ideas:** On chart paper, write student responses and questions under the heading \"What We Think About Cracked Soil.\" This becomes a reference point for later learning.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become soil scientists and find out what really happens when soil dries out—and whether we can make cracks appear ourselves!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 2 small, identical plastic containers (yogurt cups or takeout containers work well)\n- Potting soil or garden soil (enough to fill both containers halfway)\n- Water in a spray bottle or cup\n- Paper towels\n- Marker for labeling\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring cracks)\n- Observation sheet (simple drawings or checklist)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Setup (Teacher does ahead or with students):**\n- Fill both containers with moist soil.\n- Label one container \"WET\" and one \"DRY.\"\n- Spray the WET container lightly with water so the soil feels damp throughout.\n- Leave the DRY container as is (or let it air out for 5-10 minutes if you prepared it earlier).\n\n**Student Directions (Read aloud and display with pictures):**\n\n1. **Observe the Starting Soil:**\n   - Look at both containers. Feel the soil in each one gently with your fingertip.\n   - Draw what the soil looks like right now on your observation sheet.\n   - Write or tell: Is the wet soil smooth or bumpy? Is the dry soil smooth or bumpy?\n\n2. **Place in Sunlight:**\n   - Put both containers on a sunny windowsill or under a heat lamp (teacher choice based on setup).\n   - Predict: \"Which soil do you think will get cracks first? Why?\"\n\n3. **Check Every 2-3 Days (Over one week):**\n   - Look at both containers.\n   - Draw what you see. Are there cracks? How many? How big?\n   - Feel the soil gently. Is it getting harder?\n   - The WET container—should we keep watering it? (Teacher decides: keeping it moist mimics ideal conditions; letting it dry shows comparison.)\n\n**How This Connects to the Photograph:**\n\"The picture you saw at the beginning shows real ground that dried out over many days or weeks. We're making a mini version in our containers so we can watch it happen and understand what's going on.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask prompts like: \"What's changing?\" \"Which container is changing more?\" \"Why do you think that is?\"\n- Don't lead to answers; instead, encourage careful observation.\n- Help students use the ruler to measure and compare crack sizes if they're interested.\n- Facilitate discussions between observation days: \"What did you predict? Is it happening?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that the dry soil develops visible cracks while moist soil stays smooth.\n- Students note that dry soil becomes harder and breaks apart more easily.\n- Students begin to connect water to soil flexibility and cracking.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Photograph of cracked earth (display again)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n- Picture cards or simple drawings showing wet soil, dry soil, and cracking soil\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share Observations:**\n   - Ask volunteers to share what their group observed: \"What happened to your WET soil? What happened to your DRY soil?\"\n   - Create a class \"Cracked Soil Chart\" on chart paper with two columns: WET SOIL / DRY SOIL.\n   - Record student findings.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary with Definitions:**\n\n   - **Soil:** The top layer of Earth made of tiny bits of rock, minerals, and sometimes dead plants. Soil is where plants grow.\n   - **Water (or Moisture):** A liquid that flows and keeps things wet. Soil needs water to stay soft.\n   - **Drought:** A long time when there is very little rain and the ground gets very dry.\n   - **Cracking:** When something breaks into pieces with lines between them (like your dried soil).\n   - **Weathering:** The slow breaking down and changing of rocks and soil by wind, water, and weather.\n\n3. **Make Connections Back to the Photograph:**\n   - Point to the photograph again. Ask: \"Now that we've seen our own soil crack, what do you think happened to the ground in this picture?\"\n   - \"This ground probably didn't have rain for a very long time—that's called a drought. The water dried up, and the soil shrank and cracked, just like your soil did.\"\n   - \"This is a slow Earth event—it took weeks or months, not seconds. But you could see it happening in your containers!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why do cracks appear in dry soil?\" (It loses water and shrinks.)\n   - Ask: \"What could stop the ground from cracking?\" (Rain or watering it.)\n   - Ask: \"Is this a fast Earth event or a slow Earth event?\" (Slow—it happens over time.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Soil:** The top layer of Earth made of tiny bits of rock and minerals where plants grow.\n- **Water/Moisture:** A liquid that keeps soil soft and wet.\n- **Drought:** A long, dry time with very little rain.\n- **Cracking:** Breaking into pieces with lines between them.\n- **Weathering:** Slow breaking down and changing of Earth's surface by wind and water.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary correctly to describe what they observed.\n- Students connect the photograph to the concept of drought and drying soil.\n- Students understand that loss of water causes soil to shrink and crack.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Containers from Explore phase (still drying)\n- Water spray bottles\n- Observation sheets\n- Optional: photographs of drought-affected landscapes (teacher-sourced or from curriculum)\n- Optional: picture book about water cycles (e.g., *The Water Cycle* by Rebecca Olien)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Real-World Application: \"What If We Fix It?\"**\n\n1. **Scenario Introduction:**\n   - Show students a photo of a real drought-affected area (optional but impactful).\n   - Ask: \"Imagine this cracked earth is a farmer's field where food grows. The farmer hasn't had rain in months. What could the farmer do to help the soil?\"\n\n2. **Student Investigation:**\n   - Give each group permission to water ONE of their containers (the DRY one, or a third container prepared in advance).\n   - Ask: \"Do you think watering will fix the cracks? Will the soil get soft again?\"\n   - Have students predict, then water the soil lightly.\n   - Ask them to observe over the next few days: Do the cracks get smaller? Does the soil get softer?\n\n3. **Discussion:**\n   - \"When it rains on dry, cracked ground, what do you think happens?\"\n   - \"Is water important to Earth and soil? Why?\"\n   - Introduce the idea: \"Water is one of Earth's most important resources. When there's no water, the land can't support plants, and things change a lot.\"\n\n4. **Connection to Water Cycle (Optional Extension):**\n   - If time allows, read a brief picture book about the water cycle or show a simple diagram.\n   - Ask: \"Where does rain come from? Where does the water go when soil dries out?\" (Introduce evaporation: water goes back up into the air and forms clouds.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions that encourage predictions and deeper thinking.\n- Help students notice slow vs. fast changes (watering = fast softening; drying = slow cracking).\n- Facilitate connections: \"Remember how long it took to dry out? How fast does it soften when we add water?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students predict that water will soften soil again.\n- Students observe that adding water reverses some effects of drying (soil softens, cracks may fill in).\n- Students begin to understand Earth's water cycle and the importance of water.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of drought, cracked soil, and slow Earth events.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation of student discussions during Engage and Explain phases.\n- Quality of predictions and observations recorded on observation sheets.\n- Ability to use vocabulary correctly when describing soil changes.\n\n**Exit Ticket or Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (verbal or written, depending on reading level):\n\n**Question 1:** \"What happens to soil when it doesn't have water for a long time?\" \n- ✓ Student indicates soil gets hard, cracks, or breaks apart.\n\n**Question 2:** \"Is cracked soil a fast change or a slow change to Earth?\"\n- ✓ Student indicates it's slow (takes days or weeks).\n\n**Question 3 (Drawing Option):** \"Draw what soil looks like when it has water and what it looks like when it's dry.\"\n- ✓ Student shows visible differences (wet soil smooth; dry soil cracked).\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students can describe the effect of water loss on soil.\n- Students understand that this is a slow Earth event.\n- Students can use at least one key vocabulary word (soil, water, drought, cracking, or weathering) correctly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80%+ of students demonstrate understanding that dry soil cracks and loses water.\n- Most students can identify this as a slow Earth change.\n- Students show increased curiosity about water's role on Earth.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only 2-3 key terms (soil, water, cracking) and reinforce repeatedly with pictures and physical examples.\n\n2. **Pre-Made Observation Sheet with Pictures:** Provide a sheet where students simply check boxes or circle pictures (✓ Cracks? Yes/No) rather than drawing or writing sentences. This reduces writing demands while maintaining observation skills.\n\n3. **Partner Pairing:** Assign struggling readers/writers to observe and discuss with a stronger peer. Let them contribute verbally while the partner records.\n\n4. **Extended Engagement Time:** Bring in a bowl of damp soil so they can manipulate and feel it directly during Engage, making the abstract concept more concrete.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-Variable Investigation:** Challenge students to test: \"Does soil TYPE matter?\" Provide sand, clay-rich soil, and loamy soil in separate containers. Let them observe which dries and cracks fastest and hypothesize why.\n\n2. **Measurement and Graphing:** Have students measure crack length and count crack number over multiple days, then create a simple bar graph or picture graph showing how cracks grow. Connect to the idea of tracking slow changes over time.\n\n3. **Water Cycle Extension:** Provide a simple diagram of the water cycle and ask: \"Where does the water go when soil dries out?\" Introduce the term \"evaporation\" and have them trace the path of water from soil to air to clouds.\n\n4. **Real-World Research:** Provide age-appropriate photos or articles about droughts in local or distant regions. Ask: \"What problems does drought cause for farmers, animals, and people? How is this like our cracked soil?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Drought and Desert Studies:** Read a picture book about deserts (e.g., *Desert Habitats* by Cassie Mayer) and compare desert soil to the drought-affected soil in the photograph. Ask: \"Deserts are dry all the time. How do plants and animals survive?\" This connects to ecosystems and adaptation.\n\n2. **Plant and Water Experiment:** Plant seeds in two containers—one kept moist, one allowed to dry out (with cracks). Observe over 2-3 weeks. Ask: \"Can seeds grow in cracked, dry soil? What does soil need to support life?\" This bridges to life science and soil as a resource.\n\n3. **Community Water Use Survey:** Ask students to observe and record where water is used in their classroom and home (faucets, toilets, watering plants, etc.). Create a class tally. Discuss: \"We use water every day. What would happen if there was a drought and we had very little water?\" This connects to real-world resource awareness and conservation.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Timing:** The exploration phase requires multiple days of observation (ideally 5-7 days). Plan accordingly; you may need to continue observations during Explain and Elaborate phases.\n- **Climate Consideration:** If your classroom is very humid, drying may be slow. A sunny windowsill or heat lamp will accelerate the process. Conversely, if using a heat lamp, monitor moisture to avoid fire hazard.\n- **Soil Source:** Avoid soil from a yard that may contain pesticides. Use potting soil or purchase inexpensive garden soil.\n- **Connections to Local Context:** If your region has experienced drought, use it as a touchpoint. If not, use geographic or seasonal examples relevant to your students' understanding.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson honors the 5E model by building from curiosity (Engage) through direct investigation (Explore) to conceptual understanding (Explain), real-world application (Elaborate), and evidence-based assessment (Evaluate).**",
