Identify what a fossil is and explain that fossils are remains of plants and animals from long, long ago.\n2. Observe details in a fossil and describe what the fossil tells us about the organism it came from.\n3. Explain that fossils form over very long periods of time through natural processes in Earth.\n4. Predict and test how organisms might be preserved in different materials.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about fossils and activate prior knowledge about rocks and living things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of fossils (projected on screen or printed large copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: Real small fossil or fossil replica to pass around (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or pass around printed copies. Let students observe silently for 30 seconds while they look closely.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions** (speak clearly, pause for thinking time):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me everything you notice.\"\n   - \"These are called *fossils*. Has anyone ever heard that word before? What do you think a fossil is?\"\n   - \"Do you see shapes that look like animals or living things? What makes you think so?\"\n   - \"How do you think a plant or animal got stuck inside this rock?\"\n\n3. **Record student ideas** on chart paper. Don't correct misconceptions yet—just listen and write.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... how long ago did this creature live? How did it stay inside the rock all this time? Let's become fossil detectives and find out!\"\n\n5. **Pass around** a real fossil or replica if available so students can feel the texture and see details up close.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to make our own fossil models to see how nature creates these treasures from long ago.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how organisms can be preserved in rock-like materials through hands-on fossil modeling.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Cup of air-dry clay or salt dough (pre-made: 2 cups flour, 1 cup salt, ¾ cup water, mixed ahead)\n- Small shells, leaves, twigs, toy insects, or plastic animals\n- Shallow container or plate\n- Spoon for pressing\n- Water in a small cup\n- Paper towels\n- Optional: Sand, pebbles\n\n**Activity - Student Directions (Read aloud and demonstrate each step):**\n\n1. \"Take a lump of clay about the size of a golf ball. Press it gently into the bottom of your container.\"\n\n2. \"Flatten it with your hands or the spoon until it's about ½ inch thick—like a pancake. This is your 'rock layer.'\"\n\n3. \"Choose one small object (shell, leaf, toy animal). Press it firmly into the clay, then carefully pull it out. What do you see?\"\n\n4. \"Look at the shape left behind. This is like a fossil impression!\"\n\n5. \"Try pressing different objects. Which ones made the clearest prints? Which ones didn't work as well?\"\n\n6. \"Observe: Does your clay feel wet or dry? Does that change how easy it is to make a fossil?\"\n\n7. **Record observations:** Students draw or write (with teacher scribe if needed):\n   - Which object made the best fossil?\n   - Does the object's shape match the hole in the clay?\n   - How is this like what happens in real rocks?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Tell me about the impression you made. What does it look like? Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Do *not* say \"That's right!\" or give answers. Instead, reflect: \"You noticed the smooth objects made clearer prints. Why do you think that is?\"\n- Help students handle materials gently but don't do the pressing for them.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully create impressions in clay.\n- They observe that different objects leave different quality imprints.\n- They discover that pressing firmly matters.\n- They begin to understand that fossils are \"records\" of what lived long ago.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to real fossil formation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Fossil photograph (display again)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures (optional: pre-made or drawn on board)\n- Student clay fossils from Explore\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share student discoveries** (5 minutes):\n   - Invite 3-4 pairs to show their clay fossil impressions.\n   - Ask: \"What object did you press in? How did you know it worked well?\"\n   - Affirm observations: \"You're right! The shells made very clear prints because they're hard.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly language (write each on board or chart):\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---------------------------|\n   | **Fossil** | The remains or shape of a plant or animal that lived very, very long ago and was preserved in rock. |\n   | **Impression** | A shape or mark left behind when something is pressed into a material. |\n   | **Preserve** | To keep something safe so it doesn't disappear or fall apart. |\n   | **Rock Layer** | A flat sheet of rock that formed over time by materials being pressed together. |\n   | **Long ago** | Millions and millions of years before you were born—even before dinosaurs! |\n\n3. **Make connections to the photograph** (5 minutes):\n   - \"Look at the fossil in our picture again. Do you see the clear shape? That's an **impression**, just like you made in clay!\"\n   - \"This fossil spent millions and millions of years getting squished in mud and sand. The mud turned into rock. That's how nature makes fossils—it takes a *very* long time.\"\n   - \"The shell or animal died and landed in soft mud. Then more mud covered it. Over time—longer than you can even imagine—it became rock. But we can still see the shape!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding** (4 minutes):\n   - Ask these questions; students can show thumbs up/sideways/down or call out:\n     - \"Is a fossil the same as a real dinosaur bone?\" (No—it's the shape left behind)\n     - \"How long does it take to make a fossil?\" (A very, very long time—longer than we can count)\n     - \"How is your clay fossil like a real fossil in a rock?\" (Both are impressions of something that lived)\n\n**Vocabulary Display:**\nKeep vocabulary chart posted for the rest of the unit. Point to words whenever you use them.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that fossils are impressions of ancient life preserved in rock.\n- They recognize that fossil formation takes an extremely long time.\n- They can use the word \"impression\" and \"fossil\" correctly in context.\n- They see their own clay fossils as working models of real fossils.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new context and think about how fossils form in nature.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Shallow containers or aluminum pans (one per pair)\n- Wet sand or soil (from outdoors, in a bucket)\n- Water in cups\n- Shells, leaves, small pebbles, toy animals\n- Towels or newspaper (to manage mess)\n- Optional: Pictures of different fossils (shells, leaves, ammonites, trilobites)\n\n**Activity - \"Nature's Fossil Factory\":**\n\n1. **Set the scenario:** \"Now we're going to see what happens when fossils form in nature. Instead of clay, we'll use sand and water—like real rocks start as!\"\n\n2. **Student steps:**\n   - Pour wet sand into the shallow container until ½ to ¾ full.\n   - Smooth the surface with your fingers or a spoon.\n   - Press one object into the sand (shell, leaf, etc.).\n   - Gently remove it and observe the impression.\n   - (Optional: pour a tiny bit more wet sand on top, let it sit, and dig down to show how layers form)\n\n3. **Observation questions:**\n   - \"Does the sand hold the impression as well as clay did? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What would happen if rain washed over this? What if the sun dried it? What if more sand kept piling on top?\"\n   - \"In real nature, the sand would get harder and harder over time. The sand would turn into sandstone rock. What do you think would happen to the fossil then?\"\n\n4. **Introduce fossil variety** (if using pictures):\n   - Show pictures of different fossils: shells, leaf prints, ammonites, trilobites.\n   - \"Long ago, different plants and animals lived in different places. When they died, they left fossils. That tells us what lived where!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide thinking with questions: \"What's different about sand compared to clay? Why might that matter?\"\n- Help students make the connection: \"When rain hardens the sand, or when more layers pile on top and press down, what do you think happens to the fossil?\"\n- Encourage predictions: \"What would happen if this was buried for a million years?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that fossils can form in different materials (clay, sand, mud).\n- They begin to understand that pressure and time turn soft materials into hard rock.\n- They can explain that different places have different fossils because different creatures lived there.\n- They deepen their sense of \"long, long ago\" as a geological timescale.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossils, how they form, and what they tell us.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n- Circulate during Explore and Elaborate phases. Listen to student language. Do they use \"fossil,\" \"impression,\" and \"rock\" correctly?\n- Observe: Can students press firmly enough to make clear impressions? Do they observe and describe details?\n- During group shares, note which students can explain what they made and why.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of Day 2, 5-7 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a sheet that has:\n- A simple drawing of a fossil (like in the photo) or space to draw one\n- Three questions (read aloud):\n\n**Questions:**\n1. \"What is a fossil? Draw or tell me.\" (Success: Student indicates it's a shape/remains of something that lived long ago, preserved in rock)\n\n2. \"How do you think a fossil gets inside a rock?\" (Success: Student mentions: long time, mud/sand, got buried, got squished/hardened, or similar)\n\n3. \"Look at this fossil of a shell. What does it tell us about long, long ago?\" (Success: Student says: shells/animals lived here, the ocean covered this place, etc.)\n\n**Differentiated Responses:**\n- **Struggling:** Accept single words, drawings, or one-sentence answers. Scribe if needed.\n- **On-level:** Expect 1-2 sentence responses that show they understand fossils as ancient impressions in rock.\n- **Advanced:** Look for multi-step explanations (\"First the animal died, then it got covered in mud, then...\") and connections to time.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can name or identify what a fossil is.\n- ✓ Student recognizes that fossils took a long time to form.\n- ✓ Student understands that fossils show us about life long ago.\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Objectives:**\n- Review exit tickets. If 70%+ of students demonstrate understanding of \"fossil = ancient impression in rock,\" objective met.\n- If students can explain a simple version of fossil formation (time + burial = fossilization), objective met.\n- If students recognize that fossils are evidence of past life, objective met.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-make modeling materials:** Prepare clay fossils ahead of time during Engage so students can focus on observation and pressing rather than kneading clay.\n\n2. **Sentence frame for descriptions:** Provide sentence starters:\n   - \"This fossil looks like a ___.\"\n   - \"I think this animal lived in ___.\"\n   - \"It took a very long time because ___.\"\n\n3. **Pair with a peer or adult:** During Explore, pair struggling students with a peer mentor or aide. They can work together on one fossil, with the mentor handling one task while the student focuses on pressing and observing.\n\n4. **Use real objects they recognize:** Show pictures of shells, leaves, or bugs before the activity so they can connect the fossil shape back to something familiar.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-layer fossil project:** Have students create a \"fossil bed\" with multiple objects pressed at different depths in clay to show how layers form over time. Ask: \"Which fossil would be older—the one deeper down or higher up?\"\n\n2. **Research and present:** Provide pictures of different fossil types (ammonites, trilobites, dinosaur tracks). Challenge students to find one they're curious about and create a simple poster: \"This fossil is a __. It lived in a __. It looked like __.\"\n\n3. **Predict and test:** \"If we buried the same object in clay, sand, and water, which would make the best fossil? Why? Let's try and see!\" Challenge them to design the test and record which material preserves the detail best.\n\n4. **Time scale thinking:** Use a string or paper strip across the room to represent Earth's timeline. Mark \"Now\" on one end and \"Fossils were made\" on the other end. Have students help you label: dinosaurs, when people lived, when the fossil in the photo formed—showing the vast time difference.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil Hunt Scavenger Hunt (Outdoor or Classroom):**\n   - If your region has fossil locations, plan a supervised field trip or virtual tour.\n   - Alternatively, hide student-made fossils around the classroom, yard, or playground. Provide \"paleontologist maps\" with clues. Students find and identify each fossil, recording what they found. Discuss: \"Why would someone hunt for fossils? What can we learn?\"\n\n2. **\"What Lived Here?\" Fossil Inference Game:**\n   - Show pictures of different fossils (shells, leaf prints, fish, dinosaur tracks).\n   - Ask: \"If we found this fossil, what plant or animal made it? Where do you think it lived? Was it wet, dry, hot, or cold? Why?\"\n   - Students vote or create a \"fossil interpretation\" poster for each one. Emphasize that fossils are clues to Earth's past environments.\n\n3. **Salt Dough Fossil Keepsake:**\n   - Invite students to take home their clay or salt dough fossil.\n   - Include a note for families: \"Your child is a paleontologist! This fossil model shows how nature preserves ancient life. Talk about: What fossil would *you* like to find?\"\n   - Optional: Families can bake salt dough fossils at home and bring them back to create a classroom \"fossil museum.\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Timing:** This is a two-session lesson (Day 1: Engage through Explain; Day 2: Elaborate and Evaluate). If you have only one session, shorten Elaborate to 10 minutes and use the exit ticket as a quick verbal check.\n- **Real fossils:** If you can acquire real fossil replicas or small fossils from a science store or online supplier, passing them around during Engage dramatically increases engagement.\n- **Sensory experiences:** Second graders are very tactile learners. Let them *feel* the texture of clay, sand, and rock. Ask: \"Does this feel smooth or bumpy? Hard or soft?\"\n- **Language support:** Use the word \"fossil\" and \"impression\" repeatedly and in context. Point to visuals. Second graders benefit from repetition and visual referents.\n- **Connection to 2-ESS1-1:** This lesson shows that fossilization is a *slow* Earth event (taking millions of years), contrasting with quick events like earthquakes or storms. You can reinforce: \"Fossils took VERY long to make. That's very different from a rainstorm, which happens in just an hour!\"",
