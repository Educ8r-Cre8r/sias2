There are trees and grass in front of the tall buildings.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image represents the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of how the sun provides light and heat to Earth during daytime. The bright sunlight visible between the buildings demonstrates solar radiation reaching Earth's surface. This occurs because the sun is a massive star that produces energy through nuclear fusion, sending light and heat across space to illuminate our planet during the day when our location faces the sun due to Earth's rotation.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Day and Night Cycle**: The sun appears to move across the sky, but Earth is actually spinning, creating day and night\n2. **Solar Energy**: The sun provides light and heat energy that we can see and feel\n3. **Natural vs. Human-made Objects**: The sun and trees are natural, while buildings are made by people\n4. **Shadows and Light**: When sunlight hits objects like buildings, it creates shadows and bright spots\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use concrete, hands-on experiences like shadow tracing throughout the day to help kindergarteners understand the sun's apparent movement. Young children learn best through direct observation and physical activities.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways to represent the day/night cycle: use a flashlight and globe demonstration, act out Earth spinning, and create picture schedules showing daytime and nighttime activities to support diverse learning needs.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** Inside the sun, tiny particles are constantly crashing together to make the light and heat that travels to Earth (nuclear fusion at the atomic level)\n2. **Zoom Out:** Earth spins like a top in space, and as it turns, different parts face the sun, creating day and night cycles across our entire planet\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** The sun moves around Earth during the day\n   **Reality:** Earth spins, making it look like the sun moves across the sky\n\n2. **Misconception:** The sun goes away at night\n   **Reality:** The sun is always shining, but Earth's spinning means our side faces away from it at night\n\n3. **Misconception:** Buildings can block out the sun completely\n   **Reality:** Buildings create shadows but the sun's light spreads around and reflects off many surfaces\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** K-ESS2-1: Use and share observations of local weather conditions to describe patterns over time\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:K-ESS2.D]] Weather and Climate - Weather is the combination of sunlight, wind, snow or rain, and temperature in a particular region at a particular time\n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns in the natural world can be observed and used as evidence\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you notice about where the sun is in this picture? (Bloom's: Observe | DOK: 1)\n2. How do you think the shadows of these buildings might change during the day? (Bloom's: Predict | DOK: 2)  \n3. Why do you think some parts of the buildings look brighter than others? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n4. What would this same place look like at nighttime? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Sun:** The bright star that gives Earth light and heat during the day\n* **Shadow:** A dark area made when something blocks the sun's light\n* **Daytime:** When our part of Earth faces the sun and it is bright outside\n* **Energy:** The power that makes things work, like light and heat from the sun\n* **Natural:** Things that are made by nature, not by people\n* **Human-made:** Things that people build or create\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- The Sun Is My Favorite Star by Frank Asch\n- What Makes Day and Night by Franklyn M.
