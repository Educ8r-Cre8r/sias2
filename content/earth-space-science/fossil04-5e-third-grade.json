ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about fossils and activate prior knowledge through the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (large format if possible, or displayed on interactive board)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Real fossil specimens or fossil replicas to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display & Hook (3 minutes):** Project the fossil photograph on the board without explanation. Tell students: *\"Look carefully at this picture. There's something hidden in this rock that is very, very old—older than your great-great-great-grandparents. Who can spot it?\"* Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Initial Discussion (5 minutes):** Facilitate a Think-Pair-Share:\n   - Ask: *\"What do you see in this rock? What shape do you notice?\"*\n   - Pair students to discuss their observations (90 seconds).\n   - Ask 3-4 volunteers to share what they noticed.\n\n3. **Wonder & Predict (4 minutes):** Ask guiding questions one at a time, pausing for responses:\n   - *\"Do you think this shape is naturally made by rocks, or could it be something else? What makes you think that?\"*\n   - *\"What if I told you this is a shell? How do you think a shell got stuck inside a rock?\"*\n   - *\"Could this tell us something about what Earth was like a very long time ago?\"*\n\n   Record student predictions on chart paper labeled \"Our Fossils Questions.\"\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to become fossil detectives. We'll create our own fossils and discover how nature preserves the shapes of animals from long, long ago.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate fossil formation through hands-on simulation.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Shallow aluminum foil containers or plastic trays (approximately 6\" × 4\" × 2\")\n- Play dough or air-dry clay (earth-toned colors preferred)\n- Small objects to create imprints:\n  - Shells (real shells, plastic shells, or shell pasta)\n  - Small bones (chicken bones cleaned and dried, or plastic skeleton pieces)\n  - Leaves (fresh or pressed)\n  - Small toy dinosaurs or animals\n- Water spray bottle\n- Fine sand or flour (to simulate sediment)\n- Spoon or craft stick\n- Paper towels\n- Labels and pencils for documentation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (provide as a visual chart and verbally):**\n\n1. **Layer 1 — The Base (5 minutes):**\n   - Fill your container halfway with moist play dough. Press it down firmly with your hand until it is flat and smooth.\n   - This represents the ground or seafloor where organisms died.\n\n2. **Create Your Fossil (4 minutes):**\n   - Choose one object (shell, leaf, or bone) and gently press it firmly into the play dough. Press down for 10 full seconds.\n   - Remove the object slowly and carefully. You should see an imprint (a dent) left behind—this is what a fossil looks like!\n   - Observe the imprint closely. What details do you see? (Ridges? Texture? Bumps?)\n\n3. **Cover It Up (5 minutes):**\n   - Use a spray bottle to lightly mist the imprint and surrounding dough with water (2-3 sprays only).\n   - Sprinkle a thin layer of sand or flour over the damp play dough to simulate sediment burying the fossil.\n   - Gently press the sand down with your spoon.\n   - Allow it to sit undisturbed for 2 minutes. This represents time passing and layers building up.\n\n4. **Document (4 minutes):**\n   - Before looking at the results, write or draw on your label:\n     - What object did you use to make your fossil?\n     - What do you think will happen when you uncover it?\n   - Attach the label to your container.\n\n5. **Uncover & Observe (4 minutes):**\n   - Carefully brush away the sand layer with your spoon or craft stick.\n   - Look at the imprint left in the hardened dough. Does it look the same as when you made it? Different?\n   - Compare your fossil imprint to the photograph displayed on the board.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate around the room. Do not correct or guide students to \"correct\" answers; instead, ask:\n  - *\"What do you notice about the details in your imprint?\"*\n  - *\"How is this similar to or different from the fossil in our photograph?\"*\n  - *\"What does the sediment (sand) represent in real fossil formation?\"*\n- Encourage students to touch and examine imprints closely.\n- If a student's imprint is unclear, ask: *\"What could we do differently next time to make the details clearer?\"* (This primes them for the science conversation in Explain.)\n- Have students save their containers; they will be referenced in the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce clay imprints that simulate fossil formation.\n- Students document observations using drawings and predictions.\n- Students observe that the object leaves a clear record of its shape in the sediment.\n- Students begin to understand that the imprint is a \"record\" of the organism.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to real fossil science.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student-created fossils (from Explore phase)\n- Photograph displayed on board\n- Chart paper for vocabulary and concept map\n- Real fossils or high-quality images of fossils (if available)\n- Whiteboard/markers for drawing diagrams\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 4-5 students to share their observations: *\"What did you notice when you uncovered your imprint fossil? Were you surprised by anything?\"*\n   - Record their discoveries on chart paper without judgment.\n   - Highlight observations: *\"You noticed the sand made the imprint darker,\" \"The details were very clear,\" \"It felt hard when it dried.\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Display each term on chart paper with a simple definition and a picture/example.\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n\n   - **Fossil:** The preserved remains or imprint of a living thing from a very, very long time ago. It is found in rock or soil. *(Point to classroom fossil and photograph.)*\n   \n   - **Imprint Fossil:** A fossil that shows the shape of an organism pressed into rock, like a footprint in sand. *(Hold up a student's clay imprint.)*\n   \n   - **Sediment:** Tiny pieces of rock and shells that settle and pile up on the ground or at the bottom of water. Over time, sediment becomes rock. *(Show sand used in Explore activity.)*\n   \n   - **Organism:** A living thing—like an animal, plant, or bug. *(Show pictures of different organisms.)*\n   \n   - **Ancient:** Very, very, very old—older than anything we know. *(Use a timeline gesture: \"This is now, and ancient is waaaaay back that way.\")*\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Display the fossil photograph again.\n   - *\"This is a real fossil. This shell was alive in the ocean a very long time ago—millions of years ago! When the shell died, it fell onto the seafloor. Sand and mud covered it. Over millions of years, all that sand and mud became rock. And guess what? The shell left an imprint, just like you made today with your play dough.\"*\n   - Invite students to compare their clay imprints to the photograph: *\"Can you see the ridges and lines in both? That's because they're made the same way!\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: *\"How is your clay fossil like the real fossil in the picture?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"Why did we cover your imprint with sand? What does that represent?\"*\n   - Listen for: Reference to time, sediment, and preservation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand vocabulary in context.\n- Students recognize that their model mirrors real fossil formation.\n- Students can articulate that fossils are preserved records of ancient life.\n- Students identify that sediment covering organisms is key to fossil formation.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply fossil concepts to a new scenario and explore how scientists use fossils.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of 4-5 different types of fossils (ammonite, trilobite, leaf fossil, dinosaur footprint, insect in amber) — printed or displayed digitally\n- Chart paper: \"What Does a Fossil Tell Us?\"\n- Picture cards of extinct organisms (T-Rex, Triceratops, ancient fish, ancient plants)\n- Optional: \"Fossil Detective\" worksheet (simple graphic organizer for recording observations)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Fossil Detective Gallery Walk (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Display 4-5 different fossil images around the classroom or on the board in sequence.\n2. Divide class into small groups. Each group rotates to 2-3 fossil images.\n3. At each station, students observe and discuss:\n   - *\"What organism do you think made this fossil?\"*\n   - *\"What can this fossil tell us about what Earth was like when this animal was alive?\"*\n   - *\"Is this organism alive today, or did it live a long time ago?\"*\n4. Teacher circulates, asking: *\"What evidence helps you figure this out? Can you see details like the shell's ridges or the footprint's toes?\"*\n\n**Part B: Connecting Fossils to Earth's Story (8 minutes)**\n\n1. Display the chart: **\"What Does a Fossil Tell Us?\"**\n2. Co-create a list with student input:\n   - Fossils tell us what animals lived on Earth a long time ago.\n   - Fossils show us what those animals looked like and their size.\n   - Fossils help us understand how Earth has changed over time.\n   - Fossils are clues that help scientists learn about the past.\n3. *\"Scientists use fossils like we use detective clues to tell a story. The fossil tells the story of an animal that lived long ago.\"*\n4. Show a picture of an extinct organism (e.g., Tyrannosaurus rex) alongside a fossil (dinosaur bone or footprint):\n   - *\"This dinosaur lived millions of years ago. We know about it because of fossils. We've never seen a dinosaur, but the fossils tell us these amazing animals were real.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate open-ended observation without providing answers immediately.\n- Validate all observations and guide deeper thinking: *\"What makes you say that? Can you show me where you see that evidence?\"*\n- Connect observations back to the photograph and Explore activities.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different organisms produce different fossils.\n- Students understand that fossils provide evidence of extinct organisms.\n- Students begin to grasp that fossils are windows into Earth's ancient past.\n- Students practice evidence-based reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossil formation and fossil significance.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson (Ongoing):**\n- **Teacher Observation Checklist** (use during Explore and Explain):\n  - ☐ Student creates a recognizable imprint fossil.\n  - ☐ Student accurately uses vocabulary (fossil, sediment, imprint, organism).\n  - ☐ Student explains that sediment covers organisms to preserve them.\n  - ☐ Student compares their model to the real fossil in the photograph.\n  - ☐ Student understands that fossils show evidence of past life.\n\n- **Questioning During Elaborate:**\n  - Listen for student explanations: *\"Why did you think this was a shell?\" \"What does the footprint tell us about that animal?\"*\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes — end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide students with a simple graphic organizer or ask them to respond verbally/through drawing to these prompts:\n\n1. **Draw or write:** *\"What is a fossil? Draw one and label what it is.\"*\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student's drawing shows a preserved imprint or remains; label indicates it is old/ancient.\n\n2. **Short answer or sentence completion:** *\"How do fossils form? Use the words sediment and buried in your answer.\"*\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student mentions sediment covering/burying an organism. Acceptable: *\"A shell gets buried in sediment, and over a long time, it becomes a fossil.\"*\n\n3. **Picture sort (optional):** Show 3-4 pictures. Ask: *\"Which picture shows something that could become a fossil? Why?\"*\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student selects pictures of organisms and gives a reason related to preservation or sediment.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that fossils are preserved remains/imprints of ancient organisms.\n- Students can explain that sediment plays a role in fossil formation.\n- Students recognize that fossils provide evidence of past life on Earth.\n- Students apply concepts to new scenarios (identifying what would/could fossilize).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Provide a visual word wall with pictures for each term (fossil, sediment, organism, ancient). Allow students to reference the wall when speaking or writing.\n\n2. **Guided Explore Phase:** Pair students with a peer buddy or provide a step-by-step visual checklist (with pictures) showing each step of fossil creation. Read directions aloud as students work.\n\n3. **Reduced Documentation:** Allow students to respond to Explore questions orally to the teacher instead of writing. Provide sentence starters: *\"I pressed the _____ into the clay. The imprint looks like _____. The sand represents _____.\"*\n\n4. **Concrete Examples:** Use multiple real objects (shells, bones, leaves) during Explain phase. Have students touch and examine them closely to strengthen vocabulary connections.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deep Dive into Fossil Types:** Introduce the concept of **body fossils** (preserved remains) vs. **trace fossils** (imprints, footprints, burrows). Have advanced students create multiple fossil types and classify them: *\"My shell is a body fossil. My footprint is a trace fossil. How are they different?\"*\n\n2. **Timeline Investigation:** Provide a simple geological timeline showing when different organisms lived (e.g., dinosaurs 65 million years ago, woolly mammoths 10,000 years ago, modern humans now). Ask: *\"What fossil evidence tells us when each animal lived?\"* Challenge students to predict what organisms might be fossilized millions of years in the future.\n\n3. **Fossil Detective Problem:** Present a scenario: *\"A scientist found two fossils in the same rock layer—a fish fossil and a plant fossil. What does this tell us about what that place was like millions of years ago?\"* Have students draw or write their inference with evidence.\n\n4. **Explore Erosion Connection:** Advanced students investigate how weathering (the Explore activity revealed this) can expose fossils in real rock. Set up a simple model using hardened play dough embedded with shells, and let students gently chip away layers to simulate how fossils are discovered.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil Hunt Simulation (Classroom or Outdoor):**\n   - Bury simple fossil replicas or shells in a sandbox or designated outdoor area.\n   - Provide students with small tools (spoons, paintbrushes) and a grid map.\n   - Students carefully excavate their \"fossils,\" document the location on the grid, and present findings: *\"I found an ammonite at grid square C-2. It was buried 4 inches deep.\"*\n   - **Connection:** Mirrors real paleontological excavation. Reinforces careful observation and documentation.\n\n2. **\"If I Were a Fossil\" Creative Writing & Art:**\n   - Students choose an organism they'd like to be (real or imaginary) and imagine it being fossilized millions of years from now.\n   - They write or draw: What would my fossil look like? What details would be preserved? What would future scientists learn about me?\n   - Share and display creations to build enthusiasm for the lesson.\n   - **Connection:** Deepens understanding of how organisms leave evidence and extends thinking into the future.\n\n3. **Rock & Fossil Collection Project (Take-Home/Long-Term):**\n   - Send students home with a \"Rock Detective\" sheet and a small bag.\n   - Invite them to collect small rocks from their yard or neighborhood, observe them, and bring them to class.\n   - Students examine each other's collections using hand lenses and compare textures, colors, and sizes.\n   - Discuss: *\"Could any of these rocks have fossils inside? What would we need to do to find out?\"*\n   - **Connection:** Extends learning to the home environment and fosters curiosity about Earth materials in daily life.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wash hands after handling play dough and natural materials. Check for allergies to any natural objects used.\n- **Preparation:** Pre-make a sample fossil imprint during the Engage phase to show students what to expect.\n- **Timing:** The Explore phase can feel long; keep students engaged by circulating and asking questions. Pair up students if time is tight.\n- **Real Fossils:** If available, having even one real fossil to pass around during the lesson dramatically increases engagement and authenticity.\n- **Photo Revisit:** Return to the original photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. Students' understanding deepens with repeated reference.\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Post vocabulary cards in the classroom throughout the week and review during morning meeting or transitions.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson honors the Third Grade level by using concrete, hands-on experiences to build understanding of abstract concepts like time and fossilization. The 5E structure ensures students discover concepts before formal instruction, leading to deeper, more meaningful learning.",
