Identify rocks as natural Earth materials and describe their observable physical properties (color, size, shape, texture).\n2. Explain how rocks interact with plants, soil, and other landscape materials in an outdoor environment.\n3. Observe and document evidence of weathering (such as moss, lichen, or surface changes) on natural rock samples.\n4. Design and build a stable rock structure while considering how rocks are used as resources in community landscapes.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the rock feature and house landscape\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Small rock samples (3-5 pieces) to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a projector or as a large printed image where all students can see clearly. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking—just observe.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing think-time before responses):\n   - \"What do you notice about the pile of rocks in the center of this landscape? What makes it interesting to you?\"\n   - \"Why do you think someone stacked these rocks here instead of just leaving them flat on the ground? What purpose might they serve?\"\n   - \"Look closely at the rocks themselves. What colors, shapes, and textures can you see? Do all the rocks look the same?\"\n   - \"If you looked at these rocks in 5 years, do you think they would look exactly the same? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** Display the image again and say: \"These rocks are part of a real landscape. I'm wondering: How do rocks become part of our environment, and what happens to them over time? Turn to a partner and share one wonder you have about these rocks.\"\n\n4. **Record 2-3 student wonderings on chart paper** and keep this visible throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore rocks as part of Earth's landscape—how they form, how they change, and how people use them. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 8-10 rocks of varied sizes and shapes (collected from outside, river rocks, or purchased from landscape supply)\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per student)\n- Hand lenses or simple magnifiers\n- Paper towels\n- Small containers of water (for wetting rocks to see color changes)\n- Observation sheets (printed template with labeled sketches)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Science notebooks or clipboards\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (read aloud and post visually):**\n\n1. \"Your group has received a collection of rocks. Before you touch them, sit in a circle and observe them for 1 minute. What do you notice?\"\n\n2. \"Using your magnifying glass, examine ONE rock carefully for 2 minutes. Look at:\n   - Its COLOR (is it one color or multiple colors?)\n   - Its TEXTURE (is it smooth, rough, bumpy, or layered?)\n   - Its SHAPE (is it rounded, angular, or flat?)\n   - Any MARKS (do you see lines, cracks, or patterns?)\"\n\n3. \"On your observation sheet, sketch the rock and label at least three things you noticed. Write 2-3 words describing what you feel and see.\"\n\n4. \"Now, WET your rock with water from the container. Look at it again. What changed? Did the colors look different? Record this observation.\"\n\n5. \"Compare YOUR rock to the rocks others in your group examined. What is the same? What is different? Fill in the comparison section of your sheet.\"\n\n6. \"Using the provided rocks, try to STACK them without them falling over. What do you notice about which rocks stack easiest? Why do you think that is?\"\n\n**How This Connects to the Photograph:**\n- Students handle the same materials visible in the rock stack photo\n- They discover why certain rocks work better for building (flat, stable shapes)\n- They observe natural variation in rocks, just as seen in the landscape photo\n\n**What Students Record/Document:**\n- Detailed sketches of rock properties\n- Descriptive words (color, texture, shape)\n- Observations about how water changes rock appearance\n- Notes comparing their rocks to others\n- Conclusions about which rocks stack best and why\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the texture?\" \"Why do you think that rock is easier to stack?\"\n- Do NOT tell students about weathering or properties—let them discover through observation\n- Encourage precise language: \"Tell me more about that texture. Does it feel rough or smooth?\"\n- If a student makes a connection to weathering, acknowledge it: \"Interesting thought! We'll explore that more in our next phase.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will document 3-4 observable physical properties of rocks\n- Students will discover that rocks have different characteristics\n- Students will notice that water can affect how rocks appear\n- Students will begin to understand that some rock shapes are more stable for stacking\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart with vocabulary and drawings\n- Photograph of the rock stack (display again)\n- Examples of weathered rocks (if available: rocks with moss, rust stains, or visible wear)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student science notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 groups to share ONE discovery from their exploration\n   - Highlight responses that mention: rock properties, stacking challenges, water effect on rocks\n   - Record key observations on chart paper under the heading \"What We Discovered About Rocks\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   - Display each term on the anchor chart with a student-friendly definition and simple illustration\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   \n   - **Rock:** A naturally occurring solid material made of minerals that comes from Earth. Rocks are not alive and we find them all around us.\n   \n   - **Weathering:** When rocks are slowly broken down or changed by wind, water, rain, ice, or living things (like plants or animals) over a very long time.\n   \n   - **Properties:** Characteristics or features of an object that we can observe or measure, such as color, size, shape, or texture.\n   \n   - **Mineral:** A natural, solid material that forms in the Earth and makes up rocks. Rocks are made of one or more minerals.\n   \n   - **Resource:** Something from nature that people find useful and use in their daily lives (like rocks for building or gardens).\n\n3. **Connections Back to the Photograph (3 minutes):**\n   - Project the landscape photo again\n   - Point to the rock stack: \"This structure shows HOW people use rocks as a RESOURCE. These rocks have specific PROPERTIES—see how they're flattish and stackable?\"\n   - Gesture to the moss/lichen on rocks: \"Over time, even these rocks will change. That's WEATHERING. Notice the dark areas on some rocks? That's evidence that weathering is already happening.\"\n   - Point to surrounding soil and plants: \"The rocks, soil, plants, and water all interact together to form this landscape. It's a SYSTEM where everything connects.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Turn to your partner and point to something in this photo that is a rock. Now tell your partner: What resource is being used here? What do you think will happen to these rocks in 10 years?\"\n   - Listen to 2-3 pair responses. Correct gently and affirm accurate observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use vocabulary terms (rock, weathering, properties, resource) in verbal or written responses\n- Students will connect properties they observed to how rocks are used in the landscape\n- Students will understand that rocks change over time due to weathering\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials (per group):**\n- 15-20 rocks of varied sizes (cleaned and sorted by approximate size: small, medium, large)\n- Cardboard base or shallow tray (8\" × 10\") for building stability\n- Ruler (to measure rock dimensions)\n- Design planning sheet (template provided)\n- Challenge cards with 3 difficulty levels (see below)\n- Optional: Digital camera or tablets for documenting designs\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge-Based Design Activity: \"Build Your Own Rock Feature\"**\n\n1. **Introduce the Challenge (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember how the rock pile in the photograph serves a purpose in the landscape? Your group is going to design and build YOUR OWN rock feature. But here's the challenge: it has to be STABLE (not fall over) AND use rocks of at least THREE different sizes.\"\n\n2. **Present Three Challenge Levels** (students select or are assigned):\n   \n   **Level 1 (Introductory):**\n   - Build a stable rock pile at least 8 inches tall using rocks of small, medium, and large sizes\n   - Draw your design before building\n   - Write one sentence explaining how your rock feature uses properties of rocks (shape, size, stability)\n   \n   **Level 2 (Grade-Level Standard):**\n   - Build a rock feature that is stable AND has a specific shape or purpose (e.g., a garden marker, a raised border, a decorative display)\n   - Plan your design on paper first, including measurements\n   - Write 2-3 sentences explaining how you used rock PROPERTIES to make it successful and how it could be a RESOURCE in a landscape\n   \n   **Level 3 (Advanced):**\n   - Design a rock feature that solves a real landscaping problem (e.g., prevents soil erosion on a slope, creates a raised planting bed, frames an outdoor area)\n   - Include a sketch with measurements and labels\n   - Write 4-5 sentences explaining how this feature uses rock resources, how weathering might affect it over time, and how it interacts with other landscape materials (soil, plants, water)\n\n3. **Building Process (10 minutes):**\n   - Groups plan their design on paper first (2 minutes)\n   - Build their structure (7 minutes)\n   - Teacher circulates, asking: \"Why did you choose that rock for that position?\" \"What would happen if you put a small rock on top of a larger one?\" \"How could weathering affect your structure?\"\n\n4. **Documentation (3 minutes):**\n   - Groups take a photo or sketch their finished structure\n   - Write or type a short reflection about what they learned\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without building for students\n- Ask probing questions about choices and stability\n- Encourage problem-solving: \"That fell over. What could you try differently?\"\n- Connect to weathering and resources: \"If rain and wind hit this structure for a year, what might happen?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will design and build a stable rock structure\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that rock properties determine function\n- Students will apply knowledge of resources to solve a design challenge\n- Students will articulate connections between their structure and real-world landscapes\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of Earth systems, rock properties, and resource use.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Teacher observation during Explore: Are students identifying and describing rock properties?\n- Teacher observation during Elaborate: Are students making decisions based on rock properties and stability?\n- Listening to partner conversations in Explain phase: Can students use vocabulary correctly?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\n**Administer on Day 1 or 2** (depending on pacing). Provide each student with this written assessment:\n\n---\n\n**Name: __________________ Date: __________________**\n\n**Rock and Resource Exit Ticket**\n\n**1. Look at the photograph of the rock landscape again. Describe THREE PROPERTIES (characteristics) of the rocks that helped them be stacked into a stable structure.**\n\n(Example format: \"The rocks are _______________ because _______________.\")\n\n**2. What is WEATHERING? Explain it in your own words, and give ONE example of how weathering might change the rocks in the photograph over time.**\n\n**3. Circle the answer: Rocks are a NATURAL RESOURCE because:**\n- a) They are pretty to look at\n- b) They come from Earth and people use them for many things\n- c) They have different colors\n- d) All of the above\n\n**4. Draw or describe how the rocks, soil, and plants in the landscape INTERACT with each other (work together).**\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student identifies 3+ rock properties; explains weathering with an example; selects correct answer about resources; describes interaction between rocks, soil, plants with 2+ accurate details.\n\n✓ **Approaching:** Student identifies 2 rock properties; explains weathering but with unclear example; selects correct answer; describes interaction with 1 detail.\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student identifies 1 property; explains weathering but lacks clarity; may not select correct answer; interaction description is vague or incomplete.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify 2-3 rock properties\n- 75% of students will explain weathering with a relevant example\n- 85% of students will recognize rocks as natural resources\n- 70% of students will describe rock-soil-plant interactions with specificity\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Guided Rock Observation:** Pair students with a peer or provide sentence starters during Explore:\n   - \"The color of my rock is _________________.\"\n   - \"When I touch it, it feels _________________.\"\n   - \"This rock is shaped like a _________________.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Support:** Provide a visual vocabulary reference sheet with pictures and simple definitions during all phases. Allow students to use this sheet during assessment.\n\n3. **Simplified Challenge (Elaborate):** Assign Level 1 challenge with teacher pre-sorting rocks into piles and providing a template drawing. Reduce writing requirement to one sentence with frame: \"I used _____________ rocks because they are _____________.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Weathering Investigation:** Provide rocks with visible weathering (moss, lichen, rust) and a hand lens. Ask: \"What organisms or processes caused these changes? How do you think this happened?\" Have students research and present findings about biological vs. chemical weathering.\n\n2. **Geosphere-Biosphere-Hydrosphere Model:** Challenge students to design a labeled diagram or 3D model showing how rocks, water, soil, plants, and air interact in the landscape. Include labels for each sphere and arrows showing interactions.\n\n3. **Real-World Application:** Ask students to survey the school grounds, take photos of human-made rock features (retaining walls, pathways, decorative stones), and analyze which rock properties made them suitable for each use. Have them present findings to the class.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Weathering Simulation Experiment:** Over 2 weeks, have students soak rocks in water daily, expose them to sunlight, or subject them to freeze-thaw cycles (small cups of water with rocks in a freezer). Document observable changes with photos and written observations. Create a poster showing evidence of weathering. (Earth Systems, time-extended investigation)\n\n2. **Community Geology Walk:** Take students on a neighborhood or school campus walk to identify rocks as natural resources in human-made structures (buildings, paths, gardens, decorative features). Create a photo essay or poster titled \"Rocks in Our Community\" with captions explaining what each rock feature does and how it demonstrates rock properties. (5-ESS3-1 application)\n\n3. **Mineral Identification and Collection:** Introduce the concept that rocks are made of minerals. Provide a simple mineral identification key (color, luster, hardness) and have students examine provided samples or collected rocks. Create a labeled mineral and rock collection display for the classroom. (Earth materials, classification skill-building)\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Sourcing rocks:** Contact local landscape supply companies, quarries, or garden centers for free/inexpensive rock samples. Alternatively, collect rocks from school grounds or nearby parks.\n- **Safety:** Ensure rocks are free of sharp edges. Check for any hazardous coatings or contaminants before student handling.\n- **Photograph engagement:** Printing multiple copies of the photograph allows students to annotate, circle observations, or use as reference during activities.\n- **Vocabulary retention:** Create a permanent \"Rock Reference\" anchor chart that stays posted throughout future Earth materials units.\n- **Extension into Grade 6:** This lesson sets a foundation for more advanced topics such as the rock cycle, mineral identification, and erosion processes.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly supports the goal of helping Fifth Grade students understand Earth systems by exploring how rocks—natural materials from our planet—interact with other landscape components and serve as essential resources in human communities.**",
