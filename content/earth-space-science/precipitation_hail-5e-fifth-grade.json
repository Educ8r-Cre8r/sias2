ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest in hail and precipitation by examining the photograph and activating prior knowledge about water and weather.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of hail on ground (displayed on projector, smart board, or printed copies)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Students' science notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image of hail on the ground and allow students 1-2 minutes of silent observation. Ask them to simply notice what they see without commenting yet.\n\n2. **Facilitate Discussion with Guiding Questions:**\n   - \"What do you observe in this photograph? Describe what you see in detail.\"\n   - \"What do you think these round, icy objects are? Have you ever seen something like this before?\"\n   - \"Where do you think these ice balls came from? How did they get on the ground?\"\n   - \"How is this different from snow or regular rain?\"\n\n3. **Activate Prior Knowledge:**\n   - Ask: \"We know water can be a liquid (like rain) or a solid (like ice in a freezer). What state of water do you think we're looking at here?\"\n   - Invite students to turn and talk with a partner: \"When is the last time you saw hail or heard about hail? What happened?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:**\n   - Pose this question and have students write or draw their prediction in their science notebooks: \"I wonder... how does water turn into ice balls in the sky and fall to the ground? What makes hail so different from regular rain or snow?\"\n\n**Transition:** \n\n*Now that we're curious about how hail forms, let's do an investigation where we model what happens to water droplets high up in the atmosphere.*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate phase changes and the conditions that form hail through a hands-on model-building activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- Small glass jar or clear plastic cup\n- Ice cubes (crushed into small pieces)\n- Water at room temperature\n- Aluminum foil or plastic wrap\n- Warm water (in a larger shallow container/pan)\n- Thermometer (optional but helpful)\n- Paper towels\n- Droppers or spoons\n- Notebook for observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Set Up the Model:**\n   - Fill your jar about halfway with crushed ice and add a small amount of room-temperature water to the ice. This represents the cold, upper atmosphere where hail forms.\n   - Cover the jar tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap to seal it.\n   - Label this jar \"Cold Air (Upper Atmosphere).\"\n\n2. **Create the Temperature Difference:**\n   - Place your sealed jar into the shallow pan of warm water. The warm water represents warmer air below the cold atmosphere. Be careful—the water should be warm but not dangerously hot.\n\n3. **Observe for 5-7 Minutes:**\n   - Watch the inside of the jar closely. What do you see forming on the inside of the lid or walls?\n   - Record your observations: Describe the water droplets you see and any changes that occur over time.\n   - If using a thermometer, record the temperature inside the jar.\n\n4. **Open and Investigate:**\n   - Carefully remove the jar from the warm water and open it.\n   - Look at the water that accumulated on the inside surfaces. Some may have frozen into tiny ice crystals.\n   - Record: Did the water change state? How? What made this happen?\n\n5. **Connect to Real Hail:**\n   - Discuss with your group: In real hail formation, water droplets in the clouds are frozen by very cold air. Then they fall and are pushed back up by strong winds, collecting more layers of ice, like our model showed water freezing on the cold jar surface.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups, asking probing questions: *\"What do you think is happening to the water droplets? Why are they gathering on the lid? How is this like what happens in a real storm cloud?\"*\n- Do NOT give answers; guide students to observe and infer.\n- Ensure warm water is at a safe temperature and supervise jar handling.\n- Have students draw a labeled diagram of their model setup in their notebooks.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe water droplets forming and condensing inside the jar.\n- Some students may observe small ice crystals forming as the model cools.\n- Students record observations and make connections between the model and real atmospheric processes.\n- Students recognize that temperature differences and phase changes are central to hail formation.\n\n---\n\n#### 3.

Does it stay on the ground, or does it move to other places?\"*\n\n2. **Create a Pie Chart or Bar Graph:**\n   - In groups of 3-4, students create a visual representation of Earth's water distribution using the provided percentages.\n   - Students label where hail/precipitation fits in this system (as part of the hydrosphere that moves between reservoirs).\n   - Each group explains: *\"Where does hail water go after it lands? Does it run into rivers and lakes? Soak into the ground? Evaporate back into the atmosphere?\"*\n\n3. **Model Earth's Water Systems:**\n   - On a large piece of paper, students draw or label a diagram showing:\n     - The atmosphere (where water vapor and clouds exist)\n     - The geosphere (land, soil—where hail lands)\n     - The hydrosphere (oceans, lakes, groundwater—where water ends up)\n   - Draw arrows showing how hail represents water moving from atmosphere to geosphere/hydrosphere.\n\n**Option B: Hail, Weather Preparedness, and Community Response (Addresses 5-ESS3-1)**\n\n1. **Introduce Real-World Context:**\n   - Ask: *\"Hail can damage crops, cars, and property.

Where does hail water end up?\"*\n- For Option B: Provide reliable, curated resources; help groups focus their research on one specific aspect.\n- Guide students to see that Earth science knowledge has real-world applications.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students demonstrate understanding that hail is one of several forms of precipitation and part of interconnected water systems.\n- Students create accurate visual representations of water distribution and movement.\n- Students articulate connections between understanding weather/water science and protecting communities and resources.\n\n---\n\n#### 5.
