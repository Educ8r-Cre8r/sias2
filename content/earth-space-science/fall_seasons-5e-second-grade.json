(connection: decomposition and water in soil)\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Observe and describe changes that happen to plants and leaves during autumn.\n2. Explain that seasonal changes are slow Earth events that happen naturally.\n3. Sort and classify leaves by observable properties (color, size, shape, texture).\n4. Predict and investigate what happens to fallen leaves over time.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the autumn yard with fallen leaves\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Real fallen leaves (collected beforehand or available for students to examine)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it. Allow students to look quietly for 10-15 seconds without speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause for thinking time after each):\n   - \"What do you see covering the ground in this picture? What colors are the leaves?\"\n   - \"Where do you think these leaves came from? Were they always on the ground?\"\n   - \"Have you ever noticed leaves changing color or falling from trees near your home or school? When does this happen?\"\n   - \"What do you think happens to all these leaves after they fall?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I'm wondering... if we collected all these leaves from the ground right now, what would happen to them if we checked on them again in a few weeks? Would they look the same, or would they change?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper. Accept all ideas without judgment.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become leaf scientists and do an experiment to find out what really happens to fallen leaves!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One resealable plastic bag per student or small group\n- Fallen leaves (varied colors and sizes) — collect before the lesson\n- Soil or potting soil\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Paper towels\n- Observation journals or paper for drawing and writing\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Leaf Observation & Sorting (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute a variety of fallen leaves** to each student or pair.\n\n2. **Give these directions:**\n   - \"Look carefully at your leaves. Feel them. What do you notice about the colors? Are they the same shade? Feel how the leaf feels — is it smooth? Rough? Stiff? Bendy?\"\n   - \"Sort your leaves into two groups. You decide how to sort them — maybe by color, size, or how they feel.\"\n   - \"Draw or write in your journal how you sorted your leaves and why.\"\n\n3. **Teacher Role:** Circulate and ask questions: \"What did you notice about the texture?\" \"Why did you put these leaves together?\" Do not direct sorting — let students decide.\n\n4. **Expected Outcome:** Students observe and describe leaf properties; practice classification.\n\n**Part B: Leaf Decomposition Setup (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute resealable bags.** Explain: \"We're going to create a small world for our leaves to see what happens to them.\"\n\n2. **Give these step-by-step directions:**\n   - \"Place a small handful of leaves in your bag.\"\n   - \"Add a small handful of soil.\"\n   - \"Spray the soil with water 2-3 times so it's damp, not dripping wet.\"\n   - \"Seal the bag tightly.\"\n   - \"Label your bag with your name and today's date.\"\n\n3. **Place bags in a warm, indirect-light location** where they will remain undisturbed for 2-3 weeks.\n\n4. **Students record in observation journals:**\n   - Draw what the leaves and soil look like today\n   - Write one sentence: \"I think my leaves will look like _______ in two weeks.\"\n\n5. **Expected Outcome:** Students set up an investigation; make predictions based on observations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms and pictures\n- Real fallen leaves still on display\n- The photograph from the Engage phase\n- Picture cards showing seasons (spring leaves, summer leaves, autumn leaves on trees, autumn leaves on ground)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Who wants to share how they sorted their leaves? Why did you choose that way?\"\n   - Listen to 3-4 students. Affirm different sorting strategies.\n   - \"Everyone sorted differently, and that's great science thinking!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n\n   Present each term on chart paper with an image or physical example:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Autumn (or Fall):** The season when the weather gets cooler, leaves change color, and leaves fall from trees. (Point to the photograph: \"This is autumn.\")\n   - **Seasonal Change:** Changes that happen to Earth and plants at different times of the year. (Show picture sequence of seasons: \"Leaves are green in summer, then they change colors in autumn.\")\n   - **Decompose:** When something breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces and becomes part of the soil. (Hold up a leaf: \"Over time, this leaf will decompose and become part of the ground.\")\n   - **Properties:** Characteristics you can observe, like color, size, shape, or texture. (Point to the leaves: \"Red, yellow, and bumpy are all properties of these leaves.\")\n   - **Slow Change:** Something that takes a long time to happen. (Explain: \"Leaves changing color happens slowly over weeks, not all at once.\")\n\n3. **Make Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at the photograph again. These leaves didn't just disappear — they're on the ground. What do you think will happen to them next? (Listen for responses.) Yes! They will slowly decompose and become part of the soil.\"\n   - \"This is a slow change. It takes weeks and weeks. This is an Earth event — something that happens naturally on our planet.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Can someone show me a property of these leaves?\" (Students point and describe.)\n   - \"Is autumn a fast change or a slow change? Why?\" (Slow — it takes weeks for leaves to change and fall.)\n   - \"What will happen to these leaves? What's that word that means they break down?\" (Decompose.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students understand vocabulary in context; recognize autumn as a seasonal, slow change; connect decomposition to the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart showing \"Where Do Autumn Leaves Go?\"\n- Students' observation journals\n- Optional: Simple picture book about seasons or trees (e.g., *Fall Leaves* by Loretta Holland or *Trees* by Gail Gibbons — read a 2-3 minute excerpt)\n- Colored paper and markers for a class mural or display\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-World Application Activity: \"Leaf Life Cycle\" (10 minutes)**\n\n   **Explain:** \"Let's trace what happens to a leaf from start to finish.\"\n\n   **Show or draw a simple life cycle on chart paper:**\n   - Stage 1: Leaf grows on a tree in spring/summer (green)\n   - Stage 2: Leaf changes color in autumn (yellow, red, orange)\n   - Stage 3: Leaf falls from the tree\n   - Stage 4: Leaf lands on the ground\n   - Stage 5: Leaf slowly decomposes and becomes soil\n   - Stage 6: New plants grow in that soil\n\n   **Student Task:**\n   - \"Draw or write about what happens to an autumn leaf. You can draw the stages, or write about what you think happens.\"\n   - \"Your leaf bag experiment will help us see if your prediction was right!\"\n\n2. **Class Mural or Display (5-10 minutes):**\n   - Create a simple visual display: one section shows \"Autumn Leaves (What We Observe)\" and another shows \"Under the Ground (What Happens Next).\"\n   - Students add drawings of leaves, soil, and decomposing leaves.\n   - Display around the classroom or in the hallway.\n\n3. **Teacher Role:** \n   - Prompt thinking with questions: \"What needs to happen for a leaf to decompose?\" (Water, warmth, time, soil organisms—keep it simple: \"The leaf gets broken into tiny pieces by water and time.\")\n   - Validate all attempts to represent the life cycle.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** Students explain the leaf life cycle; recognize decomposition as part of a natural cycle; apply vocabulary in drawings or writing.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of seasonal changes and decomposition.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe sorting activity: Can students identify and explain properties?\n- Listen to discussion responses: Do students use \"autumn,\" \"slow change,\" and \"decompose\" appropriately?\n- Review observation journal drawings and predictions: Do they show understanding of the process?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (end of Session 1 or 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a small paper or whiteboard. Ask these questions (read aloud; students can draw or write responses):\n\n1. **\"What season are we learning about? What happens to leaves in this season?\"**\n   - Success Criteria: Student names autumn/fall and describes leaves changing color or falling.\n\n2. **\"Is the change in leaves during autumn a fast change or a slow change? Why?\"**\n   - Success Criteria: Student says \"slow change\" and gives a reason (e.g., \"It takes many weeks\" or \"Leaves don't fall all at once\").\n\n3. **\"What will happen to the leaves on the ground? Use the word 'decompose' in your answer.\"**\n   - Success Criteria: Student explains leaves will decompose/break down over time and become part of soil.\n\n**Follow-Up (after 2-3 weeks):**\n- **Return to Leaf Bags:** Have students observe their sealed bags.\n  - \"What changed? Do the leaves look the same as when we started?\"\n  - Record observations: Are leaves breaking down? Has the color faded? Is the soil different?\n  - Compare predictions to actual results.\n  - This observation reinforces 2-ESS1-1 (evidence that Earth events can be slow).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students demonstrate understanding of autumn as a seasonal, slow Earth change.\n- Students explain decomposition as a natural process.\n- Student responses and drawings show they can identify leaf properties and predict change over time.\n- Leaf bag observations provide evidence of slow decomposition.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary with Pictures:** Provide a personal \"word card\" with pictures and words for autumn, seasonal change, decompose, and properties. Students reference during discussions and when writing/drawing.\n\n2. **Guided Sorting:** During Explore, provide a sorting frame with two labeled categories (e.g., \"Big Leaves\" and \"Small Leaves\" or \"Bright Colors\" and Dark Colors\"). Students sort into pre-defined categories rather than creating their own.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Responses:** Provide sentence starters:\n   - \"I see leaves that are __________ (color).\"\n   - \"The leaves feel __________.\"\n   - \"I think the leaves will __________ in two weeks.\"\n   - \"Decompose means __________.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Extended Prediction & Hypothesis:** Ask: \"Why do you think leaves decompose? What do you think helps them break down?\" (Introduce ideas: moisture, warmth, tiny organisms in soil, time.) Have students predict: \"If we put a leaf in a dry bag instead of a damp one, will it decompose faster or slower? Why?\"\n\n2. **Leaf Journaling Over Time:** Have students make detailed observations of their leaf bags weekly. Create a \"Decomposition Journal\" with sketches and measurements (How much has the leaf broken down? Has the color changed more?). Graph or chart the changes.\n\n3. **Research & Presentation:** Provide access to picture books or age-appropriate websites about deciduous vs. evergreen trees or why leaves change color. Have students create a simple poster or presentation: \"Why Do Leaves Change and Fall?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Nature Walk & Leaf Collection:** Take students on a guided walk around the school or neighborhood. Collect leaves at different stages (some still on trees, some on the ground, some partially decomposed if available). Create a \"Leaf Stage Display\" showing the progression from tree to soil. Discuss: \"What do you notice about the oldest leaves?\"\n\n2. **Sensory Leaf Exploration:** Create a sensory bin with fallen leaves in various states (fresh, partially dried, crumbling). Add soil, water, and small sticks. Let students manipulate and observe decomposition in progress. Discuss: \"Which leaves fall apart easiest? Why?\" (Connects to properties and decomposition.)\n\n3. **Seasonal Comparison Chart:** Create a class chart comparing what happens in each season to trees and leaves. Include illustrations or photos:\n   - Spring: New leaves grow\n   - Summer: Leaves are big and green\n   - Autumn: Leaves change color and fall\n   - Winter: Trees have no leaves; some seeds fall\n   \n   Discuss: \"Where does all this happen? On Earth! These are slow changes that Earth goes through every year.\"\n\n4. **Home Connection:** Send home a \"Leaf Detective\" worksheet asking families to:\n   - Collect 3-4 leaves from outside\n   - Draw them and describe their properties\n   - Predict: \"What will happen to this leaf?\"\n   - Return to school to share and compare with classroom observations.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Timing:** If your area is not in autumn during the lesson, collect and preserve fallen leaves before the season ends, or show photographs and video clips of autumn. The concepts (seasonal change, slow Earth events, decomposition) remain valid.\n- **Leaf Bag Timing:** Set bags up early in autumn (or simulate time passage by pre-preparing older leaf bags to show progression). Students are most engaged when they see real changes in their own bags.\n- **Safety Reminder:** Ensure students wash hands after handling soil and leaves.\n- **Cross-Curricular Link:** This lesson naturally connects to literacy (seasonal picture books), math (sorting, counting, time measurement), and social studies (seasonal traditions, harvest celebrations).",
