Identify and describe rocks and rock-like materials found in their local environment.\n2. Sort and classify rocks based on observable properties (size, color, texture).\n3. Explain that rocks are natural materials that people use for building and construction.\n4. Demonstrate respectful ways to observe and collect natural materials from the environment.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about rocks by exploring the photograph and activating prior knowledge about their environment.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (8.5\" × 11\" minimum, or projected on screen/smartboard)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: magnifying glasses for passing around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Display and Introduction:**\nDisplay the photograph prominently. Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see? This special rock is sitting in a place where cars and trucks drive. Let's explore it together!\"\n\n**Discussion Questions (ask 3-4 in sequence, pausing for responses):**\n1. \"What do you notice about this big rock? What colors do you see?\"\n2. \"Do you see lines or patterns on the rock? What do they look like?\"\n3. \"Where do you think this rock came from? How do you think it got here?\"\n4. \"Have you ever seen rocks like this near your home or school? Where?\"\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n\"I wonder what this rock is made of... and I wonder how long it took for this rock to get all those lines and colors. What do you wonder about rocks?\"\n\nRecord student wonderings on chart paper, drawing pictures alongside words for non-readers.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's go on a rock hunt and find rocks just like the one in this picture to explore up close!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rocks through hands-on collection and sensory observation, discovering their properties independently.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small collection bags or baskets (one per pair/small group)\n- Access to outdoor area with rocks (playground, garden bed, gravel area, or use pre-collected rocks in a bin)\n- Magnifying glasses (1-2 per group)\n- Observation recording sheet (simple template with pictures: large/small boxes, color swatches, texture pictures—rough/smooth)\n- Clipboards (optional, or use hard books as writing surfaces)\n- Hand sanitizer or wipes\n- Safety boundaries marked (rope, tape, or cones)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Today, you will be rock detectives! In small groups, walk to our rock-finding area (point out boundaries). Look for rocks that are different sizes, colors, and feels.\"\n\n2. \"Collect 3-5 rocks that are small enough to fit in your hand. Ask a partner, 'Is this rock interesting?' before you collect it.\"\n\n3. \"Use your magnifying glass to look very closely at your rocks. Notice:\n   - Is it rough or smooth?\n   - What color is it?\n   - Are there lines or patterns?\n   - Is it big or small?\"\n\n4. \"On your observation sheet, draw pictures of your rocks or point to pictures that match your rocks (rough vs. smooth, big vs. small, color colors).\"\n\n5. \"Wash your hands before coming back inside.\"\n\n**Connection to Photograph:**\n\"Look for rocks like the one in our picture—ones with lines or layers, or ones that feel rough or bumpy.\"\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Simple drawings of rocks collected\n- Pictures matched to rock properties (size, texture, color)\n- Teacher-scribed sentences: \"My rock is ___. I found it in the ___.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking open-ended questions: \"Tell me about that rock. What does it feel like? What color is it?\"\n- Point out interesting rocks without directing which ones to collect: \"I see a rock with interesting colors over there.\"\n- Encourage peer sharing: \"Show your partner your rock. How is it the same or different?\"\n- Facilitate safe collection (staying in bounds, gentle handling, not throwing).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents will have collected 3-5 rocks and identified at least one observable property (color, size, or texture) for each.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of rocks and their uses in human environments.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student-collected rocks (from Explore phase)\n- Large rock from the photograph (can use a printed image or bring a real rock if available)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple icons\n- Picture cards showing rocks in use (rocks in buildings, gravel in parking lots, rocks in gardens, decorative rocks)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out:**\nInvite 3-4 students to share their rocks with the class. Ask: \"What did you find? What does your rock look like?\" Display rocks on a table where all can see.\n\n**Introduce Key Vocabulary:**\n\n1. **Rock:** A hard, natural material made from stone. It comes from the Earth.\n   - *Icon: Picture of a rock*\n\n2. **Rough:** Not smooth; bumpy and uneven when you touch it.\n   - *Icon: Bumpy texture picture*\n\n3. **Smooth:** Flat and even; nice to touch, not bumpy.\n   - *Icon: Smooth texture picture*\n\n4. **Layer:** A stripe or band of something. Rocks have layers that tell how they were made.\n   - *Icon: Picture of striped/layered rock*\n\n5. **Natural material:** Something from nature (like rocks, wood, dirt) that people use.\n   - *Icon: Pictures of natural things*\n\n**Connections Back to Learning:**\nPoint to the photograph: \"See the layers in this big rock? Those lines show that this rock took a very long time to form. And look—it's in a parking lot! People use rocks like this to build roads and parking places.\"\n\nShow picture cards of rocks in use: \"Rocks help us build houses, make pathways, and make parking lots. We find rocks in many places in our town.\"\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Ask: \"Can someone point to a rough rock?\" (students point)\n- Ask: \"Can someone find a rock with stripes or layers?\" (students identify)\n- Ask: \"Where have you seen rocks in our neighborhood?\" (students respond)\n\n**Vocabulary Chart:**\nCreate a visible anchor chart with each vocabulary word, icon, and a student-friendly definition. Leave it posted for the Elaborate phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents can identify 2-3 vocabulary words and point to rocks that match their descriptions (e.g., \"a rough rock,\" \"a rock with layers\").\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by sorting rocks and discussing how people use rocks in their community.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Collected rocks from Explore phase\n- Sorting mats or large paper divided into sections (pre-drawn or created with tape)\n- Labels for sorting categories with pictures and words: \"Rough,\" \"Smooth,\" \"Big,\" \"Small,\" \"Light Color,\" \"Dark Color\"\n- Community helper picture cards (construction worker, geologist, landscaper) with images of rocks in use\n- Chart paper for recording\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Rock Sorting Investigation:**\n\n1. \"Now we're going to organize our rocks like scientists do! We'll sort them into groups based on what they look like and feel like.\"\n\n2. Display sorting mats with labels. Explain each category clearly with visuals.\n\n3. \"Choose a rock. Feel it. Look at it. Decide which group it belongs to. Place it on that mat. Then choose another rock.\"\n\n4. As students sort, ask: \"Why did you put that rock there? Does anyone have a rock that belongs in more than one group?\"\n\n5. Once sorting is complete, count rocks in each category: \"How many rough rocks did we find? How many smooth rocks?\"\n\n**Discuss: How Do Humans Use Rocks?**\n\nShow picture cards of rock uses. Ask:\n- \"What is this person doing with rocks?\"\n- \"Have you seen rocks being used this way in your town?\"\n- \"Why do you think people need rocks?\"\n\nTeacher scribes responses: \"We use rocks to make parking lots. We use rocks to build houses. We use rocks to make paths.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate sorting without directing answers; ask: \"What does this rock feel like? Where should it go?\"\n- Celebrate different sorting strategies: \"Some of you sorted by size, some by texture—both are good!\"\n- Record student thinking on chart paper for visual reference.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents successfully sort rocks into at least 2 categories and can explain one way that humans use rocks in their community.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rocks, their properties, and their use in the environment.\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- **Observe during Explore:** Are students accurately identifying and describing rock properties?\n- **Listen during Explain:** Can students use vocabulary words (rough, smooth, layer)?\n- **Watch during Elaborate:** Do students sort rocks logically and can they explain their sorting choices?\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment Activity (5-10 minutes):**\n\n**Option 1: Picture-Based Exit Task (for emerging readers/writers)**\nDisplay three rocks or rock pictures on the board. Ask each student individually or in small groups:\n1. \"Point to the rock that is rough.\"\n2. \"Point to the rock that is smooth.\"\n3. \"Where have you seen rocks near your home?\"\n\nRecord student responses with a checkmark on a simple checklist.\n\n**Option 2: Rock Detective Certificate**\nGive each student a simple paper with a picture of a rock and blanks to fill in:\n- \"I found a rock that was ___ (color).\"\n- \"My rock felt ___ (rough or smooth).\"\n- \"People use rocks to ___.\"\n\nTeacher scribes responses or students draw pictures. This becomes a keepsake and evidence of learning.\n\n**Option 3: Group Reflection Discussion**\nGather in a circle with collected rocks visible. Ask:\n- \"What did you learn about rocks today?\"\n- \"Where are rocks found?\"\n- \"Why are rocks important?\"\n\nTeacher records responses on chart paper with student names.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\nStudents have met learning objectives if they can:\n✓ Identify at least 2 observable properties of rocks (color, size, texture)\n✓ Use 2+ vocabulary words correctly (rough, smooth, rock, layer, natural material)\n✓ Identify at least one way humans use rocks in their community\n✓ Demonstrate respectful handling and observation of natural materials\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nMost kindergarteners will be able to describe a rock using 1-2 sensory words (color, texture) and name one place they've seen rocks. Advanced students will use multiple descriptors and explain why rocks are useful.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Pair with a strong language partner:** Pair a student with a peer who can model vocabulary use and sorting strategies. The student can observe, participate in decisions, and receive language modeling.\n\n2. **Use real objects only (no pictures):** For students who struggle with abstract representations, have them sort and observe only real collected rocks, not pictures. Provide a smaller number of rocks (2-3) to sort.\n\n3. **Pre-teach vocabulary with hands-on models:** Before the lesson, spend 2-3 minutes with this student group touching rough and smooth materials (sandpaper, silk, tree bark) while saying the words aloud. Use the actual photograph to point to layers while saying \"layers.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Multi-category sorting:** Challenge students to sort rocks by two properties at once (e.g., \"big AND rough,\" \"small AND smooth\"). Ask: \"Can you find a rock that is both big and smooth? Can you find one that is small and rough?\"\n\n2. **Predict and test weathering:** Provide a ziplock bag with a rock and water. Ask: \"What do you think will happen to this rock if we leave it in water for a few days? Why?\" Check at the end of the week and discuss.\n\n3. **Create a \"Rocks in Our Community\" drawing:** Have students draw or collage pictures of where rocks are used in their neighborhood (driveways, buildings, playgrounds). Ask them to label or describe each use orally.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rock Art Project:** Students paint collected rocks with washable paint to create painted rocks. Display them or return them to nature. Discuss: \"We found natural rocks. Now we've changed them with our ideas. Is this rock still a natural material?\" This extends thinking about how humans change the environment.\n\n2. **Classroom Rock Garden:** Create a small rock garden or display in the classroom. Students tend to it, add to it over time, and observe changes. Compare rocks that are left outside vs. inside. Discuss: \"Why might rocks change when they're outside in the weather?\"\n\n3. **Story Time Expansion:** Read *A Rock Is Lively* by Dianna Hutts Aston or *The Rock from the Sky* by Jon Muth (abridged). Discuss connections to rocks students found. Create a class book: \"Our Rock Adventures\" with drawings and dictated sentences about rocks found and where they were used in the community.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n**Safety Reminders:**\n- Establish clear boundaries for outdoor exploration.\n- Ensure students wash hands after handling rocks and dirt.\n- Inspect the collection area beforehand to remove hazards.\n- Supervise rock handling; discuss gentle, respectful observation.\n\n**Materials Prep:**\n- Scout your outdoor space 1-2 days before to ensure adequate rocks for collection.\n- Prepare sorting mats with labels in advance.\n- Print and laminate the photograph for durability.\n- Have picture cards of rock uses ready (can be hand-drawn).\n\n**Classroom Connection:**\nThis lesson directly relates to the photograph's real-world context—rocks in a parking lot. Students see how the Earth provides materials (rocks) that humans use to build and construct their community. This scaffolds the foundational understanding that will grow into later Earth and Space Science concepts about natural resources and human impact.",
