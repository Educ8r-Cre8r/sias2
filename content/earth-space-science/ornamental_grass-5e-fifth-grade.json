ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity about the frost-covered plants and activate prior knowledge about water and weather.\n\n#### Materials\n- Photograph (projected on screen or printed large format)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display and Wonder (5 minutes):**\nProject the ornamental grass photograph on the board without explanation. Allow 1–2 minutes of silent observation. Then ask students to turn to a partner and describe what they see in detail.\n\n**Facilitated Discussion (5–7 minutes):**\nAsk these specific questions to guide thinking:\n\n1. **\"What do you think this white, sparkly coating on the grass is? What could it be made of?\"** (Listen for guesses—frost, ice, snow, crystals, frozen water, etc. Do NOT correct; simply affirm curiosity.)\n2. **\"Have you seen something like this before? When and where?\"** (Connect to students' experiences—early morning in their yard, on car windows, on spider webs.)\n3. **\"How do you think the water got on top of these plants? Where did it come from?\"** (Guide them to think about air, weather, and water sources beyond rain.)\n4. **\"What do you think had to happen to the air or temperature for this to form?\"** (Introduce the idea that temperature matters; frost isn't the same as rain.)\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n\"If this is made of water, and we know water comes from oceans, lakes, and rivers, how did water get way up on these plant tips, and in a frozen form? Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Record on chart:** Write down student predictions. Save this to revisit in the Explain phase.\n\n#### Transition\n\"Today, we're going to become water detectives and figure out how frost forms and where water goes as it moves through different parts of Earth.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents discover how water changes states and condenses through hands-on investigation.\n\n#### Materials\n- **Per pair of students:**\n  - Small clear plastic cup or glass\n  - Warm water (about 1/2 cup; prepare ahead)\n  - Ice cubes\n  - Thermometer (optional but recommended)\n  - Paper towel or small cloth\n  - Water droplets or spray bottle with water\n  - Markers to label temperature\n  - Observation sheet (provided below)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Introduce the Investigation (2 minutes):**\n\"We're going to create frost indoors! We'll use a cold surface and warm, moist air to see condensation happen in real time. Your job is to observe carefully and record what you see.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Set up your cup:** Pour warm water into your cup (teacher pre-fills to save time). Note the temperature if using a thermometer.\n2. **Add ice:** Drop ice cubes into the warm water. The cup now has a very cold bottom surface (in contact with the ice water).\n3. **Wait and observe:** Watch the OUTSIDE of the cup for the next 5–10 minutes. What do you see forming on the outside surface?\n4. **Touch and record:** Gently touch the outside of the cup (if safe). Is it wet? Cold? Describe the texture.\n5. **Draw and label:** Sketch what the outside of the cup looks like at 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes. Label any water droplets or condensation.\n6. **Predict:** If we left this cup in a freezer for 30 minutes, what do you think would happen to those water droplets?\n\n**Observation Sheet for Students:**\n(Simple table or template provided on handout)\n\n| Time | What do I see on the outside? | Is it wet or dry? | Temperature of cup (if using thermometer) |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| Start | | | |\n| 5 min | | | |\n| 10 min | | | |\n\n**Connection to Photograph:**\n\"Just like the frost on the grass formed when cold air met moisture in the air, the water droplets on your cup are forming because the cold cup surface is meeting warm, moist air inside the cup. The air can't hold as much water when it's cold, so water condenses—it changes from invisible water vapor (gas) to tiny visible droplets (liquid).\"\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate among pairs, asking guiding questions:\n  - \"What's changing on your cup?\"\n  - \"Why do you think that's happening?\"\n  - \"How is this like what we saw in the frost picture?\"\n- Ensure ice is being used; refill warm water if it cools too quickly.\n- Do NOT explain the science yet—guide observation only.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students observe water droplets condensing on the cold cup exterior.\n- Students record observations and make a sketch showing visible moisture appearing over time.\n- Students recognize that cold surfaces + warm, moist air = condensation (though they may not use the term yet).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and Earth system connections after hands-on discovery.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Simple diagram template (see below)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Share-Out and Connection (5 minutes):**\n- Ask 3–4 pairs to briefly describe what they observed.\n- Write key observations on the board:\n  - \"Water droplets appeared on the cold cup.\"\n  - \"The cup was cold and the air inside was warm and wet.\"\n  - \"The droplets got bigger over time.\"\n- Show the frost photograph again: \"This is exactly what happened to the grass! Let's understand the science behind it.\"\n\n**Introduce Key Vocabulary (7–8 minutes):**\nWrite each term and definition on the board, using the photograph and students' observations as examples.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n1. **Condensation:** When water vapor (invisible water gas in the air) cools down and turns into liquid water droplets. *Example: \"On your cold cup, the water vapor in the warm air inside cooled when it touched the cold surface and turned into visible droplets.\"*\n\n2. **Frost:** Frozen water crystals that form when water vapor condenses AND freezes at the same time, usually when the temperature is below 32°F (0°C). *Example: \"In the photograph, the moisture in the early morning air froze directly into ice crystals on the grass because it was cold outside.\"*\n\n3. **Atmosphere:** The layer of air surrounding Earth that contains water vapor, oxygen, and other gases. *Example: \"Water vapor floats invisibly in the atmosphere until it gets cold.\"*\n\n4. **Hydrosphere:** All of Earth's water—oceans, lakes, rivers, groundwater, and water in the air. *Example: \"Frost is part of the hydrosphere; it's water that came from the hydrosphere and temporarily entered the atmosphere.\"*\n\n5. **System Interaction:** When different parts of Earth (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, geosphere) affect each other. *Example: \"Frost shows an interaction: the atmosphere (cold air), hydrosphere (water vapor), and biosphere (plants) all work together to create frost.\"*\n\n**Create a Simple Diagram (5–7 minutes):**\nDraw or project a simple labeled diagram on the board showing:\n- Sun (energy source)\n- Ocean/water body (labeled \"hydrosphere\")\n- Water vapor rising (labeled \"atmosphere\")\n- Cold ground/plant surface\n- Frost crystals forming (labeled \"where the systems interact\")\n- Arrows showing the cycle\n\nGive students a blank copy or ask them to sketch this in their science notebook, adding the vocabulary terms as labels.\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\nAsk quick comprehension questions:\n- \"Where does the water in frost come from?\" (the atmosphere/water vapor)\n- \"Why does water vapor turn into frost instead of staying as vapor?\" (because temperature drops below freezing)\n- \"Which Earth systems are involved in making frost?\" (atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere—the plants)\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students can define condensation, frost, and atmosphere using examples from their investigation.\n- Students draw or describe a model showing frost formation with at least three labeled Earth systems.\n- Students explain that frost is water from the atmosphere that has condensed and frozen on cold surfaces.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents apply water cycle and Earth system concepts to a new real-world scenario and deepen understanding.\n\n#### Materials\n- Printed scenario cards (one per small group; see below)\n- Chart paper or large paper for group posters\n- Markers and colored pencils\n- Access to the photograph (displayed still)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Scenario-Based Problem Solving (15–20 minutes):**\n\nDivide students into small groups (3–4 students each). Give each group a **different scenario card** (see examples below). Their task: **Predict where frost will form and explain why, using what they learned about Earth systems.**\n\n**Scenario Card Examples:**\n\n**Scenario 1 - The Farm:**\n*\"A farmer notices that frost appears on the grass in her field, but not on the dark asphalt driveway next to the field, even though both are outside. Why might this happen? Which surface is colder, and why?\"*\n\n**Scenario 2 - The Car Window:**\n*\"On a cold morning, your car window is completely covered in frost, but the windows of the house next to it have only a little frost. One building uses more heat than the other. How might the warmth inside buildings affect frost formation?\"*\n\n**Scenario 3 - The Lake:**\n*\"A town has a lake nearby. Frost forms on the grass around the lake later in the morning than on grass far from the lake. What property of water (or which Earth system) might explain this? Why might water affect the timing of frost?\"*\n\n**Scenario 4 - The Plant Leaves:**\n*\"Some plants have waxy leaves and others have fuzzy leaves. Frost forms more easily on fuzzy leaves. Why might the texture of a surface affect frost formation?\"*\n\n**Group Task:**\n1. Read the scenario aloud together.\n2. Discuss: What do you already know that helps explain this? (Use your investigation and the Explain vocabulary.)\n3. Make a prediction: Where will frost form, and why?\n4. Create a simple diagram or poster showing your thinking. Label the atmosphere, water vapor, cold surface, and frost.\n5. Write one sentence explaining which Earth systems are interacting in your scenario.\n\n**Gallery Walk (optional, 3–5 minutes):**\nPost group posters around the room. Have students do a quick gallery walk to see other groups' thinking.\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate among groups, asking:\n  - \"Where do you think the water is coming from?\"\n  - \"What has to be true about the temperature for frost to form?\"\n  - \"Which Earth systems are involved here?\"\n- Provide hints rather than answers; encourage students to reference their investigation.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Each group produces a labeled diagram or poster showing their scenario with at least two Earth systems identified.\n- Students write or verbally explain a prediction using the term \"condensation\" or \"frost\" correctly.\n- Groups demonstrate understanding that frost requires cold surfaces, moisture in the air, and specific conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of frost formation and Earth system interactions.\n\n#### Assessment Strategy\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- **During Explore:** Observe students' ability to describe changes on the cup and make connections to frost.\n- **During Explain:** Ask comprehension questions; listen for use of key vocabulary.\n- **During Elaborate:** Review group diagrams and explanations for evidence of systems thinking.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5–10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (digital or printed). Students complete the following:\n\n**Exit Ticket Prompts:**\n\n1. **\"Frost forms when two things happen. Name the two things. (Hint: One has to do with water, one with temperature.)\"**\n   - Expected answer: Water vapor from the air condenses/turns into liquid water AND the temperature is cold enough to freeze it.\n\n2. **\"Draw a simple picture showing how frost connects the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Label each system.\"**\n   - Expected: Diagram showing air with water vapor, a cold surface (plant or ground), and frost crystals forming where they meet.\n\n3. **\"In your own words, explain why frost formed on the outside of your cup during the investigation.\"**\n   - Expected: Student describes that cold cup surface cooled the warm air near it, causing water vapor to condense into droplets.\n\n4. **(Challenge)** **\"If the air temperature was 40°F instead of below 32°F, would you still get frost? Explain why or why not.\"**\n   - Expected: No, because water would condense but not freeze; you'd get dew instead of frost.\n\n#### Success Criteria\n\n**Student meets target if they:**\n- Correctly identify condensation and freezing as part of frost formation.\n- Label or describe at least two Earth systems involved in frost formation.\n- Explain that cold surfaces + water vapor in air = frost.\n- Use vocabulary (atmosphere, hydrosphere, condensation, frost) at least once in their response.\n\n**Advanced responses include:**\n- Explanation of why temperature below 32°F is essential.\n- Recognition that frost is part of the water cycle.\n- Connection to the photograph with specific details (e.g., \"The grass blades are cold because it's early morning, and the air has water vapor from...\").\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Scaffolded Observation Sheet:** Provide a sentence frame version for the Explore phase:\n   - \"At 5 minutes, I see _______________. The cup feels _______________.\"\n   - \"I think this is water because _______________.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Word Bank:** During Explain and Elaborate, provide a visual word bank with pictures or simple icons next to each term (atmosphere = cloud icon, hydrosphere = water drop, etc.). Allow students to reference this during writing and discussion.\n\n3. **Partner Exit Ticket:** Allow struggling learners to complete the exit ticket orally with a peer or teacher, or choose only 2 of the 4 questions to answer in writing. The teacher scribes or accepts drawings + verbal explanations.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Deep Dive - Water Cycle Connection:** Ask advanced students to create a full water cycle diagram that includes frost as ONE step, showing evaporation → condensation → precipitation → frost. Have them explain how frost is different from rain or snow.\n\n2. **Graphing Frost Data:** Provide data (temperature readings at different times of day and frost observations) and ask students to graph the relationship between temperature and frost formation. Ask: \"At what temperature does frost first appear? What does this tell us about water?\"\n\n3. **Research Extension:** Ask advanced learners to investigate and report on:\n   - How meteorologists predict frost warnings.\n   - Why frost harms some plants more than others.\n   - Why frost is important for agriculture (some crops need frost; others don't).\n   - The difference between frost, dew, and rime ice.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frost Forecast Project (homework or long-term activity):**\n   - Students track local weather forecasts for 1–2 weeks.\n   - Each night, they predict whether frost will form based on temperature and humidity data provided by a weather website.\n   - They observe their yard or school grounds the next morning and record whether frost actually formed.\n   - They create a simple bar graph or table showing the relationship between predicted low temperature and actual frost occurrence.\n   - **Connects to:** 5-ESS2-1 (systems interaction) and developing observation skills.\n\n2. **Frost Protection Challenge:**\n   - Present this real-world scenario: \"A gardener wants to protect delicate plants from frost damage. What could they do?\"\n   - Students brainstorm methods (cover plants, spray water, place dark objects nearby, etc.) and explain the SCIENCE behind why each method might work using concepts of temperature, water, and Earth systems.\n   - **Connects to:** 5-ESS3-1 (protecting Earth's resources) and practical application of science knowledge.\n\n3. **Comparative Investigation - Different Surfaces:**\n   - Provide students with various materials (metal, plastic, dark cloth, light cloth, wood, soil).\n   - On a cold morning or in a freezer setup, place these materials outside or in a cold environment and observe which ones develop frost first and most heavily.\n   - Students hypothesize why based on color, texture, and ability to lose heat (thermal properties).\n   - Create a poster or chart showing results and explaining the science.\n   - **Connects to:** Properties of matter, heat transfer, and careful observation.\n\n---\n\n## Standards Alignment Summary\n\n| NGSS Standard | How It's Addressed in This Lesson |\n|---|---|\n| **5-ESS2-1** (Systems Interaction) | Students observe and explain how the atmosphere (water vapor, cold air), hydrosphere (water), and biosphere (plants) interact to form frost in the Explore and Elaborate phases. They create models showing these interactions. |\n| **5-ESS2-2** (Water Distribution) | The lesson contextualizes frost as a phase of water within Earth's hydrosphere and shows how water moves between reservoirs (oceans → atmosphere → surface). The extension activity on water cycle deepens this understanding. |\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Preparation Notes\n\n1. **Before Lesson 1 (Engage):**\n   - Prepare the photograph for projection.\n   - Create discussion question posters or slides.\n   - Write exit ticket templates or have digital access ready.\n\n2. **Before Lesson 2 (Explore):**\n   - Prepare warm water (about 50–60°F; can be lukewarm tap water) and place in a pitcher to distribute quickly.\n   - Gather ice cubes; freeze extras the day before.\n   - Prepare printed observation sheets or have them displayed digitally.\n   - Test the demonstration yourself to verify condensation forms within the timeframe.\n\n3. **Before Lesson 3 (Explain & Elaborate):**\n   - Create or print scenario cards for each group.\n   - Prepare blank diagram templates or have chart paper ready.\n   - Display the photograph again for reference.\n\n4. **Classroom Setup:**\n   - Ensure students work in pairs or small groups with adequate table space.\n   - Have markers, colored pencils, and large paper accessible.\n   - If possible, have a place to display student work (gallery walk space).\n\n5. **Safety Notes:**\n   - Warm water should be warm, not hot (test temperature before giving to students).\n   - Supervise ice cube use to ensure no students place them directly on skin for extended periods.\n   - Ensure all materials are non-toxic and age-appropriate.\n\n---\n\n## Connection to Photograph\n\nThe ornamental grass photograph is the **visual anchor** for this entire lesson:\n- It shows the **product of condensation and freezing** (frost crystals), making the invisible visible.\n- The delicate structure of the frost on the spiky grass demonstrates how water vapor in the atmosphere becomes a solid, clinging to surfaces.\n- The lighting in the photo—showing the crystalline detail—emphasizes that frost is made of ice/frozen water, not just moisture.\n- Students see real-world evidence that atmospheric water interacts with living things (biosphere), grounding the lesson in observable phenomena.\n\nBy returning to the photograph in each 5E phase, students connect their investigation (cup), vocabulary (atmosphere, hydrosphere, condensation, frost), and applications (scenarios) to authentic, compelling imagery.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is designed to be engaging, hands-on, and rigorous while remaining fully accessible to Fifth Grade learners. It emphasizes systems thinking—a cornerstone of Earth and Space Science—and creates multiple opportunities for students to **observe, discover, explain, and apply** understanding.",
