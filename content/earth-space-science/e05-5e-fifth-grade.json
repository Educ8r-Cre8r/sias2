Lichen and moss break down rock material, demonstrating how living organisms contribute to rock breakdown.\n- **Interactions Between Earth Systems:** The photograph displays interconnections between the geosphere (rock), biosphere (lichen, moss, grass), hydrosphere (moisture enabling growth), and atmosphere (sunlight and air supporting organism growth).\n- **Patterns of Organism Distribution:** Lichen and moss grow preferentially on the shaded, moister side of the rock, demonstrating how organisms respond to environmental conditions and how microhabitats exist within a small space.\n- **Slow Changes to Earth's Surfaces:** Over years and decades, the combined action of weather, water, and living things gradually changes rock structure and shape—a key ESS concept about Earth's dynamic systems.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Lichen Detectives: How Life Changes Rocks**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or one 90-minute block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-ESS2-1 (Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Describe how living organisms (lichen and moss) and weather interact with rocks over time.\n2. Identify evidence of weathering and organism growth on rock surfaces.\n3. Explain how the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere work together to change Earth's surface.\n4. Design and communicate observations about how organisms and nonliving things interact in a small outdoor habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about the rock's unusual appearance and activate prior knowledge about rocks and living things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (or digital display via projector/screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or as a printed poster where all students can see it clearly. Do not explain anything yet.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (in order, pausing for think-pair-share after each):\n   - *\"What do you notice about this rock? What makes it look different from a normal, plain rock?\"*\n   - *\"What are all the different colors and patterns you see on the rock's surface? Where is each color located?\"*\n   - *\"If you could touch this rock, what do you think it would feel like in different spots?\"*\n   - *\"What do you think is growing on this rock, and why might it be growing more on some parts than others?\"*\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** *\"Here's a mystery: This rock is slowly breaking apart, even though no one is hitting it with a hammer. What do you think is breaking it down? Turn to a partner and make a prediction.\"*\n\n4. **Chart Responses:** Write student predictions on chart paper without correcting them. Explain that they will become \"rock detectives\" to test their ideas.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to observe our own rocks up close and discover what causes them to change, just like the rock in this photograph.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rock surfaces and living organisms through hands-on observation and data collection.\n\n**Materials:**\n- One smooth rock (granite or similar) per student pair, collected from schoolyard or purchased from garden/craft store\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (one per student pair)\n- Spray bottles with water\n- Paper towels\n- Data collection sheet (provided below)\n- Colored pencils\n- Optional: Small brushes to gently remove debris\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Get a rock and a hand lens.** With your partner, sit in a safe outdoor space where you can observe the rock closely.\n\n2. **Observe without water first.** Use your hand lens to examine the rock's entire surface. Look for:\n   - Smooth areas and rough areas\n   - Cracks or tiny holes\n   - Any greenish, grayish, or whitish growth\n   - Different colors or patterns\n   \n   *Record what you see:* Sketch the rock on your data sheet and label the areas where you see growth or discoloration.\n\n3. **Spray the rock lightly with water.** Notice how the wet areas look different. Use your hand lens again to observe:\n   - Do cracks look deeper or wider when wet?\n   - Does any growth look more visible when wet?\n   - Are there any tiny organisms you can see more clearly now?\n   \n   *Record:* Note how the rock changed when wet. Draw arrows or notes on your sketch.\n\n4. **Predict and observe locations.** Ask yourselves: *\"Where is there more growth—on the sunny side or the shady side? On smooth areas or rough areas?\"* Check your prediction by examining both sides of the rock if possible.\n\n5. **Gently rub a small area** with a damp paper towel where you see the most growth. Observe what comes off (the colored growth material). This is mostly lichen and moss.\n\n   *Record:* Describe what you found. Did the rock change color where you rubbed it?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among student pairs. Ask guiding questions like: *\"What do you notice about where the green growth is? Why might it be there and not on the sunny side?\"* and *\"What do you think happens to the rock when water seeps into these cracks?\"*\n- Do **not** tell students what lichen is yet; let them describe what they observe.\n- Encourage students to use descriptive language: \"crusty,\" \"bumpy,\" \"flaky,\" \"crumbly,\" etc.\n- Ensure students handle rocks gently and do not break them.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will identify lichen/moss growth on rocks and note it is more prevalent on shaded, moist areas.\n- Students will observe that water changes the appearance of the rock and may seep into cracks.\n- Students will create a sketch with labeled observations, including evidence of weathering (cracks, rough texture) and organism growth.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and explain the interactions students discovered.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Vocabulary cards or poster\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather as a class** with rocks still visible. Ask: *\"What did you discover about our rocks? What was growing on them?\"*\n\n2. **Facilitate a share-out:** Have 2–3 student pairs share one observation each. Record key words on chart paper as students speak.\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary** in context:\n\n| **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Lichen** | A living organism (made of fungus and algae together) that grows on rocks and tree bark. It looks like a crust or bumpy coating and is often greenish, grayish, or white. |\n| **Weathering** | The slow breaking down or wearing away of rocks due to water, ice, wind, heat, and living things over a very long time. |\n| **Microhabitat** | A very small area (like a shady spot on a rock) where specific plants and animals live because the conditions are right for them. |\n| **Interaction** | When two or more things affect each other. For example, water interacts with rock, and organisms interact with both. |\n| **Geosphere** | All the rocks, soil, and ground that make up Earth's solid surface. |\n| **Biosphere** | All the living things on Earth, including plants, animals, and tiny organisms like lichen. |\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - *\"Remember the rock we saw at the beginning? The white and green colors were lichen and moss—living things.\"*\n   - *\"Those organisms need moisture, so they grow more on the shaded side where it stays wetter longer. That's a microhabitat.\"*\n   - *\"Over many years, these organisms and water slowly break down the rock. That's weathering.\"*\n\n5. **Explain the interaction model:** Draw or display a simple diagram on the board:\n\n   ```\n   Geosphere (rock)\n         ↓ (interacts with)\n   Biosphere (lichen, moss) + Hydrosphere (water/moisture) + Atmosphere (sunlight, air)\n         ↓ (result)\n   Rock slowly breaks apart\n   ```\n\n   *\"All of these parts work together. None of them break down the rock alone, but together they slowly change it.\"*\n\n6. **Check for Understanding:** Ask:\n   - *\"Why does more lichen grow on the shady side of the rock?\"* (It stays wetter there; lichen likes moisture.)\n   - *\"What would happen if there was no water on a rock?\"* (Lichen couldn't grow; weathering would be much slower.)\n   - *\"Is weathering fast or slow?\"* (Very slow; it takes many years.)\n\n**Vocabulary:** (Anchor these words on a classroom poster for reference.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can define and use the terms lichen, weathering, and microhabitat in sentences.\n- Students understand that weathering involves interactions between living and nonliving things.\n- Students can explain why organisms like lichen prefer certain parts of a rock (moisture, light).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to a new scenario and deepen thinking about Earth systems interactions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student rocks (from Explore)\n- Chart paper\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: Photos of different weathered rocks (cliff faces, old tombstones, boulders in nature)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Design a Microhabitat (Hands-on)**\n\nStudents work in pairs to design the *ideal* location to place their rock outdoors to speed up weathering.\n\n1. Ask: *\"If you want this rock to weather and get more lichen growth, where would you place it in our schoolyard? Why?\"*\n\n2. Students sketch a location diagram showing:\n   - Sunny vs. shaded spot\n   - Near water source or on dry ground\n   - Protected or exposed to wind/rain\n   - Explanation of their choices using new vocabulary\n\n3. Have students explain their design choices to the class, using phrases like: *\"The biosphere will grow better there because…\"* or *\"Water from the hydrosphere will…\"*\n\n**Option B: Weathering Story (Verbal/Written)**\n\nStudents create a narrative or comic strip showing the \"life of a rock\" over 100 years:\n\n- Panel 1: A freshly broken piece of granite (no organisms)\n- Panel 2: First lichen appears (5 years later)\n- Panel 3: More growth, rock surface rougher (20 years later)\n- Panel 4: Visible cracks and pitting; moss joins lichen (50 years later)\n- Panel 5: Rock significantly changed and smaller (100 years later)\n\nStudents label each panel with vocabulary and explain what interactions are happening at each stage.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Listen to student explanations and ask: *\"How do the geosphere and biosphere interact there?\"* or *\"What role does water play in your design?\"*\n- Affirm correct use of vocabulary and logical reasoning.\n- Gently redirect if students think weathering happens quickly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students apply understanding of microhabitats to real-world contexts (schoolyard).\n- Students demonstrate understanding of interactions by explaining how location affects organism growth and weathering rate.\n- Students communicate ideas using new vocabulary in context.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of Earth systems interactions and weathering.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- Observation checklist during Explore: Did students identify lichen growth and note its location preference? Did they observe water's effects?\n- Listen-in during Explain share-out: Do students use vocabulary correctly?\n- Elaboration activity quality: Can students reason about how systems interact?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with this written prompt or conduct verbally for struggling readers:\n\n---\n\n**\"Weathering Detective\" Exit Ticket**\n\n**Name: _________________ Date: _________________**\n\n**Look at this picture of a rock with lichen on it.**\n\n1. **What three things are helping to break down this rock?** (Hint: One is living, one is water, one is in the air.)\n   - ________________________\n   - ________________________\n   - ________________________\n\n2. **Why do you think there is more lichen on one side of the rock than the other?**\n   \n   _________________________________________________________________\n\n3. **In 50 years, how might this rock look different? Describe one change.**\n   \n   _________________________________________________________________\n\n4. **Draw a simple picture showing how water, lichen, and the rock interact.**\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ Student identifies at least 2–3 interacting systems (geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere).\n- ✓ Student explains that lichen prefers moist or shaded areas.\n- ✓ Student describes a change caused by weathering over time.\n- ✓ Student attempts to show interactions in a drawing or explanation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most students will correctly identify that water, organisms, and rock interact.\n- Students will show understanding that weathering is slow and involves multiple factors.\n- Students will recognize microhabitats and organism preferences.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"lichen,\" \"weathering,\" and \"water\" instead of \"geosphere,\" \"biosphere,\" etc. Build toward formal terms gradually.\n2. **Guided observation sheet:** Provide a data sheet with pictures and sentence starters: *\"I see _____,\" \"The wet rock looks _____ because _____.\"\"*\n3. **Peer pairing:** Pair with a strong reader/observer during Explore. Let them be the recorder while the struggling student directs observations.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Research assignment:** Have students research how weathering affects human structures (buildings, monuments, roads). Present findings on how we prevent or manage weathering.\n2. **Rate weathering variables:** Ask students to hypothesize: *\"Which is more important for weathering—shade and moisture, or freezing and thawing? Design an experiment to test this.\"* (This connects to scientific inquiry.)\n3. **Expand the systems model:** Challenge them to add feedback loops: *\"If weathering creates soil, what grows in soil? What does that plant do to more rock?\"* (Introduces cycles and complex systems thinking.)\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Lichen Survey Walk:** Take students on a schoolyard walk to find rocks, trees, and surfaces with lichen. Create a map showing where lichen is most common. Discuss: *\"What do all these places have in common?\"* (Shade, moisture, old surfaces.)\n\n2. **Rock Breakdown Over Time:** Place a rock in a clear plastic container with damp paper towels and a light source. Observe weekly for weathering changes and lichen/mold growth over a month. Graph the visible changes.\n\n3. **Design a Weathering Resistance Challenge:** Have students use small blocks of soap or chalk as \"pretend rocks\" and subject them to water, scratching, and freezing to model different weathering processes. Which method breaks down the material fastest? This helps students test variables and understand that multiple weathering agents work together.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Real rocks work best:** If possible, collect rocks from your schoolyard so students see familiar features and can revisit the rocks throughout the year to track slow changes.\n- **Timing flexibility:** This lesson can be split into two sessions or taught as one 90-minute block. Session 1 could end after Explore; Session 2 covers Explain through Evaluate.\n- **Safety reminder:** Ensure students handle rocks gently and wash hands after the activity (water with lichen/moss present).\n- **Outdoor access:** This lesson assumes access to an outdoor space or the ability to bring rocks indoors. If neither is available, substitute with high-quality photographs of rocks with lichen at different weathering stages.\n- **NGSS Alignment Note:** This lesson prioritizes 5-ESS2-1 by explicitly modeling how geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere interact. The photograph itself is evidence of these interactions in a real-world context.",
