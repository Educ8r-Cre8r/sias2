Identify and describe visible layers in sedimentary rock and explain what each layer represents.\n2. Explain how erosion and weathering change rocks over time using evidence from the photograph.\n3. Model the formation of rock layers using classroom materials to demonstrate how Earth's crust develops in stages.\n4. Analyze how understanding rock layers helps us learn about Earth's past environments and protect our natural resources.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the stratified rock (photograph)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen without context. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (one at a time, allowing 15-20 seconds thinking time before responses):\n   - \"What do you notice about this rock? What makes it look different from other rocks you've seen?\"\n   - \"Do you see any patterns? What do the lines or stripes tell you?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this rock has so many different colored layers stacked on top of each other?\"\n   - \"If this rock could tell a story, what do you think it might say?\"\n\n3. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper under the heading \"What We Want to Know About Layers.\" Accept all responses without judgment.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"This rock is like a book written in stone. Each page tells part of Earth's story. Today, we're going to become rock detectives and learn how to read what these layers are telling us.\"\n\n**Transition:** Now that we're curious about what these layers mean, let's do some investigating to discover how rocks with layers form.\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small clear plastic cups or jars (one per pair/group)\n- Sand (fine and coarse, different colors if possible—or use regular sand and soil)\n- Pebbles/small gravel\n- Water\n- Spoons for stirring\n- Newspaper or paper towels for cleanup\n- Paper plates\n- Magnifying glasses (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Setup:** Divide students into pairs. Distribute materials.\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Fill your cup about one-quarter full with sand (the finest material). Gently press it down with a spoon so it's flat on the bottom.\"\n\n2. \"Add a thin layer of small pebbles on top of the sand. Press gently.\"\n\n3. \"Add another layer of coarser sand or soil on top of the pebbles. Press gently.\"\n\n4. \"Add water slowly to your cup until it's about half-full. Watch what happens to your layers.\"\n\n5. \"Observe for 2-3 minutes. The heavier particles will settle to the bottom, and lighter particles will float and settle on top—just like in nature when water carries rock materials.\"\n\n6. \"Sketch what you see in your cup on a piece of paper. Label each layer and describe what's in each one.\"\n\n7. \"Now, compare your cup to the rock in the photograph. What do you notice? Are there similarities?\"\n\n**What to Record:**\n- Sketch of layers in the cup with labels\n- List of what materials ended up in each layer and why\n- One sentence comparing their model to the rock photograph\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Why do you think the heavier materials sank to the bottom?\" \"Which material settled first?\" \"What might have caused these layers to stick together and turn into rock?\"\n- Do *not* explain the answer—allow discovery.\n- Use a think-pair-share: have pairs turn to another pair and discuss what they notice.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that materials separate by size and weight in water.\n- Students recognize that the layers in their cup are similar to the photograph's layers.\n- Students begin to hypothesize that water is involved in layer formation.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Student sketch work from Explore phase\n- Visual anchor chart (you create, or use provided)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out (5 minutes):** Invite 3-4 student pairs to briefly describe what they observed in their cups and how it compared to the photograph. Display student sketches side-by-side with the rock photograph.\n\n2. **Teacher-led mini-lesson (10 minutes):**\n   - Point to the rock photograph and say: \"What you discovered in your cups is exactly how rocks like this one form—through **layering and settling.** Let me show you how this happens over millions of years.\"\n   - Use simple narrative: \"Imagine heavy rain washing rock pieces down a hillside into a river. The heaviest pieces sink first. Lighter pieces float farther downstream and settle later. Over thousands of years, more and more layers pile up. The weight of all these layers presses down, squeezing out water and gluing the particles together. This is how **sedimentary rock** forms.\"\n   - Point out the evidence in the photograph: \"See how each layer is a different color or thickness? That tells us different materials arrived at different times. Maybe one layer came from a river, another from a volcano, another from ocean mud.\"\n   - Connect to **erosion and weathering:** \"You can also see that this rock is breaking apart. Wind, water, and weather are wearing it down—that's called erosion. Someday, these pieces will become part of new layers somewhere else.\"\n\n3. **Check for understanding (3 minutes):** Ask: \"Using what you learned, explain why the bottom layer in your cup looked different from the top layer. Turn and tell a partner.\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Sedimentary Rock** | Rock made from pieces of older rocks that get pressed and glued together by weight and time. |\n| **Layer/Strata** | A sheet-like band of rock that formed during one time period, stacked on top of or under other layers. |\n| **Erosion** | The wearing away of rock and soil by wind, water, or weather. |\n| **Weathering** | The breaking down of rock into smaller pieces by rain, frost, wind, or other natural forces. |\n| **Geosphere** | The solid, rocky parts of Earth—all the rocks, soil, and land. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and define sedimentary rock, erosion, and weathering.\n- Students understand that layers represent different time periods and materials.\n- Students see the connection between their model and real Earth processes.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photographs of different real-world locations showing layered rock (you can project these or print them)\n- Examples: Grand Canyon layers, road cuts, quarries, cliff faces\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Optional: samples of different rock types if available\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Real-World Connection Exploration:**\n\n1. Show 2-3 photographs of layered rocks in real-world settings (Grand Canyon, a highway road cut, a quarry, or a cliff face).\n\n2. **Guided analysis:** For each image, ask:\n   - \"What do you see? How many layers can you count?\"\n   - \"What do you think caused this rock to look different in the different layers?\"\n   - \"How could scientists use these layers to learn about Earth's past?\"\n\n3. **Application Task—\"Protecting Our Rocks\":**\n   - Explain: \"People use rocks for many things—building roads, making cement, extracting resources. But erosion can damage these rocks quickly. Communities have to figure out how to protect them.\"\n   - Show a real example: Highway cuts with loose, eroding rock, or a quarry where rocks are being mined.\n   - Ask: \"What problems do you see? How might erosion affect this place? What could people do to protect the rocks or prevent damage?\"\n   - Have students work in pairs to draw or write one idea for protecting rocks in their community (e.g., planting plants to hold soil, building barriers, careful mining practices).\n\n4. **Share ideas on chart paper:** Create a class list titled \"Ways We Can Protect Earth's Rocks and Reduce Erosion.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide analysis without giving away answers.\n- Connect back to the original photograph: \"Just like the rock in our photo is wearing away, these places are too. Understanding how rocks form and change helps us take care of Earth.\"\n- Affirm creative, practical thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply erosion and weathering concepts to new situations.\n- Students understand human responsibility in protecting Earth's resources.\n- Students recognize that rock layers tell stories about time and environmental change.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n- Observe student sketches and descriptions during Explore.\n- Listen to pair-share discussions during Explain.\n- Note quality of ideas during Elaborate real-world activity.\n\n**Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes, end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper. Ask them to answer these questions:\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Sketch a sedimentary rock with at least 3 layers. Label what each layer might contain and what it tells us about the past.\n\n2. **Explain:** In 2-3 sentences, describe what erosion and weathering do to rocks. Use the word \"geosphere\" in your answer.\n\n3. **Apply:** If you were a scientist studying this rock's layers, what could you learn about Earth's history?\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery when they:\n- ✓ Accurately identify and label rock layers in their sketch.\n- ✓ Define erosion and weathering with examples.\n- ✓ Make a reasonable inference about what a layer tells us (e.g., \"A layer of sand tells us water once flowed here\").\n- ✓ Connect layers to Earth's history or past environments.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets show students can identify layers and explain their formation.\n- Students distinguish between erosion and weathering.\n- Students use vocabulary appropriately (sedimentary rock, geosphere, layers, erosion, weathering).\n- Students demonstrate understanding that rock layers are a record of Earth's past.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide a labeled diagram template** during the Elaborate phase so students can simply match labels to parts of the rock photograph rather than drawing from scratch.\n\n2. **Use a sentence frame for the exit ticket:**\n   - \"This layer looks like _____ because _____.\"\n   - \"Erosion happens when _____.\"\n   - \"This rock tells us that _____.\"\n\n3. **Pair with a stronger reader/writer** during Elaborate. One student describes ideas aloud; partner scribes on chart paper.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Introduce the concept of relative age:** \"If you see three layers stacked, which is oldest? Why?\" Have students order photographs of rock formations from oldest to youngest layers and justify their reasoning.\n\n2. **Research extension:** Assign students to research the **rock cycle** (igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary) and create a diagram showing how sedimentary rocks fit into the larger cycle. Present findings to class.\n\n3. **Critical thinking challenge:** \"If sedimentary rocks tell Earth's story, what do you think caused the layers in this rock to be tilted or bent?\" (Introduce the idea of plate tectonics, mountain-building, or earthquakes in simple terms.) Have students hypothesize and sketch a scenario.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Layered Jar Art + Science Journal:** Students create colorful layered sand jars (using different colors of sand or painted rice) to take home. Inside, they glue a written explanation: \"This jar shows how sedimentary rocks form. Each layer represents _____. This process takes _____.\" (Homework/follow-up)\n\n2. **Field Investigation:** Take students on a local \"rock walk\" to find evidence of erosion, weathering, or layered rocks in your community (road cuts, exposed stone, construction sites, natural outcroppings). Students photograph or sketch evidence and present findings in a \"Field Report\" poster.\n\n3. **Geosphere & Atmosphere Connection:** Conduct a follow-up lesson on how **weathering connects the geosphere and atmosphere.** Set up an experiment: place chalk (soft rock) in a spray bottle. Spray it repeatedly over several days. Students observe how water and air break down the chalk, creating a muddy mixture—just like real weathering. Connect to 5-ESS2-1 (geosphere-atmosphere interaction).\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\n- This lesson is designed to be concrete and observable, ideal for Fifth Grade's developmental stage.\n- The photograph serves as the anchor throughout all five phases, creating continuity.\n- Vocabulary is introduced *after* hands-on exploration, supporting deeper understanding.\n- Real-world applications (erosion protection, community resource use) connect to NGSS 5-ESS3-1 and increase relevance.\n- The lesson can be extended into a unit on the rock cycle, weathering, or Earth's history.",
