Observe and describe the layers, colors, and textures of a sedimentary rock formation and explain what each layer reveals about Earth's history.\n2. Identify and explain how the geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere interact to shape and change rocks over time (weathering and erosion).\n3. Develop a model or diagram showing how rock layers form through the deposition of sediment and the interaction of Earth systems.\n4. Use evidence from the rock formation to support an explanation of how Earth's materials are constantly being reshaped by natural processes.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about rock formation and Earth systems using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected photograph of the layered rock formation (or printed copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image on the board or distribute printed copies. Allow students 1-2 minutes to observe silently without explanation.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about this rock? Describe what you see—what patterns or features stand out to you?\" *(Prompt for observations of layers, colors, differences between sections)*\n   - \"If this rock could tell a story, what do you think it might tell us about? What might each layer represent?\"\n   - \"How do you think a rock with so many different layers gets made? What would have to happen?\"\n   - \"Where have you seen rocks like this, or pictures of them? What did you know about them already?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"Today, we're going to be rock detectives. We're going to investigate how rocks form, what their layers tell us, and how Earth's systems—water, air, soil, and rock—work together to create and change the landscape over time.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Scientists call rocks like this ones that have layers 'sedimentary rocks,' and by studying them, we can unlock secrets about our planet's past and understand how Earth is always changing.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how sedimentary rock layers form and how Earth systems interact to shape rocks.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic cups or jars (one per group of 2-3 students)\n- Water\n- Sand (fine and coarse if possible)\n- Pebbles or small gravel\n- Soil or clay\n- Spoons for stirring and layering\n- Labels or tape for marking layers\n- Student observation sheets (see below)\n- Optional: copies of the rock photograph for reference\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Part A: Building a Layered Rock Model (10-12 minutes)**\n\n   - **Teacher Setup:** Divide students into groups of 2-3. Give each group a clear cup and the sediment materials.\n   \n   - **Student Directions:**\n     - \"You're going to create a model of how sedimentary rocks form. Start with a dry layer—place a thin layer of pebbles or gravel at the bottom of your cup.\"\n     - \"Next, add a layer of sand on top. Make it about 1 inch thick.\"\n     - \"Add another layer—this time, use soil or clay. Push it down gently to compact it.\"\n     - \"Continue alternating layers (pebbles, sand, soil) until you've used most of your materials. Each layer should show a different 'material' or 'particle size.'\"\n     - \"Observe the layers as you build. How are they different from each other? What would happen if we pressed on them?\"\n\n   - **Connection to Photograph:** \"Look at the photograph of the real rock. What do you notice? The layers in your cup are similar to what happened in nature over thousands and thousands of years.\"\n\n   - **Documentation:** Students sketch or photograph their layered model and label each layer with what material it contains.\n\n2. **Part B: Simulating Weathering and Erosion (8-10 minutes)**\n\n   - **Teacher Prep:** Pre-stage this activity or do it as a teacher demonstration if time is limited.\n   \n   - **Student Directions:**\n     - \"Now we're going to add water—this represents rain and groundwater. Slowly pour water into your cup. What happens? What do you observe?\"\n     - \"Notice how water moves through the layers. Some layers stay firm. Others might change. The materials might mix.\"\n     - \"This is what happens in nature. Water—from rain, rivers, and underground—moves through rock layers, changing them over time.\"\n\n   - **Recording:** Students record observations: \"How did adding water change the layers? Which layers changed the most? Why might that be?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"Why do you think that layer held together better?\" \"What would happen if water kept flowing through for a longer time?\"\n- Resist explaining—guide students to their own discoveries.\n- Prompt groups to compare their models: \"How is your model similar to or different from the rock in the photograph?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students build a model showing distinct sediment layers.\n- Students observe and record that water moves through and interacts with rock layers, changing them.\n- Students connect their hands-on model to the photograph and recognize that layers form over time through natural processes.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts about rock formation and Earth system interactions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the layered rock (displayed)\n- Student models from Explore phase\n- Chart paper with vocabulary and definitions (pre-made or written during instruction)\n- Colored markers\n- Simple diagram template (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to describe their models and what they observed when water was added.\n   - Ask: \"How is your model like the real rock in the photograph? How is it different?\"\n   - Highlight that their simple model represents processes that take thousands of years in nature.\n\n2. **Key Vocabulary Instruction (5-7 minutes):**\n\n   Introduce and define these terms using the photograph and student models as reference:\n\n   - **Sedimentary Rock:** A type of rock made from layers of sediment (tiny pieces of rock, soil, and shells) that get pressed together over a very long time. *(Point to the photograph)* \"This is a sedimentary rock—you can see the layers clearly.\"\n   \n   - **Layers (or Strata):** Distinct bands of material in rock, each one formed at a different time. Different layers have different colors and textures because they formed from different sediments. *(Have students point to different layers in the photograph and their models)*\n   \n   - **Weathering:** The slow breaking down of rocks by water, air, wind, and living things. It happens on Earth's surface and beneath it. *(Reference the discoloration and surface changes visible on the rock)*\n   \n   - **Erosion:** The process by which weathered rock pieces are moved from one place to another by water, wind, or ice. *(Connect to the gravel surrounding the rock—these are examples of eroded materials)*\n   \n   - **Geosphere:** The solid, rocky parts of Earth—all the rocks, minerals, and soil. *(Point out that the rock in the photo is part of the geosphere)*\n\n3. **Interactive Diagram (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Draw a simple cross-section of Earth systems on chart paper showing:\n     - The geosphere (rock layers)\n     - Water (hydrosphere) moving through and around the rock\n     - Air (atmosphere) weathering the surface\n   - Annotate arrows showing interactions: \"Water and air break down rock → pieces move → form sediment → bury and compress → new rock forms.\"\n   - Refer back to both the photograph and student models.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we looked at this rock 1,000 years from now, how might it be different? Why?\"\n   - Students respond with partners before sharing aloud.\n   - Listen for understanding of: weathering and erosion rates, the role of water and air, and the very long timescale involved.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Sedimentary Rock** | Rock made from layers of tiny pieces of rock and soil that have been pressed together for a very, very long time. |\n| **Layers (Strata)** | Bands of different colored or textured rock that formed at different times; each layer has its own story to tell. |\n| **Weathering** | The slow breaking down of rocks by rain, wind, air, and sometimes roots. It happens all around us, though it's slow. |\n| **Erosion** | When weathered rock pieces move and travel to new places by water, wind, or ice. |\n| **Geosphere** | All the solid, rocky parts of Earth—rocks, minerals, soil, and even the crust under the ocean. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define and use the five vocabulary terms correctly.\n- Students understand that rock layers form over very long timescales through the interaction of water, air, and sediment.\n- Students recognize that Earth systems (geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere) actively interact to shape our planet.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new context and deepen their grasp of Earth system interactions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Rock samples or photographs of different rock types (if available)\n- Access to pictures or videos of real geological formations (optional: Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, etc.)\n- Student worksheet: \"Real-World Rock Detective Investigation\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Real-World Investigation (Recommended)**\n\n1. **Scenario:** \"Communities around the world use their understanding of how rocks form and change to protect the land and water. For example, some cities know that certain rock layers act as aquifers—they hold fresh water. Other communities watch how rivers erode riverbanks and design barriers to slow erosion.\"\n\n2. **Student Task:**\n   - Provide images or brief descriptions of 2-3 real-world scenarios:\n     - **Example 1:** A town near a river notices the riverbank is eroding quickly. How might understanding rock layers and erosion help them protect homes?\n     - **Example 2:** Geologists study rock layers to find safe places to store water for the community. How would understanding layers and weathering help them?\n     - **Example 3:** A construction company needs to dig a foundation. How might understanding rock types and layers keep workers safe?\n\n3. **Student Work:**\n   - In pairs, choose one scenario.\n   - Draw or diagram how understanding sedimentary rocks and Earth system interactions helps solve the problem.\n   - Write 2-3 sentences explaining their thinking.\n\n4. **Share & Discuss:**\n   - Pairs present their scenario and solution to the class.\n   - Class discusses: \"How is this connected to what we learned about the rock in the photograph?\"\n\n**Option B: Comparative Analysis (If time allows)**\n\n- Show students 2-3 more photographs of layered rock formations from different locations (canyon walls, cliffs, road cuts, etc.).\n- Students compare: \"What can you tell about each location from the rock layers? How might weathering and erosion have shaped each place differently?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate scenario discussions—do not provide answers.\n- Ask: \"What evidence from the rock layers would tell you this?\"\n- Challenge students to explain their thinking using vocabulary from the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply concepts of rock formation and Earth system interaction to real-world problems.\n- Students articulate how understanding geosphere processes helps communities manage natural resources and hazards.\n- Students demonstrate deeper understanding through explanatory drawings and written reasoning.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rock formation, Earth system interactions, and the ability to apply these concepts.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation of student models and explanations during Explore phase\n- Listening to student responses during group share-out in Explain phase\n- Circulating during Elaborate phase and noting quality of explanations and connections\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with this assessment (can be written or verbal, adapted for learner needs):\n\n1. **Look at the photograph of the layered rock again.** Explain what each of the following had to do with creating this rock:\n   - Water\n   - Time\n   - Pressure\n   - Sediment (sand, soil, pebbles)\n\n2. **Choose one of these Earth systems and explain how it interacts with the geosphere (the rock):**\n   - The hydrosphere (water)\n   - The atmosphere (air)\n\n3. **Imagine you're a scientist studying this rock 1,000 years in the future. How might it look different? What will have changed it?**\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- ✓ **Emerging:** Student identifies at least 2-3 factors in rock formation; can name one Earth system that interacts with rock.\n- ✓ **Developing:** Student explains how water and sediment contribute to rock formation; describes one Earth system interaction; predicts some change over time.\n- ✓ **Proficient:** Student explains the roles of water, pressure, time, and sediment; clearly describes how multiple Earth systems interact with rock; uses vocabulary correctly; provides detailed prediction of future changes with reasoning.\n- ✓ **Advanced:** Student does all of the above; makes connections to real-world applications; explains rates of weathering and erosion; discusses long timescales with sophistication.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that sedimentary rock forms through interaction of multiple Earth systems over very long timescales.\n- Students can explain cause-and-effect relationships between weathering/erosion and rock change.\n- Students apply concepts to predict future changes and understand real-world applications.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create and post a visual anchor chart with pictures, simple definitions, and examples of each vocabulary term. Allow students to reference it during all phases and during assessment.\n\n2. **Guided Model-Building:** For students who struggle with sequencing or fine motor skills, pre-layer some materials in cups and have students complete layers, or partner them with a peer who can assist. Ask guiding questions: \"What goes next? Why?\"\n\n3. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Provide a fill-in-the-blank or matching version of the exit ticket. For example:\n   - \"Water helps break down rocks through a process called ___________.\"\n   - \"The layers in this rock formed over _____ (a short time / a very long time).\"\n   - Offer 3-4 answer choices.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deep Dive into Geologic Time:** Introduce the concept of the geologic time scale in simplified form. Have students research and create a timeline showing how long rocks like this one take to form (millions of years), compared to human timescales.\n\n2. **Rock Cycle Expansion:** Challenge students to investigate and diagram the full rock cycle (igneous → sedimentary → metamorphic → back to igneous). How does this rock fit into the bigger picture? What happens to the sedimentary rock if it gets buried deeper or pushed up into mountains?\n\n3. **Real Community Investigation:** Have students research a specific community's approach to protecting Earth's resources (e.g., managing aquifers, preventing riverbank erosion, finding safe locations for construction). They can create a presentation or detailed report connecting their findings to the concepts in this lesson.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil Detective:** If possible, examine or show pictures of rocks containing fossils. Students investigate: \"What can fossils tell us about Earth's past? How do they form in sedimentary rocks?\" Students could sketch fossils found in rocks or create their own fossil model using clay and small objects, then have a partner try to \"read\" the story.\n\n2. **Local Geology Walk:** If your community has accessible rock outcrops, road cuts, creek beds, or a local geology museum, plan a field experience. Students observe real layered rocks in situ and document with sketches and observations. They compare real-world formations to their models and identify layers, colors, and signs of weathering/erosion.\n\n3. **Design a Solution:** Present a scenario (e.g., \"Your town's riverbank is eroding 6 inches per year. Design a structure or system that uses understanding of erosion to protect homes downstream\"). Students sketch and explain their design, referencing rock types, water flow, and erosion concepts learned in this lesson. This connects to 5-ESS3-1.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis lesson engages fifth graders in hands-on investigation of sedimentary rock formation and Earth system interactions. By building models, observing evidence in a real photograph, and exploring real-world applications, students develop a deep understanding of how the geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere work together to shape our planet over time. The 5E sequence ensures that students first observe and wonder, then investigate and discover, before being introduced to formal vocabulary and real-world applications. Assessment opportunities throughout the lesson allow teachers to identify and support each student's learning journey.",
