ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the stratified rock formation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on interactive board or printed and posted\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without explanation. Ask students to look quietly for 30 seconds and observe what they see.\n\n2. **Facilitate a Think-Pair-Share:**\n   - Think: \"What do you notice about this rock? What do the lines mean?\"\n   - Pair: Turn to a partner and share your observations.\n   - Share: Call on 4–5 pairs to share with the class; record their ideas on chart paper.\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"Why do you think this rock has stripes or lines running across it?\" (Students may say: layers, different kinds of rock, different times)\n   - \"How do you think this rock got here? What might have happened?\"\n   - \"If you could look at rocks under the ground, what do you think you would find?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen layers in other things—like dirt, sand, or even a cake? What were they?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder if this rock can tell us a story about what Earth looked like a long time ago. Let's become rock detectives and find out what the layers are telling us!\"\n\n**Transition:** Now we're going to investigate rocks and layering by doing our own experiment to understand how these layers form and what they can tell us.\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate layering and erosion through hands-on activity, discovering how rocks form in layers and how weathering changes them.\n\n**Materials (per pair/group of 3):**\n- Clear plastic cup or jar (8–10 oz)\n- Soil or fine sand (2–3 tablespoons)\n- Small pebbles or gravel (2–3 tablespoons)\n- Powdered chalk or crushed clay (optional, for color variation)\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Hand lens or magnifying glass\n- Spoon or stick for stirring\n- Paper towel\n- Student recording sheet (provided below)\n\n**Activity – Part 1: Building Layers (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Provide clear directions to students:**\n   - \"Layer 1: Spread a layer of pebbles or gravel on the bottom of your cup. About as thick as your pinky finger.\"\n   - \"Layer 2: Add a layer of soil or sand. About the same thickness.\"\n   - \"Layer 3: Add another layer of pebbles.\"\n   - \"Layer 4: Add more soil or sand on top.\"\n   - Optional: Use chalk dust or crushed clay between layers to create visible color differences.\n\n2. **Students observe and record:** \"Look at the side of your cup. Draw what you see. Label each layer. What colors do you see? Are the layers the same thickness?\"\n\n**Activity – Part 2: Simulating Weathering (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Explain the scenario:** \"Imagine it rains heavily on a hill where these rocks are. We're going to use a spray bottle to simulate rain and see what happens to our rock layers.\"\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - Gently tilt your cup to a 45-degree angle over a paper towel.\n   - Spray water on the top of your layers 5–10 times.\n   - Observe what happens: Do the layers move? Do they mix? Does water flow through?\n   - Draw and record: What happened to your layers?\n\n3. **Observation questions for students to record:**\n   - \"Which layer materials moved the most?\"\n   - \"Why do you think some materials stayed in place while others moved?\"\n   - \"How is this like what happens to real rocks on a hillside?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions rather than providing answers.\n- Use prompts like: \"Tell me what you observe,\" \"Why do you think that happened?\" and \"What would happen if it rained more?\"\n- Avoid saying \"correct\" or \"incorrect\"—instead reflect back observations: \"I notice you're saying the smaller particles moved faster. What does that tell you?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that layers can be distinguished visually.\n- Students discover that water causes smaller particles to move and erode.\n- Students record observations showing that different materials behave differently during erosion.\n- Students begin to make connections between the model and real rock formations.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration; connect discoveries back to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student notebooks\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms\n- Photograph from Engage phase\n- Picture examples (optional: real rock samples, images of rock layers in landscapes)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3–4 groups to briefly share what they observed during the weathering simulation.\n   - Record common observations on chart paper: \"Layers moved,\" \"Water caused erosion,\" \"Some materials are tougher,\" etc.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   Display each term on chart paper. Use the photograph to illustrate.\n\n   - **Layer:** A sheet or thickness of material that forms on top of or beneath another. (Point to the photograph: \"See the stripes? Each stripe is a different layer of rock.\")\n   - **Weathering:** The slow breaking down and wearing away of rock by wind, water, and ice. (Ask: \"In our experiment, what broke down our layers? The water! That's like weathering.\")\n   - **Erosion:** The movement of broken rock and soil from one place to another, usually by water, wind, or ice. (Explain: \"When rain washes soil downhill, that's erosion—the material moves away.\")\n   - **Rock Formation:** The process of how rocks form and change shape over long periods of time. (Connect: \"The layers we see in the photograph formed one on top of another, over millions of years.\")\n   - **Geologic Time:** The idea that Earth is very, very old, and changes happen slowly over millions of years. (Scaffold: \"The photograph shows rocks that are older at the bottom and newer at the top—like pages stacked in a book.\")\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again.\n   - \"Now that you've done the layering experiment, what do you think this rock is telling us?\"\n   - \"Why are there different colors and textures in each layer?\" (Different materials were deposited at different times.)\n   - \"What happened to this rock to make it look weathered and worn?\" (Wind, rain, and ice broke it apart over time.)\n   - \"Which layer is the oldest? How do you know?\" (The bottom layer—it was there first.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Quick-draw assessment: \"Draw a rock with three layers. Label which is the oldest and which is the newest.\"\n   - Listen for: Students should identify the bottom layer as oldest.\n   - Ask follow-up: \"How do you know which is older?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Layer** | A sheet of material that is stacked with other sheets, like pages in a book. In rocks, each layer was made at a different time. |\n| **Weathering** | The slow breaking down and wearing away of rocks by wind, water, rain, and ice over many years. |\n| **Erosion** | When weathered rock pieces and soil are carried away by water, wind, or ice to a new location. |\n| **Rock Formation** | The process over millions of years where rocks form in layers and change shape due to weathering and erosion. |\n| **Geologic Time** | The idea that Earth is extremely old (billions of years), and big changes happen very slowly over millions of years. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define weathering and erosion and explain the difference.\n- Students understand that rock layers show time—older at bottom, newer at top.\n- Students recognize that the photograph shows evidence of both layering and weathering.\n- Students begin to see rocks as a record of Earth's history.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by interpreting a real-world rock formation scenario and predicting landscape change.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the layered rock formation (displayed again)\n- Second image or drawing showing the same area as a landscape (surrounding terrain, vehicles, parking lot) to provide context\n- Student worksheet: \"Rock Detective Case Study\" (provided below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Chart paper (optional, for group discussion)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Real-World Application – Rock Detective Case Study (10 minutes)**\n\nDistribute the \"Rock Detective Case Study\" worksheet with questions like:\n\n1. \"This rock is in a parking lot where many cars drive. How might human activity affect weathering? Will it weather faster, slower, or the same as rocks in the forest? Why?\"\n\n2. \"Look at the loose rocks and gravel around this formation. Where do you think they came from?\" (They broke off the main rock through weathering and erosion.)\n\n3. \"If we came back to look at this same rock in 100 years, what do you predict will happen to it?\" (It will be smaller, more weathered, more layers may be exposed.)\n\n4. \"Based on the layers you see, how long do you think it took for this rock to form?\" (Help students understand: millions of years—much longer than a human lifetime.)\n\n**Part 2: Landscape Change Prediction (5 minutes)**\n\n- Show students the broader context of the photograph (the parking lot, surrounding area).\n- Ask: \"This rock is now visible because the land was disturbed for a parking lot. Before that, it was buried under soil. What does this tell us about how Earth's surface changes?\"\n- Students sketch and label: \"What might this area look like 1,000 years from now? Show how the rock might change.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide discussion without leading students to a single \"right\" answer.\n- Ask: \"What evidence supports your prediction?\" (Pushing for reasoning, not just answers.)\n- Help students see connections: \"How is this related to what you learned about weathering?\"\n- Validate predictions based on logic, not accuracy.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply concepts of weathering and erosion to a real geological feature.\n- Students predict that layered rocks are evidence of very long time periods.\n- Students recognize that human activity can expose and alter geological features.\n- Students demonstrate deeper thinking by explaining *why* changes occur, not just *what* changes happen.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rock layers, weathering, erosion, and Earth's changing landscape.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Explore phase:** Observation of student recordings and group discussions.\n- **Explain phase:** Quick-draw assessment of rock layers and identification of oldest/newest.\n- **Elaborate phase:** Student responses on the Case Study worksheet and reasoning during discussions.\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (5–10 minutes)**\n\nProvide this written/drawn exit ticket at the end of the lesson. Students complete individually.\n\n**Exit Ticket: \"Rock Detectives—Show What You Know\"**\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Sketch a rock with three layers. Label which layer is the oldest. Explain why that layer is oldest.\n\n2. **Answer (circle or write):**\n   - **Weathering is:** (a) rocks forming in layers / (b) rocks breaking down slowly / (c) rocks moving downhill\n   \n3. **Explain in 1–2 sentences:** \"How do we know this rock in the photograph has been weathered?\"\n\n4. **Predict:** \"If you found this same rock in 50 years, what might be different about it? Why?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Students demonstrate mastery if they:**\n- Correctly identify the bottom layer as the oldest (showing understanding of rock chronology).\n- Accurately explain weathering as the breaking down of rock (not just \"rock breaking apart\").\n- Provide evidence from the photograph (color, texture, cracks, exposed nature) to explain weathering.\n- Make reasonable predictions about future change based on cause-and-effect reasoning.\n\n✓ **Students show developing understanding if they:**\n- Understand that layers represent different times but may confuse which is older.\n- Define weathering with prompting but need help connecting it to the photograph.\n- Make predictions but cannot explain why they'll occur.\n\n✓ **Students need further support if they:**\n- Cannot identify layers or distinguish them visually.\n- Confuse weathering with erosion or do not understand either concept.\n- Make predictions without any reasoning or evidence.\n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Evidence to Look For |\n|-------------------|---------------------|\n| Observe and describe layers; explain what each represents | Students accurately sketch layers, label colors/textures, and explain layers formed at different times. |\n| Identify evidence of weathering and erosion | Students point to or draw features (cracks, color changes, loose material) and explain how wind/water caused them. |\n| Interpret layered rock as a record of Earth's history | Students identify oldest layers and explain the concept of \"reading\" rocks like a timeline. |\n| Predict how landscapes change with weathering over time | Students make logical predictions and provide cause-and-effect reasoning. |\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Provide a fill-in-the-blank version:\n   - \"The oldest layer of rock is at the ________ [bottom/top].\"\n   - \"Weathering means rocks __________ [break down/move].\"\n   - Pair with a visual diagram they can point to rather than draw.\n\n2. **Scaffolded Explore Activity:** \n   - Pre-layer the cup for students before the activity begins, so they focus on the weathering/erosion simulation only.\n   - Provide a sentence frame for recording: \"When we sprayed water, the _______ layer moved because __________.\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:**\n   - Keep a large, illustrated vocabulary chart posted throughout the unit with images and simple definitions.\n   - Allow students to refer to it during independent work and assessments.\n   - Use photos from the internet of real rock formations alongside terms.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Research Task:**\n   - Provide pictures of three different rock formations (from different regions/geologic ages).\n   - Ask students to compare the number, thickness, and composition of layers: \"What does this tell us about how Earth was different in different places?\"\n   - Have them create a written hypothesis about which environment (desert, ocean, river) each formation came from based on layer characteristics.\n\n2. **Quantitative Measurement Challenge:**\n   - Ask students to measure the thickness of each layer in the photograph (using a ruler and scale estimation).\n   - Create a bar graph comparing layer thicknesses: \"What does it mean if one layer is much thicker than another?\" (Longer time of formation, different depositional rate, different environment.)\n   - Extend: \"If one layer formed every 100,000 years, how old is this rock?\" (Introduce proportional reasoning.)\n\n3. **Real-World Application – Design Task:**\n   - \"Imagine you're a construction engineer. You found this rock when digging a foundation. What would you need to know about weathering to predict if this rock would be safe to build on? Design a test to find out.\"\n   - Students propose how to test rock durability using materials and reasoning grounded in weathering concepts.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Build a Rock Timeline Wall:**\n   - Create a large wall display showing geologic time (with student help).\n   - Add printed images of rocks from different eras alongside this photograph.\n   - Label approximate ages in millions of years, helping students grasp the enormous timescale of Earth's history.\n   - Tie to local geology: Research rocks found in your region and add them to the timeline.\n\n2. **Explore Local Geology – Field Walk or Virtual Tour:**\n   - If your area has exposed rock formations, plan a short field walk (or virtual tour via Google Earth) to identify weathering features.\n   - Students use hand lenses to observe and photograph (or sketch) evidence of weathering in the real world.\n   - Return to class and compare photos to the lesson photograph, identifying similarities and differences.\n   - Reflect: \"How is weathering in our area similar to or different from this photograph?\"\n\n3. **Weathering Prediction Experiment – Extended Investigation:**\n   - Leave student layer cups in different conditions (sunny windowsill, dark closet, outside, inside).\n   - Over 2–3 weeks, photograph or sketch changes to each cup.\n   - Create a data chart showing weathering rates under different conditions.\n   - Connect to real-world question: \"Why do rocks on a sunny mountain weather faster than rocks in a shaded valley?\"\n   - Present findings as a class mini-research poster.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Pacing:** This lesson works best as two sessions: Day 1 (Engage + Explore) and Day 2 (Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate). Alternatively, condense by combining Explore and Explain if time is limited.\n- **Safety:** Ensure students handle water spray bottles over paper towels or trays to prevent spills. If using real rock samples in class, check for sharp edges.\n- **Preparation:** Pre-gather all materials in advance. If using actual rock samples, source from a local geology museum, university, or online educational supplier.\n- **Connections:** This lesson pairs well with units on Earth's systems, natural resources, and land formation. Consider revisiting these concepts when studying water cycle, erosion control, and conservation.\n- **Language Learners:** Use visuals extensively, pair students for discussions, and provide vocabulary anchor charts. Pre-teach key terms before the lesson.\n- **Engagement Hook:** Consider bringing in a real (small, safe) rock sample from your area to pass around during Engage—students love tangible, real objects!\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly supports 4-ESS1-1 and 4-ESS2-1 through evidence-based observation, hands-on investigation, and interpretation of Earth's features as markers of change over time.**",
