  "content": "# Autumn by the Lake: A 5E Lesson on Seasonal Changes\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n- **Seasonal change and patterns:** The photograph shows trees in the autumn season with distinctive orange, red, and brown leaf colors, demonstrating the predictable seasonal transition from warm to cold months.\n- **Landforms and water features:** The lake is a visible body of water that shows how water shapes the landscape and provides habitats for plants and animals near its shore.\n- **Light and daylight patterns:** The overcast autumn sky and lower angle of the sun's light visible in the image reflects shorter daylight hours characteristic of fall.\n- **Plant life cycles and adaptation:** Trees shed their leaves in autumn as a seasonal adaptation, and the fallen leaves visible on the ground show this natural process.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n**Colors Change, Seasons Come Around**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 60–75 minutes (one 45-minute session plus outdoor observation time, or two 30–40 minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 1-ESS1-2: Make observations at different times of year to relate the amount of daylight to the time of year.\n  - 1-ESS1-1: Use observations of the sun, moon, and stars to describe patterns that can be predicted.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Observe and describe** changes in plants and light during autumn.\n2. **Identify patterns** in how seasons change the appearance of trees and the amount of daylight.\n3. **Predict** what will happen to leaves and daylight as seasons continue to change.\n4. **Record observations** of seasonal changes using drawings, words, or pictures.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by examining the autumn photograph and wondering about seasonal changes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed or projected photograph (lake_landform.jpg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"I wonder...\" sentence frames printed or written on board\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a large print where all students can see clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent looking time.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What colors do you see on the trees in this picture? Why might the leaves be orange and brown instead of green?\"\n   - \"How do you think the trees will look different in winter? What about in spring?\"\n   - \"Look at the sky. Does it look bright and sunny, or cloudy and darker? How much daytime do you think there is in this season?\"\n   - \"Do the trees look the same as they did in summer? What has changed?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge** by asking: \"Who has seen leaves change color where you live? Can you describe what that looked like?\"\n\n4. **Record student \"I wonder\" statements** on chart paper. Examples:\n   - \"I wonder why leaves turn orange.\"\n   - \"I wonder when it will get dark outside.\"\n   - \"I wonder if the trees will grow new leaves.\"\n\n5. **Show enthusiasm** and tell students: \"Today, we're going to be scientists and observe how our world changes with the seasons. We'll look for patterns—things that happen over and over again.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore what happens to trees and daylight during autumn, and discover patterns we can predict.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate seasonal changes through observation and hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or poster board (one per small group or pair)\n- Colored pencils, crayons, or markers (reds, oranges, browns, greens, yellows)\n- Leaves collected from outside (dried autumn leaves, or pictures of leaves)\n- Actual leaves from trees if available, or leaf cutouts in seasonal colors\n- Simple observation recording sheet with two columns: \"Summer Trees\" | \"Autumn Trees\"\n- Pictures or drawings of the same tree in different seasons (optional visual support)\n- Index cards with drawings of sun position (high in summer, lower in autumn)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Leaf Color Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into pairs or small groups.** Give each group a collection of real or paper autumn leaves.\n\n2. **Direct students:** \"Look at your leaves carefully. What colors do you see? Sort them by color—can you make a pile of red leaves, orange leaves, brown leaves, and any other colors?\"\n\n3. **Ask observation questions:**\n   - \"How many different colors do you count?\"\n   - \"Which color do you see the most?\"\n   - \"Do all the leaves look the same, or are they different?\"\n\n4. **Have students draw or color a tree** showing how it looks in autumn (with orange, red, and brown leaves on the branches).\n\n**Part 2: Comparing Seasons (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show students a simple picture or drawing of a tree in summer** (full, green leaves) next to your autumn photograph or a picture of an autumn tree.\n\n2. **Ask students:** \"How is this tree different from the autumn tree? What changed?\"\n\n3. **Model comparing two trees:** \"In summer, leaves are green. In autumn, leaves turn orange, red, and brown. In winter, the leaves fall off and the branches are bare. This happens every year—it's a pattern!\"\n\n4. **Have students complete a simple two-column chart:**\n   - **Column 1:** Draw or describe a summer tree\n   - **Column 2:** Draw or describe an autumn tree\n\n5. **Ask:** \"What will happen next? If autumn is here now, what season comes after autumn?\" (Students may say \"winter.\") \"Good thinking! Let's predict what the tree will look like then.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"How are these leaves different?\" \"What do you think caused that change?\"\n- Do not provide direct answers; encourage students to observe and think.\n- Help students articulate observations using descriptive language (colors, textures, sizes).\n- Record student observations on chart paper for use in the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe and sort leaves by color.\n- Students will draw or describe trees in summer vs. autumn with visible color differences.\n- Students will begin to recognize a seasonal pattern.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to seasonal patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage and Explore phases\n- Poster or picture showing the four seasons\n- Large calendar or seasonal wheel\n- Image showing sun position in summer vs. autumn (optional)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a whole-group setting** and display their work from the Explore phase.\n\n2. **Facilitate a group share-out:**\n   - \"Let's look at what we noticed about the autumn tree. What colors did we see?\"\n   - \"How was it different from the summer tree you drew?\"\n   - Call on pairs or groups to share their observations aloud.\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** with pictures and examples:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Season:** A time of year with its own weather and plant patterns (spring, summer, autumn, winter).\n   - **Autumn (Fall):** The season when leaves change color and fall from trees; it comes after summer and before winter.\n   - **Daylight:** The time during the day when the sun is in the sky and it is light outside.\n   - **Pattern:** Something that happens again and again in the same order, like seasons that repeat every year.\n\n4. **Make explicit connections back to the photograph:**\n   - \"The trees in this photograph are in autumn. Look at all the orange, red, and brown leaves. This is what happens every year in autumn.\"\n   - \"See the sky? It looks cloudy and gray. Autumn days are often like this, and the sun is not as high in the sky. This means there is less daylight—the sun goes down earlier in the evening.\"\n   - \"These patterns happen every year. We can predict them!\"\n\n5. **Introduce the seasonal pattern using a visual calendar or wheel:**\n   - Show students pictures of the same scene (or a tree) in each season.\n   - \"Autumn comes after summer. Then winter comes, then spring, then summer again. This pattern repeats every year.\"\n   - \"We can use this pattern to predict: If it's autumn now, what season comes next? (Winter) What do you think will happen to the leaves in winter?\"\n\n6. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to a partner and tell them: What season is happening right now? What colors are the leaves?\"\n   - \"If it's autumn, what season will come next?\"\n   - Ask individual students: \"What is daylight?\" or \"Why do you think there is less daylight in autumn?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the word \"autumn\" or \"fall\" correctly.\n- Students will understand that seasons follow a repeating pattern.\n- Students will recognize that daylight changes with the season.\n- Students will be able to predict the next season based on the current season.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of seasonal patterns to make predictions and connect to their own lives.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart titled \"Predicting Winter\" on poster board or paper\n- Drawing paper and crayons/colored pencils\n- Pictures of winter scenes (snow, bare trees, etc.)\n- Calendar pages showing dates and seasons\n- Optional: photographs of the school grounds or a local park in different seasons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce a prediction challenge:**\n   - \"We are scientists! We can use patterns to make predictions. Since we know autumn comes after summer, and winter comes after autumn, what do you predict will happen next?\"\n\n2. **Ask prediction questions:**\n   - \"If the leaves are orange and falling now, what will the trees look like in two months when winter arrives?\"\n   - \"Will there be more daylight or less daylight in winter? Why?\"\n   - \"What will you wear outside in winter compared to what you might wear in autumn?\"\n\n3. **Have students draw or create a winter prediction:**\n   - Provide a template with a tree outline: \"Draw what you think this tree will look like in winter.\"\n   - Students should show a bare tree (no leaves) or a tree with snow.\n   - Encourage them to draw the sun lower in the sky or fewer daylight hours (option: draw a dark/light sequence showing shorter days).\n\n4. **Connect to students' lives:**\n   - \"What do you notice changing where you live right now? Are leaves changing? Is it getting darker earlier in the evening? Is it getting colder?\"\n   - \"How do you know winter is coming? What signs tell you?\"\n\n5. **Introduce observation challenge for home/family:**\n   - \"This week, notice the trees and sky at home or on your way to school. Tomorrow, we'll share what autumn signs you saw!\"\n   - Provide a simple observation sheet: \"What autumn signs did you see?\" (drawings or words)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to use evidence from their observations to support predictions.\n- Ask: \"Why do you think the tree will look like that? What makes you say that?\"\n- Encourage students to connect seasonal changes to their own environment.\n- Validate multiple correct predictions (e.g., \"In winter, trees could have snow, or they could just have bare branches—both are right!\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will accurately predict what trees will look like in the next season.\n- Students will explain why they made their prediction based on patterns.\n- Students will identify seasonal signs in their own surroundings.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of seasonal patterns and changes in daylight.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist:** As students work, note whether they can:\n  - Identify and describe colors of autumn leaves\n  - Name the season correctly\n  - Recognize the pattern of seasons\n  - Describe changes between seasons\n  - Use vocabulary (season, autumn, daylight, pattern) appropriately\n\n- **Partner conversations:** Listen as students explain to a peer what they learned. Do they mention leaf color changes, seasonal order, or daylight changes?\n\n- **Drawings and recordings:** Review student work from Explore and Elaborate phases. Do drawings show observable differences between seasons?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide one or more of these options:\n\n**Option 1: Verbal Exit Ticket (Teacher or aide asks individual students)**\n- \"What season is it right now? How do you know?\"\n- \"What colors are the leaves in autumn?\"\n- \"What season comes after autumn?\"\n- \"Is there more daylight or less daylight in autumn compared to summer?\"\n\n**Option 2: Drawing Exit Ticket**\n- Provide a simple template with a tree outline and the prompt: \"Draw what autumn looks like.\"\n- Students should include:\n  - Colored leaves (orange, red, brown, or yellow)\n  - Ground with fallen leaves (optional)\n  - Sky that reflects autumn (cloudy or with sun lower on horizon)\n\n**Option 3: Interactive Exit Ticket**\n- Show four pictures: a summer tree, autumn tree, winter tree, spring tree.\n- Ask: \"Point to the autumn tree. Why did you choose that one?\"\n- \"What will this tree look like next?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies the current season (autumn/fall) using evidence (leaf color, daylight).\n- ✓ Student describes at least one change that happens in autumn (leaf color change OR daylight decrease).\n- ✓ Student can name the season that comes after autumn (winter) or show a pattern of seasonal order.\n- ✓ Student uses observational language (colors, time, plant changes) to explain seasonal change.\n- ✓ Student makes a reasonable prediction about a future season based on the pattern observed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify the current season.\n- 70% of students will describe at least one observable seasonal change.\n- 75% of students will demonstrate understanding of seasonal sequence/pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and sentence frames:**\n   - Provide pre-printed sentence frames:\n     - \"In autumn, the leaves are ___.\"\n     - \"I see ___ colors.\"\n     - \"After autumn comes ___.\"\n   - Use repetition and visual supports (picture cards with season names and images).\n\n2. **Concrete, hands-on focus:**\n   - Allow students to spend more time manipulating and sorting actual leaves rather than drawing.\n   - Offer real leaves in a sensory bin for tactile exploration.\n   - Reduce the number of colors to identify (focus on \"green,\" \"not green,\" \"brown\" rather than specific hues).\n\n3. **Paired or small-group instruction:**\n   - Work with a small group during Explore phase to guide observation systematically.\n   - Use one-on-one questioning: \"What color is this leaf? How does it feel? Have you seen a leaf like this before?\"\n   - Reduce drawing expectations—accept pointing, labeling, or verbal description in place of detailed drawings.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extended prediction and pattern work:**\n   - Ask students to predict changes in daylight: \"If daylight is shorter now, will it get longer or shorter in winter? What about spring?\"\n   - Have students create a year-long prediction chart showing all four seasons in order with drawings and descriptions.\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think seasons repeat? What causes these changes?\" (Introduce the idea that Earth moves, leading to different sun angles—at an age-appropriate level).\n\n2. **Data recording and graphing:**\n   - Create a simple chart: \"How many hours of daylight?\" for each season (use approximate, easy numbers: summer = 14 hours, autumn = 12 hours, winter = 10 hours, spring = 12 hours).\n   - Have students compare numbers and identify which season has the most/least daylight.\n   - Challenge: \"Can you see a pattern in the numbers?\"\n\n3. **Cross-curricular extension:**\n   - Have advanced students research or observe animals in autumn (animals preparing for winter, migration patterns, etc.).\n   - Ask: \"How do animals respond to seasonal changes? Do birds change their behavior in autumn?\"\n   - Challenge them to make connections: \"How do both plants and animals use seasonal patterns?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seasonal Observation Journal (Ongoing):**\n   - Have students maintain a simple observation journal over 4 weeks (once per week for a month).\n   - Each week, students draw or write what they observe: leaf colors, weather, daylight duration (early sunset), animals.\n   - At the end of 4 weeks, review the journal to see the progression from autumn into early winter.\n   - Use the journal to revisit the pattern: \"Look at what we recorded in week 1 vs. week 4. What changed?\"\n\n2. **Seasonal Walk and Scavenger Hunt:**\n   - Take students on a nature walk around the school grounds or playground.\n   - Provide a checklist: \"Find 3 autumn signs: colored leaves, fallen leaves, bare branches, animals preparing for winter, cloudy sky, etc.\"\n   - Collect samples (with permission) to bring back and sort by color or type.\n   - Create a class \"Autumn Scavenger Hunt Board\" displaying photos or items found.\n\n3. **Read-Aloud and Seasonal Stories:**\n   - Read age-appropriate picture books about autumn or seasons:\n     - *Why Do Leaves Change Color?* by Betsy Maestro\n     - *Fall Leaves* by Loretta Holland\n     - *Autumn Leaves* by Ken Robbins\n   - Have a discussion comparing the book's descriptions to what students observed in the photograph.\n   - Ask: \"Did the book explain something you wondered about? What did you learn?\"\n\n---",
