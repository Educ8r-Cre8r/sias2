ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about frost and water in different forms using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the frost-covered ornamental grass\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student science notebooks or paper for drawing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or printed large enough for all students to see clearly. Say: *\"Today, we're going to look at something magical that happens on cold mornings. Look closely at this picture. What do you notice?\"*\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** (pause 10-15 seconds after each for thinking time):\n   - *\"What sparkly, white stuff do you see covering the grass and branches?\"* (Students may say: frost, ice, sparkles, snow, or diamonds.)\n   - *\"Where do you think this white stuff came from?\"* (Guide them to think: cold, freezing, water.)\n   - *\"Have you ever seen something like this in your neighborhood or yard? When?\"* (Elicit: cold mornings, winter, after rain on a cold night.)\n   - *\"If we touched this white stuff, what do you think would happen? How would it feel?\"* (Students predict: cold, wet, slippery, or that it would melt.)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Say: *\"I wonder... what is this frosty white stuff made of, and where did it come from? Let's investigate!\"*\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper. Write their names next to their ideas (this builds ownership and allows you to assess prior knowledge).\n\n**Transition:** *\"Now we're going to do an experiment to see how frost forms and what it's made of. We'll use ice and cold water to discover the answer!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the formation and properties of frost through hands-on experimentation with ice and water.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 cup filled with ice cubes\n- 1 thermometer (or temperature strips, if available)\n- 1 sheet of black construction paper\n- Small dish with water\n- Paper towels\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but helpful)\n- Student observation recording sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity: \"Making Our Own Frost\"**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. *\"Place your ice cup on top of the black construction paper. This will help you see what happens!\"*\n\n2. *\"Watch the outside of the cup carefully for the next 5-10 minutes. Use your magnifying glass if you have one. What's growing on the outside of the cup?\"* (This is condensation forming, which becomes frost in cold weather.)\n\n3. *\"Feel around the outside of the cup with your finger. Is it wet? Cold? Does it feel like the frosty grass in our picture?\"*\n\n4. *\"Touch a small drop of water from your water dish. Now touch the icy cup. How does the cup feel different?\"*\n\n5. *\"If you have a thermometer, place it near the ice cup. What temperature do you see? Is it cold?\"*\n\n6. **Record observations** on the observation sheet by:\n   - Drawing what they see on the cup\n   - Writing one or two words describing how it feels (cold, wet, sparkly, etc.)\n   - Circling whether the cup feels \"very cold\" or \"a little cold\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice? Is it wet? How did that water get there?\"*\n- **Do NOT say:** \"That's condensation\" or explain the scientific process. Let them discover through observation.\n- Encourage students to use their senses (touch, sight) safely.\n- Help students compare their cup to the photograph: *\"Does your ice cup look like the frosty grass? How?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should observe:\n- Water droplets forming on the outside of the ice cup\n- The cup feeling very cold\n- A wet, icy layer building up\n- The connection between cold and water changing form\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of frost, water states, and weather.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of frost (same as Engage phase)\n- Picture cards showing: ice, liquid water, frost (optional; can draw simple pictures)\n- Thermometer or temperature chart\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students together.** Say: *\"Let's talk about what you discovered! Who wants to share what you saw growing on your ice cup?\"* \n\n   - Invite 3-4 volunteers to share observations.\n   - Point out common observations: cold, wet, sparkly, white, icy.\n\n2. **Introduce the concept:** *\"When water gets very, very cold, it freezes and becomes solid ice. When frost forms on the grass like in our picture, it's frozen water! The water from the air turned into tiny ice crystals. That's why it looks so sparkly and white.\"*\n\n3. **Teach vocabulary** (write each word on chart paper with a simple picture):\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|----------------------------|\n   | **Frost** | Tiny ice crystals that form on plants and ground on very cold mornings |\n   | **Freeze** | When water becomes so cold that it turns into ice (solid) |\n   | **Melt** | When ice gets warmer and turns back into liquid water |\n   | **Solid** | Something hard that keeps its shape (like ice) |\n   | **Liquid** | Something wet that flows and takes the shape of its container (like water) |\n   | **Water vapor** | Water in the air that we can't see (optional—may be too advanced) |\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:** Point to the image and say:\n   - *\"This grass is covered in frost. That means it was very cold last night. The water in the air froze and made all these sparkly ice crystals.\"*\n   - *\"When the sun comes up and it gets warmer, what do you think will happen to the frost?\"* (Guide them: it will melt and turn into water drops; it will disappear.)\n\n5. **Check for understanding** using the \"Thumbs\" strategy:\n   - *\"Frost is water that froze. Show me thumbs up if that makes sense, thumbs sideways if you're not sure, thumbs down if you disagree.\"*\n   - Address any thumbs sideways or down with a quick re-explanation.\n\n**Vocabulary Reference:** Post the vocabulary chart in the room for reference throughout the lesson.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should understand:\n- Frost is frozen water\n- Cold weather causes water to freeze\n- Water can be solid (ice/frost) or liquid (water)\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to a new context and explore how frost affects the land and plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Pictures of plants covered in frost (can use the original photo or search for additional images)\n- Small potted plant or grass sample (live, if possible)\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Optional: video clip of frost melting (2-3 minutes, YouTube: \"frost melting timelapse\")\n\n**Activity: \"Frost Changes Our World\"**\n\n1. **Set the scenario:** *\"Frost doesn't just look pretty—it changes things on Earth! Let's think about how frost affects plants and the land.\"*\n\n2. **Show additional pictures** (or the same photograph again) and ask:\n   - *\"If this frost stays on the grass, what might happen to the plants? Will they be healthy or hurt?\"* (Students may say: the plants might freeze, get stiff, break, or die.)\n   - *\"What happens when the sun comes out? Will the frost stay or go away?\"* (It will melt.)\n\n3. **Live demonstration (if you have a plant):**\n   - Lightly mist a plant with water from the spray bottle to simulate dew/frost.\n   - *\"Now let's pretend this water is frost because it's very cold. What would happen if it stayed frozen all day?\"* \n   - Discuss how plants need to thaw to be healthy.\n\n4. **Real-world connection:** *\"Farmers have to think about frost! If frost comes early in fall or late in spring, it can hurt their crops. Gardeners use special blankets to protect plants from frost!\"*\n\n5. **Optional: Show a 2-3 minute timelapse video** of frost melting in morning sun (search \"frost melting timelapse\"). After viewing, ask: *\"What happened? Did the frost disappear? Where did it go?\"* (It melted and turned back into water.)\n\n6. **Application task:** Students draw or write:\n   - *\"Draw what happens to frost when the sun comes up and makes it warmer.\"*\n   - Younger/struggling students can draw; older/advanced students can write a sentence.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate discussion without leading to one \"right answer.\"\n- Emphasize that frost is a **weather event** that happens quickly (overnight) and changes things on Earth.\n- Connect to 2-ESS1-1 (quick vs. slow Earth changes).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents should:\n- Explain that frost affects plants on the land\n- Predict what happens when temperature changes (frost melts)\n- Understand that this is a weather change that happens relatively quickly\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of water states, frost formation, and Earth changes.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation of Explore phase: Were students able to observe condensation and connect it to frost?\n- Thumbs check during Explain phase: Did students understand vocabulary?\n- Verbal responses during Elaborate phase: Can students predict what happens when frost melts?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5 minutes)**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket. Students can respond by drawing, writing, or both (scaffold as needed):\n\n1. **Question 1:** *\"What is frost? Draw or write.\"*\n   - **Success criteria:** Student identifies frost as frozen water or ice on plants.\n\n2. **Question 2:** *\"Circle the picture that shows what happens to frost when it gets warm.\"*\n   - Show two pictures: (A) Frost stays the same / (B) Frost melts and turns into water drops\n   - **Success criteria:** Student circles picture B.\n\n3. **Question 3:** *\"Is frost a fast Earth change or a slow Earth change? Circle one.\"*\n   - Show: FAST / SLOW\n   - **Success criteria:** Student circles FAST (frost forms overnight, disappears with sun).\n\n**Alternative: Observation-Based Assessment**\n\nIf exit tickets feel too formal, observe during the final 5 minutes:\n- Ask individual students: *\"Tell me in your own words: What is frost, and where does it come from?\"*\n- Listen for key concepts: water, cold, frozen, ice, ground/plants.\n- Record on a simple checklist for each student.\n\n**How to Determine Success:**\n\n- **All students should:** Identify frost as frozen water and link it to cold weather.\n- **Most students should:** Predict that frost melts when it gets warmer.\n- **Some students may:** Explain why frost forms (air gets cold, water freezes).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on just three terms (frost, freeze, melt). Simplify definitions further: *\"Frost is ice. Freeze means turning to ice. Melt means ice turns to water.\"*\n\n2. **Use more visuals and demonstrations:** Provide picture cards showing water → ice → water again. Use the actual photograph and your ice cup experiment repeatedly. Repeat questions with simpler language if needed.\n\n3. **Partner with a peer or aide during Explore:** Pair a struggling student with a peer who can help guide observation and recording. The teacher or aide can ask guiding questions: *\"What do you see? How does it feel?\"*\n\n4. **Offer sentence starters for drawing/writing:**\n   - *\"Frost is made of ___.\"*\n   - *\"When it gets warm, frost will ___.\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Introduce water cycle connections:** Ask: *\"Where does the water in the air come from? Could it come from evaporation from lakes or oceans?\"* Have them trace a simple water cycle diagram showing evaporation, condensation, and freezing.\n\n2. **Explore real-world impact:** Have advanced students research and create a short poster: *\"How do farmers protect crops from frost?\"* or *\"Why does frost happen on some mornings but not others?\"*\n\n3. **Investigate temperature relationships:** Provide a thermometer and ask: *\"At what temperature does frost form? Can you test this?\"* Let them record temperatures at different times of day and make predictions about when frost will appear.\n\n4. **Write a narrative:** *\"Tell the story of a water droplet. Where does it come from? How does it become frost? What happens next?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frost Hunt (Home or School):** Send students home with a simple observation sheet to look for frost the next cold morning (or conduct a classroom \"frost hunt\" if you can observe a window or outdoor area). Have them draw or photograph frost they find and bring back descriptions. Discuss in the next class: *\"Where did you find frost? Why was it there and not somewhere else?\"*\n\n2. **Melting Race:** Place ice cubes in different locations (sunny window, shady corner, refrigerator, warm water) and have students predict and observe which melts first. Record times on a chart. Connect to learning: *\"Just like frost melts in the sun, ice melts when it gets warmer!\"*\n\n3. **Frost Art & Writing:** Students create a \"frost landscape\" by sprinkling salt or glitter on wet paper or paint (simulating frost crystals), then write or dictate a short story: *\"I found frost on a _____ and it made me think about _____.\"* Display in the classroom or hallway.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Preparation\n\n- **Gather materials at least one day before:** Ice, cups, thermometers, black paper, water dishes.\n- **Test your ice cup experiment beforehand** to ensure condensation forms clearly in your classroom environment.\n- **Prepare the photograph for projection** or printing (ensure it's large and clear).\n- **Bookmark or download the timelapse video** in advance.\n- **Optional:** Invite a local farmer or gardener to visit and discuss why they care about frost warnings (brings real-world relevance).\n- **Safety reminder:** Emphasize gentle touching of ice—it's cold but students can briefly touch it. No prolonged contact.\n\nThis lesson directly addresses NGSS 2-ESS2-3 and 2-ESS1-1 by having students identify water in solid form (frost) and recognize a weather event that changes Earth's surface relatively quickly.",
