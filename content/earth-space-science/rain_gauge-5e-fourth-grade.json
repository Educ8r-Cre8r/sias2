ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about rainfall and the tools scientists use to measure it.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of rain gauge (displayed on screen or printed for small group viewing)\n- Pictures or short video clips showing weather damage (flooding, erosion, mudslides) — optional but powerful\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Ask students: \"What do you see in this picture? What is this tool, and what do you think it's used for?\"\n\n2. **Facilitate a whole-group discussion** using these guiding questions:\n   - \"Have you ever wondered how much rain falls during a storm?\" (Students often think about big storms and their impacts.)\n   - \"Why might people need to know exactly how much rain falls in one place?\" (Help them think about farmers, construction workers, meteorologists, emergency planners.)\n   - \"What problems can too much rain cause?\" (Guide them toward erosion, flooding, landslides, damage to crops or buildings.)\n   - \"How could knowing the amount of rain help us prepare for or handle these problems?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge:** Ask, \"Who has seen a rain gauge before? Have you ever kept track of weather?\" Validate all responses.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"Over the next two weeks, we're going to become meteorologists and use rain gauges to measure and record rainfall. We'll collect real data and use it to understand how water changes Earth's surface.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now let's explore how rain gauges work and what kinds of information they can give us about the water falling in our area.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rainfall measurement through hands-on experimentation and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 rain gauge per small group (or 1 per student if available) — commercial rain gauges work best, but DIY versions can be made from clear plastic bottles with marked measurements\n- Rulers (at least one per group)\n- Water (pitcher or access to sink/outdoor hose)\n- Outdoor space or designated location to place gauges (or simulate by pouring water)\n- Data recording sheets (provided below in template)\n- Pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Divide students into small groups** (3-4 students per group).\n\n2. **Explain the setup:** \"Each group will place your rain gauge in an open outdoor area where it can catch rainfall. But first, we need to test how the gauge works and make sure we know how to read it correctly.\"\n\n3. **Hands-on testing (in classroom or outdoor area):**\n   - Provide each group with a rain gauge.\n   - Using a pitcher and water, have students **carefully pour a measured amount** (start with 0.5 inches, then 1 inch) into a rain gauge.\n   - Ask: \"How does the water level change in the gauge? How do we read the measurement? Where exactly do we look?\"\n   - Students should **record the water level** on their data sheet using the marked measurements on the gauge.\n   - Repeat with a second pour to reinforce accuracy in reading.\n\n4. **Outdoor placement (or designated indoor simulation):**\n   - Have students place their rain gauges in an agreed-upon location outdoors (open area, not under eaves or trees) where they will not be disturbed.\n   - **Establish a daily routine:** Students will check the gauge at the same time each day (e.g., first thing in the morning or at end of day) and **record the rainfall amount** on a data sheet.\n   - If outdoor placement is not feasible, simulate by checking the gauge every few days and having the teacher add measured water to represent rainfall collected.\n\n5. **Data recording:** Students document:\n   - Date and time of measurement\n   - Rainfall amount (in inches or millimeters, depending on gauge)\n   - Weather observations (clear, cloudy, rainy, sunny)\n   - Any notes about the weather that day\n\n6. **Teacher role:** \n   - Circulate among groups to ensure gauges are read correctly and placed safely.\n   - Ask probing questions: \"What do you notice about the water level? Did it go up, down, or stay the same? Why?\"\n   - Help students troubleshoot if gauges tip over or aren't placed properly.\n   - **Do not tell students what patterns to look for**; let them discover through observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students correctly read a rain gauge to the nearest 0.1 inch (or smaller, depending on gauge precision).\n- Students collect daily rainfall data over a 2-week period (or shorter, depending on your lesson timeline).\n- Students notice variation in rainfall amounts from day to day and begin to ask questions about patterns (\"Why did we get more rain on Tuesday than Wednesday?\").\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and help students make sense of their data through teacher-guided discussion and connection to weathering and erosion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Large graph paper or digital graphing tool\n- Ruler and markers\n- Images showing erosion or weathering caused by water (optional visual aids)\n- Vocabulary poster board or digital slides\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Data share-out and graphing:**\n   - Collect data from all groups and create a **class rainfall graph** (bar graph or line graph) showing daily rainfall amounts over the measurement period.\n   - Post the graph where all students can see it.\n   - Ask: \"What do you notice in our data? Which days had the most rain? The least? Were there any days with no rain?\"\n\n2. **Identify patterns:**\n   - Guide students to look for patterns: \"Did we have rainy days in a row? Did dry days follow wet days?\"\n   - Discuss how the amount of rainfall varies and why this might matter.\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary** (write on board and display):\n   - **Precipitation:** Water that falls from clouds to Earth's surface, including rain, snow, sleet, and hail.\n   - **Weathering:** The process by which water, wind, ice, and other natural forces break down rocks and soil on Earth's surface.\n   - **Erosion:** The movement of soil and rocks from one place to another, often caused by water, wind, or ice.\n   - **Meteorologist:** A scientist who studies weather and uses tools like rain gauges to collect data.\n   - **Data:** Information collected through observations and measurements that help answer scientific questions.\n\n4. **Connect to weathering and erosion:**\n   - Show images or discuss: \"When rain falls on hills or mountains, what happens to the soil and rocks? Where does that water go?\"\n   - Explain: \"Heavy rainfall can cause water to flow downhill, carrying soil and small rocks with it. This is called erosion. Over time, erosion changes the shape of the landscape.\"\n   - Ask: \"How might knowing how much rain falls help people predict erosion in an area?\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask students to turn to a partner and explain in their own words: \"Why is it important for scientists to measure rainfall?\"\n   - Listen in and assess accuracy of explanations.\n   - Ask: \"What could happen if we had very heavy rainfall all at once?\" (Guide toward flooding, landslides, severe erosion.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Precipitation** | Water that falls from clouds to the ground. It can be rain, snow, sleet, or hail. |\n| **Weathering** | The slow breaking down of rocks and soil caused by water, wind, ice, and other natural forces. |\n| **Erosion** | The movement of soil and rocks from one place to another, usually caused by flowing water, wind, or ice. |\n| **Meteorologist** | A scientist who studies weather and uses tools to measure and predict what the weather will be. |\n| **Data** | Information or measurements you collect to answer a question or solve a problem. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that rain gauges measure precipitation and provide data about weather patterns.\n- Students can identify trends in rainfall data they collected.\n- Students understand that heavy rainfall can cause weathering and erosion, which change Earth's surface.\n- Students can use vocabulary correctly in discussions.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of rainfall and its impacts by designing solutions to reduce the negative effects of water-related weather events.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper, markers, and colored pencils\n- Images of erosion prevention or flood management solutions (e.g., retaining walls, rain gardens, flood barriers, drainage systems)\n- Building materials (optional, for creating a model): cardboard, foam, soil, sand, gravel, water\n- Rulers and measuring tools\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present a real-world problem:**\n   - Share a scenario: \"A community in a nearby town experiences flooding and erosion after heavy rainstorms. Soil washes away from gardens and yards. Basements flood. What are some ways this community could reduce these problems?\"\n\n2. **Show examples of solutions** (display images or short videos):\n   - Rain gardens (shallow, planted areas that absorb runoff)\n   - Retaining walls and terraces (to prevent soil from sliding downhill)\n   - Improved drainage systems and gutters\n   - Planting vegetation to hold soil in place\n   - Permeable pavement (allows water to soak in)\n   - Flood barriers or levees\n\n3. **Group design challenge:**\n   - Divide students into design teams (same groups from Explore, or mixed groups).\n   - Assign each team one or two of the above solutions to research and plan.\n   - Students **sketch a design** and **write an explanation** of how their solution would reduce erosion or flooding, using evidence from their rainfall data and what they learned about weathering and erosion.\n   - For example: \"Our community gets an average of 2 inches of rain per week. A rain garden can absorb up to 3 inches, so it would help prevent flooding.\"\n\n4. **Optional hands-on model:**\n   - If time allows, provide students with materials to **build a model** of their solution (e.g., create a miniature hillside in a tray, build a model rain garden or retaining wall, and test how water flows through it).\n   - Have them pour water (\"rain\") onto the model and observe whether erosion is reduced.\n\n5. **Gallery walk or presentations:**\n   - Students display their designs and explanations.\n   - Peers review each other's work using a simple rubric: \"Does this solution reduce erosion or flooding? Is it explained clearly? Is there evidence from rainfall data?\"\n\n6. **Teacher role:**\n   - Facilitate brainstorming without leading toward one \"correct\" answer.\n   - Ask guiding questions: \"How would this solution work in a heavy rainstorm? Would it work in your area based on the rainfall amounts we measured?\"\n   - Encourage students to reference their own data when justifying their designs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students propose at least one realistic solution to reduce the impacts of rainfall-related weather hazards.\n- Students justify their solution using evidence from their rainfall measurements or their understanding of erosion and weathering.\n- Students can compare their solution to others and explain why one might be more effective in a particular situation.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of precipitation measurement and the relationship between rainfall and Earth's surface changes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- Observe students as they use the rain gauge; check for correct reading of measurements.\n- Listen to partner discussions during Explain phase; note understanding of weathering and erosion vocabulary.\n- Review data sheets for completeness and accuracy of daily recordings.\n- Observe group discussions during Elaborate phase; assess ability to make connections between rainfall data and real-world problems.\n\n**Summative assessment — Exit ticket / Quiz (administer at end of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide students with 3-4 questions (adjust complexity based on class level). Students answer on paper or respond orally:\n\n1. **Measurement question:** \"Look at this rain gauge image. What is the rainfall amount shown? (Provide a photo of a gauge at a specific level.)\"\n\n2. **Data interpretation question:** \"Over two weeks, our class collected this rainfall data: Week 1 had 3 inches, Week 2 had 1 inch. What can we conclude about rainfall patterns in our area during these weeks?\"\n\n3. **Concept question:** \"Explain how heavy rainfall can cause erosion on a hillside. Use the word 'weathering' in your answer.\"\n\n4. **Solution question:** \"If a community experiences flooding after heavy rainstorms, what is one solution that could reduce flooding? Explain how it works.\"\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Student correctly reads a rain gauge to the nearest 0.1 inch or better.\n- Student can identify at least one pattern or trend in rainfall data.\n- Student explains the relationship between precipitation and weathering/erosion using 2+ pieces of evidence.\n- Student proposes a realistic solution to a rainfall-related problem and justifies it with evidence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 80% of students correctly read a rain gauge and record data accurately.\n- Most students identify patterns in rainfall data (e.g., \"We had more rain in Week 1\").\n- Most students can explain that rainfall causes weathering and erosion.\n- Most students propose a reasonable solution to reduce impacts of heavy rainfall and provide at least one reason why it would help.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified data recording:** Provide a pre-made table with dates already filled in; students only need to record the rainfall amount and one observation. Reduce the time period for measurement from 2 weeks to 1 week or 5 school days.\n\n2. **Vocabulary anchors:** Create a visual anchor chart with pictures and definitions of key terms (precipitation, erosion, weathering) posted near work areas. Allow students to reference the chart during discussions and writing.\n\n3. **Paired practice with rain gauge:** Pair struggling readers with a peer or a stronger reader during Explore phase. Practice reading the gauge multiple times before beginning daily data collection. Provide a checklist for correct gauge placement (open area, not under eaves, level).\n\n4. **Scaffolded explanation during Elaborate:** Instead of designing an original solution, provide students with 2-3 pre-designed solutions (with pictures and simple descriptions). Students choose one, cut and paste the description, and answer: \"How does this help? Why would we use it here?\" This reduces the writing and creative load while still requiring connection to rainfall data.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extended data collection:** Have students maintain a rain gauge for 4-6 weeks or an entire season. Create a more complex graph showing cumulative rainfall over time, or compare rainfall data to temperature data to look for seasonal patterns.\n\n2. **Research project:** Ask advanced students to research how different climates receive different amounts of annual rainfall. They can compare rainfall data from your area to data from a desert, tropical rainforest, or mountain region. Create a comparison poster or presentation.\n\n3. **Engineering redesign:** Challenge students to design a rain gauge that is more accurate or easier to read, or that can measure rainfall in a wider range of amounts. Provide materials and have them build and test a prototype.\n\n4. **Community impact analysis:** Have students research a real-world flooding or erosion event in a nearby area. They gather information about rainfall amounts during the event, the damage caused, and solutions implemented by the community. Present findings to the class.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Water cycle model:** Students create a diagram or 3D model showing how rainfall is part of the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation). They label where the water comes from and where it goes after it falls as rain. Connect to the concept that the same water is recycled on Earth.\n\n2. **Erosion investigation lab:** Set up a simple erosion demonstration in a cafeteria tray or outdoor area. Create a \"hillside\" of soil/sand. Slowly pour water on it and observe erosion. Then, have students test a solution (plant grass, build a barrier, use mulch) and compare erosion rates. Record and graph results. This reinforces the connection between water and erosion.\n\n3. **Interview a meteorologist or water manager:** Invite a local meteorologist, water resource specialist, or emergency management official to speak to the class about how they use rainfall data in their work. Students prepare 3-5 questions in advance (e.g., \"Why is rainfall data important to your job?\" \"What happens when we get too much rain at once?\").\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
