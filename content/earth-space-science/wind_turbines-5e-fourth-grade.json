ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about wind and energy using the wind turbine photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the wind turbine photograph (or printed copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student science journals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board without context. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds, noticing every detail they can see.\n\n2. **Facilitate a curiosity conversation** using these guiding questions:\n   - \"What do you notice in this picture? Describe what you see.\" (Accept all observations: tall structures, blades, farmland, blue sky, power lines, etc.)\n   - \"What do you think these tall machines with the spinning blades might be used for? Why would someone build them here in a field?\"\n   - \"Have you ever felt wind push on you? How strong can wind be?\"\n   - \"What might this machine be doing with the wind energy?\"\n\n3. **Launch a prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to tell you that these machines are called wind turbines, and they make electricity from wind. Turn to a partner and share: How do you think moving air could turn into the electricity we use in our homes?\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper titled \"What We Wonder About Wind Turbines\" — don't correct misconceptions yet; these become anchors for learning.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to build our own spinning wind machine and discover how wind can be captured and turned into power, just like these giant turbines do.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how wind causes motion and discover factors that affect the spinning speed of a wind turbine model.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 paper cup (8-10 oz)\n- 4 strips of construction paper (8\" × 1\"), different colors\n- 1 wooden dowel or unsharpened pencil\n- 1 straight pin or pushpin\n- Tape (masking or clear)\n- Ruler or measuring stick\n- A pencil with eraser (for mounting the dowel)\n- A hairdryer, electric fan, or access to a breezy window\n- Stopwatch or timer (smartphone timer is fine)\n- Science journal for recording observations\n\n**Activity — Building and Testing a Wind Turbine Model:**\n\n1. **Model Construction (First 8-10 minutes):**\n   - Have students fold each construction paper strip in half lengthwise, creating a \"blade.\"\n   - Tape all four blades to the inside rim of the cup (evenly spaced, like a pinwheel).\n   - Push the dowel through the bottom of the cup and secure it so the blades are free to spin.\n   - Mount the dowel horizontally in an eraser-end of a pencil so it can rotate freely (like a spit).\n   - Test that the blades spin freely with a gentle breath.\n\n2. **Investigation Protocol (Second 12-15 minutes):**\n   \n   **Part A — Effect of Wind Speed:**\n   - Have students position their turbine in front of a fan or hairdryer on the lowest setting (or open a window).\n   - Record observation: Do the blades spin? How many rotations happen in 10 seconds? (Count or use a stopwatch.)\n   - Increase the fan speed (or move closer to the wind source).\n   - Count rotations again in 10 seconds. Record.\n   - Repeat at a third wind speed level.\n   - **Question to guide recording:** \"What happens to the spinning when wind gets stronger?\"\n\n   **Part B — Blade Design Investigation (if time allows):**\n   - Test: What if we fold the paper blades differently? What if we use different materials?\n   - Have one group experiment with wider blades, another with narrower blades (tear paper to modify).\n   - Observe and record: \"Do different blade shapes spin the same way in the same wind?\"\n\n3. **Documentation:**\n   - Students draw their turbine model and label the parts (blades, dowel, cup).\n   - Record data in a simple chart:\n     - Wind Speed (Low / Medium / High)\n     - Number of Rotations in 10 Seconds\n     - Observations (spin direction, blade movement, sound, etc.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group and ask clarifying questions: \"What changed when we turned up the fan?\" \"Why do you think the blades move faster?\"\n- Prevent early conclusions by asking \"What else could we test?\" rather than confirming ideas.\n- Ensure safety with moving fans and pins.\n- Support struggling groups with step-by-step construction guidance and simplified data recording (e.g., \"Did it spin more or less?\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that stronger wind causes faster spinning.\n- Students observe a direct relationship between wind speed and blade motion.\n- Students create a working model that demonstrates energy conversion (wind → motion).\n- Data recorded showing the effect of variable wind speeds.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific explanations for how wind turbines work and relate them to renewable energy.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph of wind turbines (displayed again)\n- Simple diagram of a wind turbine (cross-section showing blades → shaft → generator)\n- Optional: video clip (2-3 minutes) showing how a wind turbine works (search \"How Wind Turbines Work\" — Khan Academy or National Geographic Kids)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their findings: \"What did you discover about how wind speed affects the spinning?\"\n   - Chart student observations and highlight patterns (stronger wind = faster spinning).\n   - Ask: \"Why might stronger wind matter if we're trying to make electricity?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary and Concepts (8-10 minutes):**\n   \n   Use the photograph and student models as visual references while teaching:\n\n   - **Wind Energy:** The energy that comes from moving air. Wind is created by differences in temperature and pressure on Earth. It is always available in most places on Earth.\n   - **Turbine:** A machine with blades (like a fan) that spin when pushed by wind, water, or steam. In a wind turbine, spinning blades turn a shaft.\n   - **Generator:** A machine inside the turbine that converts spinning motion (mechanical energy) into electrical energy (electricity). When the shaft spins fast, the generator creates power.\n   - **Renewable Energy:** Energy that comes from natural resources that are constantly replaced or don't run out (like wind, sun, or water). Unlike fossil fuels, wind will always be available.\n   - **Power or Electricity:** The energy we use to light homes, run appliances, and power cities.\n\n   **Explanation with Visual Connection:**\n   \"Just like your turbine model had blades that spin in the wind, the real turbines in the photograph have huge blades that catch the wind high up in the sky. The spinning blades turn a shaft — similar to the dowel in your model. Inside the turbine, a generator is connected to that spinning shaft. As the shaft spins faster and faster, the generator creates electricity. That electricity flows down cables through power lines to homes and schools.\"\n\n3. **Check for Understanding (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Show me with your hands: How do the blades move when wind pushes them?\"\n   - Ask: \"Where does the energy start?\" (Wind) \"Where does it end up?\" (Electricity in our homes)\n   - Pose a challenge question: \"If there's no wind, what happens?\" (Blades don't spin, no electricity is made.)\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (posted on classroom wall):**\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Wind Energy** | The power that comes from moving air |\n| **Turbine** | A machine with spinning blades that catches wind |\n| **Generator** | The part inside a turbine that makes electricity from spinning motion |\n| **Renewable Energy** | Energy from natural resources that don't run out (like wind) |\n| **Electricity** | The energy we use to power lights, devices, and appliances |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that turbines convert wind (a natural resource) into electricity.\n- Students can identify the main parts of a wind turbine and describe their function.\n- Students grasp that renewable energy comes from sources that are constantly available.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of wind turbines to real-world contexts and evaluate the benefits and challenges of wind energy as a solution to human energy needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Index cards or sticky notes\n- Photograph of the wind turbine farm (displayed again)\n- Optional: Images of other renewable energy sources (solar panels, dams, geothermal vents)\n\n**Activity — Wind Energy: Solutions and Tradeoffs**\n\n1. **Real-World Application Discussion (5-7 minutes):**\n   \n   Show the original photograph again and ask:\n   - \"Why do you think someone built these turbines in this farmland? What problem are they solving?\" (Meeting energy needs, reducing pollution from fossil fuels)\n   - \"Look at the farmland around the turbines. What do farmers grow here? How might having turbines affect farming?\" (Accept varied responses: can farm around them, provides income, takes up space, etc.)\n\n2. **Pros and Cons Investigation (8-12 minutes):**\n   \n   Divide the class into two groups or pairs:\n\n   **Group A — Advantages of Wind Energy:**\n   - Brainstorm on chart paper: \"Why is wind energy good for people and the environment?\"\n   - Prompt with questions: \"Does wind pollution? Does wind run out? Is wind free?\"\n   - Expected responses: No pollution, renewable, free, reduces fossil fuel use.\n\n   **Group B — Challenges of Wind Energy:**\n   - Brainstorm: \"What makes wind energy tricky or hard to use?\"\n   - Prompts: \"Does the wind always blow? What if there's no wind? Are turbines expensive to build?\"\n   - Expected responses: Wind is unpredictable, turbines are costly, need space, some people think they're ugly, birds.\n\n3. **Gallery Share:**\n   - Post both charts.\n   - Have students do a \"gallery walk\" to see both perspectives.\n   - Discuss as a class: \"Knowing the good things and the hard things about wind energy, do you think it's worth building wind turbines? Why?\"\n\n4. **Connection to Environmental Impact:**\n   - Refer back to 4-ESS3-1 (energy affects the environment): \"Wind energy doesn't create pollution or greenhouse gases like burning coal or oil does. But it does change the landscape. Is that a fair tradeoff?\"\n   - Record student thinking in journals.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without steering opinion; validate all reasonable ideas.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"Can you tell me more about that?\" \"Why do you think that matters?\"\n- Help students see nuance: \"So wind energy solves one problem (pollution) but creates another (space). How could we solve both?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that wind energy is a renewable resource with environmental benefits.\n- Students understand that all energy solutions have tradeoffs.\n- Students can articulate reasons why wind turbines are built in certain locations.\n- Students begin thinking critically about real-world applications of science.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of wind energy, turbine function, and the role of renewable resources in meeting human energy needs.\n\n**Activity — Multi-Part Assessment:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Can students build a working model and identify variables affecting spin speed?\n- Listen during group discussions in Explain and Elaborate phases: Do students use vocabulary correctly? Can they explain cause-and-effect (wind → spinning → electricity)?\n- Review student science journal entries and data recordings for accuracy and clarity.\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes, end of Session 2):**\n\nStudents respond to the following in their science journals or on a provided card:\n\n1. **Draw and Label:** Sketch a wind turbine and label three important parts (blades, shaft/dowel, generator).\n\n2. **Explain in Your Own Words:** \"How does wind help make electricity? What happens inside the turbine?\"\n\n3. **Apply Your Learning:** \"The town of Windville has very strong winds. Scientists want to build a wind farm there. What are two good reasons to build it, and one challenge they might face?\"\n\n4. **Reflection:** \"What was the most interesting thing you learned about wind energy?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Approaching:** Student can identify turbine parts and describe that wind makes blades spin.\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student can explain the sequence (wind → spinning → electricity), use vocabulary correctly, and identify at least one advantage and one challenge of wind energy.\n\n✓ **Advanced:** Student can explain renewable energy, compare wind to other energy sources, and discuss environmental tradeoffs with reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets reveal whether students understand energy conversion and the role of wind as a renewable resource.\n- Drawings show comprehension of turbine structure.\n- Responses demonstrate ability to apply concepts to a real scenario.\n- Journal entries document learning progression across the lesson.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Model:** Provide a pre-assembled cup turbine or allow students to use a paper pinwheel (already made) instead of building from scratch. Focus on observation and testing rather than construction.\n\n2. **Guided Data Recording:** Use a partially completed chart where students only need to fill in numbers or circle \"more/less/same\" rather than generating original data labels.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create and display illustrated cards with pictures, word, and simple definition for each key term. Students can reference this during discussions and keep a copy in their journals.\n\n4. **Sentence Starters for Explanations:** Provide frames such as: \"When the wind is ______, the blades spin ______. This is because ______.\"\n\n5. **Pairing Strategy:** Pair struggling readers/writers with more confident peers during Explore so all students can participate fully in building and testing.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Optimize Turbine Design:** Challenge students to redesign their turbine model to spin faster or make electricity \"stronger.\" Provide materials (different paper types, sizes, angles) and have them test hypotheses systematically. Ask: \"Which blade shape/size/angle works best and why?\"\n\n2. **Research and Present:** Assign independent research on real wind farms (locations, capacity, energy produced). Have students create a short informational poster comparing wind energy to solar or hydroelectric power.\n\n3. **Engineering Design Challenge:** \"Your town needs clean energy but has limited windy areas. Design a solution that combines multiple renewable resources (wind + solar, for example). Sketch and explain.\"\n\n4. **Data Analysis:** Provide actual wind speed and turbine output data from a real wind farm (simplified table). Have students create a graph, identify patterns, and predict future output.\n\n5. **Environmental Impact Essay:** Write a reasoned argument: \"Should we build more wind turbines, even if some people don't like how they look?\" Support with evidence from the lesson.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Weather Station Investigation (Homework/Follow-up):**\n   Students create a simple wind speed indicator (pinwheel on a stick) and observe wind patterns at home or school over one week. Record observations daily and create a bar graph. Compare: \"When was it windiest? When was it calmest? How would this affect a turbine?\" Connects to 4-ESS2-1 (observing effects of wind).\n\n2. **Wind Energy Around the World (Research Project):**\n   Research and create a fact sheet about wind farms in different countries (Denmark, China, Germany, USA). Display on a world map with statistics (number of turbines, power generated, jobs created). Present findings to the class: \"Where is wind energy most successful, and why?\"\n\n3. **Scale and Comparison Activity:**\n   Measure and compare the height of a real wind turbine (typically 200-300 feet) to familiar landmarks in your school or town (flagpole, building, trees). Create a scale drawing or use string to show the size difference. Discussion: \"Why do turbines need to be so tall?\" (Wind is stronger high up; more space between blades and ground for safety.)\n\n4. **Family Energy Audit:**\n   Students interview a family member about where their home's electricity comes from. Create a pie chart showing the mix of energy sources (fossil fuels, wind, solar, nuclear, etc.). Share classroom results to create a class aggregate chart: \"Where does our community's power come from?\"\n\n5. **Letter to Town Planning:**\n   Write a persuasive letter to a local government official making a case for or against building a wind farm in your area. Use evidence from the lesson about benefits and challenges. Emphasize reasoning about environmental impact and community needs.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n**Safety Considerations:**\n- Supervise use of pushpins and dowels during model construction.\n- Keep hair and loose clothing away from spinning fan blades.\n- Ensure hairdryer/fan is on a stable surface and cord doesn't create a tripping hazard.\n\n**Vocabulary Reinforcement:**\n- Use the words \"wind energy,\" \"turbine,\" and \"renewable\" repeatedly and visibly during all phases.\n- Create a classroom word wall with images to support visual learners and English language learners.\n\n**Alignment Notes:**\n- This lesson directly addresses **4-ESS3-1** by having students observe and describe energy derived from a natural resource (wind) and discuss its environmental effects (clean energy vs. landscape change).\n- It connects to **4-ESS2-1** through observation and measurement of wind's effects on motion (spinning turbine blades).\n\n**Assessment Emphasis:**\n- Focus on student ability to explain the *sequence* of energy transformation, not memorization of mechanical details.\n- Value reasoning about tradeoffs and real-world application over perfect definitions.",
