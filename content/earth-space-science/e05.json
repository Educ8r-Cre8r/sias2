Over time, living things have made their home on the hard rock surface.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe **Anchoring Phenomenon** is **biological weathering** - the process where living organisms break down rocks over time. The moss and lichen growing on this rock are slowly breaking it apart through chemical processes. These organisms produce weak acids that dissolve minerals in the rock, creating small cracks and spaces where they can grow. This is a form of weathering that happens very slowly, taking many years to create visible changes.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Weathering:** Natural processes break down rocks into smaller pieces over long periods of time\n2. **Living vs. Non-living Interactions:** Living things (moss, lichen) can change non-living things (rocks) in their environment\n3. **Habitat:** Rocks can provide homes for small organisms like moss and lichen\n4. **Time and Change:** Changes in nature happen over different time scales - some very slowly like rock weathering\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use a hand lens or magnifying glass to help students observe the detailed textures of moss and lichen.
