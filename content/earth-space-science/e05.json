The rock has patches of green moss growing on its surface, along with white and light green lichen creating interesting patterns. The rock itself is grayish-brown with some pink-orange areas. Around the rock you can see brown fallen leaves, grass, and part of a tree trunk. This rock has been sitting in this forest location for a very long time, slowly being weathered and colonized by living things!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates biological weathering - when living organisms help break down rocks. Lichen are amazing organisms that are actually a partnership between fungi and algae working together! As lichen grow on rock surfaces, they produce weak acids that slowly dissolve minerals in the rock. The moss also holds moisture against the rock, which speeds up chemical weathering. Over hundreds and thousands of years, lichen and moss help transform solid rock into soil. This is one of the ways that bare rock gradually becomes colonized by increasingly complex life - first lichen, then moss, then small plants, and eventually larger vegetation.\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Biological Weathering**: When living organisms (plants, lichen, bacteria) help break down rocks into smaller pieces.\n\n2. **Lichen**: A unique organism formed from algae and fungi living together in a symbiotic relationship.\n\n3. **Soil Formation**: The gradual process of rock breaking down into smaller particles that mix with organic matter to create soil.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate a \"Rock to Soil Timeline\" project!
