Identify that animals like crabs live in special places called habitats where they find food and shelter.\n2. Explain that animals dig and change their environment (like making burrows in sand) to create homes that keep them safe.\n3. Describe what they observe about sand and how it is used by animals on the beach.\n4. Demonstrate understanding that different animals need different types of homes based on where they live.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about beach animals and habitats using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected color photograph of the ghost crab on sand (large enough for all students to see)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: small beach bucket or shovel toy to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the image on a large screen or chart so all kindergarteners can see it clearly. Let students look silently for 15-20 seconds before speaking.\n\n2. **Initial Wonder Prompt:** Say: *\"What do you see in this picture? Look very carefully at this little creature. What is it doing?\"* Accept all responses without judgment.\n\n3. **Guided Discussion Questions (ask one at a time, pause for responses):**\n   - \"What do you think this animal is? Have you ever seen something like this?\"\n   - \"Look at its home. Where is it? What is the home made of?\" (Gesture to the sand and the hole.)\n   - \"Why do you think this animal might dig in the sand? What could it be looking for?\"\n   - \"If you were a tiny animal on a hot, sandy beach, what would YOU need to be safe and happy?\"\n\n4. **Wonder Wall:** Write student predictions on chart paper: *\"Why does the crab dig in the sand?\"* or *\"What does the crab need to live here?\"* Leave this visible for the entire lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \n*\"Today we're going to be beach explorers and learn about how animals like crabs make their homes in the sand, just like the one in our picture!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how animals can use sand to create shelter through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Shallow sensory bin or storage container (8\" × 10\")\n- 2-3 cups of kinetic sand (or damp play sand from outside)\n- Small plastic animals: 1-2 toy crabs, plastic hermit crabs, small plastic fish (if available)\n- Natural materials: small shells, pebbles, dried seaweed (optional but enhances authenticity)\n- Plastic spoons or small shovels\n- Paper for observational drawings (one per child)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup:** Divide the class into 3-4 small groups. Each group gets a bin of sand and materials.\n\n2. **Student Directions (give verbally and demonstrate):**\n   - \"Look at your sand. Touch it gently. Tell your group: Is it soft? Hard? Wet? Dry?\"\n   - \"Pick up your plastic crab. This is like our crab from the picture. Where should the crab live? Why?\"\n   - \"Use your spoon to help the crab dig a little home in the sand. Make a place where the crab can hide.\"\n   - \"Once your crab has a home, add shells or rocks around it to make it even better.\"\n   - \"Draw a picture of where your crab's home is in the sand.\"\n\n3. **Teacher Facilitation (do NOT answer directly; instead ask questions):**\n   - Circulate and observe without immediately helping.\n   - Ask: *\"What did you notice when you pushed into the sand?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"Does the crab stay in one spot or does it move?\"*\n   - Ask: *\"How does having a home in the sand help the crab?\"*\n   - Encourage children to describe what they notice: \"Tell me what you're doing.\"\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Have students draw their sandy home on paper: *\"Draw where the crab lives in the sand. Show the hole. Show the sand.\"*\n   - Encourage labeling with teacher support: Sand, Crab, Home/Hole.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that sand can be pushed and shaped to make a hole.\n- Students begin to understand that the crab's burrow provides shelter/protection.\n- Students create a simple representation of a beach habitat with a sheltered space for an animal.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect exploration to habitat concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple illustrations\n- Picture cards showing: crab, burrow/hole, sand, beach, habitat (one set to show or project)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 groups to briefly show their sandy homes.\n   - Ask: *\"What did you do to help the crab make a home?\"* (Dig, push sand, make a hole.)\n   - Ask: *\"Why does the crab need this home?\"* (To hide, to be safe, to stay cool.)\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Display each term with an illustration or photo. Use Kindergarten-friendly definitions:\n\n   - **Crab:** A small animal with a hard shell that lives on beaches and in the ocean.\n   - **Burrow:** A hole or tunnel that an animal digs in sand or dirt to live in and hide from danger.\n   - **Sand:** Small grains of rock found on beaches that animals can dig through.\n   - **Beach:** A landform by the ocean covered with sand where many animals and people visit.\n   - **Habitat:** The special place where an animal lives and finds food, water, and shelter.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the original crab photo again.\n   - Say: *\"This crab is in its habitat—the beach. The beach is its home. See how it has dug a burrow in the sand? Just like you did! The burrow keeps it safe from bigger animals that might eat it, and it keeps it cool when the sun is very hot.\"*\n   - Point to specific features in the photo: *\"Do you see the hole? That's the burrow. Do you see all the sand? That's what the crab used to make its home.\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individually: *\"Where does the crab live?\"* (Beach, sand, burrow.)\n   - Ask: *\"Why did the crab dig a hole?\"* (To hide, to be safe, to make a home.)\n   - Have students point to a burrow in the original photo: *\"Can you show me where the crab made its home?\"*\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (displayed on poster for remainder of lesson):**\n- **Crab** = Beach animal with a shell\n- **Burrow** = Hole dug in sand for a home\n- **Sand** = Small rocks on a beach\n- **Beach** = Sandy place by the water\n- **Habitat** = An animal's home\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name the animal in the photo (crab).\n- Students understand that burrows are homes animals dig.\n- Students make a connection between the photograph, their exploration, and the concept of habitat.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by exploring how different animals need different habitats and by designing their own beach environments.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photos of different beach animals: crab, hermit crab, beach bird, snail, turtle (print or use images)\n- Shallow sensory bins or trays (one per group)\n- Sand, shells, rocks, plastic plants, toy animals (same as Explore phase, plus extras)\n- Chart paper titled: *\"What Does Each Beach Animal Need?\"*\n- Colored pencils and paper for each student\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Habitat Needs Discussion (5 minutes):**\n   - Show picture cards of 3-4 different beach animals one at a time.\n   - For each animal, ask: *\"Where does this animal live? What does it need to be happy and safe?\"*\n   - Create a simple chart:\n\n     | Animal | Where It Lives | What It Needs |\n     |--------|---|---|\n     | Crab | Sandy burrow | Hole to hide in |\n     | Bird | Beach/air | ? |\n     | Hermit Crab | Empty shell | Shell for protection |\n\n   - Emphasize: *\"Different animals need different things in their habitats because they are different from each other.\"*\n\n2. **Design a Beach Habitat (10 minutes):**\n   - Give each small group a bin of sand, shells, rocks, and toy animals.\n   - Task: *\"Create a beach where different animals can live. Give each animal what it needs. The crab needs a burrow. What does the bird need? What does the snail need?\"*\n   - Students rearrange materials to create homes for multiple animals.\n   - Encourage: *\"Why did you put that shell here? What animal uses it?\"*\n\n3. **Gallery Walk & Share (3 minutes):**\n   - Have groups show their habitats to one other group.\n   - Each student draws their favorite habitat they saw.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions rather than giving answers: *\"Why do you think the bird needs that spot?\"*\n- Encourage diversity of solutions: *\"That's one way! Can anyone think of another way?\"*\n- Validate all attempts: *\"You gave that hermit crab a shell home—that's perfect!\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create or describe multiple beach habitats with appropriate features.\n- Students begin to recognize that animals have different needs based on their body structure and lifestyle.\n- Students apply the term \"habitat\" to new scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of habitats, animal needs, and how animals modify their environment.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Do students attempt to dig/create shelter for the animal?\n- Listen to language during Explain phase: Do students use words like \"burrow,\" \"sand,\" \"home,\" \"hide\"?\n- Engagement during Elaborate phase: Do students thoughtfully place animals and materials?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (choose one or combine):**\n\n**Option 1: Picture-Based Response (5 minutes)**\n- Show the original crab photograph again.\n- Ask three questions (teacher reads aloud; accept verbal or drawn responses):\n  1. *\"What animal is this?\"* (Expected: Crab)\n  2. *\"Show me where the crab's home is.\"* (Expected: Point to the burrow/hole)\n  3. *\"Why did the crab make this home in the sand?\"* (Expected: To hide, be safe, stay cool, etc.)\n\n**Option 2: Three-Choice Question**\n- Display the photo.\n- Ask: *\"Why does the crab dig in the sand?\"*\n  - A) To play\n  - B) To make a home and hide **(Correct)**\n  - C) To find toys\n- Students point to or say the answer.\n\n**Option 3: Quick Sketch & Tell**\n- Provide a blank piece of paper divided in half.\n- Left side: *\"Draw a beach with an animal home.\"*\n- Right side: *\"Tell why the animal needs this home.\"* (Teacher scribes or accepts drawing)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify the crab and its burrow in the photograph.\n- ✓ Student can explain that the burrow is a home the crab made in the sand.\n- ✓ Student can give at least one reason why the burrow is important (safety, shelter, hiding).\n- ✓ Student can use the word \"habitat\" or \"home\" correctly in context.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 85%+ of students can identify the crab and its burrow.\n- 75%+ of students can explain that the crab digs to make a home.\n- 70%+ of students can provide a reason the home is important (protection/safety).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners or students needing scaffolding):\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only two key terms consistently: \"Animal,\" \"Home.\" Gradually introduce \"crab\" and \"sand\" when student is ready.\n   \n2. **Hands-On Exploration Extended:** Provide an additional 10-minute session before the main lesson where student plays with sand and toy animals with one-on-one teacher support, building familiarity with materials and concepts.\n\n3. **Visual Supports & Sentence Frames:** Provide a visual chart with pictures and fill-in-the-blank sentences:\n   - *\"The crab lives in a _______.\"* (hole/burrow)\n   - *\"The burrow keeps the crab _______.\"* (safe/hidden)\n   - Pair each sentence with a photo.\n\n4. **Reduced Complexity During Elaborate:** Instead of managing multiple animals, ask this student to focus on one animal: *\"Where does the crab live? Can you make a home for just the crab?\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Compare Multiple Habitats:** Introduce pictures of non-beach habitats (forest burrow, tree nest, ant hill) and ask: *\"How are these homes the same? How are they different? Why do different animals make different homes?\"* Record observations on a Venn diagram.\n\n2. **Predict & Explain:** Pose \"what if\" questions:\n   - *\"What if it rained a lot on the beach? Would the crab's burrow still work?\"*\n   - *\"What if a big wave came? How would the crab's home help it?\"*\n   - Have the student draw or explain their thinking.\n\n3. **Create a Beach Guidebook:** Using 3-4 pages, have the student draw different beach animals and their habitats, label them, and create a simple \"Field Guide to the Beach\" to share with the class or take home.\n\n4. **Investigate Sand Properties More Deeply:** Provide wet and dry sand side-by-side and ask: *\"Which sand is better for making a burrow? Why? Where does wet sand come from?\"* (Introduction to water cycle and material properties.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Beach Exploration (Real or Virtual Field Trip)**\n   - If possible, take a brief walk to a local beach or sandy area to observe real burrows, shells, and animal homes. If not, use a virtual beach tour video (5-7 minutes).\n   - Have students sketch or photograph real habitats they see.\n   - Discussion: *\"Did we see real crab burrows? What else did we find?\"*\n   - Connects to authentic habitat observation and real-world science.\n\n2. **Sensory Story & Drama: \"A Day in the Life of a Crab\"**\n   - Read a simple beach-themed picture book (e.g., *A House for Hermit Crab* by Eric Carle, or *Crab's Shell Home* if available).\n   - Act out a day in the crab's life: hiding in the burrow, coming out to find food, going back to hide.\n   - Students take turns being the crab, moving through a sensory \"beach\" (sand table, shells, etc.).\n   - Reinforces habitat concepts through kinesthetic learning.\n\n3. **Create a Classroom Beach Diorama**\n   - As a class or in small groups, build a larger beach habitat in a box or on a tray.\n   - Include: sand, shells, rocks, toy animals, and clearly labeled burrows.\n   - Label different habitats with student-made signs: \"Crab's Home,\" \"Bird's Nest,\" etc.\n   - Display in classroom for other classes to view.\n   - Encourages collaboration, vocabulary reinforcement, and school community engagement.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Sensory Considerations:** Some students may have sand texture sensitivities. Offer alternatives: kinetic sand, moon sand, or even beans/lentils. Always ask before requiring touch.\n  \n- **Safety Reminder:** Ensure no sand enters eyes or mouths. Keep sand exploration contained. Wash hands after activity.\n\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Use the key terms (crab, burrow, sand, beach, habitat) consistently throughout both sessions. Repetition is crucial for Kindergarten retention.\n\n- **Photograph Revisiting:** Return to the photograph multiple times across the lesson. Each time, students will notice new details and make deeper connections.\n\n- **Real Crab Connection (Optional):** If you have a classroom crab or can view a short, age-appropriate video of a live crab digging, this creates powerful authentic engagement. Keep exposure brief (2-3 minutes).\n\n- **Parent Communication:** Send home a simple letter explaining the lesson so families can reinforce concepts: *\"This week we learned that crabs dig homes called burrows in the sand. Ask your child: Where does the crab live? Why does it dig?\"*\n\n---\n\nThis lesson honors the photograph's natural content while building foundational understanding of habitats and animal needs—key Kindergarten ESS concepts. Students move from curiosity to hands-on exploration to vocabulary building to creative application, following the 5E model throughout.",
