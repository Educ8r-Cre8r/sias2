  "content": "# NGSS Engineering Design Challenge: Waterside Erosion & Access\n\n---\n\n## ### Visible Elements in Photo\n- Bare, sloped ground transitioning from upper bank to water's edge\n- Multiple mature trees with exposed root systems near the water\n- Wire/metal fencing running along the hillside\n- Calm body of water (pond or slow-moving water)\n- Wooden posts or stakes marking the slope\n- Mix of leaf litter, bare soil, and sparse vegetation on the bank\n\n---\n\n## ### Reasonable Inferences\n1. **From exposed roots and bare slope**: Water erosion or seasonal thaw is removing topsoil and destabilizing the bank, exposing tree roots.\n2. **From fencing and posts**: The landowner has attempted to manage or protect this area from further erosion or animal access.\n3. **From water level and season**: This appears to be early spring (seasonal thaw visible in the water color), when water volume and flow increase, accelerating erosion.\n\n---\n\n## ### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2:**\nYour forest ground is washing away when water flows down the hill. Build a \"stopper\" using sticks, leaves, and soil to slow the water and keep the dirt from sliding into the pond. Test it with water poured from a cup. Does your stopper catch dirt and slow the water?\n\n**3-5:**\nDesign and build a shoreline stabilization barrier that will:\n- Reduce soil loss when water flows down a sloped surface (test using a measured amount of water poured from a pitcher)\n- Withstand at least 3 test runs without completely failing\n- Use only natural or recycled materials (twigs, leaves, cardboard, burlap, soil)\n- Keep at least 75% of loose soil from entering the \"water\" zone\n\nSuccess measured by: soil retained in the barrier zone (weigh before/after) and barrier integrity after water tests.\n\n---\n\n## ### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis photo clearly shows a *real environmental problem*—bank erosion threatening tree stability and water quality. Students naturally ask: \"Why is this happening?\" and \"How can we fix it?\" The visible erosion damage prompts students to observe, question, and identify the need before imagining solutions. This grounding in a genuine problem builds authentic motivation for the design process.\n\n---\n\n## ### Suggested Materials\n- Twigs, branches, and fallen logs\n- Burlap or landscape fabric scraps\n- Cardboard pieces or paper\n- Soil and leaf litter (from outdoors or bagged)\n- Wire or garden stakes\n- Cups or pitchers for water testing\n- Optional: clay, straw, or mulch\n\n---\n\n## ### Estimated Time\n- **K-2**: 45–60 minutes (includes observation, building, and 2–3 water tests)\n- **3-5**: Two 45-minute sessions (Session 1: observe, plan, build; Session 2: test, measure, iterate)\n\n---\n\n## ### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis challenge directly addresses **NGSS K-ESS2-1 / 2-ESS2-1** (weathering and erosion) and **ETS1-1/2** (defining problems and designing solutions), while using a tangible, local environmental context that makes engineering relevance impossible to ignore.",
