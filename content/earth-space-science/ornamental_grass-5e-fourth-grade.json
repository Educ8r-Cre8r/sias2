Observe and describe how frost (frozen water) forms on plants and explain the connection to freezing temperatures.\n2. Identify how plants and vegetation help prevent soil erosion and weathering.\n3. Explain how freeze-thaw cycles contribute to weathering and gradual landscape changes over time.\n4. Predict how repeated freezing and thawing of water can break down materials and change Earth's surface.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about frost and connect it to larger Earth processes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital display of the frost-covered ornamental grass photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Real frost-covered plant sample (if available) or collected frost photos from students' homes\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster. Ask students to sit in a semicircle where all can see clearly.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see covering the grass and plants in this picture? What is it made of?\"\n   - \"How do you think this 'sparkly coating' got there? Where did it come from?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen frost or ice on plants outside your home? What time of year was it?\"\n   - \"If frost is frozen water, what happens when the sun comes up and the frost melts away?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder what happens to the soil under these frost-covered plants when the ice melts and refreezes many times. What do you think might happen to the dirt and tiny rocks in the ground?\" Have students share predictions and record them on chart paper labeled \"Our Frost Predictions.\"\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be Earth scientists and discover how frost and freezing water can actually change the shape of our planet. Let's explore this in our next activity!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students conduct hands-on investigations to discover how freezing and thawing affect materials, modeling the freeze-thaw weathering process.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small soil samples in clear plastic cups (one per student pair), pre-gathered from outside or purchased\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Paper towels\n- Freezer access (ideally a class freezer or school freezer, coordinated with custodian)\n- Magnifying glasses\n- Observation notebooks or data sheets\n- Small rocks or gravel mixed into some soil cups (optional, for enhanced observation)\n- Camera or smartphone to document changes (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Station Setup (Prepare the day before):**\n- Create two identical sets of soil cups:\n  - **Cup A (Freeze-Thaw Group):** Lightly mist soil with water, place in freezer overnight, will be removed to thaw during class\n  - **Cup B (Control Group):** Same soil, kept at room temperature, remains dry\n\n**Student Directions (Presented on poster or board):**\n\n1. \"Examine your soil cup carefully using a magnifying glass. Look at the soil particles, any rocks, and how tightly packed everything is. Draw what you see in your notebook.\"\n\n2. \"Feel the soil with your fingers. Is it wet or dry? Hard or crumbly? Record your observations.\"\n\n3. \"If your group has the Freeze-Thaw Cup (Cup A): This cup spent the night in the freezer with water in it. What do you notice? Has anything changed? Look for cracks, ice crystals, loose particles, or broken rocks.\"\n\n4. \"If your group has the Control Cup (Cup B): Examine this dry soil. How is it different from the frozen cup? Record the differences.\"\n\n5. \"Now, carefully break apart the soil in both cups with a plastic spoon. Which one breaks apart more easily? Which one has more loose particles? Why do you think that is?\"\n\n6. \"Draw or describe the differences between the two cups in your observation notebook.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between groups, asking guiding questions: *\"What changed from yesterday? Why do you think that happened? How is this like what happens in nature?\"*\n- Avoid giving answers; instead, encourage observation: *\"What do you notice about the texture? The particles? The structure?\"*\n- Help students use magnifying glasses to see fine details.\n- Take photos of dramatic differences for group discussion.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that the freeze-thaw cup has cracked soil, loosened particles, and possibly broken rocks.\n- Students recognize that frozen water (ice) expands and pushes soil apart.\n- Students record and compare observations between the two cups.\n- Students begin to hypothesize that repeated freezing and thawing breaks down soil and rocks over time.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize learning with vocabulary and connect observations to real-world weathering processes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Photograph from Engage phase\n- Explore activity results (the two soil cups)\n- Optional: short video clip (2-3 minutes) showing time-lapse of frost formation or rock breakdown (search \"freeze-thaw weathering animation\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:** \n   - Ask 2-3 student pairs to share their observations from the Explore activity.\n   - Show the photographs taken during exploration. Ask: *\"How does our cup experiment show us what happens in nature, like with the frost-covered grass in our photo?\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (write each on chart paper with a picture):\n\n   - **Frost:** Tiny ice crystals that form on surfaces when the temperature drops below freezing (32°F). Frost is frozen water that comes from water vapor in the air.\n   \n   - **Weathering:** The slow breaking down of rocks and soil caused by wind, water, ice, and living things. Weathering changes Earth's surface over time.\n   \n   - **Freeze-Thaw Cycle:** When water freezes and turns to ice (making it bigger and push things apart), then melts back to water. This cycle can happen many times and break down rocks and soil.\n   \n   - **Erosion:** The movement of soil and broken rock pieces from one place to another, usually by water, wind, or gravity.\n   \n   - **Vegetation:** Plants and grass that grow in soil and help hold it together with their roots, preventing erosion.\n\n3. **Make Connections:**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"The frost we see here is made of ice crystals. Under the soil where these grass roots grow, the same freeze-thaw cycle is happening. Water seeps into tiny cracks in rocks, freezes, expands, and pushes the rock apart—just like what happened in our cups!\"\n   - Show the \"before and after\" soil cups side by side: \"This is weathering happening in real time, thanks to frozen water.\"\n   - Explain: \"Over many seasons—years, even—this weathering breaks big rocks into smaller and smaller pieces, creating soil that plants need to grow.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If it freezes and thaws once, does that break rocks into tiny pieces? What if it happens 100 times? 1,000 times? Why?\"\n   - Have students turn to a partner and explain: \"Tell your partner how frost and freezing water can change the landscape.\"\n   - Listen for correct use of weathering, freeze-thaw, and erosion in their explanations.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Frost:** Tiny ice crystals that form on surfaces when it gets very cold (below 32°F).\n- **Weathering:** The slow breaking down of rocks and soil by ice, water, wind, and plants.\n- **Freeze-Thaw Cycle:** When water freezes solid, gets bigger, and pushes things apart—then melts and can freeze again.\n- **Erosion:** When soil and pieces of rock get moved from one place to another by water, wind, or gravity.\n- **Vegetation:** Living plants (like grass and trees) that help hold soil in place with their roots.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define weathering and freeze-thaw cycles in their own words.\n- Students connect their Explore observations to the processes shaping Earth's landscape.\n- Students understand that frost, freezing, and thawing are part of Earth's natural weathering processes.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to new scenarios and deepen knowledge about how weathering changes landscapes over time.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or images showing landscapes affected by erosion and weathering (canyons, rocky cliffs, river valleys, damaged sidewalks/roads)\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Scenario cards (printed or written on index cards)\n- Optional: modeling clay or salt dough\n\n**Activity Option A: Landscape Analysis**\n\n1. **Display images** of real-world landscapes shaped by weathering (Grand Canyon, river valleys, frost-cracked sidewalks, mountain slopes with erosion gullies).\n\n2. **Ask:** \"How do you think freeze-thaw weathering helped create these landscapes? Which ones show effects of water, ice, and freezing?\"\n\n3. **Students discuss and hypothesize** which landscapes were most affected by freeze-thaw weathering and which by other types of weathering.\n\n4. **Record ideas** on chart paper: \"Freeze-Thaw Weathering Changes Our Earth.\"\n\n**Activity Option B: Real-World Problem Scenarios** (Recommended—more engaging for Fourth Grade)\n\n1. **Present scenario cards** to small groups. Example scenarios:\n   - *\"A homeowner in Minnesota has a driveway with cracks. Every winter, frost forms in the cracks and the driveway breaks apart more. How can understanding freeze-thaw weathering help them fix this problem?\"*\n   - *\"Farmers plant grass on steep hillsides to prevent soil erosion. Why is vegetation important when freeze-thaw weathering is breaking down rocks and soil?\"*\n   - *\"A hiking trail in a mountain area shows big rocks broken into many pieces. What Earth process likely caused this, and how long did it probably take?\"*\n\n2. **Student task:** Discuss the scenario and write or draw an explanation of how freeze-thaw weathering or vegetation affects the situation.\n\n3. **Share-out:** Groups present their scenarios and solutions. Highlight how understanding weathering helps us solve real problems.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group discussions with questions: *\"What evidence do you see of weathering? How does freezing and thawing play a role? How long might this have taken?\"*\n- Validate creative thinking while guiding toward accurate scientific reasoning.\n- Celebrate connections to the Explore activity and vocabulary.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply freeze-thaw weathering concepts to new landscapes and real-world situations.\n- Students recognize that weathering is a slow process that happens over long periods.\n- Students explain the importance of vegetation in preventing erosion.\n- Students use domain-specific vocabulary (weathering, freeze-thaw, erosion, vegetation) in explanations.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess mastery of learning objectives through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Note which students correctly identified differences between the freeze-thaw and control cups and offered scientific explanations.\n- **Partner Talk during Explain:** Listen for accurate use of vocabulary and logical connections between frost/ice and weathering.\n- **Elaboration discussions:** Assess ability to apply concepts to new scenarios.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket** (Administer at end of Lesson 2)\n\n**Provide each student with an index card. Ask them to complete all three prompts:**\n\n1. **Draw or write:** \"What is frost, and where does it come from?\"\n\n2. **Explain:** \"How does freeze-thaw weathering break down rocks? Use the words 'ice,' 'expand,' and 'break' in your answer.\"\n\n3. **Predict:** \"If a rock experiences 50 freeze-thaw cycles each winter, and winters happen every year for 100 years, what will happen to that rock?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ **Meets Standard:** Student correctly describes frost as frozen water, explains that ice expands and breaks rocks apart, and predicts that repeated cycles cause significant breakdown over time. Uses at least 2 vocabulary terms correctly.\n- ✓ **Approaching Standard:** Student describes frost; explains freeze-thaw process with minor inaccuracies; uses 1-2 vocabulary terms. Prediction is partially supported by reasoning.\n- ✓ **Below Standard:** Student struggles to describe frost or freeze-thaw process; limited or inaccurate vocabulary use; prediction lacks scientific reasoning.\n\n**Additional Exit Ticket Question (Optional, for deeper assessment):**\n- \"How does planting grass on a hillside help prevent erosion from freeze-thaw weathering?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly explain frost formation and freeze-thaw weathering.\n- 75% of students will accurately predict long-term effects of repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\n- All students will demonstrate understanding of at least 3 key vocabulary terms.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a classroom poster with pictures and simple definitions of frost, weathering, freeze-thaw, and erosion. Review before each phase. Allow students to reference this during Explore and Evaluate.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Worksheet:** Provide a pre-made observation sheet with sentence starters and labeled diagrams for the Explore phase:\n   - \"The frozen soil looks _____.\"\n   - \"The room-temperature soil looks _____.\"\n   - \"I think the ice made the soil break apart because _____.\"\n\n3. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair struggling students with proficient readers/explainers during group activities. Assign roles clearly (e.g., one student manipulates materials, the other records observations).\n\n4. **Visual Supports:** Use photographs and diagrams extensively. Create a \"weathering sequence\" poster showing ice forming, expanding, rocks breaking—concrete visual progression.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Scenario Analysis:** Provide advanced learners with more complex real-world cases:\n   - \"Research how freeze-thaw weathering affects different types of rock. Why might granite break faster than limestone?\"\n   - \"If a location has mild winters with few freeze-thaw cycles, and another has harsh winters with many cycles, which landscape will change faster? Explain your reasoning with evidence.\"\n\n2. **Quantitative Investigation:** Have advanced students predict and measure:\n   - How many freeze-thaw cycles does it take to noticeably alter the soil sample?\n   - Create a hypothesis: \"After 5 cycles, 10 cycles, 15 cycles, I predict the soil will look _____.\"\n   - Conduct multiple freeze-thaw cycles and graph or chart results.\n\n3. **Erosion Experiment Extension:** Challenge students to design an experiment testing whether vegetation actually prevents erosion. They could:\n   - Create two small soil hillsides (with and without grass/plant roots).\n   - Simulate heavy rain or water runoff.\n   - Measure and compare soil loss from each.\n   - Present findings to the class.\n\n4. **Historical Landscape Interpretation:** Provide images of famous landscapes (Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, Badlands) and have students write an explanation of how freeze-thaw weathering contributed to their formation over geological time.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### 1. **Frost Photo Scavenger Hunt (Homework or Follow-Up)**\n   - **Activity:** Send students home with a camera or use their family's camera to photograph frost, ice, or frost damage around their neighborhood or yard.\n   - **Task:** Capture images of frost on plants, ice on sidewalks, or cracked pavement they think might have been affected by freeze-thaw weathering. Students bring photos to class and create a \"Frost Evidence Gallery\" on a classroom bulletin board.\n   - **Connection:** Connects science to students' home environments and reinforces observation skills.\n   - **Grade Alignment:** Meets 4-ESS2-1 (making observations of weathering effects).\n\n### 2. **Rock Weathering Timeline (Follow-Up Lesson or Early Finisher)**\n   - **Activity:** Students research or create a visual timeline showing how a large boulder might be broken down by freeze-thaw weathering over 1,000+ years. Include:\n     - Year 1: Boulder with small cracks forming.\n     - Year 100: More cracks, some pieces breaking off.\n     - Year 500: Large sections separated.\n     - Year 1,000+: Boulder mostly broken into smaller rocks and gravel.\n   - **Materials:** Poster paper, colored pencils, pictures of real weathered rocks.\n   - **Presentation:** Students explain how repeated weathering over long time periods creates gradual landscape change.\n\n### 3. **Vegetated vs. Bare Soil Erosion Simulation** (Follow-Up Hands-On Activity)\n   - **Activity:** Create a rain erosion experiment comparing two hillside models:\n     - **Model A:** Hillside with planted grass or roots embedded in soil.\n     - **Model B:** Bare soil, no vegetation.\n   - **Method:** Pour water (simulating rain) down each hillside into a collecting tray. Measure how much soil washes away from each.\n   - **Analysis:** Students compare erosion rates and explain why vegetation prevents erosion, reinforcing concepts from the original lesson.\n   - **Connection:** Meets 4-ESS2-1 (providing evidence of effects of vegetation on erosion).\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Freezer Coordination:** Reach out to custodian/cafeteria staff weeks in advance to secure freezer space for Explore phase.\n- **Outdoor Connection:** If possible, bring students outside to observe real frost (winter months) on grass and plants. Use magnifying glasses to examine ice crystals up close.\n- **Real-World Photo:** The ornamental grass photo is perfect because students can immediately see frost's beauty and connect it to the weathering concept.\n- **Revisit the Photo:** Return to the original photograph repeatedly throughout the lesson. Each time students see it, they'll have deeper understanding.\n- **Pacing:** Two 45-minute sessions allows time for processing. Adjust based on your class's needs.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson deeply connects the beauty of frost in the photograph to fundamental Earth and Space Science principles, making abstract weathering processes concrete and observable for Fourth Grade learners.",
