Identify natural materials (wood, straw, leaves, clay) that humans use to build shelters.\n2. Explain that shelters protect people from weather and help meet their needs for safety and warmth.\n3. Demonstrate how different materials work together to make a shelter strong and warm.\n4. Suggest at least one way they could reduce waste when building or using shelters.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate prior knowledge about shelters and build curiosity about how natural materials keep us safe.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the wood-framed structure with insulation (displayed on screen or printed large)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small wooden blocks and fabric scraps for handling\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all children can see. Ask them to sit in a circle or on the carpet.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is this building made of?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen wood used to build things? Where?\"\n   - \"Why do you think someone put all that fluffy gray stuff (insulation) on the walls?\"\n   - \"What does a shelter do? How does it help people?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what would happen if we didn't have walls or insulation in our homes when it gets really cold or rainy. Let's find out how these natural materials help keep us safe and cozy!\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper in simple words and pictures. Validate all responses.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Today, we're going to be builders and discover which materials work best for making shelters.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students will investigate which natural materials provide the best protection and warmth for a shelter model.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 children):**\n- Small cardboard or wooden boxes (toilet paper tubes, tissue boxes, or small gift boxes)\n- Natural materials: dry leaves, straw/hay, moss, crumpled newspaper, small twigs, cotton balls (represents wool insulation)\n- Thin plastic sheets or aluminum foil (represents metal roofing)\n- Tape and glue sticks\n- Thermometer (digital or simple bulb type) — 1 per group\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Paper towels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge:** \"We're going to build a tiny shelter for a toy animal (or small figure). We have different materials to choose from. Your job is to find out which materials keep the inside warm and dry.\"\n\n2. **Step-by-step exploration:**\n   - Show children all the materials. Let them touch, feel, and describe each one: \"Is it rough? Soft? Does it keep you warm?\"\n   - Assign each group a small box as their \"shelter frame.\"\n   - Give each group 3-4 different materials (mix them up—different groups get different combinations).\n   - Children stuff or tape their chosen materials inside and around the box to insulate it.\n   - Have groups use the spray bottle to sprinkle water on the outside (simulating rain) and observe if water gets inside.\n   - Place a thermometer inside each shelter and measure the temperature after 5 minutes.\n\n3. **What to record/document:**\n   - Draw pictures of the materials they used\n   - Record whether water got inside (yes/no with pictures)\n   - Write or dictate which shelter felt warmest by touching it\n\n4. **Teacher role:** Circulate to ask open-ended questions: \"Why do you think that material kept the water out?\" \"Which one feels the warmest to you?\" Don't correct; guide curiosity. Help with thermometer readings and water spraying as needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that thicker, fluffier materials (straw, cotton, crumpled paper) trap warmth.\n- Students observe that smooth materials like plastic or foil resist water.\n- Students begin to understand that combining different materials makes better shelters.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect discoveries to how real shelters work.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple drawings\n- Photograph of the original structure displayed again\n- Optional: picture book excerpt about animal homes or human shelters (e.g., *A House for Hermit Crab* by Eric Carle or similar simple text)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore:**\n   - Ask each group: \"What did your shelter look like? What materials did you use?\"\n   - \"Which material kept the water out best? Which made the inside warm?\"\n   - Record responses on chart paper with pictures.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions:**\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---------------------------|\n   | **Shelter** | A safe place that protects people or animals from weather like rain, snow, wind, and cold. |\n   | **Insulation** | Material (like the fluffy gray stuff in the picture) that traps warm air and keeps heat inside. |\n   | **Natural materials** | Things from nature that we can use, like wood, straw, leaves, and clay. |\n   | **Protect** | To keep something safe from harm. Shelters protect us from getting wet and cold. |\n   | **Weather** | What it's like outside—hot, cold, rainy, windy, sunny. |\n\n3. **Connection back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the wood: \"See the wood frame? That's like the skeleton of the shelter—it holds everything up.\"\n   - Point to the insulation: \"See that gray fluffy stuff? That's insulation. It traps warm air inside, just like the materials you chose.\"\n   - Point to the window: \"Windows let light in so we can see. But they also let heat escape, so buildings need good insulation.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think people put insulation in walls?\" (Pause for answers.)\n   - \"If it rains, what keeps the water out?\" (Point to the roof/walls.)\n   - \"What natural materials did you use that worked like real building materials?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Shelter:** A safe place that protects people or animals from bad weather.\n- **Insulation:** Soft, fluffy material that keeps heat inside and cold outside.\n- **Natural materials:** Things from nature we can use to build, like wood, straw, leaves, and stone.\n- **Protect:** To keep safe from rain, wind, cold, or harm.\n- **Weather:** What it's like outside (rainy, cold, hot, windy, sunny).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name at least 2 materials used in shelters.\n- Students understand that shelters keep people safe and warm.\n- Students can explain that insulation traps warmth.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing an improvement to reduce waste and environmental impact.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and colored markers\n- Collected recycled materials (cardboard tubes, newspaper, fabric scraps, old socks, plastic bags—items heading to trash)\n- Shelter models from Explore phase (or new boxes)\n- Picture cards showing recycling symbols and waste (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-world connection:**\n   - Explain: \"People want to build shelters, but we also want to take care of our Earth. If we use a lot of new materials, we have to cut down many trees and it makes trash. What if we built shelters with materials we already have—like things we were going to throw away?\"\n\n2. **Design challenge (age-appropriate version):**\n   - Show children the \"recycled\" materials pile (materials heading to the trash).\n   - Ask: \"Can we use any of these to improve our shelters instead of throwing them away?\"\n   - Let children choose recycled materials to add to or rebuild their shelter.\n   - Ask: \"Does your new shelter still keep things warm and dry? Did we use less new stuff?\"\n\n3. **Discussion:**\n   - \"What waste did we use instead of throwing away?\" (Point to items.)\n   - \"How did using old materials help our planet?\" (Less garbage, fewer trees cut, less pollution.)\n   - \"Could you use recycled materials in a real house?\"\n\n4. **Teacher role:** Facilitate choice-making and celebration. Validate all attempts. Ask guiding questions like, \"Why did you choose that material?\" and \"How does that help the Earth?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create an improved shelter using at least one recycled material.\n- Students articulate (in simple terms) that reusing materials is good for the Earth.\n- Students demonstrate problem-solving: \"We can use old things in new ways.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of shelter materials and environmental responsibility.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative assessment during lesson:**\n   - **Observation checklist** during Explore and Elaborate phases:\n     - ☐ Student handles and describes properties of materials\n     - ☐ Student makes predictions about material effectiveness\n     - ☐ Student attempts to insulate or weatherproof their shelter\n     - ☐ Student suggests or uses recycled materials in elaboration\n   - **Listen for understanding** during whole-group discussions: Do students use vocabulary correctly? Can they explain why materials were chosen?\n\n2. **Exit ticket or summative assessment:**\n   - **Option A (Verbal—best for Kindergarten):** Ask each child individually:\n     - \"What is a shelter?\"\n     - \"Show me a material that keeps things warm. Why did you pick that one?\"\n     - \"Can we use old things to build shelters? Why is that good?\"\n   - **Option B (Picture task):** Show a simple drawing of a house with empty walls. Provide picture options of materials (wood, leaves, plastic, straw, glass). Ask, \"Which materials should we use? Why?\" Child points or glues pictures.\n   - **Option C (Drawing and dictation):** Children draw a shelter they built and dictate one sentence: \"My shelter is made of _____ so it keeps _____ out.\" Teacher records.\n\n3. **Success criteria:**\n   - Student can identify at least 2 materials used in shelters.\n   - Student can explain (simply) that shelters protect people.\n   - Student recognizes that some materials are better for keeping things warm or dry.\n   - Student demonstrates awareness that reusing materials helps the Earth.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most children will understand the basic purpose of a shelter (protection).\n- Students will identify natural/recycled materials as useful for building.\n- Students will show emerging understanding that material properties matter (thick = warmer, smooth = water-resistant).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n1. **Simplified material choices:** Provide only 2-3 clearly different materials (e.g., straw, plastic, wood) rather than many options, reducing decision fatigue.\n2. **Hand-over-hand exploration:** Physically guide students' hands through touching and comparing materials; use descriptive language together (\"This is soft... this is rough...\").\n3. **Visual supports:** Use picture cards (drawn or photographed) showing the function of each material rather than relying on verbal explanation alone.\n4. **Pre-teach vocabulary:** Before the lesson, read a very simple picture book about animal homes or shelters and use those same words throughout.\n5. **Shortened activity:** Allow these students to observe, handle, and describe materials without having to build a full model; focus on sensory exploration and basic naming.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n1. **Engineering design:** \"Build two shelters—one that's waterproof and one that's warm. Which design works better for each job? Can you build one that does BOTH?\"\n2. **Material comparison chart:** Have them create a simple chart (with pictures or words) comparing materials: \"soft/hard,\" \"keeps dry/gets wet,\" \"warm/cold.\" Tally which shelter wins each category.\n3. **Real-world research:** Ask, \"What materials does your house use? Can you find examples of insulation, roofing, or wood in our school or home?\" Collect pictures or samples to share.\n4. **Sustainability connection:** \"How many pieces of waste did we reuse? Could a whole neighborhood build shelters this way?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Animal Homes Exploration:** Set up a classroom \"habitat station\" with pictures of different animal homes (bird nest, beaver dam, termite mound, rabbit burrow). Ask, \"What materials did the animal use? What does it protect them from?\" Connect to human shelters: \"We all need homes made from materials that work in our environment.\"\n\n2. **Weather Chart and Shelter Needs:** Create a simple weekly weather chart (sunny, rainy, snowy, windy icons). Each day, ask, \"What do we need our shelter to protect us from TODAY? Is insulation more important when it's cold, or when it's hot?\" This reinforces K-ESS2-1 (patterns over time) while deepening shelter understanding.\n\n3. **Take-home challenge:** Send home a note (with pictures for preliterate families): \"Find three natural materials in your home or yard that could be used to build a shelter. Draw them or collect them. Bring them back to show the class. We'll create a big classroom shelter model together!\"\n\n4. **Recycling sorting game:** Bring in pictures of items (newspaper, plastic bottle, wooden spoon, fabric scrap, glass jar). Children sort them into \"reuse for shelter,\" \"recycle,\" and \"compost.\" Connects to K-ESS3-3 (reducing human impact).\n\n5. **Circle discussion: \"Houses around the world\":** Show simple pictures of different cultural shelters (teepee, igloo, stilt house, adobe dwelling). Ask, \"What materials are used here? Why? What weather do they protect from?\" This expands understanding that shelter design connects to environment and available materials.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\nThis lesson honors Kindergarteners' natural curiosity about how things work while keeping expectations concrete and hands-on. The photograph of the wooden-framed structure with insulation is an excellent real-world anchor—it's not a cartoon; it's an actual building showing actual materials. Kindergarteners will be engaged by the tactile experience of handling materials and building something with their hands.\n\n**Timing:** If you combine Sessions 1 and 2 in one block, insert a 5-minute movement break after Explore (e.g., \"Stand up like a strong wooden beam! Stretch like insulation getting warm!\").\n\n**Safety:** Pre-check spray bottles for mold; ensure no small parts become choking hazards; supervise use of scissors or tape.\n\n**Inclusive design:** All students participate in discovery through touch, sight, and discussion—no prerequisite literacy required, though you'll record and read back student ideas.",
