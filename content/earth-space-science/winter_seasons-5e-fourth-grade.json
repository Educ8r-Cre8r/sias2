ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest in how ice and snow change Earth's surface by examining the photograph and connecting to winter observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed copy of the winter photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: short video clip (30–45 seconds) of icicles forming or ice breaking concrete (search \"ice weathering\" online)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Ask students to study it silently for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions:**\n   - \"What do you see covering the trees, branches, and ground in this picture?\" (Snow and ice)\n   - \"Why is the snow so thick and heavy on some branches? Do you think this is easy or hard for the plant?\" (Heavy weight; plants bend or break)\n   - \"What do you think happens to rock or concrete if snow and ice keep piling on it, freezing and melting over and over?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen cracks in sidewalks or roads in winter or spring? What do you think causes them?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what happens to rocks, sidewalks, and plants when water freezes and unfreezes over and over again. Let's investigate!\"\n\n4. **Record** student predictions on chart paper: *\"What does ice do to Earth's materials?\"*\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to act like Earth scientists and test how freezing water damages different materials, just like it does in nature during winter.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the physical effects of freezing and thawing through a hands-on experiment.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2–3 students):**\n- 2–3 different sample materials: a smooth stone/pebble, a brick piece or concrete sample, modeling clay, a small terracotta pot, or chalk (collect beforehand or use craft clay)\n- 3 clear plastic cups or containers\n- Water\n- Freezer access (or use ice from a freezer)\n- A tray to catch any spills\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Observation sheet (provided below)\n- Hammer and safety goggles (teacher-supervised; optional for breaking samples after experiment)\n\n**Activity: Freeze-Thaw Weathering Simulation**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **Prepare your samples:** Place one material sample (e.g., a pebble or piece of chalk) in each cup.\n\n2. **Add water:** Fill each cup about halfway with water, ensuring the sample is partially submerged or surrounded by water.\n\n3. **Measure and observe:** Use the ruler to measure any cracks, gaps, or the overall size of your sample. Draw or describe what it looks like in your observation sheet.\n\n4. **Freeze:** Place all cups in the freezer overnight (or use pre-made ice from the freezer's ice maker and pack it around the samples).\n\n5. **Remove and thaw:** The next day (or after 4–6 hours), remove the cups and let them sit at room temperature for 15–20 minutes.\n\n6. **Observe and measure:** Look for cracks, chips, or changes in the samples. Measure again and compare to your first observations. Record what changed.\n\n7. **Repeat:** If time allows, refreeze and thaw one more time to show that the damage increases.\n\n**Observation Sheet (students complete):**\n\n| Material Sample | Appearance Before | Size/Condition Before | Appearance After | Size/Condition After | What Changed? |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Sample 1: _______ | (Draw or describe) | (Measure: _____ cm) | (Draw or describe) | (Measure: _____ cm) | Cracks? Chips? Smaller? |\n| Sample 2: _______ | (Draw or describe) | (Measure: _____ cm) | (Draw or describe) | (Measure: _____ cm) | Cracks? Chips? Smaller? |\n| Sample 3: _______ | (Draw or describe) | (Measure: _____ cm) | (Draw or describe) | (Measure: _____ cm) | Cracks? Chips? Smaller? |\n\n**Connection to the photograph:**\n- \"Just like the branches in the photo are bent by heavy snow, the water in our cups expanded when it froze and pushed on the rocks from the inside—breaking them apart.\"\n- \"In nature, this happens thousands of times over many years, slowly breaking down mountains and rocks.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice about your sample? Did freezing and thawing change it? How?\"*\n- Encourage students to measure carefully and compare their before/after observations.\n- Do **not** tell students what the answer is; let them discover the damage themselves.\n- Facilitate safe freezer use and material handling.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe visible cracks, chips, or breakage in at least one material.\n- Students record measurements showing materials became smaller or were damaged.\n- Students recognize that freezing water has power to break solid materials.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce scientific vocabulary and connect observations to weathering and erosion concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Optional: diagram showing ice expansion (search \"ice wedging diagram\" for a reference)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:**\n   - Ask 2–3 groups to share their observations: *\"What happened to your samples after freezing and thawing?\"*\n   - Record responses on chart paper.\n   - Ask: *\"Why do you think this happened?\"* (Guide them toward: \"Water expanded when it froze and pushed on the material, breaking it.\")\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** using student-friendly language:\n\n   | Vocabulary Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Weathering** | The slow breaking down of rocks and materials on Earth's surface by wind, water, ice, and temperature changes. |\n   | **Ice Wedging** (or **Frost Weathering**) | When water freezes in cracks, it expands and pushes on the rock, making the crack bigger and breaking the rock apart over time. |\n   | **Erosion** | The wearing away and movement of Earth's materials (rocks, soil) by water, wind, ice, or gravity. |\n   | **Freeze-Thaw Cycle** | The repeated freezing and thawing of water that causes weathering; happens many times in cold climates. |\n   | **Physical Weathering** | Breaking rocks apart without changing what they're made of (like ice wedging), different from chemical weathering. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - *\"The snow and ice in this picture show freeze-thaw cycles happening right now. The water from melting snow seeps into tiny cracks in rocks and tree bark. When it freezes again, it expands and makes those cracks bigger—just like in our experiment!\"*\n   - *\"Over many years, this same process breaks down mountains and creates new sediment and soil.\"*\n   - Point to the bent branches: *\"The heavy snow also shows how much force ice and snow have!\"*\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"Why do roads and sidewalks get cracked and bumpy in spring after winter?\"* (Freeze-thaw weathering)\n   - Ask: *\"If a freeze-thaw cycle happens once, do the rocks break a lot or a little?\"* (A little) *\"What if it happens 100 times?\"* (A lot—it adds up!)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Weathering:** The slow breaking down of rocks and materials on Earth's surface by wind, water, ice, and temperature changes.\n- **Ice Wedging (Frost Weathering):** When water freezes in cracks, it expands and pushes on rock, making cracks bigger and breaking rock apart over time.\n- **Erosion:** The wearing away and movement of Earth's materials (rocks, soil) by water, wind, ice, or gravity.\n- **Freeze-Thaw Cycle:** The repeated freezing and thawing of water that causes weathering; happens many times in cold climates.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that ice expanding in cracks breaks down rocks and materials.\n- Students recognize this as a slow but powerful natural process.\n- Students can explain why winter weather shapes Earth's landscapes.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding of weathering to designing solutions that protect human structures from ice damage.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Index cards or large sticky notes\n- Markers\n- Sample images of winter damage (optional: search \"pothole,\" \"frost heave,\" \"concrete damage\" online—2–3 pictures printed or projected)\n- Chart paper for solutions brainstorm\n\n**Activity: Design a Solution to Prevent Ice Weathering Damage**\n\n1. **Present the problem:**\n   - Show images of potholes, cracked sidewalks, or heaving roads.\n   - Explain: *\"Cities and towns spend billions of dollars every year fixing roads, sidewalks, and buildings damaged by freeze-thaw cycles. We need to figure out how to protect these structures.\"*\n\n2. **Brainstorm solutions as a class:**\n   - Ask: *\"How could we stop ice and snow from damaging our roads and buildings? What materials or designs could we use?\"*\n   - Record all ideas (no judgment): salt, better materials, drainage systems, sloping surfaces, different pavers, sealants, etc.\n\n3. **Evaluate solutions:**\n   - Work through 3–4 ideas as a class:\n     - *\"Salt melts ice. Does that solve the problem? (Yes, but it damages soil and plants. Is that a good trade-off?)\"*\n     - *\"We could use concrete that doesn't crack. What would that material need? (Stronger, more flexible)\"*\n     - *\"What if we drained water away from the pavement so it can't seep in and freeze?\"*\n\n4. **Sketch and explain:**\n   - In small groups, students pick one solution idea.\n   - They draw it on a large card and write 2–3 sentences explaining: *\"This solution works because...\"*\n   - Emphasize that the solution should reduce (not completely stop) the effects of freeze-thaw weathering.\n\n5. **Gallery walk (if time allows):**\n   - Post all solutions and have students view and discuss which ones might work best and why.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to think critically about trade-offs (e.g., salt works but harms plants).\n- Ask questions like: *\"Would this solution be expensive? Would it last a long time? Could it hurt the environment?\"*\n- Encourage evidence-based reasoning: *\"Why would that work better than what we have now?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students propose at least one reasonable solution to reduce freeze-thaw damage.\n- Students explain their solution using evidence from the Explore phase.\n- Students consider trade-offs and real-world constraints.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of weathering, ice wedging, and solutions to natural hazards.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- **Observation of Explore phase:** Do students identify changes in their materials? Do they measure and record carefully?\n- **Questioning during Explain:** Can students explain why ice breaks rocks?\n- **Discussion during Elaborate:** Do students propose reasonable solutions with reasoning?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper. Students answer these questions (independently, 5 minutes):\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Draw a cross-section of a rock with water in a crack that is about to freeze. Label where the water is and show with an arrow what happens when it freezes.\n\n2. **Explain:** Write 2–3 sentences answering: *\"Why does ice break rocks apart? Why is this powerful enough to damage roads and sidewalks?\"*\n\n3. **Apply:** *\"If you were building a new road in Alaska where it gets very cold and there are many freeze-thaw cycles, what would you do to protect it from weathering? Explain why.\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- Correctly show ice expansion pushing on rock (drawing with label).\n- Explain that water expands when it freezes and that repeated cycles cause more damage.\n- Propose a reasonable solution with evidence-based reasoning (e.g., \"I would use a material that doesn't absorb water because water that gets inside freezes and breaks it\").\n- Use vocabulary correctly: weathering, ice wedging, freeze-thaw cycle.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 75% of students show understanding of ice wedging and its effects.\n- Students can describe 1–2 real-world impacts and solutions.\n- Exit ticket drawings clearly show ice expansion as the mechanism.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a checklist version with yes/no questions instead of open-ended observations:\n   - *\"Did your sample crack? Yes / No\"*\n   - *\"Did your sample get smaller? Yes / No\"*\n   - *\"Did anything break off? Yes / No\"*\n\n2. **Sentence Starters for Explanation:** Provide frames for writing and discussion:\n   - *\"Ice breaks rocks because...\"*\n   - *\"This solution would work because...\"*\n\n3. **Reduce Recording Demands:** Allow students to draw pictures or take photographs instead of writing full sentences for observations.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extend the Experiment:** Have students:\n   - Test different types of water (salt water vs. fresh water) to see if dissolved minerals affect ice expansion and weathering.\n   - Increase the number of freeze-thaw cycles and graph the cumulative damage over time.\n   - Research real-world weathering in their region: *\"What rocks or structures are most affected by freeze-thaw cycles near us?\"*\n\n2. **Deeper Analysis:** Ask students to:\n   - Compare ice weathering to other types of weathering (wind, rain, chemical) using a Venn diagram.\n   - Research and present on how geologists predict future landscape changes based on freeze-thaw cycles.\n   - Investigate the cost-benefit analysis of different anti-icing road treatments (salt vs. alternatives).\n\n3. **Authentic Application:** Have students design and test a material or coating that best resists freeze-thaw damage, testing multiple iterations.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Winter Weathering Walk:** Take students on a nature walk (or virtual walk video) to observe real weathering in your community. Have them:\n   - Photograph or sketch potholes, cracked concrete, flaking rock faces, or damaged tree bark.\n   - Measure crack sizes with a ruler or tape measure.\n   - Record temperature (if it's freezing season) and map locations on a school/neighborhood map.\n   - Compare findings: *\"Where is weathering happening most? Why is that location more affected?\"*\n\n2. **Historical Landscape Analysis:** Provide before-and-after photographs of the same landscape taken 20+ years apart (search \"landscape change over time\"). Have students:\n   - Analyze what changed (erosion, weathering, vegetation loss).\n   - Hypothesize how freeze-thaw cycles contributed.\n   - Predict what the landscape might look like in another 20 years.\n\n3. **Road Salt and Plants Investigation:** Since salt is commonly used to melt ice, students can investigate its effects:\n   - Research why salt harms plants and soil.\n   - Design an experiment to test salt's impact on plant growth.\n   - Propose alternative de-icing solutions and compare them (sand, kitty litter, calcium chloride alternatives).\n   - Create a persuasive poster: *\"Better Solutions to Road Salt\"* for the school or community.\n\n4. **Indigenous Knowledge Connection:** Research how Native peoples in cold climates built structures that resisted freeze-thaw damage. Have students present findings or sketch traditional building designs and discuss why they worked.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
