ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about wind and introduce the concept of using wind to do work.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of wind turbines (projected or printed)\n- Pinwheel toys (1 per student or pair) OR paper pinwheels you've pre-made\n- Access to a fan or open window with breeze\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Hook (3 minutes):** Project the wind turbine image. Ask students, \"What do you notice about these tall structures?\" Allow responses. Say, \"These are called wind turbines, and they do something amazing—they catch the wind and turn it into electricity for people's homes. How do you think they do that?\"\n\n2. **Interactive Discovery (4 minutes):** Give each student or pair a pinwheel. Ask:\n   - \"What happens when you blow on the pinwheel?\" (Let them blow gently.)\n   - \"What if we had a really strong, steady wind like outside? What would happen?\" \n   - \"How is your pinwheel like a wind turbine?\" (Both spin when wind pushes them.)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt (3 minutes):** Show the turbines again and ask:\n   - \"Why do you think these turbines are so big and tall?\"\n   - \"What do you think happens inside them when the blades spin around and around?\"\n   - \"Could we use wind to power things we use every day?\"\n\n4. **Class Prediction (2 minutes):** Ask students to turn and talk with a partner: \"Do you think wind turbines are a good idea for making energy? Why or why not?\" Collect 2-3 brief responses.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate how wind works, build our own wind turbine, and discover why communities are choosing to use wind energy.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2.

Use the pinwheel to anchor understanding with tactile, visual experience.\n\n2. **Simplified Data Recording:** Instead of a table, provide a picture graph where students place stickers or draw simple marks to show \"more spins\" vs. \"fewer spins\" for different wind speeds. Use only two wind speeds (light/strong) instead of three.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Claims:** Provide pre-written sentence starters: \"Wind turbines are good because _____. They help by _____.\" Allow students to choose from a list of ending words (clean, safe, free, quiet).\n\n4. **Partner with a Peer:** Pair struggling students with strong partners during turbine building so they can observe and assist, developing understanding through collaboration.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Generator Exploration:** Introduce the concept of a generator—the part that converts spinning motion into electricity. Ask: \"How could we make an electric light turn on using our spinning turbine?\" (Connect to circuits if the class has studied electricity.)\n\n2. **Data Analysis at Scale:** Provide real wind speed data from a weather station or online source. Ask students to create their own bar graph showing wind speeds for different months and predict which months would be best for wind turbines. Discuss seasonal patterns.\n\n3. **Design Optimization:** Challenge students to modify their turbine design to spin faster with the same amount of wind. What if they add more blades? Longer blades? Different angles? Conduct a fair test comparing designs.\n\n4. **Research and Present:** Assign students to research a specific wind farm in the U.S. and present findings about how many turbines it has, how much energy it produces, and how many homes it powers. Connect to real-world renewable energy projects.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Wind Direction Investigation:** Create a simple wind vane using a straw, paper arrow, and tape. Place it outside and record which direction the wind comes from at different times of day over a week. Create a simple graph or chart showing patterns. Connect to 3-ESS2-1 by having students represent directional weather data over time.\n\n2. **Community Energy Audit:** Ask families to list all the ways they use electricity at home (lights, TV, refrigerator, computer, etc.). Compile a class list and discuss: \"How many of these things could be powered by wind turbines?\" Create a visual display showing estimated electricity usage that could come from wind energy.\n\n3. **Turbine Height Experiment:** Build turbines of different heights (short cup on short pencil, tall cup on tall pencil, very tall extension). Test with a fan and compare: Do taller turbines spin faster? Why? (Introduce the concept that wind is stronger higher up.) Record and graph results.\n\n4. **Compare Renewable Energy Sources:** Create a Venn diagram or T-chart comparing wind turbines to another renewable energy source (solar panels, water wheels, geothermal). Discuss advantages and disadvantages of each. Which is best for your region?\n\n5. **Engineer a Solution:** Present a design challenge: \"A coastal community wants to reduce air pollution. Design an energy solution using wind, sun, or water.\" Students sketch and label their design, explaining why it would work in that location.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\nThis lesson is engaging and hands-on, with a clear progression from concrete exploration (building and testing turbines) to abstract reasoning (making claims about renewable energy solutions). The 5E model allows students to discover the wind-turbine relationship independently before learning formal vocabulary. By anchoring concepts in the real photograph and connecting to community-level energy decisions, students develop both scientific understanding and environmental awareness appropriate for third grade.\n\nThe lesson aligns strongly with **3-ESS3-1** (making claims about design solutions) and **3-ESS2-1** (representing weather data graphically), giving students practice with both scientific reasoning and data literacy.",
