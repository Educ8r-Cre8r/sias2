Observe and describe the rings and patterns visible on a tree trunk cross-section\n2. Explain that tree rings form as trees grow during different seasons\n3. Identify that trees are natural resources from Earth that we use\n4. Predict how many rings a tree might have based on observations and size\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about tree rings and activate prior knowledge about seasons and growth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, high-quality printed color copy of the photograph (or display digitally on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Point to the circular cross-sections.\n\n2. **Introduce with wonder:** Say: \"Look at these tree slices. Do you see all these circles inside? These are called rings. What do YOU think they are? Why do you think they're there?\"\n\n3. **Pose these discussion questions (wait for responses after each):**\n   - \"What do you see inside each wood circle? Describe the rings.\"\n   - \"Why do you think some rings are thick and some are thin?\"\n   - \"Do you think the biggest circle came from the oldest tree or a younger tree? Why?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a tree or logs like this before? Where?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm thinking that these rings might tell us something about when the tree grew. What do YOU think the rings might tell us?\" Record student ideas on chart paper—don't correct, just capture.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's investigate some tree rings up close to find out what story they tell us.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students examine tree rings firsthand and discover the relationship between rings and time/seasons.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Real tree cookies (cross-sections of log, 2-3 inches thick) — approximately 1-2 per student pair OR high-quality color photographs printed on card stock\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (one per student pair)\n- Rulers or measuring tapes\n- Clipboards with paper\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Water in spray bottles (optional: lightly mist wood to enhance ring visibility)\n\n**Activity — Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Pair students** and give each pair one tree section and a hand lens.\n\n2. **Provide this simple investigation framework:**\n   - \"Look closely at your tree section with the hand lens. What do you see?\"\n   - \"Trace your finger from the center outward. Count how many rings you can see. You can mark them with a pencil if it helps.\"\n   - \"Find the thickest ring. Find the thinnest ring. Why might some be thicker than others?\"\n   - \"Measure the distance from the center to the edge. Write or draw this.\"\n\n3. **Student recording:** Students sketch their tree section on paper and label:\n   - How many rings they count\n   - Which rings are thick or thin\n   - Color of the wood (light/dark areas)\n   - Any patterns they notice\n\n4. **Facilitation notes:** Circulate and ask open-ended questions:\n   - \"Tell me what you're seeing.\"\n   - \"Why do you think that ring is thicker?\"\n   - \"What would happen if the tree got a lot of rain one year?\"\n   - Avoid giving answers; guide with \"What do you notice?\" language\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify and count rings (accuracy less important than the process)\n- Students observe that rings vary in thickness\n- Students make initial connections between ring size and growing conditions\n- Drawings show observable features: rings, bark, color variation\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and scientific explanation for why tree rings exist and what they represent.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Large printed photograph or one tree section for teacher demonstration\n- Pointer or stick\n- Whiteboard/markers for vocabulary\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Invite 4-5 pairs to share one observation from their tree section. Record responses on chart paper. Affirm observation skills.\n\n2. **Teacher explanation (use simple language and point to photo):**\n   - \"When a tree grows, it gets bigger. Every year, the tree grows a little bit more. When it grows, it makes a NEW ring—a circle of wood.\"\n   - \"Do you remember our seasons? Spring, summer, fall, winter?\" (Gesture or show pictures of seasons if available.)\n   - \"In spring and summer, trees grow a LOT because it's warm and there's lots of sunlight. They make thick rings.\"\n   - \"In fall and winter, trees grow more slowly because it's cold and dark. They make thin rings.\"\n   - \"So if I COUNT the rings, I can count how many years that tree was alive! A ring for each year.\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary introduction (point to photo and student samples):**\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|\n   | **Tree ring** | A circle of wood inside a tree that grows every year as the tree gets bigger |\n   | **Seasons** | Spring, summer, fall, and winter—times of year with different weather |\n   | **Growth** | Getting bigger; when trees make new wood |\n   | **Year** | The time it takes for all four seasons to pass |\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"If I point to a ring, can you tell me that's one year of growth?\" (Have students point and repeat with you.)\n   - \"If a tree has 10 rings, how many years old is it?\" (Simplified; focus on concept, not math)\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think thick and thin rings form?\" Elicit: warm/cold seasons, more/less growth.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that tree rings represent years of growth\n- Students connect ring thickness to seasonal growth patterns\n- Students use vocabulary: tree ring, season, growth, year\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding to a new scenario and explore the real-world value of trees.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or simple drawings of: trees, wood furniture, paper, pencils, wood toys\n- Chart paper: \"How We Use Trees\"\n- Optional: real wood items (pencil, wooden spoon, block, piece of paper) for students to handle\n- Index cards with simple icons for sorting\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-world connection:** Show or hold up real items made from wood (pencil, wooden block, paper).\n   - Say: \"Remember the tree rings we looked at? Those trees are cut down, and we use the wood to make things. Can you think of things made from trees?\"\n\n2. **Class brainstorm — \"How We Use Trees\":**\n   - Display pictures or items: desk, chair, paper, pencil, house, toy\n   - Ask: \"Which of these come from trees?\" Have students point and name.\n   - Record on chart paper with simple sketches/words.\n\n3. **Sorting activity (if time allows):**\n   - Give student pairs 4-5 picture cards showing tree products and non-tree items\n   - Students sort into two piles: \"Made from trees\" and \"Not from trees\"\n   - Pairs share their sorting; discuss any disagreements\n\n4. **Reflection prompt:**\n   - \"Trees grow slowly—each ring is a whole year! Why do you think it's important to take care of trees?\"\n   - Accept all ideas; emphasize: \"Trees give us wood for things we need.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:** Facilitate discussion, ask \"Why?\" questions, guide sorting, validate student thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify multiple products made from wood/trees\n- Students begin to understand that natural resources take time to grow and are valuable\n- Students connect tree rings (ring per year) to the time it takes to grow a tree large enough to use\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of tree rings, seasons, and growth.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during Explore and Explain):**\n- Observe student drawings and recordings: Do they show rings? Can they count them?\n- Listen to explanations: Can they use words like \"ring,\" \"year,\" \"season,\" or \"growth\"?\n- Ask individuals: \"Show me a ring. What does one ring mean?\" Listen for \"one year.\"\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes, end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple drawing of a tree cross-section (with 8-10 visible rings, clearly drawn).\n\n**Ask (show with fingers or point):**\n1. \"How many rings do you see? Point and count. Tell a friend or me.\"\n2. \"If each ring is one year, how old do you think this tree is?\" (Accept counting; no exact answer needed.)\n3. **Show two ring patterns:**\n   - One with a very thick ring\n   - One with a very thin ring\n   \n   Ask: \"Which ring might have grown in spring/summer when it was warm and sunny? Why?\"\n\n**Success Criteria — Students have met objectives if they:**\n- Count rings with reasonable accuracy (not perfect; focus on the process)\n- State that \"one ring = one year\" OR \"rings show how the tree grows\"\n- Identify that thick/thin rings relate to seasons or growing conditions\n- Name at least one tree product (wood furniture, paper, pencil)\n\n**How to Determine Success:**\n- Exit ticket responses (verbal or drawn) show understanding\n- Student drawings include visible rings and labels\n- Participation in group discussions demonstrates conceptual grasp\n- No student needs to be perfect; developmental understanding is the goal\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Reduce counting complexity:** Provide a tree section or image with pre-marked or highlighted every 5th ring. Students count the marked rings first, then practice smaller numbers.\n\n2. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"ring,\" \"tree,\" \"year,\" and \"grow.\" Avoid \"season\" temporarily; focus on \"warm time\" and \"cold time.\"\n\n3. **Hands-on emphasis:** Prioritize tactile experience with real wood samples and hand lenses over drawing/recording. Allow students to trace rings with their fingers while you narrate.\n\n4. **Sentence frames for speaking:**\n   - \"I see _____ rings.\"\n   - \"This ring is _____ (thick/thin).\"\n   - \"Trees give us _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Comparative analysis:** Give advanced students 2-3 different tree sections of varying sizes. Challenge: \"Which tree is older? How do you know?\" Encourage them to compare total ring counts and make inferences about age.\n\n2. **Prediction and estimation:** Provide a large diameter tree cross-section and ask: \"If this tree has been growing for 40 years, how many years did it take to grow to THIS size?\" Have them estimate rings per inch and calculate rough ages.\n\n3. **Seasonal connection extension:** Create a simple bar graph with students showing \"ring thickness by season.\"\n   - Draw a simplified seasonal calendar (spring/summer thick, fall/winter thin)\n   - Have students predict where each ring would fall and why\n   - Connect explicitly to 1-ESS1-2: changing daylight hours in different seasons\n\n4. **Research extension:** \"Trees grow when there's more sunlight. In which season is there MORE daylight?\" Guide students to explore how day length (the science of 1-ESS1-2) affects tree growth.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Tree Hunt Walk:** Take students on a short walk around the school grounds or nearby area. Have them observe trees of different sizes.\n   - Ask: \"Which tree looks older? Why?\"\n   - Let students touch bark, measure tree width with arms, observe variations\n   - Return and draw/discuss findings: connect to ring activity (\"We can't see the rings without cutting, but we can guess how old it is by how big it is\")\n\n2. **DIY Wood Slice Experiment:** If access to real wood slices is limited, students can create a \"paper ring model.\"\n   - Draw concentric circles on a paper plate or cardboard circle (pre-drawn or student-drawn)\n   - Color alternating rings with markers (dark and light) to represent spring/summer vs. fall/winter growth\n   - Label each ring with a season or year\n   - Write or draw what happened during that year (e.g., \"Year 3: Sunny and warm—thick ring!\")\n\n3. **Tree Timeline:** Create a class timeline showing a tree's life.\n   - Select an imaginary tree and assign it a birth year (e.g., \"This tree was born in 2010\")\n   - Draw 5-10 rings on chart paper\n   - For each ring, students illustrate or write: \"Ring 1: 2010—A seed sprouts\"; \"Ring 2: 2011—Warm summer, thick ring!\"\n   - Display in classroom as a visual reference\n\n---\n\n**Notes for Teacher Implementation:**\n\n- **Wood sourcing:** Contact local tree trimming services, parks departments, or home improvement stores for free or low-cost tree rounds. Many communities compost wood and are happy to donate for educational use.\n- **Photo-based alternative:** If real samples aren't available, high-resolution printed images work well for first graders, though the tactile experience is diminished.\n- **Seasonal timing:** This lesson is most impactful when taught near a season transition (e.g., spring to summer, fall to winter) so you can reinforce: \"Right now, trees are growing thick rings!\"\n- **Safety note:** Sand any splinters on wood samples; supervise hand lens use to ensure students don't poke eyes.\n\nThis lesson firmly grounds tree ring observation in **Earth and Space Science** by connecting observable patterns (rings) to **natural resources** and **seasonal cycles** tied to daylight changes (1-ESS1-2).",
