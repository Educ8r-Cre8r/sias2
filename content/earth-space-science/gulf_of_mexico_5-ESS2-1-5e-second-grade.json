ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about water's power to change land using the photograph and spark predictions about why a warning sign is needed at the beach.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (or projected image) of the \"Caution: Drop Off\" sign at the beach\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Picture book option: *Beaches* by Jan Pienkowski or similar simple ocean/coastal book\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or print it for the class to examine together.\n\n2. **Introduce with a question:** \"Look at this picture. What do you notice? Why do you think there's a big warning sign at the beach?\" Give students 30 seconds to turn-and-talk with a partner.\n\n3. **Ask these guiding questions** (pause for student responses after each):\n   - \"What do you see in the water?\" (waves, movement, water splashing)\n   - \"What do you see on the land?\" (the sign, a pole, sand/dirt)\n   - \"Why would someone put a warning sign here? What could be dangerous?\"\n   - \"Do you think the beach looks the same every day, or does it change?\"\n\n4. **Make a class prediction:** \"The sign says 'Drop Off.' That means the land might be falling away or getting lower. Who thinks water has anything to do with that? How could water change the land?\"\n\n5. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper: \"We wonder... Does water really change beaches? How fast? Can we stop it?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to discover how water is like a powerful tool that can change the shape of our Earth—and it happens right here at places like this beach!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students conduct a hands-on investigation to discover how water erodes (wears away) soil and sand, and to test solutions for slowing erosion.\n\n**Materials (per pair/small group):**\n- One aluminum foil baking pan or shallow plastic tray (roughly 9\" × 13\")\n- Moist soil or sand (enough to fill half the pan, about 3-4 cups)\n- Water in a pitcher or spray bottle\n- Craft sticks or popsicle sticks (for making barriers/solutions)\n- Rocks, small pebbles, or gravel\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Paper towels\n- Data sheet (simple picture chart: \"Before,\" \"During,\" \"After\")\n- Clipboard and pencil\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Water Erodes (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up:** Each pair builds a small \"coastal slope\" by piling moist soil or sand on one end of their pan, making it higher on one side and lower on the other (like a cliff meeting a beach). Leave one end of the pan empty to catch water.\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Build your 'cliff' with soil. Make it lumpy and uneven, like a real beach.\"\n   - \"Draw a picture or write on your data sheet: What does your land look like before water touches it?\"\n   - \"Now pour water slowly from your pitcher down the slope. Watch what happens!\"\n   - \"Keep pouring a little more. What happens to the soil? Where does it go? Does the shape change?\"\n   - \"Draw or write what your land looks like after the water.\"\n\n3. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask:\n   - \"What's happening to your soil right now?\"\n   - \"Is the shape changing? How?\"\n   - \"Where is the soil going? Can you see it in the water at the bottom?\"\n   - \"Is this happening fast or slow?\"\n\n4. **Expected outcomes:** Students observe that water carries soil away, the slope flattens, and soil collects at the bottom of the pan (sediment). They recognize this as erosion.\n\n**Part 2: Testing Solutions (10 minutes)**\n\n5. **New challenge:** \"Now, imagine you are scientists working for the city at that beach. You need to slow down the water so it doesn't wash away so much soil. What could you use? Try one idea and see if it works!\"\n\n6. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Choose one solution to try: rocks piled in a line, sticks placed on the slope, gravel spread across the top, or anything else you think might work.\"\n   - \"Build your solution on a fresh, rebuilt slope in your pan.\"\n   - \"Pour water again. Does it slow down? Does it stop the water? Does less soil wash away?\"\n   - \"Compare: Was more or less soil washed away with your solution than before?\"\n\n7. **Teacher role:** \n   - Encourage trial and adjustment: \"That didn't work perfectly. What could you change?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think rocks/sticks/gravel helped (or didn't help)?\"\n   - Note which students recognize that barriers slow water or catch soil.\n\n8. **Expected outcomes:** \n   - Students observe that barriers can slow erosion.\n   - Some solutions work better than others.\n   - Students begin to understand cause and effect: different materials have different effects on water flow.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts; connect discoveries back to the photograph and real-world beach erosion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words pre-written\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Optional: short (2–3 minute) video clip of real beach erosion or waves hitting a cliff (e.g., from YouTube or National Geographic Kids)\n- Picture cards showing \"fast\" and \"slow\" erosion examples\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Class share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Call on 2–3 pairs to share: \"What did your water do to the soil? Show us your before and after pictures.\"\n   - Highlight: \"I see that the water pushed the soil around!\" and \"Your solution with rocks really did slow it down!\"\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (8 minutes):** Display and discuss each term:\n\n   - **Erosion:** When water, wind, or ice wears away soil and rock and moves it to a new place. (Show the photo: \"This is happening at that beach—the water is eroding the cliff.\")\n   - **Sediment:** Tiny pieces of rock and soil that get moved by water. (Point to the water in their pans: \"See that cloudy water? That's sediment being carried away.\")\n   - **Coast or Coastline:** Where the land meets the water (ocean, gulf, lake). (Point to the photograph: \"This is a coastline. This is where the warning sign is.\")\n   - **Fast vs. Slow Change:** Some Earth events happen quickly (like a big storm washing away sand), and some happen slowly (like water washing away a little bit of cliff every day for many years).\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember that sign that says 'Caution: Drop Off'? Now we know why it's there! The water and waves are slowly eroding the cliff. The land is getting lower and lower. It's not safe!\"\n   - \"The waves you see in the picture are doing the same thing your water did in the pan—wearing away the soil bit by bit.\"\n   - \"This happens at coasts all over the world.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"When you poured water on your soil, what do we call that wearing away? (Erosion) What are the little pieces of soil floating in the water called?\" (Sediment)\n   - Thumbs up/sideways/down: \"Do you think water can really change the shape of the land?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Erosion:** The wearing away and movement of soil and rock by water, wind, or ice.\n- **Sediment:** Tiny broken pieces of rock and soil carried by moving water.\n- **Coast/Coastline:** The place where land meets a large body of water.\n- **Fast change:** Something that happens in minutes, hours, or days (like a storm).\n- **Slow change:** Something that happens over weeks, months, or years.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use the word \"erosion\" to describe what water does to land.\n- Students understand that the \"Drop Off\" sign warns people because water is eroding the cliff.\n- Students recognize that erosion can happen fast or slow depending on the situation.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing and testing real-world solutions to coastal erosion, and connect to how actual communities protect their shorelines.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Additional modeling supplies: natural items (grass, twigs, leaves), craft materials (index cards, tape, foil), sand, soil, water, trays\n- Optional: Picture cards of real erosion-control methods (seawalls, sandbags, jetties, vegetation, dunes)\n- Design Planning Sheet (simple handout with space to draw and write)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-world context (3 minutes):**\n   - \"People live near coasts all over the world. When erosion happens, it can damage houses, roads, and beaches that people love. Engineers and scientists try to find ways to slow down or stop erosion.\"\n   - Show 3–4 picture examples: seawall, sandbags, planted dunes, rock barriers. \"These are real solutions people use.\"\n\n2. **Design challenge (12 minutes):**\n   - Divide the class into small groups (3–4 students per group).\n   - **Assign each group a different scenario:**\n     - Group 1: \"Stop water from washing away a sandy beach.\"\n     - Group 2: \"Protect a cliff from crumbling into the ocean.\"\n     - Group 3: \"Build a barrier that lets some water through but stops sand from moving.\"\n     - Group 4: \"Create a solution using only natural materials (grass, twigs, leaves, rocks).\"\n\n3. **Student directions:**\n   - \"Use your pan, soil, and water again. This time, design a better solution to stop erosion for your scenario.\"\n   - \"Plan your solution first: Draw it or talk about it with your group.\"\n   - \"Build your solution in the pan.\"\n   - \"Test it by pouring water. Does it work? If not, fix it and try again.\"\n   - \"On your Design Planning Sheet, draw your solution and write (or tell the teacher) why you think it would work in the real world.\"\n\n4. **Teacher role:**\n   - Ask guiding questions: \"Why did you choose rocks instead of sticks? How does that help? Would that work on a real beach?\"\n   - Push thinking: \"What happens if there's a big storm? Would your solution still work?\"\n   - Celebrate engineering thinking: \"You redesigned it! That's what real engineers do—they improve their ideas.\"\n\n5. **Share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Have 1–2 groups show their solutions and explain why they would work.\n   - Emphasize: \"Different places use different solutions because they have different problems and different materials.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a working model of an erosion-control solution.\n- Students can explain (verbally or in writing) why their solution would help slow or stop erosion.\n- Students recognize that real-world solutions must be tested and improved, just like they did.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of erosion, water's power to change land, solutions to erosion, and fast vs. slow Earth events.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Watch for students who recognize that water carries soil away and that barriers slow the water. Listen to their language: Do they use words like \"erosion,\" \"water moving,\" or \"changing\"?\n- **Check-in questions during Explain:** Use thumbs up/sideways/down and quick verbal responses to gauge understanding of vocabulary.\n- **Observations during Elaborate:** Note which students can reason about why their solutions would or wouldn't work; listen for cause-and-effect language: \"The rocks stop the water because...\"\n\n**Exit Ticket (5 minutes):** \n\nAdminister at the end of Day 2. Provide these three questions (read aloud; students can draw, dictate, or write):\n\n1. **\"What does water do to sand and soil? (Draw or tell.)\"**\n   - *Success criterion:* Student indicates that water moves, washes away, or erodes soil/sand.\n\n2. **\"Look at this picture of a beach with big waves. Is erosion happening fast or slow? Why?\"**\n   - (Show the original photograph or a similar one.)\n   - *Success criterion:* Student identifies that waves are eroding the beach, and can make a reasonable guess about speed (e.g., \"Fast, because the waves are strong\" or \"Slow, because it takes a long time\").\n\n3. **\"If you were protecting a beach from erosion, what would you try? Draw or tell.\"**\n   - *Success criterion:* Student suggests a logical barrier or solution (rocks, wall, plants, sandbags, etc.) and attempts to explain why it would help.\n\n**Summative Assessment:**\n\nAssign a take-home picture sort or simple written/drawn task:\n- **Option A (Picture sort):** Provide four images—two showing fast erosion (storm, cliff collapse) and two showing slow erosion (gradual cliff wear, beach change over seasons). Students sort them and label \"Fast\" and \"Slow.\"\n- **Option B (Drawing with caption):** \"Draw a picture of a beach or cliff where water is eroding the land. Write or tell: Is this happening fast or slow? Why?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding by:\n- Using the word \"erosion\" or describing water wearing away soil/rock.\n- Explaining that water is the cause and land shape-changing is the effect.\n- Providing at least one realistic solution to slow erosion (barrier, plants, rocks, wall).\n- Distinguishing between a fast Earth event (storm, sudden cliff collapse) and a slow one (gradual erosion over years).\n- Connecting their pan observations to the real \"Drop Off\" sign scenario.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visual support:** Create a vocabulary chart with pictures for \"erosion,\" \"water,\" and \"change.\" Pre-teach these words before Explore. Allow students to point to pictures rather than write.\n\n2. **Hands-on model with teacher guidance:** During Explore, pair struggling students with a stronger partner or work with a small group while the teacher facilitates. Provide a step-by-step pictorial instruction card (\"Step 1: Build the slope. Step 2: Pour water. Step 3: Watch the change.\") rather than verbal-only directions.\n\n3. **Concrete exit ticket:** Instead of open-ended questions, offer multiple-choice or yes/no questions with pictures:\n   - \"Does water wear away soil? Yes or No?\"\n   - \"Is this fast (picture of storm) or slow (picture of one year passing)?\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Engineering extension:** Challenge advanced students to design a solution that works in two scenarios—a regular rainstorm AND a hurricane. Have them test both and redesign based on what doesn't work. Ask: \"What would make your solution even stronger? What would break it?\"\n\n2. **Research and report:** Ask students to research a real coastal community (or provide 2–3 options like Miami Beach, California coast, etc.) and find out what erosion solution people actually use there. Have them present their findings: \"This place uses [seawall/sandbags/dunes]. It works because...\"\n\n3. **Fast vs. slow timeline:** Have students create a timeline showing erosion happening over 1 week, 1 year, and 100 years. They draw or write what a coastline might look like at each time, predicting how much erosion would occur. Discuss: \"Can we see 100 years of erosion happen in our pan?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Beach Erosion Video Documentary:** Show a short video (5–7 minutes) of real coastal erosion from sources like National Geographic Kids, USGS, or Discovery Education. Have students compare what they see in the video to their pan experiments: \"What's the same? What's different? Is it faster or slower than our water?\"\n\n2. **Design a Coastal Park:** Provide students with a blank map or poster board showing a coastline where a new park will be built. Have them design the park while also planning erosion solutions (placing rocks, trees, sandbags, walls, etc.). Ask: \"How will you keep the park safe from water damage? Where will you put protection?\"\n\n3. **Water on Earth Inventory:** Extend understanding of where water is found (2-ESS2-3) by doing a \"Water Hunt\" around school or home. Students photograph or list all the water they find (puddles, fountains, ponds, rain, rivers, etc.) and sort by \"large bodies\" (ocean, lake) vs. \"small bodies\" (puddles, fountains). Create a class chart showing that water is found in many places, and that oceans are the biggest.\n\n4. **Model Landforms Game:** Provide students with sand, rocks, and water. Set a challenge: \"Make a mountain, then a valley, then a peninsula.\" After each landform, pour water and observe how it changes. Discuss how the same force (water) shapes different landforms differently.\n\n5. **Protective Gear Investigation:** Bring in pictures of protective clothing (rain jacket, boat, surfboard) and ask: \"Why do we need these at the beach? What does water do that we need protection from?\" Extend the idea: \"Just like we wear jackets to protect from water and wind, coastlines need protection from strong water and waves.\"\n\n---\n\n**Note to Teacher:** This lesson emphasizes observable, tangible examples of Earth's dynamic systems appropriate for second graders. The \"Drop Off\" sign provides authentic, relatable context that helps students understand why this science matters to real people. The progression from personal observation → hands-on discovery → vocabulary → real-world application supports the 5E model and ensures students leave with both conceptual understanding and scientific vocabulary to describe what they've learned.",
