Identify and describe the properties of soil (color, texture, particles) and explain why soil is important to farmers and plants.\n2. Explain how weather and seasons affect when and how farmers prepare land for planting.\n3. Describe how farmers use tools and machines to work with soil and manage land.\n4. Make a claim about how soil can be protected from being washed away by rain or blown away by wind.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by examining the farm photograph and building curiosity about soil, seasons, and farm work.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color photograph of the farm equipment and tilled field (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Marker\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector where all students can see it clearly. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you notice about the ground in this picture? What does it look like, and why do you think it looks that way?\"\n   - \"Why would someone use such a big machine on a farm? What job do you think it is doing?\"\n   - \"What time of year do you think this photo was taken? How can you tell?\" (Hint: Look at the grass, the sky, and what's growing or not growing.)\n   - \"Why do farmers need to prepare the soil before planting seeds?\"\n\n3. **Record student responses** on chart paper as a \"Wonder Wall.\" Celebrate all ideas, even if not scientifically accurate yet.\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Today, we're going to become soil scientists! We'll find out what soil is made of and why farmers care so much about it. Make a prediction: What do you think soil is made of?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's get our hands dirty and explore soil up close to see if our predictions are right!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate soil properties through hands-on exploration and discover why soil matters to farmers and plants.\n\n**Materials (per student or small group of 2-3):**\n- Small plastic cup or clear container (4 oz)\n- Soil sample collected from outside (about ½ cup per group) — gather this before the lesson\n- Water in a spray bottle\n- Magnifying glass\n- Paper towel or newspaper (to contain mess)\n- Observation recording sheet (see template below)\n- Spoon or craft stick for stirring\n\n**Soil Observation Recording Sheet Template:**\n```\nMy Soil Observations\n\nColor of soil: _________________________________\n\nWhat I feel when I touch it (soft, rough, bumpy, wet, dry): \n\nWhat I see with the magnifying glass:\n\nWhat happens when I add water:\n\nMy drawing of soil up close:\n```\n\n**Activity — Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Place soil in container.** Each group gets a cup of soil on a paper towel.\n\n2. **Observe without water first.** \n   - Look at the color. Is it light or dark? All the same color?\n   - Touch it gently. Does it feel smooth or rough? Wet or dry?\n   - Use the magnifying glass. What do you see? Can you see tiny rocks, pieces of plants, or other things mixed in?\n   - Record what you observe on your sheet. Draw a picture of what you see through the magnifying glass.\n\n3. **Add water slowly.**\n   - Use the spray bottle to add a little water to the soil. What happens?\n   - Does the soil stick together? Does water drain through it quickly or slowly?\n   - How does it feel different now?\n   - Record your observations.\n\n4. **Talk with your group:**\n   - \"Where does this soil come from?\"\n   - \"What things are mixed in the soil?\"\n   - \"Why might farmers care about how soil feels and how water moves through it?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask prompting questions: \"What do you notice? Can you describe that texture? What do you think those tiny pieces are?\"\n- Resist giving answers. Instead, redirect: \"What do you think that might be? How could we find out?\"\n- Ensure students are handling soil safely (wash hands after).\n- Take note of student observations to share during Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students will observe and record that soil is made of multiple components (particles, rocks, possibly organic matter).\n- Students will discover that soil has different textures and colors.\n- Students will observe how soil responds to water (absorption, drainage, clumping).\n- Students will generate ideas about why these properties matter for farming.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain how soil properties connect to farming, weather, and seasons using evidence from student exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Photograph of the farm equipment (display again)\n- Optional: hand-drawn or printed diagram of soil layers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share one observation: \"What surprised you about the soil?\"\n   - Record key words on chart paper: color, texture, particles, water, rocks, plants.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   \n   Present each term with a simple definition and a connection to the photograph or student exploration:\n\n   - **Soil:** The top layer of Earth made up of tiny pieces of rock, water, air, and pieces of dead plants. Soil is where plants grow and get food and water.\n     - *Connection:* \"The dark stuff in the farm picture is soil. Farmers need healthy soil to grow food.\"\n   \n   - **Texture:** How something feels when you touch it—smooth, rough, bumpy, or sticky.\n     - *Connection:* \"When you felt the soil, you noticed whether it was smooth or rough. That texture tells farmers important things about the soil.\"\n   \n   - **Weathering:** The slow breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by wind, water, and time.\n     - *Connection:* \"Big rocks in soil slowly break into smaller and smaller pieces. Rain, wind, and sun help break them down over many years.\"\n   \n   - **Season:** One of four times of year—spring, summer, fall, or winter—each with different weather.\n     - *Connection:* \"In spring, farmers prepare the soil. In summer, plants grow. In fall, they harvest. In winter, the land rests. The farm picture might be taken in spring when farmers are getting ready to plant.\"\n   \n   - **Erosion:** When wind, water, or weather washes or blows soil away from where it should stay.\n     - *Connection:* \"If a farmer doesn't protect the soil, heavy rain can wash it away, or wind can blow it away. That's why farmers care about the soil!\"\n\n3. **Make Connections to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the tilled (plowed) field: \"The machine in the picture turns over the soil. Why? It mixes things up so air and water can get in. It also helps break up hard soil. This happens in spring when the weather is warming up and farmers are getting ready to plant.\"\n   - Point to the green grass and clear sky: \"The weather looks nice—not too cold, not raining hard. That's good for farm work and for soil health.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"What are two things we found in soil?\" (Students should mention: rocks, water, air, pieces of plants, or similar.)\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the farmer is using this big machine on the soil?\" (Students should relate to: loosening soil, mixing it, preparing for planting, helping water get in.)\n   - Thumbs up/sideways/down: \"Do you feel like you understand what soil is made of and why it matters?\" Observe responses and note students who need more support.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Chart (Post on Wall):**\n```\nSOIL VOCABULARY\n\nSoil = tiny rocks, water, air, and dead plants mixed together (where plants grow)\nTexture = how something feels (smooth, rough, sticky, bumpy)\nWeathering = slow breaking of rocks into smaller pieces\nSeason = one of four times of year with different weather\nErosion = wind, water, or weather washing or blowing soil away\n```\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that soil is a mixture of rocks, water, air, and plant material.\n- Students can explain why farmers care about soil texture and health.\n- Students connect soil preparation to seasonal changes and weather.\n- Students understand that erosion is a hazard that affects soil.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by designing a solution to protect soil from erosion caused by rain and wind.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3):**\n- Small aluminum baking pan or plastic container\n- Soil (about 2 cups per group)\n- Water pitcher or spray bottle\n- Small objects to test as \"barriers\": straw, gravel, leaves, cardboard, plastic sheeting, cloth strips\n- Newspaper (to protect tables)\n- Recording sheet with illustrations (see template below)\n\n**Soil Protection Design Challenge Recording Sheet Template:**\n```\nDesign Challenge: Protecting Soil from Rain\n\nThe Problem: Heavy rain washes soil away. How can we protect it?\n\nMy design idea: I will use _________________________ to protect the soil.\n\nWhy I chose this: ________________________________________\n\nWhat I predict will happen: ________________________________\n\nWhat actually happened:\n  - Did the soil stay in place? YES / NO\n  - How much soil washed away? (A little / Some / A lot)\n  - Would this work on a real farm? YES / MAYBE / NO\n  - Why or why not? ________________________________________\n\nMy claim: The best way to protect soil is ___________________\nbecause ________________________________________________\n```\n\n**Activity — Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Set up the problem:**\n   - Fill the baking pan with soil, sloping it slightly (like a hillside).\n   - Place newspaper underneath to catch runoff.\n   - Explain: \"Real farmers face heavy rain that washes soil away. We're going to test different materials to see which ones protect soil best.\"\n\n2. **Design and test a solution:**\n   - Choose ONE material from the provided options (straw, gravel, leaves, cardboard, cloth, or plastic).\n   - Arrange it on top of the soil or around the soil to protect it from water.\n   - Record your design choice and prediction.\n\n3. **Test with water:**\n   - Pour water slowly onto the soil (simulating rain) for 20-30 seconds. Use the spray bottle or pitcher.\n   - Watch what happens. Does the soil wash away? Does your material protect it?\n   - Count or estimate how much soil washed away.\n\n4. **Record results:**\n   - Draw or write what happened.\n   - Discuss with your group: \"Did it work? Why or why not? Would a farmer use this on a real farm?\"\n\n5. **Make a claim:**\n   - Complete the sentence: \"The best way to protect soil from rain is _____ because _____.\"\n   - Use evidence from your test to support your claim.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Set up stations or distribute materials so each group has space to test.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice happening to the soil? How is your material protecting it? Would this work if the rain was much harder?\"\n- Help students think about real-world constraints: \"Would a farmer be able to afford this? Would it work on a whole field?\"\n- Encourage students to revise their ideas: \"Some scientists changed their minds after testing. That's okay! What would you try next?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students test at least one design solution and collect evidence.\n- Students make observations about what works and what doesn't.\n- Students form a claim about soil protection supported by their test results.\n- Students consider real-world applications and limitations.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students understand soil properties, seasonal connections, and erosion-reduction strategies.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing During Lesson):**\n\n- **During Explore:** Observe whether students accurately describe soil texture, color, and composition. Listen for use of descriptive language.\n- **During Explain:** Monitor responses to check-for-understanding questions. Note students who confuse soil with dirt or don't understand weathering.\n- **During Elaborate:** Assess whether students can make a reasonable claim and support it with evidence from their test.\n\n**Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes):**\n\nDistribute a simple form (or ask students to draw/write on paper):\n\n```\nTODAY I LEARNED ABOUT SOIL\n\n1. Draw and label two things you found in soil:\n   [space for drawing]\n\n2. Why do farmers care about soil? \n   _______________________________________________\n\n3. What would happen to a farm if heavy rain \n   washed all the soil away?\n   _______________________________________________\n\n4. One thing I still wonder about: \n   _______________________________________________\n```\n\n**Summative Assessment — Student-Generated Claim:**\n\nEvaluate students' soil protection claims using this rubric:\n\n| Criteria | Developing | Proficient | Advanced |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| **Makes a Claim** | Claim is unclear or not stated | Claim is clear and answers the question | Claim is clear, specific, and includes reasoning |\n| **Uses Evidence** | Little or no evidence from test | References results from the test | Uses specific observations and explains why evidence supports the claim |\n| **Understands Erosion** | Shows limited understanding of erosion or its causes | Understands that rain washes soil away | Understands multiple causes of erosion (rain, wind) and why it's a problem |\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n\n✓ **Objective 1 (Identify soil properties):** Student correctly identifies at least two components of soil and describes texture.\n\n✓ **Objective 2 (Explain seasonal connection):** Student explains that farmers prepare soil at certain times of year because of weather/season changes.\n\n✓ **Objective 3 (Describe farm work):** Student can explain what the machine in the photograph does (loosens, mixes, or prepares soil).\n\n✓ **Objective 4 (Make a claim about erosion protection):** Student makes a claim about protecting soil from rain or wind and supports it with at least one piece of evidence.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Most students will demonstrate understanding of soil as a mixture and explain why farmers care about its health.\n- Most students will connect seasonal changes to farm work.\n- Most students will be able to describe a simple solution to reduce erosion and explain why it works.\n- Students who struggle may need re-teaching of vocabulary or additional soil-handling experiences.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support for Struggling Learners\n\n1. **Soil \"Recipe\" Anchor Chart:** Create a visual chart showing soil ingredients with pictures (rocks, water, air, plants). Reference this during Explain and Elaborate. Pair students with stronger partners during group activities.\n\n2. **Guided Vocabulary Cards:** Provide picture-word cards for soil, texture, season, and erosion. Students can match cards and use them as reference during activities. Reduce the number of vocabulary terms to focus on the most essential (soil, texture, season).\n\n3. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Offer a multiple-choice or \"circle the answer\" version for students who struggle with writing. Example: \"Soil is made of: rocks / water / air / all of these\" or use a drawing-only exit ticket.\n\n### Challenge for Advanced Learners\n\n1. **Multi-Variable Testing:** Ask advanced students to test multiple materials at the same time to compare which is *most* effective. Have them create a data table to rank materials by soil protection.\n   - Example: \"Test straw, gravel, AND leaves on three separate pans. Which protected the soil best? Why do you think so?\"\n\n2. **Real-World Research:** Provide access to age-appropriate articles or books about farming practices (e.g., cover crops, mulching, terracing) that protect soil. Students can present or write about one method farmers use in real life.\n\n3. **Design Improvement:** Ask: \"Your first design worked okay, but it washed away some soil. How would you improve it? What if the rain was even heavier? Could you make your design work for a huge farm?\" Students can refine their design and test it again.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seasonal Farm Calendar Illustrated Timeline:**\n   - Have students create a 4-panel poster showing what a farm looks like in each season (spring: plowing and preparing soil; summer: growing crops; fall: harvest; winter: resting).\n   - They can draw or cut/paste images and label each season with typical weather and farm activities.\n   - This reinforces 3-ESS2-1 (describing weather in different seasons).\n\n2. **Earthworm Habitat Investigation:**\n   - Extend learning by creating a simple soil habitat with earthworms (in a clear container with layers of soil, sand, and leaves).\n   - Students observe how earthworms help soil by moving through it and breaking down organic matter.\n   - This deepens understanding of soil as a living system and why soil health matters.\n\n3. **Compost Demonstration:**\n   - Start a small compost bin in or outside the classroom with food scraps, leaves, and soil.\n   - Over weeks/months, students observe decomposition and see how organic material breaks down into soil-like material.\n   - This connects to weathering and the role of dead plants in soil formation.\n   - Send home a \"Composting at Home\" family activity sheet for students to try with their families.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure all soil is collected from a safe location and students wash hands thoroughly after activities.\n- **Material Prep:** Collect soil the day before the lesson. If outdoor soil is unavailable, potting soil works well.\n- **Photography Moment:** Take photos of student exploration and design tests to document learning and create a class soil poster.\n- **Connection to Agriculture:** If possible, invite a local farmer to visit or show a short video of spring plowing. This brings the photograph to life!\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Use vocabulary words consistently throughout the lesson and post the vocabulary chart for visual reference in days following.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson builds strong foundational understanding of soil as a natural resource, connects observable farm practices to Earth systems, and empowers Third Graders to think about solutions to real environmental challenges.**",
