    "grade4": "## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThe photo shows a closeup view of dry, cracked soil or mud. The ground appears to have broken into numerous irregular polygon-shaped pieces, with deep cracks running between them. The soil is a tan or beige color and has a rough, cracked texture. You can see some small weeds or grass blades attempting to grow in the cracks, showing how life finds a way even in harsh, dry conditions.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates the process of soil desiccation, which happens when wet soil dries out completely. When clay-rich soil gets saturated with water, the clay particles expand and the soil swells. As the water evaporates during a drought or dry spell, the soil contracts and shrinks. Different areas of the soil shrink at different rates, causing tension to build up until the soil literally cracks apart. These cracks form the polygon shapes you see because that's the most efficient way for the stress to be released in the soil. This cracking pattern is a natural phenomenon that occurs in clay-based soils that experience cycles of wetting and drying.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Evaporation**: The process where liquid water turns into water vapor and rises into the air.\n2. **Soil Composition**: Different types of soil, like clay, sand, and silt, have varying properties that affect how they behave when wet and dry.\n3. **Water Cycle**: The continuous movement of water through Earth's systems, including evaporation, precipitation, and runoff.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nTo help students understand soil desiccation, try a hands-on \"Cracking Clay\" experiment.

    "grade5": "## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis photo shows a section of dry, cracked soil or mud. The ground is covered in a patchwork of irregular, angular shapes with deep cracks running between them. The soil has a tan or beige color and appears very dry and hard. A few small weeds or grass blades are trying to grow up through some of the cracks, adding a touch of green to the otherwise barren landscape.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe cracks you see in the soil are caused by a process called desiccation. When clay-rich soil gets saturated with water, the tiny spaces between soil particles expand as the water fills them. But as that water evaporates during dry weather, the soil contracts and shrinks back down. Since different areas of the soil shrink at different rates, tension builds up until the soil literally pulls apart, creating these characteristic cracks. The cracks form the random polygon shapes you see because that's the most efficient way for the stress to be released in the soil.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Water Cycle**: Water continuously moves through Earth's systems, evaporating, condensing, and precipitating.\n\n2. **Soil Properties**: Different soil types like clay, sand, and silt behave differently when they get wet and dry.\n\n3. **Drought**: A prolonged period of low rainfall that causes soil and plants to dry out.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nTo help students visualize and understand the desiccation process, have them create a simple \"Cracking Clay\" model.
