The wooden frame is made from trees that have been cut down and processed into lumber. You can see how wood is used as a building material to create strong structures that protect people from the weather.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why do we use wood to build things, and where does wood come from?\n\nWood is a **renewable resource** because trees can be replanted and grown again after they are harvested. When a tree is cut down, new trees can be planted in its place. Over time (usually 20-60 years depending on the tree type), those new trees grow large enough to be harvested for wood again. This is different from non-renewable resources like oil or coal, which take millions of years to form and cannot be replaced within a human lifetime. Forests that are managed responsibly can provide wood indefinitely, making it a sustainable material for building.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Renewable vs. Non-Renewable Resources:** A renewable resource is something from nature that can be replaced or regrown. Wood is renewable because new trees grow to replace harvested ones. Non-renewable resources, like coal and oil, cannot be replaced once they're used up.\n\n* **Tree Growth and the Water Cycle:** Trees grow by absorbing water from the soil through their roots and sunlight through their leaves. This water and energy help the tree create wood (the solid part of the tree trunk and branches). Understanding how trees grow helps us appreciate why we must plant new trees to maintain renewable forests.\n\n* **Material Properties:** Wood has special properties that make it useful for building—it is strong, can be shaped into different sizes, and provides insulation (helps keep heat in or out). These properties come from how trees are structured inside.\n\n* **Human Impact on Resources:** When we harvest trees for wood, we must replant new trees to keep the forest healthy and ensure we have wood for the future. This teaches students about stewardship and responsible resource management.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use a real piece of wood (a block, pencil, or small board) in your classroom for students to observe, touch, and feel. Ask them to describe what they notice—color, texture, weight, strength. This concrete experience helps Third Graders connect the abstract concept of \"renewable resources\" to something tangible in their environment.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>**Multiple Means of Representation:** Show photographs of different stages of wood use—trees in forests, logging, lumber yards, and finished buildings. This visual progression helps students understand the sequence and stay engaged.\n\n**Multiple Means of Engagement:** Allow students to sort pictures of renewable resources (trees, water, wind) vs. non-renewable resources (coal, oil, natural gas). This hands-on sorting activity makes the concept concrete and allows for movement.\n\n**Multiple Means of Expression:** Students can draw, write, or dictate answers about where wood comes from and how it's used. Offer choice in how they demonstrate understanding.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n**Zoom In (Cellular/Microscopic Level):**\nIf you looked at wood under a microscope, you would see tiny tubes and cells that once carried water and nutrients through the living tree. These cells give wood its strength and structure. The rings you see in a tree stump show how the tree grew—one ring is added each year as the tree gets bigger. These microscopic structures are what make wood strong enough to build with.\n\n**Zoom Out (Ecosystem and Global System Level):**\nForests are ecosystems where many plants and animals depend on trees for survival. When we harvest wood responsibly by replanting trees, we protect these ecosystems and ensure forests can continue to provide wood, clean air, animal habitats, and water for communities around the world. Sustainable forestry connects to climate change because growing trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air, helping reduce pollution. The global demand for wood affects forests on many continents.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n* **Misconception:** \"Once we cut down all the trees, we can't get wood anymore.\"\n  - **Clarification:** Trees grow back! When loggers cut trees, people plant new trees in their place. A forest with responsible tree-planting practices will have trees available for harvesting again in the future. This is why wood is called a renewable resource.\n\n* **Misconception:** \"Wood just comes from the store; it's not a natural resource.\"\n  - **Clarification:** Wood is made from trees, which are living plants that grow in nature. We harvest (cut down) trees, process them into lumber at mills, and then use that lumber to make things we buy. But it all starts with a real tree growing in a forest.\n\n* **Misconception:** \"All resources from trees are bad for the environment.\"\n  - **Clarification:** Harvesting wood can be done in ways that protect forests and ecosystems. When companies replant trees, protect animal habitats, and don't cut down too many trees, they can harvest wood in an environmentally responsible way. This is called sustainable forestry.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n3-ESS3-1.
