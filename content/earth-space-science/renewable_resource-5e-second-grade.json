Identify natural materials (wood, plant fibers, stone) that come from Earth and can be used to build structures.\n2. Describe how wood and other natural materials protect buildings from weather like wind and rain.\n3. Explain that wood comes from trees, a renewable resource, and how it is useful for human buildings and shelter.\n4. Design and build a simple structure using natural materials to demonstrate understanding of how materials protect us.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest in how humans use natural materials from Earth to build structures that protect them from weather.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large photograph (projected or printed poster-size)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small branches, leaves, pieces of bark from outside\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Point out the wooden beams, walls, window frame, and the roof structure. Do not provide explanations yet.\n\n2. **Ask these guiding questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What materials do you see in this building? Where do you think they came from?\"\n   - \"Why would someone use wood and thick walls to build this space? What might the wood protect the inside from?\"\n   - \"Have you ever been inside a house or building? What materials did you notice?\"\n   - \"Do you think all the materials in this picture came from Earth? Which ones?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder... what happens to wood when rain, wind, or snow pushes on it? Does it keep the inside safe and dry?\"\n\n4. **Activate Prior Knowledge:** Ask students to turn to a partner and share: \"What is your home or classroom made of? Why do you think people chose those materials?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore how Earth gives us special materials to build with, and discover why wood and other natural stuff work so well at protecting us!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the properties of natural building materials and observe how they work together to create protective structures.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small pieces of wood (craft sticks, wood blocks, or branches)\n- Insulation material samples (wool, straw, or cotton batting—safe classroom samples)\n- Pieces of bark, leaves, and twigs collected from outdoors\n- Small plastic cups or containers filled with water\n- Paper towels\n- Magnifying glasses (optional)\n- Chart for recording observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set Up Stations:** Create 3-4 exploration stations around the classroom, each with different natural materials.\n\n2. **Station 1 – Wood Exploration:**\n   - Provide wood pieces and magnifying glasses.\n   - Student directions: \"Look closely at the wood. Feel it. Is it hard or soft? What do you notice about its texture? Why might hard wood be good for building?\"\n   - Record: Students draw what they see and write or dictate one thing wood is good for.\n\n3. **Station 2 – Insulation Materials:**\n   - Provide safe insulation samples (wool, batting, straw).\n   - Student directions: \"Touch this material. Is it thick or thin? Does it feel warm? This material goes inside walls to keep buildings warm. Why do you think it works?\"\n   - Record: Students touch the material and describe it with words like \"fluffy,\" \"thick,\" \"warm,\" or \"soft.\"\n\n4. **Station 3 – Water Protection Test:**\n   - Provide two small containers: one lined with plastic (waterproof) and one with paper (not waterproof). Place water in each.\n   - Student directions: \"Which container keeps the water inside better? Which one leaks? Buildings need materials that stop water, just like the plastic container. Why?\"\n   - Record: Students observe and draw which container works better.\n\n5. **Station 4 – Natural Materials Collection (if outdoors access available):**\n   - Provide a basket with bark, twigs, leaves, and stones.\n   - Student directions: \"These all came from nature. Which ones are hard? Which are soft? Which ones could help build or protect a structure?\"\n   - Record: Students sort materials into \"hard and strong\" or \"soft and flexible\" piles.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate through stations, listening to student observations without correcting.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"What else did you notice? How could this material help a building?\"\n- Encourage students to handle materials safely and record their thinking through drawings or words.\n- Use think-aloud: \"I notice this wood is very hard. That would be good for holding up a roof, wouldn't it?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that wood is hard and strong, useful for structure.\n- Students discover that insulation materials are thick and fluffy, useful for protection.\n- Students recognize that some materials stop water and some don't.\n- Students collect observations in drawings, words, or sorting activities.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts about renewable resources and building materials using the photograph and student discoveries.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n- Picture books about building (e.g., \"How a House is Built\" or similar)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out:**\n   - Invite 3-4 students to share one thing they discovered at their station.\n   - Ask: \"How does this discovery help explain what we see in the big building picture?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** with visual supports:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Renewable Resource:** Materials from Earth that can grow back or be replaced. Wood comes from trees, and more trees can grow. (Point to trees outside or in pictures.)\n   - **Natural Material:** Something that comes from nature and Earth, like wood, stone, plants, or water. (Point to examples in the photograph.)\n   - **Weather Protection:** How buildings use strong materials to keep wind, rain, and snow from getting inside. (Point to the walls and roof in the photo.)\n   - **Structure:** The strong frame or skeleton of a building that holds it up and keeps it safe. (Point to the wooden beams in the photograph.)\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph:**\n   - Point to different parts: \"The wooden beams are the structure—they hold everything up. See how strong they look? The walls protect the inside from weather, just like your jacket protects you from rain. The window lets light in but keeps wind out.\"\n\n4. **Read Aloud or Show Pictures:**\n   - Share a simple 3-5 minute book about how buildings are made, emphasizing that wood comes from trees and trees are renewable.\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Where does wood come from?\" (Trees)\n   - Ask: \"Why do we use wood to build?\" (It's strong, it comes from nature, it protects us)\n   - Ask: \"Can we get more wood?\" (Yes, trees grow back, so wood is renewable)\n   - Ask one student to point to something in the photograph that is a natural material.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary correctly: \"This is wood, a natural material.\"\n- Students understand that wood comes from trees and is renewable.\n- Students recognize that buildings use natural materials to protect people from weather.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts by designing and building a simple structure using natural materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Craft sticks, popsicle sticks, or small branches\n- String or yarn\n- Safe tape (painter's tape or masking tape)\n- Leaves, bark, grass, or shredded paper (to represent insulation and roofing)\n- Small plastic cups or boxes (optional, for bases)\n- Paper and crayons for planning drawings\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Design Challenge Introduction:**\n   - \"You are builders! Your job is to create a small shelter using natural materials, just like the big building in our photograph. Your shelter needs to have strong walls, protection from the top, and something that keeps it warm inside.\"\n\n2. **Planning Phase (5 minutes):**\n   - Students draw a simple plan: \"What will your structure look like? What materials will you use for the walls? What will protect the roof?\"\n   - Teacher prompts: \"Will you use wood for strength? Will you use leaves or stuffing for warmth?\"\n\n3. **Building Phase (10-12 minutes):**\n   - Students work individually or in small pairs.\n   - Provide a simple frame option: Stand craft sticks upright and tape them, or provide small boxes to decorate and fortify.\n   - Students add \"walls\" (more sticks, bark), \"insulation\" (leaves, stuffing), and \"roof\" (sticks lashed together or tape and leaves).\n   - Teacher circulates: \"Tell me why you chose wood for that part. How does the insulation help your structure?\"\n\n4. **Optional Test:**\n   - Gently \"test\" structures with a fan set on low to simulate wind, or spray lightly with water bottle to test weatherproofing.\n   - Ask: \"Did your structure protect the inside? What worked? What would you change?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide structure templates for students who need support (e.g., pre-made stick frames).\n- Ask questions rather than fix problems: \"What happens if we add more insulation here?\"\n- Celebrate different designs: \"I see you used bark for the roof. How does that protect the inside?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a structure using natural materials.\n- Students explain their design choices: \"I used sticks because they're strong, and leaves because they keep it warm.\"\n- Students demonstrate understanding that materials have different properties useful for different jobs.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of renewable resources, natural materials, and weather protection.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observation of student responses during Engage discussion questions.\n- Review of student drawings and recordings at Explore stations.\n- Listen to student explanations during Elaborate building phase.\n- Check for correct use of vocabulary during Explain phase.\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (End of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple paper or digital form with these prompts:\n\n1. **Draw and Label:** \"Draw a natural material used in buildings. Label it and write one word that describes it.\" (Success: Student identifies a real building material—wood, stone, glass—and writes a property like \"strong,\" \"hard,\" or \"protects.\")\n\n2. **Complete the Sentence:** \"Wood is a renewable resource because ___________________.\" (Success: Student writes or dictates something like \"trees grow back\" or \"we can get more wood from new trees.\")\n\n3. **Answer Aloud (Teacher asks):** \"Why did we use natural materials like wood in our building activity?\" (Success: Student explains that these materials are strong, protective, or come from Earth.)\n\n**Alternative Summative Assessment:**\n- **Show Me:** Display three pictures: (1) a wooden building, (2) a stone wall, (3) an insulation sample. Ask students to point to or name each and explain why it's useful for building.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student identifies at least 2 natural building materials.\n- Student explains that wood/materials protect buildings from weather.\n- Student understands wood comes from trees and is renewable.\n- Student uses at least one vocabulary word correctly (renewable resource, natural material, weather protection, or structure).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will demonstrate understanding that natural materials come from Earth and are used to build and protect structures.\n- Students will be able to name wood, stone, or plant materials used in buildings.\n- Students will recognize that renewable resources like wood can be used again.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only two key words instead of four. Focus on \"wood\" and \"protection.\" Provide picture cards to support definitions, and allow students to point rather than speak when expressing understanding.\n\n2. **Guided Station Work:** Assign a teacher aide or partner to work with the student at Explore stations. Ask simpler questions: \"Is this hard or soft?\" \"Does water go through it?\" Provide sentence frames: \"This wood is _____. It is good for _____.\"\n\n3. **Pre-Made Structure:** For the Elaborate phase, provide a pre-assembled stick frame so the student focuses on adding walls and \"insulation\" rather than starting from scratch. Offer only 2-3 material choices instead of many.\n\n4. **Visual Exit Ticket:** Allow the student to sort pictures of building materials into categories (hard/soft, protects from weather/doesn't) instead of writing. Accept drawings with labels in place of sentences.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Design Challenge:** Ask: \"Your structure must protect the inside from both wind AND water. How will you do that? What's the problem with just using leaves? How can you improve it?\" Students redesign and test with a fan and spray bottle.\n\n2. **Research Connection:** Have students investigate: \"Where does the wood in our building come from? Is it from a local forest? Where are trees grown?\" Provide access to simple picture books or websites about lumber or forestry. Have them create a poster showing the journey from tree to building material.\n\n3. **Renewable vs. Non-Renewable Comparison:** Introduce the concept that some materials, like plastic or metal, cannot be replaced quickly. Ask: \"How is wood different from plastic? Why is using wood better for Earth?\" Have students sort pictures of materials into renewable and non-renewable.\n\n4. **Advanced Vocabulary Integration:** Introduce \"insulation\" formally and ask students to explain why it matters: \"Heat escapes through thin walls. Thick, fluffy insulation traps warm air inside. Can you design a wall that is thicker and warmer than your first version?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Field Walk and Outdoor Collection:**\n   - Take students on a walk around the school grounds to identify natural materials: tree bark, twigs, leaves, stones, and grass.\n   - Collect safe samples and bring them back to the classroom.\n   - Create a \"Building Materials from Nature\" display board where students sort and label items by type and property.\n   - Challenge: \"Can you find something hard, something soft, and something waterproof?\"\n\n2. **Neighborhood Building Scavenger Hunt (Homework or Class Field Trip):**\n   - Send home a simple checklist: \"Find buildings in your neighborhood. Mark what you see made of wood. Mark what you see made of stone or brick. Draw one building you see.\"\n   - Alternatively, take a walking tour of the school or nearby buildings and have students photograph or sketch the materials they observe.\n   - Discuss findings: \"Most buildings are made of natural materials. Why? Because they work!\"\n\n3. **Building Materials Over Time (Historical Connection):**\n   - Show pictures of very old buildings (log cabins, stone houses, mud houses from different cultures) and modern buildings.\n   - Ask: \"Why did people long ago use wood and stone? Do we still use these materials today?\"\n   - Have students sort pictures into categories: \"Built long ago\" and \"Built today,\" and observe that natural materials are still important.\n   - Create a simple timeline showing how building materials have been used throughout history.\n\n4. **Sink or Float: Waterproofing Experiment (Science Extension):**\n   - Place different materials (untreated wood, sealed wood, bark, plastic, stone, fabric) in water.\n   - Observe and record which ones absorb water and which ones resist it.\n   - Discuss: \"How does waterproofing help protect a building? Why do we need walls and roofs?\"\n\n5. **3D Model Community Building Project:**\n   - As a class or small group, design and build a small community of structures (house, barn, bridge) using natural materials.\n   - Display it and label the materials used and the renewable resources they come from.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
