The fossil has a fan or shell-like shape with beautiful radiating lines spreading out from the center point, like rays of sunlight. The fossil is embedded in a brown-tan limestone rock. You can see other fossilized shells around it. The detail in this fossil is incredible - you can count the individual ridges and see the delicate pattern that was created millions of years ago!\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates fossil preservation in sedimentary rock. This is a coral fossil - corals are marine animals that lived in ancient warm, shallow seas. When the coral died, it was buried by sediments (sand, mud, other shell fragments) on the ocean floor. Over millions of years, these sediments compressed into limestone rock. Minerals from groundwater gradually replaced the original coral structure, creating a fossil that preserves the exact shape and details. The radiating pattern you see is the coral's skeleton structure. Finding coral fossils tells scientists that this area was once covered by a warm, shallow ocean - even if it's now high and dry on land!\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Limestone**: A sedimentary rock formed from layers of shells, coral, and marine sediments compressed over millions of years.\n\n2. **Coral**: Marine animals that create hard calcium carbonate skeletons, which are easily fossilized.\n\n3. **Ancient Environments**: Fossils provide evidence of what Earth's environment was like in the past.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate a \"Read the Rock\" investigation!
