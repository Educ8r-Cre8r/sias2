This demonstrates how temperature changes throughout the year affect Earth's surface and water bodies.\n\n- **Water in different forms:** The image displays water in multiple states—solid ice on the pond surface and liquid water visible where ice has melted—helping students understand that water exists in different forms depending on temperature.\n\n- **Local environment and habitats:** The scene shows a specific place where plants (trees, grasses, reeds), animals (water habitat), and humans (fence line, evidence of use) interact. This is a real local environment students can observe and understand.\n\n- **Weather patterns and time:** The transitional season visible in the photo demonstrates how weather and conditions change over time, connecting to observable patterns students can track in their own community.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**When Ice Melts: Spring Comes to the Pond**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 30-minute sessions (or three 20-minute sessions for younger kindergarteners)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - K-ESS2-1: Use and share observations of local weather conditions to describe patterns over time\n  - K-ESS3-1: Use a model to represent the relationship between the needs of different plants and animals (including humans) and the places they live\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Observe and describe what happens to ice and snow when temperature changes (using the photograph as reference)\n- Identify at least two living things and one non-living thing in a natural environment near water\n- Explain in simple words how plants, animals, and water need different conditions to survive\n- Predict what will happen to the pond as the season changes from winter to spring\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about seasonal change and the transformation of water by examining the photograph together.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of thawing pond (large enough for whole group to see)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: ice cubes in a clear container at room temperature (for reference)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Ask students to sit where everyone can see it clearly.\n\n2. **Introduce with wonder:** Say: \"Look at this special place! This is a pond near some trees. What do you notice? What looks different or interesting?\"\n\n3. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"Do you see water? What does the water look like in different places?\" (Guide them to notice ice in some spots and open water in others.)\n   - \"Why do you think some of the water is frozen like ice and some water looks like liquid?\" \n   - \"What time of year do you think this is? How do you know?\" (Accept all answers; guide toward spring/early thaw.)\n   - \"What might be living in or near this pond?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** Say: \"If we waited one more week, what do you think would happen to all this ice? Draw or tell me what you think will happen.\"\n\n5. **Record student predictions** on chart paper. Keep these visible for later reference.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's explore what happens when ice gets warm—just like what's happening at this pond!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how temperature changes affect ice and water through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Ice cubes (prepare ahead; freeze water the night before)\n- Clear cups (one per student or pair)\n- Warm water in a pitcher\n- Cold water in a pitcher\n- Room-temperature water in a pitcher\n- Observation sheets (simple template with boxes to draw in)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Paper towels\n- Optional: thermometers (if students have seen them before)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up stations or whole-group demonstration:** Give each student (or pair) a clear cup with one ice cube. Have three containers of water: warm, cold, and room-temperature, labeled with picture/word cards.\n\n2. **Student exploration (guided by teacher):**\n   - Start with ice cubes in clear cups at room temperature. Ask: \"What do you see? Is the ice changing?\"\n   - Have students observe for 2-3 minutes and draw what they see on their observation sheet (Box 1: \"Ice at the beginning\").\n   - Ask: \"Do you think warm water will make the ice melt faster than cold water?\"\n   - Carefully pour a small amount of cold water into one cup and warm water into another (teacher does this to ensure safety).\n   - Have students observe for another 3-5 minutes and draw what happens (Box 2: \"What happened?\").\n   - Discuss: \"Which water melted the ice faster? Why do you think that happened?\"\n\n3. **Student recording:** Students draw or use simple words to show:\n   - What the ice looked like at the start\n   - What happened after warm/cold water was added\n   - Which melted faster\n\n4. **Connection to photograph:** Ask: \"The sun is getting warmer in spring, just like our warm water. What do you think is happening to the ice on the pond in that picture?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice? What's changing? What do you think will happen next?\"\n- Ensure safe handling of materials\n- Prompt observations without giving answers: \"Tell me what you see happening to the ice.\"\n- Record student language and observations for the Explain phase\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that warm water melts ice faster than cold water\n- Students make predictions about cause and effect\n- Students create simple visual records of their observations\n- Students begin to connect their experiment to seasonal change\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and solidify understanding of ice, water, and seasonal change using student observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple pictures\n- Observation sheets from Explore phase\n- The pond photograph (displayed again)\n- A model habitat (see activity description)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share out from Explore:** Ask 3-4 student pairs to share what they observed:\n   - \"What happened to the ice?\"\n   - \"Which water melted it faster?\"\n   - Affirm all observations and celebrate curiosity\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with visuals:**\n   \n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Ice** | Frozen water that is hard and cold |\n   | **Melt** | When ice turns into liquid water because it gets warmer |\n   | **Temperature** | How hot or cold something is |\n   | **Spring** | The season when it gets warmer and ice melts |\n   | **Habitat** | A place where plants and animals live and find what they need |\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to different parts of the pond image\n   - \"This ice is melting because spring is coming and the sun is getting warmer—just like our warm water melted the ice!\"\n   - \"When the ice melts, the animals living in this pond can move around more.\"\n\n4. **Introduce simple habitat model:** \n   - Show a simple terrarium or diorama with water, soil, plants, and pictures of animals\n   - Say: \"This pond is a habitat. Plants, animals, and water all live together here. The animals need water to drink and live in. The plants need water and sun. When spring comes and ice melts, everyone in the habitat can get what they need!\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show the photograph again. Ask: \"Why is the ice melting?\"\n   - \"What animals might need this water when it's liquid again?\"\n   - \"What time of year is this?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Ice:** Frozen water that is hard and very cold\n- **Melt:** When something that is frozen turns into liquid because it gets warmer\n- **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is (warmer or colder)\n- **Spring:** The season when it gets warmer, snow and ice melt, and new plants start to grow\n- **Habitat:** A place outdoors where plants and animals live and find things they need to survive\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word \"melt\" and \"ice\" accurately in context\n- Students can point to the pond in the photograph and explain that ice melts when it gets warmer\n- Students understand that a habitat includes water, plants, and animals living together\n- Students see the connection between their warm water experiment and spring weather\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of seasonal change and habitats by creating their own spring habitat model.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small containers or trays (one per small group)\n- Soil or sand\n- Water in spray bottles or small cups\n- Twigs, pebbles, moss\n- Picture cards of plants and animals (deer, ducks, fish, frogs, trees, grass)\n- Small toy animals (optional)\n- Paper, crayons, markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Explain the task:** \"We're going to build a spring pond habitat! Your pond will have water, plants, and animals that need each other.\"\n\n2. **Group creation (small groups of 3-4):**\n   - Each group gets a container\n   - They add soil/sand to one side (land) and add water to the other side (pond)\n   - They place twigs, pebbles, and moss to make it look like a spring landscape\n   - They place picture cards or toy animals around and in the water\n   - They can draw and add pictures of the sun, clouds, and trees\n\n3. **Discussion during creation:**\n   - \"What does this animal need from the pond?\"\n   - \"How does the water help the plants grow?\"\n   - \"What would happen if the ice didn't melt?\"\n   - \"Why is spring a good time for animals?\"\n\n4. **Gallery walk:** Groups show their habitats to the class. Each group explains one thing living in their pond and what it needs.\n\n5. **Real-world connection:** \"When the ice melts at the real pond in our town, all these animals and plants can grow and live. Spring is when nature comes back to life!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group work by asking guiding questions\n- Help students think about cause and effect: \"If there was no water, what would happen?\"\n- Encourage students to connect back to the photograph and their ice-melting experiment\n- Take photos of student habitats for documentation\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a three-dimensional model showing a spring habitat\n- Students can explain at least one relationship between water, plants, and animals\n- Students articulate that spring and warmth enable ice to melt and habitats to thrive\n- Students demonstrate understanding that habitats meet the needs of living things\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of ice, melting, seasonal change, and habitats using multiple informal methods.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n- Observe student discussions and questions during Engage phase\n- Listen to student explanations during Explore (what language do they use about ice?)\n- Monitor student responses to teacher questions in Explain phase\n- Observe student reasoning during Elaborate (do they explain cause and effect?)\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (choose one or combine):**\n\n**Option 1 - Visual with words:**\nShow the pond photograph again. Ask students to:\n- Point to the ice\n- Point to the liquid water\n- Draw what they think will happen to the ice next week\n- Tell you: \"Why is the ice melting?\"\n\n**Option 2 - Simple sentence stems (students draw or say):**\n- \"The ice melted because _______\"\n- \"In spring, the pond habitat has _______ (water/animals/plants) that need each other\"\n- \"If the ice didn't melt, the animals couldn't _______\"\n\n**Option 3 - Observation of habitat models:**\nAsk each student (or pair):\n- \"Show me one animal in your habitat and tell me what it needs\"\n- \"What does the water do for the plants?\"\n- \"Why did you put this here?\" (pointing to water or sun)\n\n**Success Criteria—Students will demonstrate understanding if they can:**\n- Explain that ice melts when it gets warm (using simple language)\n- Identify water, plants, and animals in a habitat\n- Make a simple connection between spring, melting ice, and animals/plants needing water\n- Use the word \"melt\" accurately in context when discussing the pond or their experiment\n- Describe at least one way that spring helps a plant or animal in a habitat\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most kindergarteners will successfully observe and communicate about melting ice\n- Students will make simple predictions about seasonal change\n- Students will understand that habitats are places where living things find what they need\n- Students may not fully grasp molecular science, but will understand the observable cause-and-effect of warmth → melting\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Scaffolding for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Focus on just three words (ice, melt, water) rather than five. Use picture cards consistently and repeat language often. During discussions, provide word banks or sentence starters: \"The ice is _____, \" \"Spring is _____.\"\n\n2. **Pair with stronger communicators:** During Explore and Elaborate, pair students who struggle with language or observation skills with more verbal classmates. Have them work together on one habitat or ice experiment and let the stronger student model observation language.\n\n3. **Simplify observation recording:** Instead of drawing detailed pictures, students can simply place stickers or stamps in boxes labeled \"Before\" and \"After.\" Provide sentence frames for verbal responses: \"The ice was _____. Then it became _____.\"\n\n4. **Use multisensory experiences:** Let students touch ice (briefly, supervised) to feel cold before warm water is added. Activate prior knowledge by asking, \"When is ice cold?\" (winter, freezer) and \"When does it get warm?\" (sunny day, summer).\n\n### Challenge (Extensions for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Introduce a simple timeline:** Have advanced students draw or sequence four pictures showing the pond from winter (frozen) → early spring (partly thawed) → late spring (no ice) → summer (warm water). Ask: \"Why does each picture look different? What's changing?\"\n\n2. **Expand habitat thinking:** Challenge students to build or describe a \"winter habitat\" and a \"spring habitat\" for the same location, noting differences. Ask: \"What does a duck need in winter vs. spring? Why?\" This begins to develop understanding of adaptation and seasonal needs.\n\n3. **Comparative investigation:** Provide containers of ice with different amounts of water (one with a little, one with a lot, one with none). Ask: \"If ice sits in different amounts of water, will it melt the same way? Let's test it!\" Record results on a simple graph (pictures or tally marks).\n\n4. **Environmental observation and documentation:** Send students out with a camera or clipboard to observe the actual school grounds or neighborhood. Ask them to find \"signs of spring\" (melting snow, new plants, animals active, etc.) and compare photos to the pond photograph. Create a class book: \"Spring Changes in Our Town.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Pond in a Bottle\" take-home project:** Send students home with a small clear bottle, water, soil, and pictures of pond animals/plants to glue on. Students create a mini habitat at home with family support. Have them bring it back and explain what they included and why. (Connects to K-ESS3-1 about environment and needs.)\n\n2. **Daily observation chart—tracking spring:** Create a simple chart where students observe and mark the school ground or a local park over several weeks (or show progression of photographs across a month). Each day/week, they note: \"Is there ice? Are animals visible? Are plants growing?\" This builds understanding of patterns over time (K-ESS2-1). Create a class graph or picture timeline.\n\n3. **Storytelling and dramatic play—\"Life in the Pond\":** Students act out what happens to animals and plants as the pond unfreezes. One student is a duck waiting under the ice, others are fish, plants, or the sun. As the \"sun\" (teacher or student) gets warmer, ice melts (represented by blue paper) and animals can move and play. Repeat throughout spring to show life returning. This reinforces habitat needs and seasonal change in an engaging, kinesthetic way.",
