Observe and describe how moss grows on rocks and explain that it needs water and shade to survive.\n2. Identify that rocks can change slowly over time as plants grow on them and break them down.\n3. Explain that moss is a living thing that needs specific conditions (moisture, shade) to live on a rock's surface.\n4. Compare how different rock surfaces (smooth vs. rough) affect where moss can grow and collect water.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of moss-covered rocks.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital image of the moss-covered rock (displayed on screen or printed in color)\n- Whiteboard/chart paper for recording questions\n- Optional: Small moss sample (if available) for students to touch briefly\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or print it in color. Place it where all students can see clearly.\n\n2. **Introduce with curiosity:** Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. Something interesting is growing on this rock. What do you notice? What questions do you have?\" Allow 1–2 minutes of silent observation, then invite students to share.\n\n3. **Ask these guiding questions** (one at a time, allowing response time):\n   - \"What do you see growing on the rock? What color is it?\"\n   - \"Do you think this green stuff is alive? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"Where do you think this grew? Does it get lots of sunshine or shade?\"\n   - \"What do you think this plant needs to grow and stay alive?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... if you left this rock outside in a rainy spot for a long time, would more of this green stuff grow? Let's find out!\"\n\n5. **Record** student observations and predictions on chart paper for reference throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to become moss scientists! We'll explore how moss grows and what it needs to live on rocks.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how moisture, light, and rock texture affect moss growth through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4–5 different types of rock samples (brick, smooth stone, rough granite, sandstone, pebble) — collect these beforehand or ask families to contribute\n- Water spray bottles (1 per small group)\n- Paper towels\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per pair)\n- Small containers or plastic trays to contain water\n- Chart/record sheet for each group (see below)\n- Real moss samples (1–2 small patches per group, if available; alternatively, use pictures)\n- Cloth or shade material (to simulate shade)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Work in groups of 3–4. Your teacher will give you different rock samples.\"\n\n2. \"First, use your hand lens to look very carefully at each rock's surface. Draw or describe what you see. Is it smooth? Rough? Bumpy?\" (Record on chart)\n\n3. \"Now, spray one side of each rock sample with water from the spray bottle 3–4 times. Watch carefully. Does the water stay on the rock or run off? Where does the water go?\" (Prediction: Water stays longer on rough rocks than smooth ones.)\n\n4. \"Let the rocks sit for 2–3 minutes. Which rocks still have water on them? Which ones dried up faster?\" (Record observations)\n\n5. \"Look at your real moss sample with the hand lens. Describe what it looks like. Is it soft or hard? Does it feel dry or damp?\" \n\n6. \"Based on what you observed, predict: Which rock type would moss prefer to grow on—the smooth one or the rough one? Why?\" (Record prediction)\n\n7. \"Imagine one rock is in a sunny spot and one is in a shady spot. Which do you think moss would choose? Why?\" (Record thinking)\n\n**Recording Sheet Example (simplified for Second Grade):**\n\n| Rock Type | Smooth or Rough? | Water Stays? | Moss Would Grow Here? | Why? |\n|-----------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|------|\n| Brick     | Rough            | Yes / No     | Yes / No              | [Drawing] |\n| Smooth stone | Smooth         | Yes / No     | Yes / No              | [Drawing] |\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups asking: \"What are you noticing?\" and \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Do NOT provide answers; instead, prompt: \"What will happen if we try...?\" or \"How could we test that?\"\n- Help students focus on texture, water absorption, and where moss is likely to attach.\n- Provide encouragement and ask follow-up questions like: \"Does this match what you predicted?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should discover that rough rocks hold water longer than smooth rocks.\n- Students should observe that moss thrives in moist, shaded conditions.\n- Students should record their observations with drawings and simple words.\n- Students should make predictions based on evidence from their exploration.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- The original photograph of moss-covered rock\n- Images or real moss samples (from Explore phase)\n- Index cards with vocabulary terms written large\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Ask 2–3 groups to share one observation from their investigation. Record key findings on chart paper (e.g., \"Rough rocks hold water better\" or \"Moss grows in shady, wet places\").\n\n2. **Connect to the photograph:** Point back to the original image and say: \"Look at this rock again. Now we understand why moss is growing here! It's on a shady spot where water can stay, and the rock is rough enough to hold moisture.\"\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** with Second Grade-friendly definitions:\n\n   **Moss** — A tiny, soft green plant that doesn't have roots like big plants. It grows on rocks, logs, and damp soil and needs water to stay alive.\n   \n   **Rock/Stone** — Hard, solid material that makes up the ground beneath us. Rocks can be smooth or rough and come in different colors.\n   \n   **Weathering** — When rocks slowly break down and change because of water, wind, rain, and tiny plants growing on them.\n   \n   **Weathered** — Changed by wind, water, or weather over a long time. A rock gets older-looking and more broken down.\n   \n   **Habitat** — A special place where a plant or animal lives. It has everything the living thing needs to survive.\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to your partner and whisper: Why does moss grow on this rock?\" (Listen for: \"It's wet,\" \"It's shady,\" \"The rock is rough.\")\n   - \"Show me with your hand lens: Can you point to a rough spot on the rock where moss might grow?\"\n   - Ask: \"If I took this rock and put it in bright sunlight, what do you think would happen to the moss?\"\n\n5. **Reinforce Earth and Space Science connection:** \"Scientists who study Earth notice that rocks don't stay the same forever. Tiny plants like moss, water, and weather slowly change rocks. This happens slowly, over a very long time!\"\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (post on classroom wall for reference):**\n- **Moss** = tiny green plant\n- **Rock** = hard Earth material\n- **Weathering** = rocks slowly breaking down\n- **Habitat** = home for living things\n- **Weathered** = changed by time and weather\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that moss is a living plant with specific needs.\n- Students can explain that rough, wet, shady rocks are good habitats for moss.\n- Students can use the term \"weathering\" to describe slow changes to rocks.\n- Students recognize that Earth features change over time.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by designing a solution to prevent moss weathering on a rock structure.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Brick samples or sandstone blocks (1 per group)\n- Water spray bottles\n- Materials for \"weathering barriers\": plastic wrap, wax paper, cloth, clay, sealant (water-based)\n- Markers and labels\n- Tape\n- Containers for water testing\n- Record sheet for predictions and observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-world connection:** \"Imagine you have an old brick path or wall in your yard. Moss and water are slowly breaking it down. How could you slow down this weathering? What could you cover the rock with to keep it dry?\"\n\n2. **Design challenge:** \"In your group, you'll test different materials. Your job: Find a material that STOPS or SLOWS water from staying on the rock. This will help prevent weathering!\"\n\n3. **Step-by-step:**\n   - Give each group an identical brick sample.\n   - Assign each group a different material to test (plastic wrap, cloth, wax paper, clay coating, or no covering as a control).\n   - Have students label their samples with a marker.\n   - Spray each sample with water 3 times.\n   - Observe: Which samples stay dry longest? Which still get wet?\n   - Record results with drawings.\n\n4. **Group discussion:** \"Which material worked best? Why? Would you use that to protect your rock path?\"\n\n5. **Connect to learning objectives:** \"We just learned that moss needs water to live. When we stop water from reaching the rock, we slow down weathering and moss growth. Real engineers and builders use these ideas to protect buildings and monuments!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask: \"What do you predict will happen when we spray the water?\"\n- Observe without solving problems—let students try materials that don't work and troubleshoot.\n- Guide reflection: \"Why did that material work better than this one?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can compare different solutions to prevent water weathering.\n- Students apply understanding of moss's water needs to a practical problem.\n- Students recognize that simple materials can slow Earth processes.\n- Students think like engineers and scientists.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of moss, rocks, weathering, and habitat.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Listen to student explanations during Explore phase: Do they connect rock texture to water absorption?\n- Observe during Explain: Can students point to evidence in the photograph?\n- Watch during Elaborate: Do students apply the concept of water and weathering to their design?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nGive each student a small exit ticket (index card or half-sheet) with these prompts. Students can draw, write, or dictate answers:\n\n1. **Look at this picture of a rock** (show the original photograph again). \n   - **Circle one:** This rock has moss because it is:\n     - **A) Hot and dry**\n     - **B) Cool, wet, and shady**\n   - **Why did you choose that answer?** (Draw or write.)\n\n2. **What is one thing moss needs to live on a rock?** (Accept: water, shade, moisture, wetness)\n\n3. **True or False: Rocks change very quickly.**\n   - **Why?** (Accept: Rocks change slowly, over a very long time, because of water and plants.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student selects \"cool, wet, and shady\" and explains with one reason (e.g., \"Moss needs water\")\n- ✓ Student identifies at least one need of moss (water/moisture/shade)\n- ✓ Student understands that rocks change slowly and can name one cause (water, weathering, moss, plants)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that moss requires specific habitat conditions.\n- Students can explain that weathering is a slow process.\n- Students connect observable features in the photograph to scientific concepts learned.\n- Teacher gains evidence that students met the learning objectives.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified recording sheets:** Use mostly pictures and checkboxes instead of writing. Provide sentence frames: \"Moss grows on rocks because _____.\" (Water / Shade / It's wet)\n\n2. **Hands-on vocabulary:** Display pictures with labels for moss, rock, water, and shade throughout the lesson. Point to images when introducing terms.\n\n3. **Partner investigations:** Pair struggling students with a peer or adult. Have them focus on observing water behavior (does it drip off or stay?) rather than writing descriptions.\n\n4. **Reduce exit ticket:** Offer only 2 questions instead of 3, or allow drawing only (no writing required).\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deep dive into weathering:** Ask: \"If moss helps break down rocks, what happens after a very, very long time? Could a big rock become sand?\" Guide them to think about soil formation and the rock cycle.\n\n2. **Extended design challenge:** \"Can you invent a material that lets moss grow but also protects the rock from weathering?\" or \"Design a rock habitat that's perfect for moss to live in.\"\n\n3. **Research and report:** Ask advanced students to investigate: \"Where else does moss grow? What other living things weather rocks?\" (e.g., lichens, roots, fungi). They can present findings to the class.\n\n4. **Predict and test:** Challenge them to predict outcomes: \"If we keep this rock wet every day for 2 weeks, what will happen? How could we know?\" (Set up a long-term observation and have them check in periodically.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Moss Garden in a Jar:** Students create a terrarium with moss, soil, and a small rock inside a clear jar. They keep it moist and in indirect light. Over weeks, they observe and sketch how moss grows and changes. This reinforces that moss is a living thing with habitat needs and connects to slow Earth changes.\n\n2. **Rock Hunt and Collection:** Take students on a brief outdoor walk to find rocks with and without moss. Students collect sketches or descriptions of where moss was found (shady spots, near water, etc.). Back in class, create a class chart: \"Where We Found Moss\" and discuss why those locations were good moss habitats.\n\n3. **Time-Lapse Storytelling:** Show a simple animation or picture sequence of how a bare rock slowly becomes covered with moss, then lichen, then small plants over years. Discuss: \"What's changing? Why does it happen so slowly?\" This reinforces that weathering and Earth changes happen over long periods.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wash hands after handling natural rock samples. Avoid rocks with sharp edges.\n- **Preparation:** Collect rock samples 1–2 weeks in advance. If fresh moss is unavailable, use high-quality photos or printed images.\n- **Timing:** This lesson spans two 45–50 minute sessions or can be condensed to a single 90-minute block with careful timing.\n- **Real-world connection:** If your school or nearby area has moss on outdoor structures (roof, pathway, wall), take a photo beforehand. Students love seeing familiar places connected to their learning.\n- **Vocabulary wall:** Keep the five key terms posted throughout the unit. Reference them daily.",
