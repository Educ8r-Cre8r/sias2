Identify examples of things that change slowly (like rust forming on metal) and things that change quickly (like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly) on Earth.\n2. Explain that water and air can cause metal and other materials to change over time.\n3. Describe how living things and objects depend on their surroundings to survive and change.\n4. Suggest ways to slow down or prevent rust and other changes caused by weather and water.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the chrysalis on rusty metal structure\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: actual examples of rusty items (rusty nail, old key, corroded metal object from playground equipment)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and introduce:** Project or hold up the large photograph. Allow students 30 seconds to quietly observe without talking. Ask them to notice *everything* they see.\n\n2. **Guided observation:** Point to different parts of the photograph and ask:\n   - \"What do you notice about the metal bar? What does it look like?\" (Guide them to notice the reddish-brown color, bumpy texture, and damage.)\n   - \"What is hanging from the metal? Have you ever seen something like this before?\"\n   - \"Why do you think this green object is attached to this rusty metal? Is it safe here?\"\n   - \"What could have made the metal look so old and damaged?\"\n\n3. **Prediction and wonder prompt:** \n   - \"This metal looks broken and damaged. What do you think made it change like this? Turn and talk to a partner about your ideas.\"\n   - Chart their responses on paper labeled \"What Changes Things?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Today we're going to discover what makes things change on Earth—some changes happen slowly, like what happened to this metal, and some changes happen very fast. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how water and air change materials over time.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 3-4 steel wool pads or steel nails (one per small group, 4-5 groups)\n- Shallow cups or containers (one per group)\n- Water (some groups get water, some don't)\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Magnifying glasses (4-5)\n- Paper towels\n- Observation sheets (simple picture-based recording sheets with lines for drawing \"before\" and \"after\")\n- Control group: dry nail/steel wool in a sealed bag\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up stations (Teacher does this before the lesson):**\n   - Station A: Steel wool in a dry cup (no water, control)\n   - Station B: Steel wool in a cup with a little water\n   - Station C: Steel wool sprayed with water and left uncovered\n   - Station D: Steel wool fully submerged in water\n\n2. **Student directions (demonstrate each step):**\n   - \"You will be scientists studying how water and air change metal. Go to your station.\"\n   - \"Look at your metal very carefully. Draw what it looks like RIGHT NOW on your 'Before' sheet.\"\n   - \"Use your magnifying glass. What color is it? Is it smooth or bumpy?\"\n   - \"Feel it gently. Is it smooth or rough?\"\n   - \"Write or draw what you observe using the word bank: shiny, dull, smooth, rough, red, brown, gray, silver.\"\n\n3. **Connection to photograph:**\n   - \"Look at the photograph again. The metal bar in the picture probably looked like your shiny metal a long time ago. Water and air in nature changed it, just like we're going to watch happen to our metal samples.\"\n\n4. **What students record:**\n   - Before observations (pictures + description)\n   - Group predictions: \"Which metal will change the most? Why?\"\n   - Note: *Teacher will check these \"before\" observations the next day to see changes.*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What do you see? What's different about the wet metal compared to the dry metal? What could cause this change?\"\n- Do NOT tell them it's called \"rust\" yet—let them describe it\n- Ensure safety: no eating or putting rusty materials in mouths\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and record initial appearance of metal\n- Students make predictions about which metal will change the most\n- Students begin to notice even small changes in the wet samples compared to the dry sample\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration; connect to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (again)\n- Chart paper labeled \"How Earth Changes Things\"\n- Pictures of weathering: rusty fence, wet rocks, eroded riverbank, peeling paint (optional: 2-3 simple images)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to show their observations: \"What did you notice about your metal?\"\n   - Record key words they use: wet, brown, rough, bumpy, different, changed\n   - Point out: \"Look—the metal that got WET changed more than the DRY metal! Water is doing something!\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary:**\n\n   | **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |----------|--------------------------------|\n   | **Rust** | A reddish-brown coating that forms on metal when water and air mix with it. It makes metal weak and breaks it down. |\n   | **Weathering** | When water, wind, and air slowly change the shape or color of rocks, metal, and other things on Earth. |\n   | **Change slowly** | Something that takes a long time to happen—like metal turning rusty over weeks or months. |\n   | **Change quickly** | Something that happens in a short time—like a butterfly coming out of its chrysalis in a few days. |\n   | **Environment** | Everything around a living thing—air, water, temperature, shelter, and other plants and animals. |\n\n3. **Connection back to photograph:**\n   - \"The metal bar in our picture has been outside for a very long time. Rain and water hit it, and the air blew on it. Just like our wet metal samples, the water and air slowly turned it reddish-brown. That's RUST!\"\n   - \"The chrysalis on the metal is using the structure as a safe place to grow. It's in its environment—where it can hang safely.\"\n   - \"The metal slowly changed (that's weathering), but the butterfly inside the chrysalis is changing quickly—in just days!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show thumbs up, sideways, or down: Do you understand that water can make metal change?\"\n   - \"Can you give me an example of something that changes slowly on Earth?\" (Pause for responses: trees growing, rocks breaking, buildings getting old)\n   - \"Can you give me an example of something that changes quickly?\" (Pause for responses: a ball rolling, rain falling, a butterfly hatching)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Rust:** The reddish-brown coating that forms when metal meets water and air over time.\n- **Weathering:** The slow way that water, wind, and sun change rocks, metal, and land.\n- **Change:** To become different from how something was before.\n- **Environment:** All the things around a living creature that help it survive (air, water, shelter, other animals, plants).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that water and air cause materials like metal to rust (slow change)\n- Students can identify weathering as a natural process that happens slowly\n- Students recognize both slow and fast changes in nature\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by solving a real-world problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards showing: rusty playground equipment, peeling painted fence, eroded soil, wet mailbox\n- Chart paper: \"How Can We Stop Rust?\"\n- Samples to test: painted wood, oiled metal, plastic-wrapped metal, bare metal (have these ready at a table)\n- Paint brushes or oil applicators\n- Non-toxic metal or wood scraps for testing (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Problem scenario:**\n   - \"Think about our school playground. Some of the metal equipment is starting to rust and look like the metal in our photograph. If rust makes metal weak and breaks it, how could we stop the rust from happening? Or make it slower?\"\n   - Show simple pictures of rusty playground equipment, fences, mailboxes\n\n2. **Brainstorm and test solutions:**\n   - Ask: \"What could we put ON the metal to protect it from water and air?\"\n   - Collect ideas: paint, plastic covering, oil, wax, metal covers\n   - **Hands-on test (if time/materials allow):** \n     - Show samples: a bare scrap of metal, a painted scrap, an oiled scrap, a plastic-wrapped scrap\n     - Ask: \"Which one do you think the water will hurt the least? Why?\"\n     - If time permits, spray all samples lightly with water and observe\n     - Discuss: \"Paint and plastic cover the metal so water can't touch it. That's one solution!\"\n\n3. **Apply to the photograph:**\n   - \"If we wanted to protect the metal bar in the photograph where the chrysalis lives, what could we do?\"\n   - \"But wait—we have to be careful! The chrysalis needs air and some water from rain. We can't wrap it completely. We might paint the metal, but we have to leave space for the chrysalis.\"\n   - This teaches that solutions have trade-offs!\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate brainstorming without judging ideas\n- Guide students to think: \"How would that stop water from touching the metal?\"\n- Ask: \"Would that solution work for a playground? For a building? For a butterfly's home?\"\n- Emphasize that different situations need different solutions\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students propose reasonable ways to slow or prevent rust\n- Students understand that protecting metal from water and air stops weathering\n- Students think about how solutions affect living things and environments\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of slow/fast changes and weathering.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist during Explore:** Can students identify differences between wet and dry metal samples?\n- **Listen to group discussions:** Are students using words like \"wet,\" \"change,\" \"different,\" \"damaged\"?\n- **Thumbs check-in during Explain:** Can students show understanding of the connection between water and rust?\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (end of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet showing four simple drawings:\n1. A shiny nail (dry)\n2. A rusty nail (in water for a week)\n3. A caterpillar\n4. A butterfly\n\n**Questions (teacher reads aloud; students circle or point):**\n\n1. \"Which picture shows something that changed SLOWLY, like rust?\" (Students circle rusty nail)\n2. \"Which pictures show FAST changes?\" (Students circle caterpillar and butterfly)\n3. \"What made the nail change?\" (Students choose: water, sun, air, or all of these)\n4. \"What is one way we could stop rust from happening to a metal swing set?\" (Students draw or tell: paint, cover, oil, etc.)\n\n**Alternative exit ticket for non-readers:** \n- Show pictures; have students point or draw their answers\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify that water and air cause rust (slow change)\n- ✓ Student can give one example of fast change (butterfly, animal movement, ball rolling)\n- ✓ Student can name one way to protect metal from rust\n- ✓ Student connects the photo to the learning (explains why the metal is rusty, where the chrysalis is safe)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can distinguish between slow changes (rust/weathering) and fast changes\n- Students can explain that water causes rust\n- Students propose at least one realistic solution to prevent rust\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards with pictures:** Provide images alongside words. Use the word \"water\" and \"rust\" repeatedly, with simple picture prompts showing water + metal = rust.\n\n2. **Buddy system during Explore:** Pair struggling students with a peer to observe rust formation together. Provide a filled-in sentence frame: \"The wet metal is changing. It looks _________.\"\n\n3. **Concrete, reduced-choice assessment:** At exit ticket, offer only 2 choices instead of multiple options. Use simple yes/no or pointing responses instead of writing.\n\n---\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Research question:** \"Why does salt water rust metal faster than fresh water?\" Provide picture-based or leveled text resources. Have students test a metal sample in salt water vs. fresh water over the same time period.\n\n2. **Engineering challenge:** \"Design a way to protect the metal bar in the picture so the chrysalis stays safe AND the rust stops. Draw your idea and explain why it would work.\"\n\n3. **Extended writing:** Provide sentence stems: \"Rust is dangerous because ___. We could prevent rust by ___. This solution works because ___.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rust hunt around school:** Take students on a short outdoor walk to find examples of rust on playground equipment, outdoor structures, or gates. Have them photograph or sketch what they find and compare it to the photograph in the lesson. Create a classroom display labeled \"We Found Rust!\"\n\n2. **Weathering and erosion exploration:** Collect different rocks and small pebbles from outside. Discuss: \"Do rocks rust?\" Introduce the idea that rocks weather differently (they break apart, crack, get smaller, change color). Students can compare old, worn rocks to newer-looking ones.\n\n3. **Predict and check: Long-term observation:** Leave one metal sample from the Explore phase in a humid location (on a windowsill) or outside, and measure/observe changes over 1-2 weeks. Students can draw \"progress pictures\" and compare to their original \"before\" drawings. This extends the lesson into the following week and reinforces slow change.\n\n4. **Make a class book: \"Changes on Earth\":** Students each contribute one page: half showing a \"before\" picture (shiny nail, new fence, young tree) and half showing \"after\" (rusty nail, weathered fence, old tree). Bind pages together. Read and discuss: \"Which changes are slow? Which are fast?\"\n\n---\n\n## Connections to Real World\n\nThis lesson directly addresses Second Graders' curiosity about why things age, break down, and change. They see rust on swings and bikes at home and in their neighborhood—making this concept concrete and personally meaningful. The photograph of the chrysalis adds wonder by showing that not all change is bad; natural change on Earth includes the beautiful transformation of living things in their environments.",
