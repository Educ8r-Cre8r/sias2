  "content": "# Engineering Design Challenge: Fossil Preservation & Display\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n- Multiple fossilized shells (ammonites and bivalves) embedded in sedimentary rock\n- Tan, beige, and brown coloring indicating age and mineralization\n- Spiral chamber structure visible in the center ammonite fossil\n- Ridged texture on shell surfaces showing fine detail preservation\n- Rocks of varying sizes clustered together in natural arrangement\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n- **From shell structure & rock embedding**: These organisms died, were buried under sediment, and hardened over time—the delicate spiral and ridges were preserved because they were protected from damage during fossilization.\n- **From texture detail preservation**: Soft sediment (like mud or silt) was essential to capture fine surface patterns; harder sediment would have destroyed these details.\n- **From mixed fossil grouping**: These organisms likely lived together in the same ancient environment (an ocean or shallow sea), suggesting they occupied the same habitat and time period.\n\n---\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2 Version:**\nYou found some ancient shells buried in the ground! Design a safe \"fossil museum box\" using a shoe box and clay. Your job: create a cozy nest of clay and sand that protects the shells and shows them off so visitors can see the pretty spiral patterns. The shells must not roll around or break.\n\n**3-5 Version:**\nDesign a protective storage and display system for fragile fossils. Your container must:\n- Protect shells from rolling or shifting during transport (use clay, sand, or foam)\n- Keep the spiral and ridged details visible and dust-free\n- Hold at least 3 different-sized \"fossils\" (shells or shell-like objects)\n- Be labeled to explain what each fossil is and where it came from\n\nTest your design by gently tilting the container side-to-side. All fossils must stay in place with zero damage to surface details.\n\n---\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis photo shows *preserved* fossils, not a problem to solve yet. The task flips the problem: \"How do we *keep* them preserved and protected now?\" Students start by observing what made these fossils last millions of years (gentle embedding in soft material) and apply that insight to a modern storage challenge. This grounds the EDP in real paleontology practice.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Materials\n- Shoe boxes or small plastic containers\n- Air-dry clay or modeling clay\n- Sand, fine gravel, or kinetic sand\n- Shells (from beaches or craft stores) as fossil stand-ins\n- Foam sheets or bubble wrap (for cushioning layers)\n- Labels and markers (for identification)\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Time\n**45–60 minutes** (single session)\n- Observation & discussion: 10 minutes\n- Design planning (sketch): 5 minutes\n- Building/arranging: 20–25 minutes\n- Testing & refinement: 10 minutes\n\n---\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.A (Defining and Delimiting Engineering Problems)** by asking students to identify *constraints* (fragility, size variation, visibility) and *criteria* (protection + display) based on observable evidence, building design thinking rooted in authentic paleontological practice.",
