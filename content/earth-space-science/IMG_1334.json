Green plants and red flowers grow around the squirrel.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image represents the **Anchoring Phenomenon** of animal feeding behavior and habitat adaptation. The squirrel demonstrates how animals use their body parts (paws, teeth, eyes) to obtain and consume food from their environment. This behavior occurs because squirrels have evolved specific physical adaptations that allow them to grasp, manipulate, and eat various foods. Their dexterous front paws function like hands, while their sharp teeth can gnaw through tough materials. This feeding behavior is driven by the animal's need for energy and nutrients to survive.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Animal Body Parts and Functions**: Squirrels have specialized body parts (paws for grasping, teeth for chewing, tail for balance) that help them survive in their environment.\n\n2. **Animal Needs**: All animals need food, water, air, and shelter to live and grow. The squirrel is meeting its food needs.\n\n3. **Animal Habitats**: Animals live in places that provide everything they need to survive. This garden habitat provides food and shelter for the squirrel.\n\n4. **Animal Behaviors**: Animals do things to help them survive, like finding and eating food.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use hand motions when teaching about animal body parts - have students pretend to hold food like a squirrel, showing how their hands work like the squirrel's paws.

The squirrel has a bushy tail, small ears, and dark eyes as it enjoys its snack in what looks like a garden setting.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe **Anchoring Phenomenon** shown here is **animal feeding behavior and habitat interaction**. The squirrel is demonstrating how animals obtain food resources from their environment to meet their survival needs. This behavior occurs because all living things require energy (from food) to grow, reproduce, and maintain life processes. The squirrel's physical adaptations - like sharp teeth for gnawing, dexterous paws for grasping, and keen eyesight for locating food - help it successfully gather and consume the nutrients it needs to survive.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Animal Adaptations**: The squirrel's physical features (bushy tail for balance, sharp claws for climbing, cheek pouches for storing food) help it survive in its environment.\n\n2. **Food Webs and Energy Transfer**: Animals obtain energy by consuming plants or other animals, showing how energy moves through ecosystems.\n\n3. **Habitat Requirements**: Animals need specific environmental features (food sources, shelter, water) to meet their basic survival needs.\n\n4. **Animal Behavior**: Squirrels exhibit learned and instinctive behaviors like food gathering, storage, and consumption patterns that help them survive seasonal changes.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use this image to launch a \"Notice and Wonder\" activity where students observe the squirrel's features and behaviors, then make connections to how these help it survive.
