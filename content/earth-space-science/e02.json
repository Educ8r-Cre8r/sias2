In the foreground on the left, you can see a large house with a red tile roof surrounded by green trees and vegetation. In the distance, a city skyline is visible but very unclear - it's partially obscured by thick haze or fog. The buildings in the background look faint and gray. The entire scene has a misty quality showing how particles in the air can reduce visibility.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates atmospheric haze and how particles in the air affect visibility. Haze forms when tiny particles of dust, smoke, pollution, or water droplets scatter and absorb sunlight in the atmosphere. Unlike fog (which is water droplets), haze is often a mixture of dry particles and moisture. The hazy appearance tells us about air quality - more particles mean more haze and reduced visibility. In urban areas, haze can result from vehicle emissions, industrial pollution, or natural causes like dust. The way distant objects appear faded shows how Earth's atmosphere affects light - the farther away something is, the more air its light must travel through to reach our eyes.\n\n## 📚 Core Concepts\n\n1. **Atmosphere**: The layer of gases and tiny particles surrounding Earth that we breathe and live in.\n\n2. **Air Quality**: How clean or polluted the air is, affected by natural and human-made particles.\n\n3. **Visibility**: How far we can see clearly, which is reduced by particles suspended in the air.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nCreate an \"Air Particles\" demonstration!
