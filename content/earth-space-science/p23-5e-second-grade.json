ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph while building curiosity about water's power to change land.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed on board, projector, or printed copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small rocks and soil samples for students to handle\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph (2 minutes):** Project or display the photograph of the eroded streambed. Ask students to sit where everyone can see clearly.\n\n2. **Hook with a Question:** Say: *\"Look at this picture carefully. What do you think happened here? Why does it look all torn up and messy?\"*\n\n3. **Guided Discussion (8-10 minutes):** Ask these specific Second Grade–level questions:\n   - *\"What do you see in this picture? Can you describe the different colors and textures?\"* (Students name rocks, soil, dirt, water)\n   - *\"Where do you think the water is in this picture? Can you point to it?\"* (Students identify the muddy stream/water flow)\n   - *\"Do you think this path was always shaped like this? What could have made it look this way?\"* (Students speculate: water, rain, flowing water wearing it away)\n   - *\"Has water ever changed something in your neighborhood? Maybe a puddle, a river, or a muddy path?\"* (Students connect to prior experience)\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt (2-3 minutes):** On chart paper, write: *\"I wonder what water does to soil and rocks. I wonder if we can stop water from washing dirt away.\"* Invite students to add their own \"I wonder\" statements to the chart. This becomes a reference point for later phases.\n\n**Transition:** \n*\"Today, we're going to do an experiment to find out exactly what water does to soil and rocks, and we might even try to stop it!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate water's ability to move and reshape soil through hands-on experimentation, discovering erosion firsthand.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Aluminum baking pans or shallow plastic bins (one per pair or small group; 6-8 inches × 12 inches minimum)\n- Potting soil or garden soil (2-3 cups per group)\n- Small rocks and gravel (various sizes, about 1 cup per group)\n- Spray bottles or pitchers filled with water\n- Small wooden blocks or books to tilt the pan\n- Paper towels and old newspapers for cleanup\n- Observation worksheet (simple template with boxes for drawing/writing)\n- Optional: food coloring in spray bottles for visual impact\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup (3 minutes):** Arrange students in pairs or small groups (3-4 students). Place materials at each station. Give each group a baking pan with a thin layer of soil, some rocks, and gravel mixed in naturally.\n\n2. **Initial Observation (2 minutes):** Say: *\"Look at your soil. Draw or write what it looks like right now on your paper. Feel the soil. Is it dry or damp? Where are the rocks? Where is the soil?\"*\n\n3. **Prediction (2 minutes):** Ask: *\"What do you think will happen if we pour water slowly on one end of your pan? Where will the water go? What will happen to the soil and rocks?\"* Students draw or tell a partner their prediction.\n\n4. **Investigation Steps (10-12 minutes):** Guide students through these steps:\n   - *\"Use a block to tilt your pan a little bit—like a hillside.\"*\n   - *\"Slowly pour water on the high end of the pan. Watch what happens!\"*\n   - *\"Keep pouring a little more. Do you see the water moving things?\"*\n   - *\"Watch where the soil goes. Watch where the rocks go. Are they in the same place now?\"*\n   - *\"Can you see the water carrying tiny pieces? Does it look muddy?\"*\n   - **Optional enhanced activity:** *\"Now try spraying water with your spray bottle. Is it different from pouring? Which moves more soil?\"*\n\n5. **Documentation (3 minutes):** Students draw or write what happened:\n   - *\"Where did the water go?\"*\n   - *\"What did the water move? (Soil? Rocks? Both?)\"*\n   - *\"Did the soil look different after the water?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: *\"What do you notice?\" \"Did that rock move?\" \"Where did that soil go?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\"*\n- Do **not** explain the process; let students observe and describe.\n- Help manage water and cleanup without directing the \"right\" answer.\n- Use wait time—give students 5-10 seconds to think before responding.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that water moves soil and rocks down the slope.\n- Students will notice the water becomes muddy or brown.\n- Students will see that materials are separated (finer soil moves farther; larger rocks stay closer).\n- Students will document their observations through drawings and simple words.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student observations to the photograph and earth science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original photograph (still displayed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Vocabulary cards with simple pictures (see Vocabulary section below)\n- Small model or diagram showing water flowing downhill\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):** Gather students on the carpet where the photograph is visible.\n   - Ask 3-4 groups: *\"What did you see happen when water poured on your soil?\"*\n   - Record key observations on chart paper as students share (e.g., \"water moved soil,\" \"rocks didn't move much,\" \"water got muddy,\" \"soil went down the slope\").\n\n2. **Make Connections to Photograph (3 minutes):** Point to the photo and say:\n   - *\"Look at this picture again. See how the stream has cut a path through the soil and rocks?\"*\n   - *\"This happened the same way your water moved the soil in your pan. But this happened over a very, very long time—maybe many years!\"*\n   - *\"That's what moving water can do to real land.\"*\n\n3. **Introduce Vocabulary (5-7 minutes):** Present and define these terms with pictures/gestures:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Erosion:** When water, wind, or moving things wear away and carry off soil and rocks. (Show: water moving soil in the pan; point to the eroded streambed in the photo.)\n   - **Soil:** The dirt and small pieces of rock where plants grow. (Hold up a handful; show it in the pan.)\n   - **Sediment:** Tiny pieces of rock and soil that water can pick up and move. (Show muddy water; explain: *\"See how the water looks brown and dirty? That's sediment—tiny pieces floating in the water.\"*)\n   - **Landform:** The shape of the land—like hills, valleys, or slopes. (Point to the shape of the streambed in the photo; draw a simple hill shape on chart paper.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2-3 minutes):** Use these quick checks:\n   - Hold up the photo and ask: *\"Is this an example of erosion? How do you know?\"*\n   - Ask individual students: *\"If water is moving soil, what is that called?\"* (Erosion.)\n   - Ask: *\"What do we call all those tiny pieces of dirt and rock that water moves?\" (Sediment.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the word \"erosion\" to describe water moving soil and rocks.\n- Students will connect their experiment to the photograph.\n- Students will understand that this process takes a long time in nature.\n- Students will recognize that water has power to change land.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of erosion to design and test solutions that slow or prevent water from changing the land.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Fresh baking pans with soil, rocks, and gravel (one per group)\n- Materials to prevent erosion: grass clippings or sod, small pieces of cardboard, pebbles or larger rocks, craft sticks, cloth strips, plastic netting\n- Water in spray bottles or pitchers\n- Small blocks to tilt pans\n- Observation sheet or checklist\n- Optional: thermometer, measuring tape\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the Problem (3 minutes):** Say:\n   - *\"Erosion changes the land by washing away soil. But what if we want to stop erosion or slow it down? What could we use?\"*\n   - *\"Scientists and engineers try to solve problems like this. Today, you're going to be engineers!\"*\n\n2. **Brainstorm Solutions (3-4 minutes):** Show the materials available. Ask:\n   - *\"What could we put on the soil to stop water from washing it away?\"*\n   - *\"Let's look at your materials. Which ones might work?\"*\n   - Record student ideas on chart paper (e.g., \"grass holds soil,\" \"rocks are heavy,\" \"cloth might catch dirt\").\n\n3. **Test Solutions (7-10 minutes):** Students work in groups to:\n   - Choose **one solution** to test first (e.g., placing grass or cloth over part of the soil).\n   - Predict: *\"Do you think this will stop the water? Will it slow down the erosion?\"*\n   - Apply their solution to one section of the pan (keeping the other side uncovered as a comparison).\n   - Pour or spray water on the pan (tilted) and observe.\n   - Discuss: *\"Did it work? Did the soil wash away on that side? Did it wash away on the other side?\"*\n   - Optional: Test a second solution if time allows.\n\n4. **Document and Share (2-3 minutes):** Students complete a checklist:\n   - *\"What did we use to stop erosion?\" (Draw or write.)_\n   - *\"Did it work?\" (Yes / A little / No)*\n   - *\"Why do you think it worked (or didn't work)?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide observations: *\"Which side lost more soil? What's different between the two sides?\"*\n- Ask: *\"Why do you think grass/cloth/rocks helped?\"* (Guide students to understand that plants and materials hold soil in place or block water flow.)\n- Celebrate effort and learning, not just \"success.\" Explain: *\"Even if something didn't work as well as we hoped, we learned something important!\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will test at least one erosion-prevention solution.\n- Students will observe and compare erosion with and without protection.\n- Students will recognize that certain materials (like plants, cloth, or barriers) can slow erosion.\n- Students will begin to understand real-world applications: *\"That's why farmers plant grass on hillsides! That's why we build walls to stop erosion!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of erosion, water's power to change land, and solutions to prevent erosion.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n   - Circulate during Explore and Elaborate phases and listen to student descriptions.\n   - Ask targeted questions: *\"Tell me what's happening to the soil. Why is the water brown? How is this like the picture?\"*\n   - Use a checklist to note which students:\n     - Can describe water moving soil (Objective 1)\n     - Can name different materials water moves (Objective 2)\n     - Attempt to design a solution (Objective 3)\n     - Use the word \"erosion\" or \"change\" when describing what happened (Objective 4)\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (End of Lesson, 5 minutes):**\n   Provide each student with a simple worksheet or have them respond orally. Ask:\n\n   **Question 1:** *\"Draw a picture of water moving soil. Label: water, soil, rocks.\"*\n\n   **Question 2:** *\"What is it called when water washes away soil and rocks?\"*\n   - A) Erosion\n   - B) Growing\n   - C) Freezing\n   \n   **Question 3:** *\"What's one thing we could do to stop water from washing away soil?\"* (Accept: plant grass, put cloth on it, add rocks, build a wall, etc.)\n\n   **Question 4 (Open-ended):** *\"How is what we did in our pan like what happened in the picture?\"*\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n   - **Emerging:** Student can describe water moving soil but uses unclear vocabulary; attempts one solution.\n   - **Proficient:** Student clearly explains erosion, identifies that water moves different materials, and tests a solution with reasoning.\n   - **Advanced:** Student explains erosion with accurate vocabulary, predicts outcomes, tests multiple solutions, and connects to real-world applications.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- All students will demonstrate understanding that water moves and changes soil and rocks.\n- Most students will use the term \"erosion\" or describe it accurately.\n- Students will show evidence of testing solutions and comparing results.\n- Students will see the connection between their experiment and natural landforms.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use simpler terms initially: *\"Water washes away dirt\"* before introducing \"erosion.\" Provide vocabulary cards with pictures and let students keep them during activities.\n\n2. **Guided Exploration:** Pair struggling students with stronger peers or provide a teacher-led small group Explore session with more direct guidance (e.g., *\"Watch the water. Tell me what you see move first—the big rocks or the dirt?\"*).\n\n3. **Visual Aids:** Use the photograph and your model (tilted pan) repeatedly. Point and label: *\"Here's the water. Here's the soil moving. Here's the muddy water.\"* Repeat the same vocabulary consistently.\n\n4. **Reduced Recording Demands:** Allow students to draw pictures or dictate observations to a peer or adult instead of writing. Simplify the exit ticket to yes/no or multiple-choice questions only.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Multiple Variable Testing:** Ask students to test *different amounts* of water (a little vs. a lot) or *different slopes* (steep vs. gentle). Have them predict and record which erodes more soil and why.\n\n2. **Real-World Application Research:** Show images of erosion control solutions used by engineers (terraced hillsides, erosion control netting, retention ponds, reforestation). Ask: *\"Why do you think people use these? What problem are they solving?\"* Have students sketch and explain one method.\n\n3. **Extended Explanation:** Challenge students to explain *why* certain solutions work: *\"How does grass hold the soil? What does it do differently than bare soil?\"* Guide them to think about root systems, surface coverage, and water flow interruption.\n\n4. **Time Scale Discussion:** Ask: *\"Our experiment happened in a few minutes. The picture in the stream took a long time—maybe years. Why does it take so long outside but was so fast in our pan?\"* (Answer: less water, controlled conditions.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Outdoor Erosion Hunt (20-30 minutes, next recess or field trip):**\n   - Take students outside to look for signs of erosion: washed-away paths, ruts from water, exposed roots, changed hillsides, ditches.\n   - Have students photograph or sketch erosion they see.\n   - Ask: *\"Why do you think this erosion happened? Is water doing it? Can we see the water?\"*\n   - Share photos back in class and create an \"Erosion Detective\" poster with the evidence found.\n\n2. **The Water Cycle Connection (30-40 minutes, follow-up lesson):**\n   - Expand learning to how water moves across Earth: rain → runs downhill → carries sediment → deposits it downstream → creates deltas and floodplains.\n   - Use a simple diagram or short video showing how rain leads to runoff and erosion.\n   - Connect to 2-ESS2-3: *\"Water changes form (liquid rain) and location (runs downhill), changing the land in the process.\"*\n\n3. **Design a Park or Playground (30-45 minutes, art + science integration):**\n   - Challenge students to plan a new park or garden on a \"hilly\" land area (provide or draw a simple topographic map).\n   - Ask: *\"How would you prevent erosion on this hill? Where would you plant? Where would you put paths? How would you handle rainwater?\"*\n   - Students sketch designs and label their erosion-prevention solutions.\n   - Display designs and have students explain their choices using vocabulary learned.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure spray bottles and water are kept away from electrical outlets. Use old clothes or aprons; water will spill.\n- **Timing:** If your school blocks 40-minute sessions, this plan easily stretches to three 30-minute lessons: Session 1 (Engage + Explore), Session 2 (Explain + Elaborate), Session 3 (Evaluate + Extension).\n- **Real-World Connection:** If your area has a local stream, ravine, or erosion example, show a photo or take a field trip. This dramatically increases engagement and relevance.\n- **Vocabulary Retention:** Repeat key terms (erosion, sediment, landform) across all five phases. Second graders need 4–6 exposures to internalize new vocabulary.\n- **Flexible Materials:** No potting soil? Use sand. No spray bottles? Use pitchers or cups. No fancy materials for erosion solutions? Grass, paper towels, sticks, and leaves work great.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson directly addresses the visible phenomenon in the photograph—water-driven erosion of a streambed—and uses it to anchor students' understanding of how Earth's landforms change over time.",
