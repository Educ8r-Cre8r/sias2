ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about the beach as a home for animals and connect sunlight and time of day to animal activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, color printout or digital display of the crab photograph (projected on screen or printed poster-size)\n- Index cards with \"sun,\" \"day,\" \"night\" written on them (large, with simple drawings)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation before speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause 3–5 seconds after each for student responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Where is this place?\" *(Expect: sand, beach, a crab)*\n   - \"Do you see the sun shining on this beach? What do you think makes the sand so hot and bright?\"\n   - \"Where is this crab's home? Why do you think it's in a hole in the sand?\"\n   - \"When do you think this crab comes out—when the sun is high in the sky during the day, or when it's dark at night? Why?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:**\n   - \"Put your thumbs up if you think crabs like the bright, hot sun. Put your thumbs down if you think they hide when it's too bright. Who can tell us why you picked that?\"\n   - Record their predictions on chart paper under the headings \"Crabs like bright sun\" and \"Crabs hide from bright sun.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore what the beach is like and figure out why crabs might live the way they do. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate sand and sunlight by creating a mini beach environment and observing how sunlight affects it.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- 1 shallow pan or aluminum tray\n- Sand (enough to fill the pan 2–3 inches deep)\n- 1 small plastic toy crab (or draw one on a plastic cup) to place in the sand\n- 1 flashlight or desk lamp\n- Optional: thermometer, small spray bottle with water\n- Observation sheet (template provided below)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity – Step by Step:**\n\n1. **Set up the mini beach:** \"Pour sand into your pan and use your hands to make it look like a beach. Make a little hole or burrow in the sand and place your crab there.\"\n\n2. **Observe in regular light first:** \n   - \"Look at your beach. Can you see the crab easily? Is the sand bright or dark? Draw what you see.\"\n   - Record: Students sketch the sand and crab in normal classroom light.\n\n3. **Add bright light (simulating bright sun):**\n   - \"Now, shine the flashlight or turn on the lamp right above your sand. What happens? Do you think the sand gets hot? Does the crab's hole get darker or lighter?\"\n   - Students observe for 1 minute and describe changes.\n   - Record: \"The sand looks ________. The crab's hole looks ________.\"\n\n4. **Optional: Temperature check:**\n   - If using a thermometer: \"Feel the sand that's in the light. Feel the sand in the shade (the crab's hole). Which is warmer?\"\n\n5. **Prediction for movement:**\n   - \"If the sun makes the sand very hot and bright, do you think the crab stays in its hole or comes out? Why?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What changes did you notice when we added light?\" \"Where is it cooler—in the hole or on top?\"\n- Do **not** tell students the answer; let them observe and wonder.\n- Prompt with: \"What do you think would happen if we waited until it was dark?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that light makes sand brighter and (they may infer) warmer.\n- Students see that the crab's hole is darker and appears to be a \"hiding place.\"\n- Students record observations through drawings and simple labels.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce key vocabulary and formalize concepts about Earth places, habitats, sunlight, and time of day.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph displayed again (large and visible)\n- Picture cards: sun (bright), moon (dark), crab, sand, burrow/hole\n- Simple sentence frames written on chart paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on the carpet.** Display the crab photograph again.\n\n2. **Share observations from Explore phase:**\n   - \"Who found that the sand got brighter when the light was on? Show me with your hand how bright it was.\"\n   - \"Who noticed the crab's hole was darker? What does that tell us about why crabs make holes?\"\n   - Write student ideas on chart paper without correcting.\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary with First Grade-friendly definitions:**\n\n   **Vocabulary & Definitions:**\n   - **Beach:** A place on Earth where sand meets water. It's usually warm and sunny.\n   - **Habitat:** A home for an animal. It has everything the animal needs to be safe and find food.\n   - **Sand:** Tiny pieces of rock on the beach. Wind and water break rocks into sand over a very long time.\n   - **Burrow:** A hole or tunnel an animal digs to hide and stay safe. It's cooler and darker inside.\n   - **Sunlight:** Light from the sun that makes things bright and warm.\n\n4. **Make connections:**\n   - Point to the photograph: \"This crab's habitat is the sandy beach. See its burrow? That's its home. During the bright, hot day, the crab stays inside where it's cool and dark. At night, when the sun goes down and it gets dark and cooler, the crab might come out.\"\n   - Show a simple timeline: \n     - **Morning/Noon (bright sun, hot)** → Crab in burrow\n     - **Evening (sun going down, cooler)** → Crab might come out\n     - **Night (dark, cool)** → Crab is active\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your body: Are you a crab hiding in the burrow, or are you a crab out in the bright sun?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the crab hides when the sun is bright?\" (Accept: \"It's too hot,\" \"The bright light is too much,\" \"It needs to stay cool.\")\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the term \"habitat\" to describe the beach.\n- Students can explain that sunlight makes the sand hot and bright, and crabs hide in burrows to stay cool and safe.\n- Students begin to connect time of day (sun position) to animal behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Deepen understanding by predicting when and how animals use sunlight and time of day.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper divided into 4 sections labeled: \"Early Morning,\" \"Noon,\" \"Evening,\" \"Night\"\n- Picture cards of sun at different heights, moon, stars\n- Crab and burrow cutouts (pre-made or student-created)\n- Glue sticks and tape\n- Optional: Picture book about beach animals (e.g., *A House for Hermit Crab* by Eric Carle, abridged)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Time of Day Timeline:**\n   - Show students the four-section paper. Point to each section and describe:\n     - **Early Morning:** \"The sun is just coming up. It's a little cold and still kind of dark.\"\n     - **Noon:** \"The sun is high, high up. It's very bright and very hot!\"\n     - **Evening:** \"The sun is going down. It's getting darker and cooler.\"\n     - **Night:** \"The sun is gone. The moon and stars are out. It's dark and cool.\"\n\n2. **Where is the crab?**\n   - \"Where do you think the crab is at each time? Is it in its burrow or on top of the sand? Let's place our crab pictures.\"\n   - Students move crab cutouts or place them on the timeline, predicting activity based on sunlight level.\n   - Ask: \"Why did you put the crab there? What's happening with the sun?\"\n\n3. **Reasoning circle:**\n   - \"In which pictures is the sun bright? Where is the crab?\" \n   - Guide students to see the pattern: **Less sunlight/cooler = crab out; More sunlight/hotter = crab hidden.**\n\n4. **Real-world connection:**\n   - \"Beach animals like crabs are very smart about the sun. The sun gives us light and warmth, but too much heat can hurt the crab. So the crab uses the beach—the sand and the burrow—to stay safe and comfortable.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the timeline activity without leading too much.\n- Ask: \"What clues tell us it's time for the crab to come out?\"\n- Encourage students to use \"because\" when explaining their choices.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students predict crab activity based on sun position/time of day.\n- Students explain that sunlight affects animal behavior.\n- Students connect their Explore observations to a larger pattern.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students understand that habitats, sunlight, and time of day affect where and when animals are active.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist during Explore:** Did students notice light/dark changes? Did they connect brightness to the crab's hiding?\n- **Vocabulary use during Explain:** Did students use \"habitat,\" \"burrow,\" and \"sunlight\" in their responses?\n- **Prediction accuracy in Elaborate:** Did students correctly place the crab based on sun position?\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket (end of lesson):**\n\nPrint or display three scenarios. Students point or respond verbally:\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"It's a hot, sunny day at noon. Where is the crab?\"\n- A) On top of the sand in the bright sun\n- B) In its burrow under the sand\n- **Correct answer:** B (with teacher accepting \"under the sand\" or \"in the hole\")\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"The sun is going down. It's getting darker and cooler. What might the crab do?\"\n- A) Stay in its burrow\n- B) Come out to look for food\n- **Correct answer:** B (accept either, but listen for reasoning: \"The sun isn't so hot,\" \"It's cooler now\")\n\n**Scenario 3:** \"Why do you think the crab makes a burrow in the sand?\" \n- **Listen for:** \"To hide,\" \"To stay cool,\" \"To stay safe from the hot sun,\" \"It's dark in there.\"\n\n**Individual response option** (if using paper):\n- Students draw or dictate: \"Draw where a crab would be during a very sunny day and explain why.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies that the crab hides when the sun is bright/hot.\n- ✓ Student explains a connection between sunlight and the crab's behavior (e.g., \"Sun is hot, so crab hides\").\n- ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary word (habitat, burrow, sunlight, sand) correctly.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most First Graders will correctly identify that crabs hide during bright sunlight.\n- Students will offer reasons that show understanding of heat/comfort/safety.\n- Students will transfer learning: \"The sun is bright, so animals hide\" or similar reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and visuals:** \n   - Use picture cards alongside every new word. Keep definitions to one simple sentence. Example: \"A burrow is a hole where an animal lives.\"\n   \n2. **Hands-on guidance during Explore:**\n   - Pair struggling students with stronger peers. Provide a sentence frame: \"When the light shines, the sand looks _____.\"\n   - Teacher works directly with this group during the mini-beach activity, asking questions one at a time.\n\n3. **Concrete exit ticket:**\n   - Instead of multiple choice, show two photos (one: bright sunny beach; one: dark nighttime beach) and ask, \"Where is the crab?\" Student points. Accept a simple verbal answer.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extend the time-of-day investigation:**\n   - \"What if we left the light on for a long time? Would the sand get even hotter? What would the crab do?\" Have them predict and test by leaving a thermometer in the light for 5 minutes.\n\n2. **Research and present:**\n   - Provide a simple picture book about beach animals. Ask, \"What other animals live on the beach? When do they come out? What are their habitats?\" Students draw and label.\n\n3. **Design a crab habitat:**\n   - \"Using sand, rocks, and a small container, design a perfect home for a crab. Show where the crab sleeps, where it eats, and where it hides from the sun. Explain your design to a classmate.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Sunrise to Sunset\" movement activity:**\n   - Take students outside. Have them act out a crab's day: Start in a low squat (burrow) while it's \"early morning.\" As the \"sun rises\" (you raise your hand/arm), students stay low or move slowly. At \"noon\" (hand at the top), students freeze or hide behind a line. As the \"sun sets\" (hand lowers), students slowly emerge and move around. Repeat with emphasis on connecting body position/activity to sun position.\n\n2. **Create a \"Beach Habitat\" classroom display or bulletin board:**\n   - Students glue sand onto paper and add drawings/cutouts of beach animals in their \"hiding spots\" during the day and \"out and about\" during the night. Label with \"Day (Hot & Bright)\" and \"Night (Cool & Dark).\"\n\n3. **Home connection: \"My Animal Journal\":**\n   - Send home a simple observation sheet: \"Observe an animal in your neighborhood today. Draw where it is and what time of day you see it. Is the sun bright or not? Does the animal hide or stay out?\" Discuss responses the next day.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Why this lesson connects to NGSS 1-ESS1-1:** Students observe the effect of the sun (a star) on a specific place on Earth and predict patterns based on the sun's brightness throughout the day. They notice that the sun's presence/absence affects animal behavior—a pattern they can observe and describe.\n\n- **Safety reminders:** When using flashlights or lamps, ensure they are not directed at students' eyes. Supervise the mini-beach activity to ensure sand stays in pans.\n\n- **Real-world relevance:** Many First Graders have been to or will visit a beach. This lesson demystifies what they see and deepens their observation skills. It also introduces systems thinking: the sun, the beach, and the animals are all connected.\n\n- **Vocabulary scaffolding:** In First Grade, repeated exposure is key. Use the same visuals and words throughout the five phases so concepts stick.",
