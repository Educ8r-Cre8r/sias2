This demonstrates how Earth's weather and landscapes change seasonally.\n\n- **Water and Its States:** The pond visible in the image shows water in different conditions (frozen ice melting into liquid water), illustrating how the same substance can change form based on temperature changes.\n\n- **Landform Features and Erosion:** The sloping terrain, exposed soil, water body, and vegetation patterns show how water shapes the land over time. The bank erosion visible near the water's edge demonstrates how moving water can change Earth's surface.\n\n- **Local Habitat Adaptation:** Trees, shrubs, and grasses visible in the photograph represent plants adapted to this specific climate and seasonal cycle. The bare branches and dormant appearance show how plants respond to seasonal temperature changes.\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Spring Awakening: Tracking Seasonal Changes at Our Local Pond**\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Third Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** 3-ESS2-1, 3-ESS2-2, 3-ESS3-1\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n- Describe the typical weather conditions and observable changes that happen during spring in their local environment\n- Collect and record data about seasonal changes visible in a photograph of a thawing landscape\n- Create a table or simple graph showing how weather conditions change from winter to spring\n- Explain how knowing about seasonal weather changes helps us prepare for spring hazards like flooding or muddy conditions\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Spark curiosity about seasonal changes by examining the photograph and activating prior knowledge about winter and spring.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Printed or digital image of the thawing pond photograph (large format if possible)\n  - Chart paper or whiteboard\n  - Markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n  Display the photograph of the thawing pond prominently. Ask students to observe quietly for 30 seconds before discussing. Then facilitate the following discussion:\n\n  **Discussion Questions:**\n  1. \"What do you notice about the water in this picture? Does it look like ice or liquid water, or both? How can you tell?\" (Encourage observations about the frozen edge and the open water in the middle.)\n  2. \"Look at the trees and ground. What season do you think this is? What clues help you know?\" (Guide students to notice bare branches, new green growth on the ground, and the partly-brown landscape.)\n  3. \"If this is spring, what must have happened to make the ice start melting? What changed?\" (Elicit ideas about temperature getting warmer.)\n  4. \"Have you seen places near your home that look like this in spring? What happens when snow and ice melt?\" (Activate prior knowledge about puddles, wet ground, possible flooding.)\n\n  Write student observations and predictions on chart paper under two columns: \"Winter\" and \"Spring.\"\n\n- **Transition:** \"Great observations! Today we're going to become weather detectives and collect data about what happens in spring. Then we'll figure out how people can stay safe when these seasonal changes happen.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate seasonal weather conditions and changes by examining the photograph closely and comparing winter-to-spring transitions.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Printed photograph (one per pair of students, or one class copy)\n  - \"Spring Changes Observation Sheet\" handout (see below)\n  - Colored pencils or crayons\n  - Rulers (optional, for measuring in the activity)\n  - Chart showing \"Winter Weather\" and \"Spring Weather\" with blank cells\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Student Directions:**\n\n  1. **Work with a partner.** Look at your copy of the pond photograph very carefully.\n\n  2. **Observe the Water:** Point to the water. Is it frozen or melted? Is it both? Draw or write what you see. Label any ice you see and any liquid water you see.\n\n  3. **Observe the Ground:** Look at the soil and plants. What colors do you see? Is the ground wet, dry, or mixed? Sketch what the ground looks like in your observation sheet.\n\n  4. **Observe the Plants and Trees:** Draw one tree from the photograph. Does it have leaves? Are there green plants growing? What does this tell you about the temperature?\n\n  5. **Predict and Record:** On your sheet, write or draw your answer: \"If this is spring, what was this place like in winter? Draw or write what you think it looked like.\"\n\n  6. **Compare:** Complete the chart on your sheet:\n     - Winter: What was the weather like? (Cold, snowy, frozen?)\n     - Spring: What is the weather like now? (Warmer, water melting, new growth?)\n\n  **Observation Sheet Sections:**\n  - Sketch the water and label its state(s)\n  - Sketch the ground and soil\n  - Draw a tree from the photo\n  - Write: \"In winter, this place probably looked like...\"\n  - Complete: Winter vs. Spring comparison chart\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you see that tells you the temperature changed?\" and \"How is the ground different from what it would be in winter?\"\n  - Avoid telling students the answers; encourage them to observe and make inferences.\n  - Help students use descriptive language: \"Is the ice thick or thin? Is there a little water or a lot?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students complete observation sheets with drawings and written descriptions.\n  - Students articulate that water changes form when temperature changes.\n  - Students identify visual clues of seasonal change (ice melting, new plant growth, wet ground).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce seasonal weather vocabulary and formalize understanding of winter-to-spring transitions using the photograph as evidence.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper with vocabulary definitions\n  - Photograph (still displayed)\n  - Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n  - Whiteboard/markers for data display\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Group Share-Out:**\n  - Ask 4-5 pairs to share their observations: \"What did you notice about the water?\" \"What does the ground tell us?\" \"How did the plants change?\"\n  - Create a class list on chart paper titled \"Spring Weather Signs\" based on student observations.\n\n  **Vocabulary Introduction (with definitions written for students to copy):**\n\n  1. **Season:** A time of year with its own weather patterns and typical conditions. (Spring is warmer; winter is colder.)\n  2. **Thaw:** When frozen water (ice) melts and turns into liquid water because it gets warmer.\n  3. **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is. (When temperature goes up in spring, ice melts.)\n  4. **Weather:** What it is like outside—hot or cold, wet or dry, snowy or sunny. (Spring weather is usually warmer and wetter than winter weather.)\n  5. **Seasonal Change:** When weather, plants, and animals change in patterns throughout the year.\n\n  **Connection Back to the Photograph:**\n  - Point to the pond: \"This is spring thaw. The ice is melting because the temperature is getting warmer. This is what happens every spring in places that get cold winters.\"\n  - Point to the ground: \"See the brown and green? In winter, everything would be covered in snow or be brown and frozen. Now green plants are growing again!\"\n  - Point to the trees: \"In winter, these trees had no leaves and looked dead. But spring warmth wakes them up and new growth starts.\"\n\n  **Check for Understanding:**\n  - Ask individual students: \"Why does ice melt in spring?\" (Warmer temperature.)\n  - Ask: \"How do you know spring is here?\" (Water melting, new plant growth, warmer weather.)\n  - Distribute index cards and ask students to draw one sign of spring they see in the photo and write/dictate one sentence about it.\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Season:** A time of year with its own special weather and patterns.\n  - **Thaw:** When ice melts and becomes liquid water.\n  - **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is.\n  - **Weather:** What it is like outside (hot, cold, wet, dry, snowy, sunny).\n  - **Seasonal Change:** The pattern of how Earth's weather, plants, and animals change throughout the year.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students understand that seasonal changes involve temperature, weather, and visible changes in water and plants.\n  - Students can use vocabulary to describe the transition from winter to spring.\n  - Students recognize that thawing is a predictable seasonal event.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding of seasonal changes by creating a data table/graph of spring weather conditions and considering how communities prepare for spring hazards.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Large grid paper or printed template for data table\n  - Colored pencils or markers\n  - Chart: \"Spring Weather in Our Region\" (sample data provided, or use local weather data)\n  - Picture cards or real photographs showing spring hazards (flooding, muddy roads, etc.)\n  - \"Design Challenge\" worksheet (optional)\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Part A: Create a Spring Weather Data Display (3-ESS2-1)**\n\n  Provide students with a simple data table template showing \"Typical Spring Weather Conditions\":\n\n  | Weather Condition | Winter | Spring |\n  |---|---|---|\n  | Temperature | Cold | Warmer |\n  | Water State | Frozen/Snowy | Melting/Liquid |\n  | Plant Growth | Dormant/Bare | Growing/Green |\n  | Precipitation | Snow | Rain |\n\n  - Have students complete the table by drawing pictures or checkmarks.\n  - Model creating a simple bar graph or picture graph showing \"Days of Freezing Weather in Winter vs. Spring\" using made-up but realistic data.\n  - Students color in a simple bar graph template to show the difference.\n\n  **Part B: Spring Hazard and Solutions (3-ESS3-1)**\n\n  Show pictures or discuss: \"When ice and snow melt in spring, what problems can happen?\" Elicit: flooding, muddy roads, erosion, wet basements.\n\n  - Display a simple scenario: \"A neighborhood near a river is worried about spring flooding when all the snow melts. How can people reduce the danger?\"\n  - Show example solutions: building a small dam, clearing drainage ditches, building walls, creating a detention pond.\n  - Ask students to pick one solution and explain why it would help (with support).\n  - Challenge: \"What is one way your family or school could prepare for spring weather changes?\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Guide students in reading and creating simple data displays.\n  - Facilitate discussion about cause and effect: \"If more snow melts, what happens to the water in the river?\"\n  - Help students evaluate solutions: \"Would that really stop flooding? Why or why not?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students complete a data table comparing winter and spring conditions.\n  - Students create or color a simple graph showing seasonal differences.\n  - Students can name one real or logical solution to a spring weather hazard.\n  - Students explain (verbally or in writing) how their solution helps.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of seasonal weather changes, data representation, and awareness of seasonal hazards.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n  - Observe and record student responses during Engage discussion.\n  - Review observation sheets from Explore for accuracy and detail.\n  - Listen to vocabulary usage during Explain phase share-outs.\n  - Check student data tables and graphs for completion and correctness.\n\n  **Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 2):**\n\n  Provide each student with a slip of paper or digital form with these questions:\n\n  1. **Draw and Label:** Sketch what the pond looks like in spring vs. what it probably looked like in winter. Label at least two things that are different.\n\n  2. **Short Answer (with picture support if needed):** \"Why does ice melt in spring?\" \n     - Sentence frame: \"Ice melts in spring because _________________.\"\n\n  3. **Claim and Reason:** \"Name one problem that happens when ice and snow melt in spring. How can people stay safe?\"\n     - Frame: \"One problem is ___________. People can stay safe by ___________.\"\n\n  **Success Criteria:**\n\n  - **Proficient:** Student accurately describes at least two observable changes from winter to spring; correctly identifies temperature as the reason for thawing; names a realistic hazard and a logical solution.\n\n  - **Developing:** Student describes one or two seasonal changes but may be vague; understands thawing is related to warmth but may need prompting; names a hazard but solution is unclear.\n\n  - **Beginning:** Student has difficulty identifying seasonal changes; does not yet understand why ice melts; cannot name a specific hazard or solution.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Exit tickets show understanding of seasonal temperature changes and thawing.\n  - Students can represent seasonal data in a simple table or graph.\n  - Students demonstrate awareness that seasonal changes create real-world impacts.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support:**\n  1. **Sentence Frames & Visual Supports:** Provide sentence starters for written responses: \"In winter, the water was _______. In spring, the water is _______.\" Use picture cards alongside text to support vocabulary understanding.\n  2. **Simplified Data Display:** Instead of a full table, provide a two-column chart with pictures (winter/spring) that students can cut and paste into. Use a picture graph with just 2-3 categories rather than multiple data sets.\n  3. **Guided Observation:** Pair struggling readers with a buddy or assign focused observation tasks: \"Just look at the water. Tell me what you see.\" Provide a checklist of observations rather than open-ended questions.\n\n- **Challenge:**\n  1. **Extended Data Graphing:** Have advanced students collect real weather data from a local weather service or school weather station over several weeks to create a multi-week line graph showing temperature increasing from winter to spring. Ask them to predict when the pond would be completely thawed based on temperature trends.\n  2. **Complex Hazard Analysis:** Challenge students to research and present a real spring weather event (e.g., a historical flood) and evaluate multiple solutions, explaining which is most effective and why. Have them interview a community member (parent, firefighter, town official) about how their town prepares for spring weather.\n  3. **Systems Thinking:** Ask students to create a detailed diagram showing how the thaw affects plants, animals, soil, and water. Discuss: \"What happens to the trees when water is available? What animals come back in spring? Why?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Spring Phenology Monitoring\" (Multi-Week Project):** Have students visit a local pond, park, or wooded area weekly and photograph or sketch the same scene as it progresses through spring. Create a \"Time-Lapse\" poster or digital slideshow showing changes in water, plants, and ground conditions over 4-6 weeks. This extends 3-ESS2-1 by having students collect and compare real-world seasonal data.\n\n2. **\"Design a Spring Flood Solution\" (Engineering Design Challenge):** Students receive a model landscape (sandbox or shallow container with soil) with a \"pond\" (water basin). Provide flooding scenario: \"Heavy spring rains are coming. Design a solution to prevent water from washing away the hillside.\" Students build with clay, sand, rocks, or other materials (barriers, channels, dams) and test their design by slowly adding water. Students must explain how their design relates to real flood prevention methods.\n\n3. **\"Winter vs. Spring Habitat Comparison\" (Comparative Research):** Have students compare the habitat visible in the photograph to how it likely appears in winter, summer, and fall. Create a four-panel poster, digital presentation, or book showing the same location in all four seasons. Include data about temperature, precipitation, and organism activity. This addresses 3-ESS2-2 (comparing climates/conditions across regions or seasons) and builds toward understanding climate patterns.",
