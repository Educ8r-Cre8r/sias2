Observe and describe wind as a natural force that moves objects.\n2. Explain in simple words how wind turbines use wind to help people.\n3. Identify one way wind energy helps reduce harm to the environment.\n4. Create a simple model showing how wind can spin and make things work.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of wind turbines\n- Lightweight scarves or strips of tissue paper (one per student)\n- Open classroom space\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Point to the large turbines and ask students: *\"What do you see in this picture?\"* Let them call out observations (big structures, things spinning, tall towers, fields).\n\n2. **Ask discovery questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - *\"What do you think makes those big things on top spin around?\"*\n   - *\"Have you ever felt wind push on you? What does wind feel like?\"*\n   - *\"Why would someone build something THIS BIG in the middle of a field?\"*\n   - *\"What do you think these machines do?\"*\n\n3. **Engage students with a kinesthetic experience:** Give each student a scarf or tissue paper strip. Say: *\"Let's go outside (or to a hallway) and feel the wind. Hold your scarf up and see what happens! Just like those turbines catch the wind, your scarf catches it too!\"* (If outdoor access is unavailable, students can run and wave their scarves to simulate wind movement.)\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** *\"I wonder how wind could help people... Let's find out!\"*\n\n**Transition:** Now that students have felt wind move objects, we're going to explore how wind can do even bigger jobs.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pinwheels (purchased or pre-made paper pinwheels, one per student or pair)\n- Straws or wooden sticks to hold pinwheels\n- Open space for movement\n- Simple recording sheet with drawings of pinwheels (blank circles for students to draw)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Pinwheel Investigation**\n\n1. **Distribute pinwheels** to each student or pair. Show students how to hold the stick gently so the pinwheel spins freely.\n\n2. **Give exploration directions:**\n   - *\"Blow gently on your pinwheel. What happens?\"*\n   - *\"Walk around the room while holding your pinwheel. What do you notice?\"*\n   - *\"Blow harder. Does it spin faster or slower?\"*\n   - *\"Stand still and blow softly. What happens now?\"*\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph:** *\"Look at the big turbines in the picture again. See how they have blades like your pinwheel? Wind makes those blades spin, just like your breath makes your pinwheel spin!\"*\n\n**Part B: Recording**\n\n4. **Have students draw** on their recording sheet:\n   - Draw your pinwheel when it's spinning slowly\n   - Draw your pinwheel when it's spinning fast\n   - Draw arrows to show which way the wind is pushing\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: *\"What made your pinwheel spin faster?\"* and *\"Where is the wind coming from?\"*\n- Encourage students to test different speeds of blowing and movement\n- Do NOT tell students that \"wind makes it spin\"—let them discover it through play\n- Take photos or anecdotal notes of student observations\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that moving air (wind/breath) causes the pinwheel blades to rotate\n- Students will recognize that stronger wind causes faster spinning\n- Students will begin to understand that wind is an invisible force with visible effects\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of wind turbines (displayed again)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Picture cards showing: wind, energy, turbine, environment\n- Children's picture book: *\"Wind Power\" by Rebecca Stefoff* or *\"The Wind Blew\" by Pat Hutchins* (optional, 5-10 min read-aloud)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations from Explore phase:**\n   - *\"What did you discover about your pinwheels?\"*\n   - *\"What made them spin?\"*\n   - Record student observations on chart paper using simple words\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with actions and visuals:\n\n   - **Wind:** Moving air. (Have students wave hands to show air moving)\n   - **Spin/Spinning:** Going around and around. (Demonstrate by rotating hand)\n   - **Turbine:** A big machine with blades that spin in the wind. (Point to picture)\n   - **Energy:** Power that makes things work. (Stretch arms up: *\"Energy helps you grow and play and think!\"*)\n   - **Environment:** All the plants, animals, land, water, and air around us. (Point around classroom and outside window)\n\n3. **Make connections to the photograph:**\n   - *\"Look at these big turbines. They're like giant pinwheels, aren't they?\"*\n   - *\"The wind blows and makes the blades spin, just like with your pinwheel.\"*\n   - *\"When the blades spin, they make energy that helps power homes and schools. Wind gives us power without hurting the air or water!\"*\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"If I show you a picture of a turbine, can you tell me what makes it spin?\"* (Students respond: wind!)\n   - *\"Is wind something we can see or something we feel?\"* (We can see what wind does, but we feel the wind itself)\n   - *\"Where would be a good place to put a wind turbine? Why?\"* (A windy place, like a hill or open field)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Wind** | Air that moves from one place to another. You can feel it and see what it does. |\n| **Spin** | To go around and around like a top or a wheel. |\n| **Turbine** | A big machine with long blades that spin when the wind blows. |\n| **Energy** | Power that makes things work—like the power that helps you run and play. |\n| **Environment** | Everything outside: the air, water, land, plants, and animals. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the word \"wind\" to explain what makes turbines move\n- Students will understand that turbines make energy for people\n- Students will begin to connect wind energy to helping the environment\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Paper plates, paper fasteners, straws\n- Markers and crayons\n- Pre-cut strips of colored paper (to tape as \"blades\")\n- String\n- Tape and glue\n- Chart paper: \"How Wind Turbines Help Our Environment\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Build a Model Turbine (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Explain the task:** *\"We're going to make our own mini turbines to show how they work!\"*\n\n2. **Provide simple directions:**\n   - Take a paper plate (optional: paint it blue for sky)\n   - Poke a hole in the center and insert a paper fastener\n   - Tape four paper strips around the fastener as \"blades\"\n   - Attach a straw to the back so students can hold and blow on it\n   - Decorate with markers (farm, trees, houses)\n\n3. **Test the models:** *\"Now blow on your turbine blades. Do they spin? You're the wind!\"*\n\n**Part B: Real-World Connection (5 minutes)**\n\n4. **Co-create a chart:** \"How Wind Turbines Help Our World\"\n   - Ask: *\"How do turbines help us?\"*\n   - Guide students toward: power for homes, no smoke/pollution, no fire needed, wind is free, helps the air stay clean\n   - Record with pictures and words on a class chart\n\n5. **Connect to the lesson photograph:** *\"The turbines in the big field work just like your models. Wind spins the big blades, and that makes energy for people to use—like electricity for lights and computers!\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide pre-made materials to reduce fine-motor frustration\n- Circulate and ask: *\"Can you explain how wind is helping your turbine spin?\"*\n- Scaffold by saying: \"Wind is the _____ that makes the blades _____\" (answers: force; spin)\n- Celebrate and display finished models\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a working model that demonstrates wind's ability to make objects rotate\n- Students articulate at least one benefit of wind energy (e.g., \"It makes power,\" \"It doesn't make the air dirty,\" \"It's free\")\n- Students make explicit connections between their model and the real turbines in the photograph\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During the Lesson):**\n- Observe pinwheel exploration: Do students recognize that wind causes motion?\n- Listen during vocabulary introduction: Can students repeat and use new terms?\n- Monitor model building: Can students explain their turbine with teacher prompts?\n- Ask probing questions: *\"Tell me what makes wind turbines spin\"* and *\"Why is wind energy good?\"*\n\n**Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes):**\n\nShow students the wind turbine photograph one final time and ask them to respond to ONE of these (you choose based on your class):\n\n**Option A (Drawing + Dictation):**\n- *\"Draw a picture showing wind making a turbine spin. Tell me one word about what wind does.\"*\n- Students draw and you record their dictated response\n\n**Option B (Verbal Response with Visual Aid):**\n- Hold up the turbine photo and ask three quick questions:\n  1. *\"What makes this turbine move?\"* (Wind/moving air)\n  2. *\"What do you think happens inside? Does it make energy or does it use energy?\"* (Makes energy)\n  3. *\"Is wind turbine energy good for the environment? Why or why not?\"* (Yes, because it's clean/doesn't hurt the air)\n\n**Option C (Movement-Based Assessment):**\n- Play \"Turbine Freeze Dance\": Play music while children spin like turbines. When you show the turbine photo and ask: *\"What makes this move?\"* they freeze and everyone says \"WIND!\" together. Observe who participates and understands the connection.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Meets Expectation:** Student can identify wind as the force that makes turbines spin AND explain in simple words that turbines help people (make power/energy)\n\n✓ **Approaching Expectation:** Student identifies wind makes turbines spin BUT cannot yet explain the human benefit\n\n✓ **Below Expectation:** Student cannot explain what makes turbines move; needs further exploration with wind and spinners\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify wind as the cause of turbine movement\n- 75% will articulate one benefit of turbines (e.g., \"makes energy,\" \"helps houses,\" \"keeps air clean\")\n- 100% will have had hands-on experience with wind causing motion (pinwheel, model turbine)\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary through movement:** Before the main lesson, spend extra time with wind words—have students BE the wind (move around) and BE the turbine (spin). Repeat these actions throughout the lesson.\n\n2. **Simplify the model-building task:** Provide a pre-assembled turbine frame so students only need to decorate and test it. This reduces fine-motor demands and keeps focus on the concept.\n\n3. **Guided questioning during exploration:** Pair struggling students with a strong peer and provide sentence stems: *\"The wind is making my pinwheel ___. I can feel the wind when I ___.\"* Have them practice saying the sentence before responding.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate variables:** Ask advanced students: *\"What happens if you blow from different directions? Does the turbine spin the same way? Can you make it spin faster or slower?\"* Have them record which direction of wind makes the fastest spin.\n\n2. **Research and present:** Provide picture books or simple digital resources about wind farms. Ask: *\"How many turbines can you see in our classroom picture? Where else do you think wind turbines are built? Why those places?\"* Have students create a simple poster showing a windy place where turbines could go.\n\n3. **Design thinking extension:** *\"If you could add something to a wind turbine to make it even better, what would you add? Why?\"* Students sketch ideas and explain their thinking (e.g., \"I'd add a rain collector,\" \"I'd make it prettier,\" \"I'd make it spin slower so birds don't get hurt\").\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Wind Walk and Weather Observation (Follow-up lesson or homework):**\n   - Take students on a classroom nature walk (or window observation) to observe wind signs: moving leaves, swaying trees, clouds moving, hair blowing, clothing fluttering\n   - Have students draw pictures of wind and what it does\n   - Create a class \"Wind Effects\" poster showing all the ways they observed wind (causes leaves to move, makes trees sway, pushes clouds, etc.)\n   - Connects to **K-ESS2-1** (observing weather patterns)\n\n2. **Compare Energy Sources (Cross-curricular science discussion):**\n   - Show images of different energy sources: sun (solar), water (hydroelectric), coal (non-renewable), wind\n   - Discuss: Which ones are clean? Which ones hurt the environment?\n   - Have students vote on or discuss which energy source they like best and why\n   - Create a simple bar graph or show of hands comparing student preferences\n   - Connects to **K-ESS3-3** (reducing human impact on the environment)\n\n3. **Build a Wind Turbine Farm (Hands-on project):**\n   - Students create turbines from various materials and arrange them in a classroom \"wind farm\" display\n   - Set up a \"wind corner\" with a small fan and have students test which location is best for turbines (closest to the fan spins fastest)\n   - Photograph the farm and create a tour guide: *\"Welcome to Our Wind Farm! We have 5 turbines making energy!\"*\n   - Connects to **K-ESS3-1** (understanding how places meet our needs)\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
