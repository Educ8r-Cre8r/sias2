ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about winter weather and snowfall using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the snowy courtyard scene\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector where all students can see it clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you see falling from the sky in this picture?\" (White, puffy things = snowflakes)\n   - \"How do you think it feels outside in this photo? Is it warm or cold?\" (Cold, freezing)\n   - \"What season do you think this is? How can you tell?\" (Winter, because of the snow and bare trees)\n   - \"What do you notice the snow is landing on?\" (The brick building, the ground, the plants, objects in the courtyard)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what happens to all this snow after it falls. Does it stay on the ground? Where does it go?\" Record student predictions on chart paper without judgment.\n\n4. **Personal connection:** \"Have you ever seen snow? What did you observe?\" Allow 3-4 students to share brief experiences.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become snow detectives! We'll learn how scientists observe and record snow to understand winter weather patterns.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate snowfall through observation, data collection, and hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small containers (clear plastic cups or shallow trays) — one per pair\n- Rulers or measuring sticks marked with simple inch/centimeter lines\n- Student observation sheets (printed template with space for drawings and checkboxes)\n- Pencils and colored pencils\n- **If actual snow is not available:** Crushed ice in a shallow tray, water droppers, access to freezer, or a video clip of active snowfall (2-3 minutes) for observation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A — Real Snow (if available):**\n\n1. **Partner students in pairs.** Give each pair a clear container.\n\n2. **Directions for students:**\n   - \"Go outside with your teacher to a safe, designated spot (away from busy pathways).\"\n   - \"Set your container on a flat surface where snow can fall into it naturally.\"\n   - \"Observe the snow for 5 minutes. Don't touch it yet—just watch and notice.\"\n   - \"Come back inside and look at your container of fresh snow.\"\n   - \"Use your ruler to measure how deep the snow is in your container. Record the number on your sheet.\"\n   - \"Draw what the snowflakes look like. Are they big or tiny? Do they stick together?\"\n   - \"Use words to describe how the snow looks and feels (cold, wet, fluffy, heavy, light).\"\n   - \"Put your container in a warm spot (windowsill, near a heater—not too hot). Predict what will happen over the next hour. Will the snow stay the same or change?\"\n\n3. **Recording:** Students complete the **Snow Observation Sheet** (see template below).\n\n**Option B — No Real Snow Available:**\n\n1. **Model snowfall indoors:** Fill a shallow tray with crushed ice. Use this as a model for fresh snow.\n\n2. **Directions for students:**\n   - \"This crushed ice represents fresh snowflakes that just fell.\"\n   - \"Observe the ice pieces. Measure the depth with your ruler. Record it.\"\n   - \"Draw what you see. Describe the texture (bumpy, smooth, cold, hard).\"\n   - \"Predict: If we leave this ice in a warm room, what will happen?\"\n   - \"Observe every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. Measure again. Record any changes.\"\n\n**Option C — Video Observation:**\n\nIf neither option is feasible, show a 3-minute video clip of active snowfall (search \"real snowfall time-lapse\" on YouTube or use a stock video). Students observe and record observations on their sheet, using the same prompts.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice about the size of the snowflakes?\" \"Is the snow getting deeper or shallower?\" \"What do you think is happening?\"*\n- Do **not** tell students what snow is or provide definitions yet.\n- Encourage precise observation and recording without judgment.\n- Help students measure accurately if they struggle with rulers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Completed observation sheets with measurements, drawings, and written descriptions\n- Visual evidence that students can observe precipitation and record data\n- Predictions about what happens to snow over time (should show emerging understanding that it melts in warm conditions)\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and weather science concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Colored markers\n- Photograph from Engage phase (displayed again)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 4-5 student pairs to share one observation they recorded (measurement, drawing, or description).\n   - Create a class list on chart paper: \"What We Observed About Snow.\"\n   - Example list might include: *cold, white, falling, piled up, stuck to buildings, melting in warm room, individual pieces, heavy when packed*\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   - Use each term in a sentence, point to the photograph, and connect to student observations.\n\n   **Vocabulary with Student-Friendly Definitions:**\n\n   | Term | Definition |\n   |------|-----------|\n   | **Precipitation** | Water that falls from clouds to Earth in different forms—like rain, snow, sleet, or hail. (Point to snow in photograph: \"This snow is precipitation.\") |\n   | **Snowfall** | Precipitation that falls as frozen water crystals (snowflakes) when it's very cold. (Show students the snowflakes they observed on their sheets.) |\n   | **Season** | A time of year with its own typical weather. Winter is the season when snow usually falls in cold places. (Ask: \"What season was it in our photograph?\") |\n   | **Weather** | What it's like outside right now—is it cold, warm, rainy, snowy, windy, or cloudy? (Point to the snow and cold visible in the photo.) |\n   | **Observation** | Careful looking and noticing details using your eyes and senses. (Compliment: \"You were all observers when you measured and drew the snow!\") |\n\n3. **Make connections (3 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again. \"Look back at this snowy courtyard. All those white flakes are snowfall—a type of precipitation. It fell during winter when the temperature was very cold.\"\n   - Refer to student observations: \"You measured precipitation just like real weather scientists do. Your data helps us understand winter weather.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Can you point to the precipitation in this photo?\" (Students point to snow.)\n   - Ask: \"What season do you think this photo was taken in? Why?\" (Winter, because there's snow.)\n   - Ask: \"If we measured that snow with a ruler, what would we be recording?\" (Data about precipitation / snowfall)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students use the term \"precipitation\" correctly to describe snow\n- Students understand that snowfall is winter weather in cold places\n- Students recognize that observation and measurement are part of how scientists study weather\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by predicting and comparing seasonal weather patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **Weather Pattern Chart template** (prepared in advance — see below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Chart paper\n- Photographs or illustrations of other seasons (spring rain, summer heat, fall leaves) — optional but helpful\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the real-world context:**\n   - \"Scientists observe weather in different seasons so they can predict what to expect. If you know it will snow in winter, you can plan ahead and wear warm clothes!\"\n\n2. **Create a class seasonal weather comparison chart:**\n   - Draw a simple 4-column chart on the board titled: **\"Weather in Four Seasons\"**\n   \n   | Season | Typical Precipitation | Temperature | What We Wear |\n   |--------|----------------------|-------------|--------------|\n   | **Winter** | Snow (or rain in some places) | Very cold | Coat, hat, boots |\n   | **Spring** | Rain | Cool, warming up | Jacket, umbrella |\n   | **Summer** | Little or no rain | Very hot | T-shirt, shorts |\n   | **Fall** | Rain | Cool | Sweater |\n\n3. **Student task (small groups or pairs):**\n   - Assign each group a season (or student chooses).\n   - Students draw the typical precipitation and weather for their season on their own \"Season Card.\"\n   - Groups share: \"In [season], the precipitation is usually ____. The weather is ____. We observe ____.\"\n\n4. **Connection to the photograph:**\n   - Show the snowy courtyard photo again: \"This is winter precipitation. If we took a photo of this same place in summer, what would be different?\" (No snow, green plants, people not wearing coats, etc.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Guide students to notice patterns (winter = cold, snow; summer = hot, little rain; etc.).\n- Ask: \"What precipitation do you see in winter?\" Expect answers like snow, freezing rain, etc.\n- Use student responses to build the chart collaboratively; don't pre-fill all answers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Season cards showing understanding of seasonal weather patterns\n- Verbal explanations connecting observation to prediction (e.g., \"In winter we expect snow because it's cold\")\n- Recognition that different seasons have different typical weather\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of precipitation, snowfall, and seasonal weather patterns.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n\n- Observation of student responses during Explore (accuracy of measurements, thoughtfulness of descriptions)\n- Quality of contributions during group share-out in Explain phase\n- Accuracy of seasonal weather comparisons in Elaborate phase\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with a slip of paper or use a digital form. Students answer 2-3 questions:\n\n1. **\"Look at this picture of snow falling. What is precipitation? (Use the word precipitation in your answer.)\"**\n   - *Expected answer: Precipitation is water that falls from the sky. Snow is one kind of precipitation.*\n   - *Acceptable for developing level: Rain and snow come from the sky.*\n\n2. **\"In what season does snow usually fall? Why?\"**\n   - *Expected answer: Winter. Snow falls in winter because it's very cold.*\n   - *Acceptable for developing level: Winter, because it's cold.*\n\n3. **\"If you were a weather scientist, what would you measure during snowfall?\"** (multiple choice or open-ended)\n   - A) How deep the snow is\n   - B) How cold the temperature is\n   - C) How long it snows\n   - D) All of the above\n   - *Expected answer: D (or students name multiple measurements)*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- **Proficient:** Student accurately uses the term \"precipitation,\" explains that snow falls in winter when it's cold, and describes at least two measurements a scientist might make.\n- **Developing:** Student understands snow is something that falls in winter but may not use precise vocabulary; can name one type of measurement.\n- **Beginning:** Student identifies snow as winter weather but needs support connecting observations to seasonal patterns or measurement.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Exit tickets show understanding of precipitation as a key component of winter weather\n- Students can explain a connection between cold temperatures and snowfall\n- Students demonstrate ability to record and think about weather data\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified observation sheet:** Provide a worksheet with images to circle rather than blank spaces to write. Example: \"Circle what you see: ☐ snowflakes ☐ raindrops. Circle the size: ☐ tiny ☐ medium ☐ big.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary anchor chart:** Keep a visual chart with pictures of each vocabulary term posted throughout the lesson. Students can reference images of \"precipitation,\" \"season,\" \"temperature,\" etc.\n\n3. **Peer pairing:** Pair struggling students with confident peers during Explore and Elaborate. Assign the confident student as the \"recorder\" so the struggling student can focus on observation.\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Use a yes/no or picture-matching format instead of open-ended questions. Example: \"Does snow fall in summer? Yes or No. Show me with your thumbs.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Quantitative comparison:** Ask advanced students to compare snowfall data across multiple days or locations. \"If 2 inches fell in our yard and 5 inches fell across town, where was the snowfall heavier? By how much?\" (Involves subtraction and reasoning.)\n\n2. **Climate research:** Challenge students to research a place that never gets snow (e.g., Hawaii, the desert). \"What kind of precipitation falls there instead? When does it fall? How is their weather different from ours?\" Students can present findings to the class.\n\n3. **Prediction and verification:** Have students predict snowfall amounts before a winter storm, then measure actual snowfall. Compare predictions to real data. \"Was your prediction close? Why or why not?\" (Introduces scientific reasoning and the role of prediction in science.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Create a Weather Journal:** Students keep a simple daily weather log for one week, drawing or writing about precipitation each day. At the end of the week, they look for patterns. \"Did we have precipitation every day? On which days? What kind?\" This extends 3-ESS2-1 (representing data over time).\n\n2. **Virtual Tour of Different Climates:** Use Google Earth or a virtual tour website to \"visit\" a snowy location (e.g., Canada, northern Japan) and a tropical location (e.g., Hawaii, Australia). Students compare and describe the climates. \"Why does one place have snow and the other doesn't?\" Connects to 3-ESS2-2 (climates in different regions).\n\n3. **Design a Snow Gear Challenge:** \"Imagine you're moving to a place with lots of winter snow. Design or draw the gear and clothes you would need. Why did you choose each item?\" This connects to real-world applications of weather knowledge and thinking about how humans adapt to seasonal precipitation (relates to 3-ESS3-1 if extended to discuss hazard preparation).\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Timing flexibility:** If your school has limited access to real snow, the crushed ice or video observation options work equally well for meeting the standards and learning objectives.\n- **Safety:** If students go outside to collect snow, designate a safe area away from traffic and ensure proper supervision.\n- **Follow-up:** This lesson pairs beautifully with a unit on the water cycle later in the year (where students learn where snow comes from and where it goes).\n- **Connection to prior knowledge:** Students may have observed rain in other seasons. Use that as a bridge: \"Rain and snow are both precipitation—both are water falling from the sky. The difference is temperature!\"",
