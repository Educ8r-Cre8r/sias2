Observe and describe clouds and weather in the sky using simple descriptive words (fluffy, white, blue, puffy).\n2. Explain that clouds are made of water that comes from Earth and floats up into the sky.\n3. Identify ways that weather (like wind) affects building structures and human activities.\n4. Ask simple questions about how weather helps or stops people from doing outdoor work.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring the photograph and building wonder about clouds and construction.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (or large digital display) of the construction crane with cumulus clouds\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: a real construction crane toy or model to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or in large format where all students can see it clearly. Ask students to sit in a circle facing the image.\n\n2. **Introduce with wonder:** Say, \"Look at this amazing picture! I see something very tall that people built, and I see something fluffy floating in the sky. What do YOU see?\"\n\n3. **Ask these discussion questions one at a time, allowing 30 seconds of think time and several student responses:**\n   - \"What is that tall metal thing? Have you ever seen something like that?\"\n   - \"What are those white puffy things in the sky? What do we call them?\"\n   - \"Why do you think someone needs that big machine when those clouds are nearby? Do you think the weather matters?\"\n   - \"Have you ever felt wind pushing you? What happens on windy days?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** Say, \"I wonder... if a big wind blew really hard, what might happen to the clouds? What might happen to that tall crane?\" Write student predictions on chart paper without correcting them.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's become cloud scientists and builders! We're going to explore clouds and wind to understand how weather changes things.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how clouds form and how wind affects structures through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small clear plastic cups or clear containers (one per pair of students)\n- Warm water (pre-filled by teacher before lesson—about 1 inch per cup)\n- Ice cubes\n- Small plastic bags (optional: for cold item)\n- Straws (one per student)\n- Tall block towers or stacking cups (pre-built by teacher or students)\n- Battery-powered fans (one per 2-3 students) OR hand fans made from paper\n- Chart paper for recording observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Making Clouds (12–13 minutes)**\n\n1. Pair students and give each pair a clear cup with warm water.\n\n2. **Demonstrate first:** In front of the class, place an ice cube on top of a warm cup of water. Slowly, a thin mist will form above the water.\n\n3. **Student investigation:** Have each pair place an ice cube on top of their warm water cup and observe for 60–90 seconds. Ask: \"What do you see appearing above the water? Does it look like a cloud?\"\n\n4. **Record observations:** Have students draw what they see on a small paper or point to the photograph and say, \"That's like the clouds up there!\"\n\n5. **Explain the observation (brief—save details for Explain phase):** Say, \"The warm water is going up, up, up into the air. When it touches the cold ice, it stops and turns into a tiny cloud—just like real clouds!\"\n\n**Part B: Wind Affects Structures (10–12 minutes)**\n\n1. Show students the pre-built block towers or stacked cups.\n\n2. **Ask:** \"What do you think will happen if wind blows on this tower?\"\n\n3. **Divide the class into small groups.** Each group gets a tower and a fan (or hand fan).\n\n4. **Investigation:** Students gently turn on the fan (or wave the hand fan) near the tower. Observe what happens.\n\n5. **Guided questions:**\n   - \"Did the tower move? Did it fall down?\"\n   - \"What made it move?\" (Wind!)\n   - \"Do you think wind can affect that tall crane in the picture too?\"\n\n6. **Record:** Have students draw or point to show what happened to the tower.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate between groups, asking open-ended questions: \"What happened when the wind came? Can you make the wind stronger? What happens then?\"\n- Do NOT give answers; let students discover through observation.\n- Gently redirect students to observe closely rather than just playing with materials.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students observe that warm water creates a misty \"cloud\" when it touches cold air.\n- Students see that wind can push or knock down towers, connecting to how wind affects the crane.\n- Students begin to link the photograph to their discoveries.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to Earth and Space Science concepts using the photograph as reference.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (still displayed)\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary written in large print\n- Picture cards or simple drawings of: evaporation, condensation, clouds, wind, weather\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students back to the circle with the photograph visible.**\n\n2. **Share observations from Explore:** Ask, \"What did we discover? Who saw a cloud in their cup? Who saw the wind move the tower?\" Record responses on chart paper.\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary with pictures and actions** (use Kindergarten-friendly explanations):\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n\n   - **Cloud:** A big, fluffy bunch of tiny water drops floating in the sky. (Point to the photograph; have students puff out their cheeks like a cloud.)\n   \n   - **Water Vapor:** Invisible water in the air that came from the ground, oceans, and lakes. (Use your hand to show it going \"up, up, up\" into the air invisibly.)\n   \n   - **Evaporation:** When water from Earth gets warm and floats up into the air, turning into something we can't see. (Point to your cup experiment and trace a path upward with your finger.)\n   \n   - **Condensation:** When water vapor touches something cold and turns into tiny drops we CAN see—like the fog on our cup. (Point to the misty water in the cups; wipe a finger on the cup to show the water.)\n   \n   - **Wind:** Moving air that can push things and change. (Wave your hand; point to the blown-over towers; point to the photograph and imagine wind moving the crane.)\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:** \n   - \"Those beautiful white clouds we see? They started as water way down on Earth. The sun warmed it up, and it floated way, way up. When it got cold, it became a cloud—just like in our cup!\"\n   - \"That tall crane? People use it to build buildings. But when the wind blows, it's hard to work. The weather affects when people can work.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your hands: Can you make a cloud shape? Can you show how wind moves? Can you point to water evaporating in our picture?\"\n   - \"Where do you think the water in clouds comes from?\" (Oceans, lakes, rivers, plants, ground.)\n   - \"What might happen if there's really strong wind at that construction site?\" (They might stop working; the crane might sway; things could get dangerous.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students use new vocabulary to describe clouds, water movement, and wind.\n- Students can point to elements in the photograph and name them correctly.\n- Students understand that weather affects human activities like construction.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by investigating how weather patterns change and considering real-world weather impacts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper titled \"Our Weather Today\"\n- Markers in multiple colors\n- Optional: weather observation worksheet with simple pictures (sunny, cloudy, rainy, windy)\n- Photographs or drawings of construction sites, farms, parks, beaches\n- Large window or outdoor access for real weather observation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Real-World Weather Observation (Recommended)**\n\n1. **Take students to a window or outdoors** (weather permitting) to observe actual clouds and sky conditions.\n\n2. **Ask guiding questions:**\n   - \"What clouds do YOU see? Are they fluffy like in the picture? Are they different?\"\n   - \"Is there wind today? Can you feel it? Can you see it moving things?\"\n   - \"Do you think the construction workers are working outside today? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Record observations on \"Our Weather Today\" chart** using drawings and words. Add the date so students can see weather changes over time.\n\n4. **Compare to the photograph:** \"Is our sky the same as the picture? What's different? What's the same?\"\n\n**Option B: Weather Affects Jobs (If outdoor observation is not possible)**\n\n1. **Show pictures of people working outside:** construction workers, farmers, mail carriers, kids playing at the park.\n\n2. **Hold up each picture and discuss:**\n   - \"What is this person doing?\"\n   - \"Do you think they can work if it's raining? Snowy? Very windy?\"\n   - \"What kind of weather is good for their work?\"\n\n3. **Have students act out scenarios:** \"Everyone be a construction worker. Now I'm going to be the wind—how do you move? Now it's raining—what do you do?\" (This adds kinesthetic learning.)\n\n4. **Create a class chart:** \"Jobs We Do Outside\" and draw what weather is best for each job.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Facilitate observation without leading to \"correct\" answers.\n- Encourage students to think about cause and effect: \"If it's very windy, what happens?\"\n- Ask follow-up questions to deepen thinking: \"Why might weather stop someone from working?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students recognize that weather patterns vary and change.\n- Students connect weather to real-world human activities (work, play, construction).\n- Students use observation and reasoning to answer questions about weather impacts.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of clouds, weather, and how weather affects human activities.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Listen to student responses during discussions; note who uses new vocabulary correctly.\n- Observe hands-on activities; note who demonstrates understanding that wind affects structures and that water creates clouds.\n- Ask individual students to point to and name elements in the photograph.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment** (Choose ONE):\n\n**Option A: Picture Sort (Best for most Kindergarteners)**\n- Show 4 pictures: a cloud, wind blowing something, water/puddle, sun.\n- Ask: \"Point to the cloud. Point to what makes wind. Point to water. Point to what warms water.\"\n- Success criterion: Student correctly identifies at least 3 of 4 pictures.\n\n**Option B: Think-Pair-Share Question**\n- Ask: \"Where does a cloud come from? Show me with your hands or tell me.\"\n- Listen for responses that include: water, sun, evaporation, going up in the air.\n- Success criterion: Student explains that water goes up (evaporates) and becomes a cloud.\n\n**Option C: Simple Drawing**\n- Provide a blank sky scene with a construction crane outline.\n- Ask: \"Draw a cloud in the sky. Draw wind. Draw what wind might do to the crane.\"\n- Success criterion: Student draws recognizable cloud and shows wind effect (arrow, movement, etc.).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that clouds are made of water.\n- Students can describe wind and its effects.\n- Students recognize that weather impacts human work and construction.\n- Students use 2–3 new vocabulary words correctly in context.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support for Struggling Learners:\n\n1. **Sentence Starters:** Provide phrase frames for discussions: \"I see a ___. The cloud is ___. The wind ___.\" Students fill in one word at a time.\n\n2. **Paired Exploration:** Always pair struggling learners with strong language models during hands-on activities; they can observe and follow along.\n\n3. **Simplified Vocabulary Focus:** Focus on just two terms (cloud, wind) rather than all five. Use consistent gestures with each word (fluffy hands for cloud, wave for wind) so students have visual anchors.\n\n### Challenge for Advanced Learners:\n\n1. **Extended Observation Prediction:** Challenge students to predict: \"If we leave our cups of water in the sun, what will happen? Where does the cloud go?\" Have them hypothesize about water going back down (rain) or disappearing (returning to air).\n\n2. **Weather Journal:** Have advanced students create a simple 3-day weather observation chart, drawing clouds each day and noting if they're the same or different.\n\n3. **Connect to Seasons:** Ask, \"Do you think we see the same clouds in summer and winter? Why?\" Encourage students to think about temperature and evaporation across seasons.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cloud and Weather Observation Center:** Set up a permanent window observation station with a chart for the month. Students record daily clouds using drawings and a word bank (fluffy, white, gray, puffy, wispy). Over time, students observe weather patterns.\n\n2. **Build a Model Weather Station:** Create a simple outdoor area with a rain gauge, windsock, and thermometer. Have students check the weather each morning, record it, and discuss: \"Is this good construction weather? Is this good play weather?\"\n\n3. **Read-Aloud Connection:** Share books like *The Cloud Book* by Tomie dePaola or *Come On, Rain!* by Karen Hesse, then discuss the clouds and weather in the stories. Have students draw their own weather scenes with people and structures affected by weather.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- This lesson works best on a day when there are visible clouds. If the sky is completely clear, the photograph becomes even more valuable as a reference point.\n- The cloud-in-a-cup experiment is reliable and engaging; test it before class if possible.\n- Kindergarteners are concrete thinkers, so hands-on, observable activities are essential. Keep explanations brief and tied directly to what they can see.\n- Weather observations build over time. Return to this topic throughout the year to help students recognize patterns.",
