ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about soil and Earth's layers using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (or displayed on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a large printout. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds and think about what they notice.\n\n2. **Facilitate a whole-group discussion** using these guiding questions (write student responses on chart paper):\n   - **\"What do you see in this picture? Describe the different colors and textures you notice.\"** (Students should observe green plants at top, dark soil, lighter tan/brown layers, darker bottom layer.)\n   - **\"Why do you think the soil has different colors? Do you think all the layers are the same?\"** (Activate prior knowledge about soil being different in different places.)\n   - **\"What do you notice about the plants? Why are they growing at the top of the soil and not deeper down?\"** (Connect roots to soil structure.)\n   - **\"If I told you these different layers took a very long time to form, what might have changed the rocks and dirt over time?\"** (Introduce the idea of slow, ongoing processes.)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what's hiding underground right below where we're standing. I wonder why soil looks different at different depths. What do *you* wonder about?\" Have students turn to a partner and share one wonder, then record 3-4 student wonderings on a \"Wonder Wall\" chart to revisit at lesson's end.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become soil detectives and dig deeper—literally!—to understand what soil really is and how those layers form.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate soil composition and layering through hands-on observation and a soil separation activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Clear plastic cup or jar (at least 16 oz)\n- Soil sample collected from schoolyard (enough to fill cup halfway)\n- Water\n- Spoon or stirring stick\n- Paper towel or newspaper (for mess containment)\n- Ruler\n- Observation sheet (template provided below)\n- Magnifying glass (1 per group, optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (written on board or printed on handout):**\n\n1. **Observe the raw soil sample** before mixing. Use your magnifying glass if available. In your notebook, draw what you see and describe the color, texture, and any objects you notice (rocks, plant pieces, insects, etc.).\n\n2. **Fill your cup about halfway** with the soil sample. Add water slowly while stirring gently until the mixture becomes soupy (add water until the cup is about three-quarters full).\n\n3. **Stir the mixture vigorously** for 30 seconds, then **set the cup down gently on a flat surface** without disturbing it. Do NOT move it again.\n\n4. **Predict:** Before waiting, draw in your notebook what you think will happen to the soil and water mixture. Will everything stay mixed, or will different things settle to the bottom?\n\n5. **Wait and observe.** Check your cup every 2-3 minutes for the next 10-15 minutes. Each time you observe, record in your notebook:\n   - How many distinct layers do you see forming?\n   - What colors are the layers?\n   - Which materials settled first (bottom) and which stayed on top or floating?\n   - Are any plant materials floating or suspended?\n\n6. **Measure and record** the height of each layer using a ruler. Estimate what percentage of the total mixture each layer takes up.\n\n7. **Illustration:** In your notebook, create a labeled diagram of your settled soil layers. Label what you think each layer contains (e.g., \"rocks and sand,\" \"clay,\" \"lighter materials\").\n\n**How This Connects to the Photograph:**\nStudents will see that their soil naturally separates into layers similar to the layers visible in the cross-section photograph—demonstrating that soil is not uniform but is made of different materials that settle based on weight and density.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups and ask probing questions without giving answers: *\"What do you think is settling first? Why might that happen?\" \"How is your soil sample similar to the layers in the photograph we saw?\"*\n- Encourage precise observation: \"Use your ruler. Be specific about the colors you see.\"\n- Manage timing so groups finish by the end of the explore phase.\n- Take photos of student soil separation results for use in the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe distinct soil layers forming in their cups\n- Students recognize that soil contains multiple materials (rocks, sand, clay, organic matter, water)\n- Students begin to understand that different materials have different weights and settle at different rates\n- Students create drawings/diagrams showing layered structure\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect students' observations to how soil forms through weathering, erosion, and biological processes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Photographs of student soil experiments (from Explore phase)\n- Printed copies of the vocabulary definitions (one per student or displayed on screen)\n- The original soil cross-section photograph\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their observations and diagrams. Display photos of their settled soil samples.\n   - Ask the class: *\"Why do all of our soil samples have layers? What made this happen?\"*\n   - Guide them to recognize that heavier materials sink, lighter materials float.\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Instruction (10-12 minutes):**\n\n   Display the original soil photograph again. Point to and identify the distinct layers:\n   \n   - **\"This photograph shows a real soil profile from nature—the same thing we just created in our cups! But in nature, these layers took much longer to form. Let me tell you how.\"**\n   \n   - **\"Soil starts with rock. Over many, many years, rocks are broken apart by weathering. Water gets into cracks. Temperature changes. Plant roots push into rock. These forces slowly break big rocks into tiny pieces called sediment.\"**\n   \n   - **\"Wind and water move this sediment—eroding it downhill. When water slows down, the heaviest sediment (sand and rocks) drops first. Lighter sediment (clay) settles on top of that. Over time, layers build up, and living things move into those layers.\"**\n   \n   - **\"At the very top of the soil, we see plants growing. That's because the top layer has lots of decayed plants and animals mixed in—we call that organic matter. It makes the soil dark and rich. That's where roots grow!\"**\n\n3. **Vocabulary Introduction (3-4 minutes):**\n\n   Write and define these terms clearly on chart paper. Use the photograph to point to examples:\n\n   - **Weathering:** The slow breaking apart of rocks into smaller pieces by water, wind, ice, temperature changes, and plant roots.\n   - **Erosion:** The movement of soil and sediment from one place to another by water, wind, gravity, or ice.\n   - **Soil Profile:** A vertical cross-section showing all the different layers of soil from the surface down.\n   - **Organic Matter:** Dead plants, animals, and their remains mixed into soil. This makes soil dark and helps plants grow.\n   - **Sediment:** Tiny pieces of broken-down rock moved and deposited by water or wind.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: *\"Turn to a partner: Which would weather faster—one large rock or the same rock broken into smaller pieces? Why?\"*\n   - Listen for responses showing understanding that more surface area = faster weathering.\n   - Ask: *\"Looking at the photograph, where do you see evidence of erosion? What do the different colors tell us?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define weathering and erosion in their own words\n- Students understand that soil forms slowly from broken-down rock\n- Students recognize layers in soil and can identify the role of organic matter\n- Students connect their soil separation activity to natural soil formation\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding to a new real-world scenario and deepen learning about how plants and humans affect soil and erosion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper (2-3 sheets) divided into columns\n- Markers\n- Photographs or drawings showing: bare hillside, hillside with plants, eroded streambank, healthy vegetated streambank, construction site, reforested area\n- Soil samples in clear containers (optional: one disturbed, one undisturbed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Analysis (Choose one approach based on class level):**\n\n**Option A: Erosion Prevention Brainstorm**\n1. Present this scenario: *\"Heavy rain falls on a bare hillside with no plants, and on a hillside covered with grass and trees. Which hillside will have more erosion? Why?\"*\n2. Have students turn and talk to predict, then facilitate a brief whole-class discussion connecting to what they learned: Plants hold soil together with their roots, slowing water flow and preventing erosion.\n3. Create a two-column chart titled \"**What Causes Erosion?**\" and \"**What Slows Erosion?**\" with student input.\n4. Introduce the concept: *\"Vegetation—plants, trees, and grasses—act like a blanket protecting soil from being washed away. When we remove plants for construction or farming, the soil is more vulnerable to erosion.\"*\n5. Ask: *\"How might we protect soil from erosion? What could people do?\"* Record solutions (plant trees, build barriers, terraces, etc.). Connect this to 4-ESS2-1 (observing effects of vegetation on erosion).\n\n**Option B: Comparing Disturbed and Undisturbed Soil**\n1. If possible, show two soil samples side by side: one freshly dug and loose, one from undisturbed ground (more compacted, with plant root structures intact).\n2. Ask: *\"Which soil will erode faster if it rains? Why?\"* Students should reason that loose soil has no root structure to hold it together.\n3. Explain: *\"When soil is disturbed—by construction, by heavy machinery, or by removing plants—it becomes more vulnerable to erosion. This is why we need to be careful about how we use land.\"*\n4. Real-world connection: *\"Next time you see a construction site, look for practices that protect soil—like fiber matting, terraced slopes, or barriers. These are designed to slow erosion.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion without leading to one \"correct\" answer—accept varied reasoning as long as students cite evidence from the lesson.\n- Use questioning to push thinking: *\"How is this like/different from what happened in your soil cup?\"*\n- Make the connection explicit: erosion is related to weathering and soil formation, but happens much faster when vegetation is removed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students explain the role of vegetation in preventing erosion\n- Students apply understanding to real-world contexts (construction, farming, reforestation)\n- Students recognize that human activities can speed up or slow down natural Earth processes\n- Students begin to think about solutions to reduce erosion impacts\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of soil formation, weathering, erosion, and the role of living things in soil stability.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklist:** As students work in the Explore phase, use this checklist:\n  - ☐ Student describes soil layers accurately\n  - ☐ Student makes predictions before observing\n  - ☐ Student uses ruler to measure and records data\n  - ☐ Student asks questions about why layers form\n  \n- **Turn-and-Talk Checks:** Pause at key moments (end of Explore, during Explain) and have students explain one concept to a partner. Listen for vocabulary use and understanding.\n\n**Exit Ticket (End of Lesson 1 or Lesson 2):**\nProvide each student with a half-sheet exit ticket. Read questions aloud; students respond in writing or draw:\n\n1. **\"Draw and label the layers you saw in your soil cup. What was in each layer?\"**\n2. **\"What is weathering? Give one example of how rocks get broken into soil.\"**\n3. **\"How do plants help prevent erosion? Use a complete sentence.\"**\n4. **\"One thing I learned about soil today is... (Finish this sentence.)\"**\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Students accurately describe 2-3 distinct layers in soil and identify components (rocks, sand, clay, organic matter)\n- ✓ Students explain weathering as a process that breaks down rocks slowly\n- ✓ Students identify plants/roots as a factor that affects soil stability and prevents erosion\n- ✓ Students demonstrate understanding that soil forms over long periods through multiple processes\n- ✓ Students use appropriate vocabulary (weathering, erosion, organic matter, sediment) in context\n\n**Summative Assessment Option:**\nIf time allows at the end of Lesson 2, have students complete a **Soil Profile Diagram** where they:\n- Draw a vertical cross-section of soil with at least 3 labeled layers\n- Label each layer with what it contains and note processes that created it (weathering, erosion, organic matter accumulation)\n- Add a legend showing: rocks, sand, clay, organic matter, plant roots\n- Write a 2-3 sentence caption explaining how the soil formed\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Objectives:**\n- Review exit tickets and diagrams for evidence that students can identify soil composition, explain weathering, and describe erosion prevention.\n- If 80% of students score \"proficient\" on the exit ticket, the learning objectives have been met.\n- Students who cannot yet explain weathering or identify soil layers should participate in small-group review during the next science block (see Differentiation/Support below).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for students needing additional scaffolding):\n\n1. **Pre-Label Diagram:** Provide students with a partially labeled soil profile diagram during the Explain phase. They only need to write in definitions or characteristics rather than creating a diagram from scratch.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames for Exit Ticket:** Offer sentence starters:\n   - \"Weathering is when _____.\"\n   - \"Plants help soil by _____.\"\n   - \"In my soil cup, I saw _____ layers because _____.\"\n\n3. **Peer Partnerships:** Pair students who struggled with observation during Explore with a peer who recorded thorough data. Provide a \"talk script\": *\"Tell your partner: What did you observe? What did you record?\"* This leverages peer explanation for reinforcement.\n\n4. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use shorter definitions and repeat key terms multiple times with concrete examples:\n   - \"Weathering = rocks breaking into smaller pieces\" (show before/after photos of rocks)\n   - \"Erosion = soil and rocks moving from one place to another\" (show a water stream moving soil)\n\n5. **Small-Group Review:** Pull a small group after the lesson for a 10-minute soil profile review using actual soil samples, focusing only on layers and basic weathering.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Investigate Weathering Rates:** Have students design a mini-experiment: *\"Which weathers faster—chalk or a limestone rock? How could you test this?\"* They could place chalk pieces in water, observe them daily for a week, measure how much dissolves, and graph results. Connect to 4-ESS2-1 (measuring evidence of weathering).\n\n2. **Analyze Rock Types in Soil:** Provide students with a magnifying glass and a soil sample. Challenge them to identify and classify the types of rocks/minerals present (granite, mica, quartz, etc.). Have them research which rocks weather fastest and hypothesize which ones will dominate the soil over time.\n\n3. **Model Long-Term Erosion:** Challenge: *\"Design a model that shows how a hillside with plants erodes differently than one without plants when water runs over it.\"* Provide materials (soil, sand, containers, water, plants/plant roots). They should create a testable setup, run water over both, measure/observe erosion, and present findings.\n\n4. **Research Real Soil Data:** Provide students with soil profile diagrams from different regions (forest, desert, prairie). Ask them to compare and contrast the layers, hypothesize about the climate and weathering processes in each region, and explain what the colors and depths tell them about weathering and erosion rates.\n\n5. **Connect to Fossil Layers:** Introduce the connection to 4-ESS1-1: *\"Soil layers can preserve fossils. If a soil layer has a fossil in it, what does that tell you about the age of that layer compared to layers above and below it?\"* Have them sketch a soil profile with fossils at different depths and explain the sequence of events.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n**For Early Finishers or Follow-Up Lessons:**\n\n1. **Soil pH and Plant Growth Investigation:**\n   Students test the acidity of soil samples using pH test strips and research how pH affects plant growth. They could plant seeds in soils of different pH levels and track which grow best over 2-3 weeks. This extends understanding of soil composition and its role in supporting life.\n\n2. **Local Soil Survey:**\n   Take students on a school-ground soil investigation. Collect soil samples from 3-4 different locations (vegetated area, bare patch, near a stream, under trees). Compare color, texture, and composition. Create a map of the school grounds showing soil types. Discuss: *\"Why are soils different in different places? What weathering or erosion processes are happening here?\"*\n\n3. **Erosion Prevention Design Challenge:**\n   Present a scenario: *\"A construction company is building on a steep hillside. They need to prevent erosion during and after construction. Design a solution using classroom materials (cardboard tubes, fabric, sand, gravel, plant seeds, etc.). Test your design with water running down an inclined tray. Does it prevent erosion?\"* Students present prototypes and explain how their design applies the concepts of vegetation, barriers, and sediment trapping.\n\n4. **Soil Composition Worksheet:**\n   Provide a more detailed worksheet where students analyze photographs of different soil profiles from various ecosystems (tropical rainforest, desert, prairie, arctic tundra). They identify layers, predict what weathering/erosion processes created each, and explain how climate affects soil formation.\n\n5. **\"Soil Journey\" Story:**\n   Have students write or illustrate a narrative story from the perspective of a rock: *\"I was a large granite boulder, and here's what happened to me over 1,000 years...\"* The story should trace the rock through weathering, erosion, becoming soil, supporting plant growth, etc. This creative assignment reinforces the sequence of soil formation processes.\n\n6. **Guest Speaker or Video:**\n   Invite a local soil scientist, geologist, or environmental engineer to discuss real-world soil conservation. Alternatively, watch an age-appropriate video showing time-lapse weathering or erosion processes in nature (recommended length: 5-7 minutes). Follow with a discussion: *\"What surprised you? How is this like/different from what we did in class?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Logistics\n\n- **Soil Sample Collection:** Collect soil samples from your school grounds the day before the lesson. Use a garden spade to dig a deep hole and extract a profile that includes different layers. Store in a bucket with a tight lid. If you want to show the natural profile, photograph it before disturbing it, or cut an exposed bank area for display.\n\n- **Timing Flexibility:** If you have only one class period, run a condensed version: Engage + Explore (combined, 20 min) → Explain (10 min) → Quick Exit Ticket (5 min). Complete Elaborate and formal evaluation in Lesson 2.\n\n- **Safety:** Remind students to wash hands thoroughly after handling soil. Use gardening gloves if students have cuts or sensitive skin. Keep paper towels accessible to manage spills.\n\n- **Accountability:** Require students to complete observation sheets during Explore; collect these as formative assessment evidence.\n\n- **Visual Aids:** Create a word wall with soil vocabulary and a photo of the original soil profile photograph so students can reference it throughout the lesson.\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly addresses NGSS 4-ESS2-1 (observing weathering and erosion) and 4-ESS1-1 (identifying patterns in rock layers) while keeping students engaged through a simple but powerful hands-on activity that mirrors real soil formation.**",
