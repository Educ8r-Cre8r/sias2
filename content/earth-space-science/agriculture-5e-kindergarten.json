ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by exploring a photograph of farm machinery and soil.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph (at least 18\" × 24\") or projected image on a screen/smartboard\n- Chart paper and markers (for recording student observations)\n- Pointer or stick (optional, for directing attention)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph prominently.** Show the image to students and give them 30 seconds of silent looking time. Say: \"Look very carefully. What do you see? What do you notice?\"\n\n2. **Facilitate a \"notice and wonder\" discussion** using these specific questions:\n   - \"What is this big green machine? Have you ever seen something like this before?\" *(Students may say \"tractor\" or \"truck\"; accept all responses.)*\n   - \"What is the machine doing to the ground? Can you point to where the soil looks different?\" *(Guide them to see the darker, dug-up areas.)*\n   - \"Why do you think someone would use this big machine to move dirt around?\" *(Listen for responses about farming, digging, making it ready for something.)*\n   - \"If you were a tiny ant living in that soil, what would you notice about your home?\" *(Encourage them to think about change and impact.)*\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** Say: \"I wonder... what happens to the soil when this big machine moves over it? I wonder... why would a farmer want to use this machine? Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Record student observations and wonderings on chart paper** so students see their ideas are valued. Highlight any student mentions of soil, machines, changes, or farming.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become scientists and explorers. We're going to use our own hands to discover what happens to soil when we move it around, just like that big machine does.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate soil properties and how soil can be shaped and moved through hands-on manipulation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large plastic tub or dishpan (one per 3-4 students, or 4-5 tubs for whole class rotation)\n- Soil or potting soil (enough to fill tubs 2-3 inches deep; approximately 10-15 cups per tub)\n- Small toy tractors or toy trucks (1-2 per tub; alternatives: wooden blocks, toy shovels)\n- Toy shovels, spoons, or craft sticks (2-3 per tub)\n- Spray bottle with water (one per tub)\n- Aluminum foil or plastic wrap (to create simple landforms)\n- Observation sheets with simple picture prompts (see below)\n- Towels for cleanup\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"First, look at the soil in your tub. Feel it gently (just with your fingertips). Is it hard or soft? Wet or dry? Draw or tell what you notice.\" *(Teachers can help students record by drawing or marking boxes on an observation sheet.)*\n\n2. \"Now, use the toy tractor (or truck) to push the soil around. What happens? Does the soil move? Does it pile up? Draw what you see.\"\n\n3. \"Use your shovel or stick to dig into the soil. Make a small hole or path. What does the soil feel like when you dig? Does it crumble or stick together?\"\n\n4. \"Now, spray a little water on the soil. Wait 10 seconds. How does the wet soil feel different? Does it move differently when the tractor pushes it? Try again and observe.\"\n\n5. \"Create a small hill or valley in your soil. Pretend this is a farm. Where would you plant seeds? Where would water go? Show your partner.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- **Circulate** between stations, observing student actions without immediately answering questions.\n- **Ask guiding questions** instead of giving answers: \"What do you notice? What happened when you added water? What would happen if we made it even wetter?\"\n- **Document observations** with photos or notes of student discoveries.\n- **Encourage persistence:** If a student says \"I can't,\" ask: \"What could you try next?\"\n- **Avoid correcting** incorrect predictions; they will be addressed in the Explain phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that soil can be moved and shaped.\n- Students notice that water changes how soil behaves (it becomes clumpier or muddier).\n- Students make connections between the toy vehicle and the big machine in the photo.\n- Students create simple landforms or paths and begin thinking about where things (seeds, water, animals) would go.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and scientific concepts after exploration; make connections to the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and simple illustrations\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Photograph of a farm with crops (optional, to show the \"why\")\n- Picture cards: soil, tractor/machine, erosion, farmland (simple, labeled drawings)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a circle.** Ask: \"What did you discover about soil? Who wants to share what happened when your tractor pushed the dirt?\"\n\n2. **Record key discoveries on chart paper** as students share. Affirm their observations: \"Yes! The soil does move! The water does change how it feels!\"\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary** using the chart and simple definitions (point to pictures as you speak):\n\n   - **Soil:** The brown material on the ground that plants need to grow. It's made of tiny pieces of rock, dead plants, and other things from nature.\n   - **Machine/Tractor:** A big tool that humans use to do hard work. The tractor in the photo helps farmers get the land ready for planting.\n   - **Change the Land:** When humans move soil around, dig, or build things, we are changing the land to meet our needs—like growing food for our families.\n   - **Farmland:** Land where farmers grow plants and food that people eat.\n   - **Weather:** Sun, rain, wind, and clouds. Weather changes how soil looks and feels.\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the large tractor: \"This big green machine is like the toy tractors you just played with—but MUCH bigger!\"\n   - Point to the turned soil: \"See the dark brown parts? That's soil that the machine moved. The farmers did this so they could plant seeds for food.\"\n   - Point to the field: \"This whole area is farmland. When we change the land like this, we need to think about what happens to animals, plants, bugs, and water.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Who can show me with their hands how the tractor moves the soil?\" *(Students mime pushing motions.)*\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think farmers use big machines? What do they need?\" *(Expected answer: to grow food, to prepare soil.)*\n   - Ask: \"What is soil? What is it made of?\" *(Guide them to say: parts of rocks, dead plants, dirt from nature.)*\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (Posted on Chart):**\n| Word | Kid-Friendly Definition |\n|------|------------------------|\n| **Soil** | Brown dirt that helps plants grow |\n| **Machine/Tractor** | A big tool that helps people do hard work |\n| **Change the Land** | When people move, dig, or build on the ground to meet their needs |\n| **Farmland** | Land where people grow food |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify soil as an important natural material.\n- Students understand that humans use machines to change the land for farming.\n- Students begin to recognize that changing the land has effects (on animals, water, plants).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to a new scenario and think about caring for the land.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photographs showing different ways humans affect land (building, farming, road construction, gardening)\n- Chart paper titled \"Ways We Help or Hurt the Land\"\n- Markers and colored pencils\n- Large paper or small whiteboards for student drawing responses\n- Optional: Picture books such as *The Lorax* (excerpt) or *Where the Wild Things Are* (brief adaptation focusing on environment)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce a scenario:** \"Farmers grow food we eat—apples, corn, carrots. To do this, they use machines to change the land. But we need to think: What happens to the little bugs in the soil? What happens to the worms? The birds? The water?\"\n\n2. **Show 2-3 picture scenarios** (one at a time) such as:\n   - A farmer preparing soil for planting (the tractor photo again)\n   - A family planting a garden in their backyard\n   - A road being built through a field\n   \n   Ask: \"Is this helping the land or hurting the land? Why? What could we do to help?\"\n\n3. **Brainstorm together: \"What can we do to take care of the land?\"** Record student ideas on chart paper. Examples might include:\n   - \"Plant new trees after we cut some down.\"\n   - \"Don't pour yucky things on the soil.\"\n   - \"Leave places for animals to live.\"\n   - \"Use water carefully.\"\n   - \"Plant gardens to help bees and butterflies.\"\n\n4. **Drawing Activity:** Give each student a piece of paper divided into two sections:\n   - **Left side:** Draw a picture of how humans change the land (you can provide a simple outline of a tractor or digger).\n   - **Right side:** Draw one idea for how to help take care of the land (plant a tree, build a home for animals, water plants carefully, etc.).\n\n5. **Gallery Walk:** Post student drawings around the room. Have students silently walk and look at each other's ideas. (This is age-appropriate for K, as they see others' thinking without pressure to present.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- **Facilitate the brainstorm** by validating all ideas and gently guiding toward Earth-care concepts.\n- **Model thinking aloud:** \"I notice that when soil is moved, water can wash it away. One idea to help is to plant grass or trees so the soil stays in place.\"\n- **Scaffold drawing** by providing word cards or offering to label student drawings.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply the concept that humans affect the land.\n- Students generate at least one idea for protecting or caring for the land.\n- Students recognize that our choices matter for plants, animals, soil, and water.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of concepts and learning objectives.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Did students manipulate soil and observe changes? Did they notice water effects? Did they apply concepts to toy scenarios?\n- **Listen to student talk:** Do they use words like \"soil,\" \"tractor,\" \"change,\" \"grow\"? Do they connect the toy activity to the real photograph?\n- **Check responses during Explain:** Can students point to soil in the photo? Can they explain why farmers use machines?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes):**\n\nUse **one or more** of these assessment strategies appropriate for Kindergarten:\n\n**Option A: Picture-Based Questions (Show image, student points or says answer)**\n1. \"Point to the soil in this picture.\" *(Success: Student points to the dark, turned earth.)*\n2. \"What is the green machine doing?\" *(Success: Student says \"moving dirt,\" \"digging,\" or similar.)*\n3. \"Why do farmers use big machines like this?\" *(Success: Student says \"to grow food,\" \"to plant,\" or \"to help with the farm.)*\n\n**Option B: Drawing + Dictation**\n- Prompt: \"Draw the tractor and the soil. Tell me one thing the tractor does to the land.\"\n- Teacher or aide writes down student's response verbatim.\n- Success: Student draws recognizable tractor/soil and verbally explains that the machine moves or changes the soil.\n\n**Option C: Acting It Out**\n- Prompt: \"Show me with your body what the tractor does to the soil. Now, show me one way we can help take care of the land.\"\n- Success: Student mimes pushing/moving (tractor action) and then performs a care action (planting, watering, etc.).\n\n**Option D: Simple Checklist (Teacher observation)**\n\n| Behavior/Understanding | Yes | Somewhat | Not Yet |\n|------------------------|-----|----------|---------|\n| Student observed soil and noticed it can change | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |\n| Student connected toy activity to real photograph | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |\n| Student used vocabulary: soil, tractor, farmland, or change | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |\n| Student explained that machines help humans grow food | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |\n| Student proposed one way to care for the land | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Developing:** Student can identify soil and notice one change when manipulating it; responds to prompts with teacher support.\n- **Proficient:** Student independently observes soil properties, explains that tractors move soil for farming, and suggests one land-care idea.\n- **Advanced:** Student makes connections between the photo and hands-on activity, uses multiple vocabulary words, and describes multiple impacts of changing the land.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will meet Learning Objectives 1-2 (observe changes, explain human use of machines).\n- Many students will meet Objectives 3-4 (recognize impact and propose care solutions), though some may need teacher scaffolding.\n- Students will retain vocabulary: soil, tractor, farmland, machine.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Soil Investigation:** Provide pre-moistened soil so students experience the water-changed texture immediately. Reduce the number of materials and tools in the tub (just a tractor and one spoon). Offer a simplified observation sheet with only two prompts: \"What does soil feel like?\" and \"What did the tractor do?\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:** Use consistent, simple words throughout (e.g., always say \"dirt\" or \"soil\" in the same way; pair every new word with a picture). Before the full lesson, show the picture book and photo to the student individually and pre-teach two key words (soil, tractor) using sensory approaches (let them touch soil, show them a toy tractor).\n\n3. **Adult Support During Explore:** Assign a classroom aide or peer buddy to sit with this student during the Explore phase. The buddy can model using the tractor, ask guided questions, and help document observations through drawing or simple statements.\n\n#### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Questioning in Explore:** Ask: \"What would happen if it rained a lot on this prepared soil? Where would the water go? How would the tractor work differently in very wet soil versus dry soil?\" Encourage these students to predict and test (spray water in varying amounts).\n\n2. **Extended Elaborate Activity:** Provide a larger soil tub and multiple materials (rocks, seeds, twigs) to build a small-scale farm model. Ask: \"Design a farm. Where will the seeds go? Where will water go? Where could animals live? Why did you place things that way?\"\n\n3. **Writing/Communication:** Instead of just drawing, challenge advanced students to dictate or write (with teacher support) a simple explanation: \"I think we should help the land by ________ because ________.\" Encourage complete thoughts.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n**Extension 1: \"Farmer for a Day\" – Classroom Gardening**\nSet up a small class garden (even in a tray indoors). Let students prepare soil, plant seeds, water, and observe growth over 2-3 weeks. Connect back to the photograph: \"Just like the farmer in the picture prepared soil for big crops, we're preparing soil for our seeds. What does our soil need to help plants grow?\" This extends ESS3-1 (relationship between needs and environments) and adds life cycle observation.\n\n**Extension 2: \"Machines in Our Community\" – Photo Walk**\nIf possible, take students on a community walk (park, construction site from a distance, garden area) to spot real machines or people changing the land. Take photos or draw. Upon return, create a class poster: \"How Machines Help Our Community.\" Students match photos of machines to the types of work (moving soil, building, digging). This reinforces observation skills and real-world connection to K-ESS2-2.\n\n**Extension 3: \"Soil Scientists\" – Soil Exploration Kit**\nCreate a take-home \"Soil Explorer Box\" with a sealed container of local soil, a magnifying glass, a card with observation prompts (\"What colors do you see? What textures?\"), and a simple data sheet. Family members help the student observe and sketch. Students bring findings back to share, extending vocabulary and family engagement while addressing K-ESS3-1 (how humans and environments are connected).\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Tips for Success\n\n1. **Prepare materials in advance:** Pre-fill soil tubs and set up stations before the lesson to maximize active time.\n2. **Use consistent language:** Say \"soil\" and \"tractor\" the same way each time; use the same pointing gestures to the photograph.\n3. **Emphasize hands-on discovery:** Resist the urge to explain everything upfront; let students' manipulations and questions drive the learning.\n4. **Document with photos:** Take pictures of students in the Explore phase to show families and create a visual record of learning.\n5. **Read aloud a related picture book** (such as *Click, Clack, Moo* or a simple farm book) as a follow-up on Day 2 to reinforce vocabulary in a different context.\n6. **Connect to lunch:** Talk about where food comes from during snack time. \"We are eating an apple. A farmer used machines like the tractor in our photo to prepare soil. Then they planted seeds, and an apple tree grew!\"\n\n---\n\n## Answer Key / Expected Responses\n\n**Engage Phase \"Wonder\" Responses:**\n- \"I see a big green truck/tractor.\"\n- \"It's pushing dirt around.\"\n- \"The soil is darker where the machine went.\"\n- \"A farmer uses it to make the dirt ready for planting.\"\n\n**Explore Phase Discoveries:**\n- \"The soil is soft and can move.\"\n- \"Water makes it muddy/stickier.\"\n- \"The toy tractor pushes the dirt into a pile.\"\n- \"The soil feels different when it's wet.\"\n\n**Explain Phase Vocabulary Use:**\n- Students point to or identify soil, farmland, tractor.\n- Students explain: \"The tractor moves soil. Farmers use it to grow food.\"\n\n**Elaborate Phase \"Help the Land\" Ideas:**\n- \"Plant trees.\"\n- \"Don't put bad things in the soil.\"\n- \"Give water to plants.\"\n- \"Leave homes for bugs.\"\n\n---\n\nThis lesson is designed to be highly engaging and hands-on while firmly grounded in the NGSS K-ESS standards. Students leave with a concrete understanding that soil is a valuable natural resource, that humans use machines to change the land, and that we all have a role in caring for Earth.",
