Observe and describe weather conditions visible in a photograph, including fog, mist, and morning light.\n2. Recognize that weather changes throughout the day and discuss what they observe.\n3. Explain in simple terms how water in the air creates mist or fog.\n4. Ask questions about why weather changes and how it affects living things.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the mysterious mist in the photograph and activate prior knowledge about weather.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the dawn photograph\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or print copies (one per pair if possible). Show it without explanation and let students look quietly for 10–15 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What looks interesting or different?\"\n   - \"What is that white fluffy stuff covering the ground and the air? Have you ever seen something like that?\"\n   - \"Why do you think it's so misty and cloudy? What could make the air look like that?\"\n   - \"Do you think this picture was taken in the morning, afternoon, or evening? How do you know?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder what that mist is made of and where it came from. What do you think? Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper without correcting—these become the basis for the Explore phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great wondering! Let's do an experiment to see if we can make our own mist and figure out how it happens!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate water condensation through a hands-on experiment that mirrors the mist formation process shown in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic cups or small jars (1 per pair of students)\n- Warm water (teacher-prepared; safe temperature for kids)\n- Ice cubes\n- Paper towels\n- Small mirrors or reflective surfaces (aluminum foil works)\n- Observation worksheets with simple drawings (provided by teacher)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Pour warm water into your cup about halfway full.\" (Teacher pours for safety.)\n\n2. \"Predict: What will happen if we put ice on top? Draw or tell a partner what you think.\"\n\n3. \"Place 3–4 ice cubes in a small plastic bag and set it on top of your cup.\"\n\n4. \"Watch carefully! What happens inside the cup? Do you see water droplets forming on the inside of the cup? That's mist!\"\n\n5. \"Feel the outside of the cup. Is it cold or warm? Talk about why you think that.\"\n\n6. \"Draw or describe what you see on your observation sheet. Where did the water droplets come from?\"\n\n**Connection to photograph:** \"The mist you see in the picture happens the same way—warm air from the ground meets cold air in the morning sky, and the water in the air turns into tiny droplets we can see!\"\n\n**What students should record:**\n- Simple drawings of their cup before and after the ice\n- A description or picture of where the mist/water droplets appear\n- One word or phrase to describe how it felt/looked (e.g., \"wet,\" \"cold,\" \"magical\")\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What's happening to the water?\" \"Where does the mist come from?\" \"Is the inside of the cup wet or dry?\"\n- Avoid stating the answer; guide observation instead.\n- Help students with recording without writing for them.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that water can become a visible mist when warm and cold meet.\n- Students observe tiny water droplets forming.\n- Students make a connection between their experiment and the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts that explain what students observed.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Real objects: a cup of water, ice, a hand mirror or aluminum foil to show condensation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students** and review their observations from the Explore phase. Ask 2–3 students to share their drawings or describe what happened.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** using simple definitions and examples:\n\n   | Term | Kindergarten-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|-----------------------------------|\n   | **Weather** | What the air and sky are like—is it sunny, rainy, foggy, cold, or warm? |\n   | **Mist/Fog** | Tiny water droplets floating in the air that we can see. It looks cloudy and wet. |\n   | **Water vapor** | Water that floats in the air that we cannot usually see (very tiny). |\n   | **Condensation** | When invisible water in the air becomes visible droplets (like what happened in your cup). |\n   | **Temperature** | How hot or cold something is. |\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph:**\n   - \"Remember the misty picture from this morning? That happened just like your experiment!\"\n   - \"In the picture, the ground was warm and the morning air was cool. The warm water from the ground and plants went up into the cold air.\"\n   - \"When warm and cold met, the invisible water in the air became visible droplets—mist!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your hands—is mist made of water or air?\" (Students can show small or large gestures.)\n   - \"Thumbs up if you've ever seen mist or fog. Thumbs sideways if you're not sure.\"\n   - \"Can you make mist at home? Tell your partner how.\"\n\n**Vocabulary display:**\nPost the vocabulary chart with pictures in the classroom for reference throughout the unit.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word \"mist\" or \"fog\" correctly to describe what they observed.\n- Students understand that mist is made of tiny water droplets.\n- Students can explain that warm and cold air meeting creates mist.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by predicting and observing weather patterns and connecting mist to real-world scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Outdoor observation area or window with a view\n- Weather observation chart (simple pictures of sunny, cloudy, rainy, foggy)\n- Drawing paper and crayons\n- Camera or student-drawn pictures\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Weather Observation Walk (if weather permits)**\n\n1. \"Let's go outside and look for mist or fog in our schoolyard. Do you see it? Where is it?\"\n\n2. \"What time of day is it? Is the air warm or cool? Is the ground wet?\"\n\n3. \"How does the mist make you feel? Does it change what we can see?\"\n\n4. Return to the classroom and have students draw or describe: \"I saw mist/fog when...\"\n\n**Option B: Weather Pattern Prediction (classroom-based)**\n\n1. Show students the photograph again. Ask: \"What happens to the mist as the sun comes up and warms the day?\"\n\n2. \"Draw two pictures: one showing the misty morning (like our photo) and one showing what the field might look like at lunchtime when it's warmer.\"\n\n3. Students share predictions and explanations.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate outdoor exploration safely, ensuring students stay together.\n- Ask guiding questions: \"When do you think you see mist—morning, afternoon, or both?\" \"Why does mist disappear?\"\n- Validate predictions without correcting; save deeper explanations for future lessons.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize mist in their local environment or in photographs.\n- Students predict how weather changes throughout the day.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that temperature affects mist formation.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of weather observations and mist formation.\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- Observation notes during the Explore phase: Can students describe water droplets forming?\n- Questions during Explain: Do students use \"mist\" or \"fog\" correctly?\n- Responses during Elaborate: Can students identify mist in a new context?\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple one-page assessment with three sections:\n\n1. **Picture Recognition:**\n   - Show a picture of misty conditions. Ask: \"Is this mist/fog? Circle YES or NO. How do you know?\"\n\n2. **Observation:**\n   - \"Draw what happened in your cup when you put ice on top. What did you see?\"\n\n3. **Application:**\n   - \"When might you see mist outside? Draw or tell about a time.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student can identify mist or fog in a photograph. ✓\n- Student can describe what happened in the water condensation experiment. ✓\n- Student can relate the experiment to real-world weather. ✓\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify mist in photographs.\n- Most students can describe the water droplet formation with simple words or drawings.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that mist is connected to temperature changes.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"mist\" and \"water droplets\" without introducing \"condensation\" or \"water vapor\" initially. Revisit these terms in later lessons.\n\n2. **Concrete manipulatives:** Pair students with a peer or adult during the Explore phase. Provide a picture guide showing each step of the experiment with photographs rather than just words.\n\n3. **Modified recording:** Allow students to simply point to or circle pictures (wet/dry, cold/warm) instead of drawing or writing. Accept one-word responses.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Extended inquiry:** \"What other things in the classroom get wet or misty when cold? Let's find more examples.\" (Windows, mirrors, metal objects in a cold room.)\n\n2. **Prediction and observation:** \"If we do the experiment twice—once with very cold ice and once with just cool water—what will happen? Which makes more mist? Why?\"\n\n3. **Real-world connection:** \"When might mist be a problem for people? Can you think of a time when you couldn't see well because of fog? What should people do?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Mist Hunt\" at Home:** Send home a simple note asking families to look for mist or fog outside their homes in the early morning or evening. Students draw or describe what they find and bring a picture or description back to class. Create a class book: \"We Found Mist!\"\n\n2. **Daily Weather Chart:** Over two weeks, have students record daily weather observations (including whether they see mist). Mark a calendar with pictures of sunny, cloudy, rainy, and misty days. Discuss: \"When do we see the most mist? Why?\"\n\n3. **Sensory Poetry or Descriptive Writing:** Students dictate or write simple sentences about mist: \"Mist is wet.\" \"Mist is cool.\" \"Mist makes me feel calm.\" Create a class poster with student responses.\n\n4. **Mist and Animals:** \"Animals see mist and fog too. How might it change where they go or what they do? Draw a picture of an animal in the mist.\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** Use warm (not hot) water. Handle ice carefully and ensure students do not touch ice directly for extended periods.\n- **Timing:** This lesson works well in early fall or spring when morning mist is more common. Adjust timing based on your climate.\n- **Prior knowledge:** Students may have experienced fog or mist but not named it. This lesson validates their observations and introduces vocabulary.\n- **Follow-up:** This lesson connects naturally to future lessons on the water cycle, seasons, and weather patterns. Reference the mist experiment throughout the year.",
