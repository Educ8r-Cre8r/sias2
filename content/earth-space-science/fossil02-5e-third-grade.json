Explain that fossils are the preserved remains of plants and animals that lived long ago.\n2. Describe how fossils form and why scientists study them to learn about Earth's history.\n3. Identify fossils as evidence that different organisms lived on Earth in the past.\n4. Create a model fossil to demonstrate how fossils form and are preserved in rock.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about fossils using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed via projector, smartboard, or printed copies)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"I Wonder\" anchor chart (prepared beforehand)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the fossil image on the board and allow 30 seconds of silent observation. Tell students: \"These are real fossils from rocks found underground. A fossil is something left behind from a plant or animal that died a very, very long time ago.\"\n\n2. **Launch Discussion with Guided Questions:**\n   - \"What do you think this spiral shape is? What animal or creature might have made it?\"\n   - \"How do you think this shape got stuck inside the rock?\"\n   - \"Where do you think scientists found these fossils? Have you ever seen rocks with shapes in them?\"\n   - \"Why do you think scientists want to dig up and study fossils?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Invite students to turn to a partner and complete this sentence: \"I wonder how this creature got stuck in the rock...\" or \"I wonder what this animal looked like when it was alive...\" Record student wonderings on the \"I Wonder\" chart to revisit later.\n\n4. **Personal Connection:** Ask, \"Has anyone ever found a rock with something interesting in it? Tell us about it!\" Validate all responses and affirm curiosity.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become fossil scientists! We'll make our own fossils to understand how these amazing time capsules form.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover fossil formation through hands-on modeling.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Air-dry clay or salt dough (prepared ahead: 2 cups flour + 1 cup salt + water)\n- Small objects to create imprints: shells, leaves, twigs, pasta shapes, buttons, toy dinosaurs\n- Paper plates or plastic trays (one per student/pair)\n- Pencils or popsicle sticks\n- Paper towels\n- Water in a small cup (for cleanup)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions (deliver clearly and post on board):**\n\n1. \"Flatten your ball of clay on a paper plate until it is about as thick as your thumb.\" (Model this.)\n2. \"Choose one object from the collection and press it gently into the clay, then pull it straight out.\"\n3. \"Look at the shape left behind. Draw or write the name of your object on the back of your plate.\"\n4. \"Let your fossil imprint dry completely (overnight, or place under a lamp for 1-2 hours).\"\n5. \"Feel the imprint with your fingers. This is what a real fossil feels like!\"\n\n**How It Connects to the Photograph:**\n\"Just like you pressed a shape into clay, millions of years ago, real animals and plants got pressed into soft mud or sand. When that mud turned into rock, it saved the shape forever—just like your clay fossil!\"\n\n**What Students Record/Document:**\n- On their paper plate, write or draw which object made the fossil\n- Observation notes: \"Does the imprint look like the real object? What details can you see?\"\n- Teacher may take photos of imprints before they dry (optional digital portfolio)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and observe without correcting technique\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice about the imprint?\" \"Can you tell what your object was from the shape alone?\"\n- Resist the urge to perfect student work—imperfect imprints teach that fossils can be unclear or incomplete\n- Help students manage materials; facilitate sharing of tools\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each student creates at least one fossil imprint\n- Students observe that clay can capture fine details from objects\n- Students begin to understand that organisms can leave impressions in soft materials\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to real fossil formation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Dried student fossils (from Explore phase)\n- Photograph (still displayed)\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary (pre-written)\n- Picture cards or drawings of different fossils (optional: trilobite, ammonite, fern, dinosaur footprints)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 3-4 volunteers to show their fossil imprints to the class\n   - Ask: \"What object did you use? How did the shape stay in the clay?\"\n   - Connect: \"Your clay model works the same way real fossils form in nature!\"\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Explanation (8-10 minutes):**\n   Use the photograph and student fossils to explain:\n   - \"Long, long ago—millions of years before people lived on Earth—there were plants and animals we've never seen. When they died, sometimes their bodies sank into mud or sand at the bottom of oceans or lakes.\"\n   - \"The weight of more and more layers of mud and sand pressed down and down. After a very long time, all that pressure turned the mud and sand into rock.\"\n   - \"The shape of the plant or animal stayed frozen in the rock—just like your imprint stayed in the clay! Scientists call these frozen shapes fossils.\"\n   - Point to the spiral fossil in the photo: \"This fossil is called an *ammonite*. It was a sea creature with a shell shaped like a spiral. It died millions of years ago, and the ocean buried it. Now we can study it!\"\n\n3. **Vocabulary Introduction (3-5 minutes):**\n   Display and define each term on chart paper. Point to examples in the photograph or student work:\n\n   - **Fossil:** The preserved remains or imprint of a plant or animal from a very long time ago.\n   - **Imprint:** A shape or mark left behind when something presses into a soft material.\n   - **Rock:** A hard, solid material made from minerals that can form over millions of years.\n   - **Preserved:** Kept safe and unchanged so it lasts for a very long time.\n   - **Long ago:** Many, many years in the past—so long that people weren't even alive.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   Ask:\n   - \"What do you call the shape left in your clay?\" (Imprint)\n   - \"How is your clay fossil like a real fossil?\" (Both show the shape of something that was pressed into soft material and hardened.)\n   - \"Why do scientists study fossils?\" (To learn about plants and animals that lived a long, long time ago.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that fossils form when organisms are buried and preserved in rock\n- Students can use the word \"fossil\" and \"imprint\" correctly\n- Students recognize that fossils teach us about the past\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply fossil concepts to a new context and explore real-world significance.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or printouts of 4-5 real fossils (ammonites, trilobites, fern fossils, dinosaur footprints, shark teeth) labeled with simple captions\n- Chart paper divided into two columns: \"What I Can See\" and \"What I Learned\"\n- Student worksheets (optional): \"Detective Fossil\" observation sheet with prompts\n- Fossil replica or cast (if available) to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Fossil Detective Gallery Walk (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Setup:** Post 3-4 pictures of different real fossils around the room, each labeled with the name and type of organism (e.g., \"Ammonite—a sea shell,\" \"Trilobite—a sea creature,\" \"Fern—a plant\").\n\n2. **Student Task:** Students walk to each fossil image and record:\n   - What they observe about the shape\n   - What the organism might have looked like when it was alive\n   - Why they think scientists would want to study this fossil\n\n3. **Whole Group Share:** Gather students and ask volunteers to share one observation. Emphasize: \"These fossils teach us that Earth looked very different millions of years ago. Different creatures lived here then.\"\n\n**Option B: \"Fossil Story\" Creation (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Guided Storytelling:** Show a fossil image and model creating a story:\n   - \"This ammonite was a spiral-shelled sea creature. It lived in an ocean that covered parts of Earth millions of years ago. One day, it died and sank to the bottom. Sand and mud buried it. It turned into rock. Today, scientists find it and learn that this animal existed!\"\n\n2. **Student Activity:** Provide each student with a fossil picture and a story frame:\n   - \"This fossil is a ___. It was a ___ that lived ___. It became a fossil because ___.\"\n   - Students complete the frame in writing or with drawings\n   - Volunteers share stories aloud\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide without giving all answers\n- Ask: \"What else do you think this fossil tells us?\"\n- Affirm correct thinking and gently redirect misunderstandings\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply fossil understanding to new examples\n- Students can explain why studying fossils is important\n- Students see fossils as evidence of Earth's changing life and environment\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossil formation and significance.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe student participation during Engage discussion (Can students make predictions about fossils?)\n- Monitor Explore activity (Does the student understand that the imprint represents an organism?)\n- Listen to Explain share-outs (Can students use vocabulary correctly?)\n- Circulate during Elaborate (Do student observations and stories show conceptual understanding?)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes):**\n\nAdminister at the end of Day 2. Students may respond verbally (to be recorded by teacher), in drawings with labels, or in writing (depending on literacy level):\n\n**Option 1 (Verbal/Drawing):**\nDisplay the original fossil photograph and ask:\n- \"What is this? Show me with your hands how you think this animal looked when it was alive.\"\n- \"How do you think this fossil formed? Tell me the story.\"\n\n**Option 2 (Written Response):**\nProvide a simple prompt:\n- \"Draw and label a fossil. Write one sentence to explain what it is.\"\n- OR: \"Fill in: A fossil is ___, and we study fossils to learn ___.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Hands-On):**\n- Give students a new clay fossil imprint and ask them to explain how it is like a real fossil\n\n**Success Criteria (Students demonstrate understanding when they can...)**\n- ✓ Define a fossil as the preserved remains or imprint of something that lived long ago\n- ✓ Explain that fossils form when organisms are buried in sediment that hardens into rock\n- ✓ Identify fossils as evidence that different plants and animals lived on Earth in the past\n- ✓ Use correct vocabulary (fossil, imprint, preserved, rock)\n- ✓ Apply the concept to a new fossil example\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can define or describe a fossil accurately\n- Most students can explain basic fossil formation\n- Students recognize fossils as teaching tools about the past\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use only 2-3 key terms (fossil, imprint, rock) instead of all five. Provide picture cues alongside words on chart paper.\n\n2. **Guided Explore:** Pre-select objects for students to press into clay (e.g., shells, leaves) rather than allowing free choice. Provide a sentence frame: \"I used a ___ to make my fossil.\"\n\n3. **Paired Learning:** Pair with a stronger peer during Explore and Elaborate phases. Allow more processing time for verbal responses.\n\n4. **Concrete Examples:** Use a fossil replica or model that students can hold and feel throughout the lesson. Revisit the photograph frequently to maintain focus.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Questioning:** Ask: \"What would happen if the layer of rock eroded away? Could we still see the fossil?\" \"Why do you think we find fossils in different places on Earth?\" Encourage predictions about Earth's past geography.\n\n2. **Fossil Research Mini-Project:** Provide picture cards of 3-4 different fossils and ask students to categorize them (sea creatures, plants, land animals) and create a poster: \"Fossils Tell Us Earth's Story.\"\n\n3. **Model Variations:** Challenge students to make multiple fossils using different objects or techniques (e.g., pressing vs. creating a mold and casting). Have them compare results and record observations in a science journal.\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:** Introduce the concept of paleontologists and ask: \"If you were a fossil scientist, what would you want to discover? What fossil would you want to dig up?\" Have them write or draw their answer.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil Dig Simulation (Classroom or Outdoor):**\n   - Bury student-made fossils and purchased fossil replicas in a sandbox or bucket of sand\n   - Provide students with paintbrushes and small tools (popsicle sticks, plastic spoons)\n   - Students carefully \"excavate\" fossils, record location and depth, and create a simple excavation map\n   - Discuss how real paleontologists work carefully to preserve fossils\n\n2. **Timeline of Earth's Life:**\n   - Create a classroom timeline on a hallway or wall showing different fossil organisms (trilobites → fish → dinosaurs → modern animals)\n   - Use large paper or poster board with student-drawn or printed images\n   - Discuss: \"Why are some fossils older than others? What was alive first?\"\n\n3. **Museum Visit or Virtual Tour:**\n   - Visit a local natural history museum to see real fossils, or use a virtual museum tour (e.g., Smithsonian, American Museum of Natural History online)\n   - Provide students with a \"Fossil Hunt Checklist\" of items to find (spiral shell, footprint, leaf, dinosaur bone)\n   - Upon return, students share favorite fossils and create a classroom museum exhibit with their own imprint fossils\n\n4. **Family Fossil Hunt (Take-Home Activity):**\n   - Send home a letter explaining fossils and asking families to:\n     - Look for shells, leaf imprints, or interesting rocks at parks or beaches\n     - Take photos or bring items to school (if safe)\n     - Write a short note about where it was found\n   - Display contributions on a \"Our Community Fossils\" bulletin board\n\n5. **Literature Connection:**\n   - Read aloud a picture book about fossils or paleontologists (e.g., *The Fossil Girl* by Marie Powell, or *Sophie Scott Goes South* by Alison Murray)\n   - Discuss how the story connects to what students learned in the lesson\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Pacing:** If air-dry clay is unavailable, use salt dough (flour, salt, water) made ahead. Allow extra drying time or use a lamp to speed the process.\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wash hands after handling clay and natural materials. Check for allergies if using any food-based materials (salt dough).\n- **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Keep the vocabulary chart visible throughout both days and beyond. Reference it frequently.\n- **Photo Power:** Return to the original photograph multiple times. Its concreteness helps Third Graders anchor abstract concepts about \"long ago.\"\n- **Celebration:** Display all student fossils in the classroom or hallway as a gallery. This validates effort and maintains interest!",
