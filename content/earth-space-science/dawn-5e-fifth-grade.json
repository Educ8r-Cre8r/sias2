ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about fog and water in the atmosphere using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large projection of the photograph (or printed copies, 8.5\" × 11\")\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small bowl of warm water with plastic wrap to observe condensation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board without any context. Ask students to sit quietly for 30 seconds and just *look*.\n\n2. **Ask these 4 specific questions** (allow 1–2 minutes for think-pair-share before whole-group responses):\n   - \"What do you see in the sky in this picture? What is that white, cloudy stuff covering the ground?\"\n   - \"Why might a farmer wake up early to see a field that looks like this?\"\n   - \"If that white stuff is water, where did the water come from? Is it from the river you can see, or did it come from somewhere else?\"\n   - \"What time of day do you think this is, and how can you tell?\"\n\n3. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper. Expect responses like: \"It's fog,\" \"It's like clouds,\" \"It's misty,\" \"The water came from the ground,\" \"It's morning because it's light but not super bright.\"\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"Today we're going to figure out how water from a river or lake can become the fog you see here—and why it happens especially at dawn. What do you predict happens?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an experiment to see if we can create fog right here in our classroom and discover where it really comes from.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the water cycle and condensation through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3–4 students):**\n- 1 clear glass or plastic cup\n- 1 bowl filled with hot water (prepared by teacher beforehand)\n- 1 piece of plastic wrap\n- 1 rubber band\n- Ice cubes (in a small bag or container)\n- Paper towels\n- Student observation sheet (provided below)\n- Colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Teacher Setup (do before class):** Fill bowls with hot water and place one at each station. Have ice ready in bags.\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Take your clear cup and stretch plastic wrap across the top. Secure it tightly with a rubber band so no water vapor can escape.\"\n\n2. \"Place your cup directly over the hot water bowl (your teacher will help you). What do you notice happening? Wait 1 minute and record observations.\"\n\n3. \"Now, carefully place ice cubes on top of the plastic wrap. Watch carefully for the next 2–3 minutes. What's forming on the underside of the plastic wrap? Where is that water coming from?\"\n\n4. \"Lift the plastic wrap slightly and feel the water droplets. Are they cold or warm? Write down your ideas.\"\n\n5. \"In your group, discuss: 'The hot water below turned into an invisible gas. The cold plastic wrap made that gas turn back into water droplets. How is this like what happens in the fog in the photograph?'\"\n\n**Student Observation Sheet:**\n```\n**My Fog Experiment**\n\nWhat I observed when I put the cup over hot water:\n_________________________________________________\n\nWhat happened when I added ice on top:\n_________________________________________________\n\nWhere did the water droplets come from?\n_________________________________________________\n\nHow is this like the fog in the photograph?\n_________________________________________________\n```\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"Where did that water come from? Could it have come from the hot water below?\" \"What does the ice do to the air?\" \"Why does this remind us of the photograph?\"\n- Do **not** explain the water cycle yet—let students discover through observation.\n- Ensure safety with hot water; assist as needed.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that water can become invisible gas (evaporation) and then turn back into liquid droplets (condensation).\n- Students realize fog forms when warm air meets cold conditions.\n- Students begin connecting this to the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and connect student discoveries to Earth systems and the water cycle.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Water Cycle diagram (teacher-created or printed, with blank labels)\n- Vocabulary cards or chart\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Whiteboard/chart paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Call on 2–3 groups to share what they discovered. Ask: \"What surprised you?\"\n   - Draw simple representations of their findings on the board.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary with Definitions (7 minutes):**\n\n   - **Evaporation:** When liquid water heats up and turns into invisible water vapor (a gas) that goes into the air. *\"Like when water disappears from a puddle on a hot day.\"*\n   \n   - **Condensation:** When water vapor in the air cools down and turns back into liquid water droplets that we can see. *\"Like fog, or the water on your bathroom mirror after a hot shower.\"*\n   \n   - **Water Cycle:** The continuous movement of water between Earth's surface (oceans, rivers, lakes, land) and the atmosphere. Water evaporates, condenses, and falls as precipitation. *\"It's like water going on a never-ending trip from Earth to the sky and back again.\"*\n   \n   - **Atmosphere:** The layer of air and gases surrounding Earth. *\"The air we breathe and where clouds and fog live.\"*\n   \n   - **Reservoir:** A place where water is stored on Earth—oceans, lakes, rivers, ice, groundwater. *\"Like a container that holds water.\"*\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the fog and ask: \"Based on what we just learned, where did this fog come from?\"\n   - Guide students to see: The river/water body heated up in early morning sun → water evaporated into the air → the cooler morning air caused condensation → we see fog.\n   - Point out the four Earth systems in the photo:\n     - **Hydrosphere:** The water (river, fog)\n     - **Atmosphere:** The air and fog\n     - **Biosphere:** The crops and trees\n     - **Geosphere:** The soil and land\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"In your own words, explain what evaporation is.\"\n   - \"If you see fog over a river at sunrise, what do you think happened to that water?\"\n   - Show diagram of water cycle with blanks; have students label evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Evaporation** | When water heats up and becomes invisible water vapor (gas) that floats into the air |\n| **Condensation** | When water vapor cools down and turns back into liquid water droplets we can see |\n| **Water Cycle** | The never-ending movement of water between Earth's surface and the atmosphere |\n| **Atmosphere** | The layer of air surrounding Earth where weather happens |\n| **Reservoir** | A place where water is stored on Earth (oceans, lakes, rivers, ice, groundwater) |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define evaporation and condensation accurately.\n- Students can identify the water cycle in the photograph.\n- Students can label a simple water cycle diagram.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a real-world scenario and deepen knowledge about water distribution.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards showing different reservoirs (ocean, lake, river, glacier, groundwater, cloud)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Colored dot stickers or circles\n- Whiteboard or large paper with a simple circle divided into 4 parts\n- Optional: access to tablets/laptops for graphing (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Water Reservoir Classification (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Display the four picture cards around the room: Ocean, Freshwater Lake, Glacier, Groundwater (or draw simple symbols).\n\n2. Explain: \"Not all water on Earth is the same. Some is salty ocean water, and some is fresh water that people can use. Let's figure out where water is stored.\"\n\n3. Give each student 10 colored dot stickers or paper circles.\n\n4. Ask: \"Of all the water on Earth, I want you to predict where most of it is. Place your dots on the reservoir you think has the most water.\"\n\n5. Record predictions on the board. Then reveal the real data:\n   - **Oceans: 97% of Earth's water**\n   - **Ice/Glaciers: ~2%**\n   - **Freshwater (lakes, rivers, groundwater): ~1%**\n\n6. Replace their dots to show the actual distribution. Ask: \"Why do you think so much water is in the ocean? What does this tell us about water we can actually use?\"\n\n**Part B: Application to the Photograph (5 minutes)**\n\n1. Point back to the photograph. Ask: \"The water in this fog and river—where did it originally come from? (Answer: The atmosphere gets water through evaporation from oceans, lakes, and rivers.) Why is this cycle important for the farmer and the crops in this field?\"\n\n2. Guide students to understand: Water cycles continuously, so it comes back to Earth as precipitation, allowing crops to grow.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate without judging predictions.\n- Use real data to build understanding of water scarcity.\n- Ask follow-up questions: \"If 97% of water is salt water, how do people on farms get fresh water for crops?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify different water reservoirs.\n- Students understand that most of Earth's water is not usable by humans.\n- Students recognize the importance of the water cycle for agriculture and life.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of the water cycle, Earth systems, and water distribution.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during the Explore phase—do they recognize where water comes from?\n- Listen to explanations during the Share-Out in Explain phase.\n- Check completeness of vocabulary definitions during Check for Understanding.\n- Review prediction accuracy in the Elaborate activity.\n\n**Summative Assessment – Exit Ticket:**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper with the following prompts (choose format appropriate for your class):\n\n**Option A (Drawing + Writing):**\n```\n1.

What is evaporation?\n   a) When water vapor turns into liquid droplets\n   b) When liquid water turns into invisible water vapor\n   c) When water falls from clouds\n   d) When water sits in a reservoir\n\n2. Fog at sunrise is caused by:\n   a) Rain from the night before\n   b) Water evaporating and then condensing in cool air\n   c) The sun pushing water into the sky\n   d) Cold water rising up\n\n3. In 2–3 sentences, explain why the water cycle is important for a farmer growing crops \n   in a field like the one in the photograph.\n```\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Student demonstrates understanding if they:**\n- Correctly define evaporation or condensation\n- Explain that fog forms when water evaporates and condenses\n- Identify at least 2 Earth systems in the photograph\n- Recognize that water cycles continuously from Earth to atmosphere and back\n- Understand that freshwater is a limited resource\n\n✓ **Proficiency Level:**\n- All 5 criteria met = Advanced/Proficient\n- 4 criteria met = Proficient\n- 3 criteria met = Developing\n- Fewer than 3 = Needs Support (plan reteach)\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Review Exit Tickets within 24 hours.\n- Identify students who struggle with water cycle concepts and plan small-group review before next lesson.\n- Use responses to guide differentiation in future lessons.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Guided Vocabulary Cards:**\n   - Provide illustrated vocabulary cards with pictures (sun evaporating water, condensation on mirror, rain, etc.) paired with words. Allow students to reference these during the exit ticket.\n\n2. **Water Cycle Diagram with Word Bank:**\n   - Instead of drawing from scratch, provide a partially completed water cycle diagram with blanks to fill in. Include a word bank: (evaporation, condensation, precipitation, sun, ocean, clouds).\n\n3. **Buddy System for Explore Phase:**\n   - Pair struggling readers/writers with a strong peer partner during the Explore activity. Have the buddy help record observations while both students observe and discuss.\n\n4. **Sentence Starters for Explanations:**\n   - Provide sentence frames for exit ticket: \"The fog in the photograph came from the ________. It evaporated when ________. It condensed when ________.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research and Report Extension:**\n   - Challenge students to research \"acid rain\" or \"water pollution\" and explain how it affects the water cycle and affects the crops in the photograph. Have them create a poster or short presentation.\n\n2. **Data Analysis with Graphing:**\n   - Provide students with real data on global water distribution (percentages of water in different reservoirs). Have them create a pie chart or bar graph showing freshwater vs. saltwater and different freshwater sources (ice, lakes, groundwater, etc.). Ask: \"Why do you think groundwater is important if we can't see it?\"\n\n3. **Deep-Dive into Hydrologic Cycle:**\n   - Challenge students to create a more detailed water cycle including transpiration (water released by plants), infiltration (water soaking into soil), and runoff (water flowing to rivers). Have them label these on the photograph or create a more complex diagram.\n\n4. **Real-World Connection Project:**\n   - Ask: \"If a river dries up in summer, how would the farmer in this photograph handle it?\" Have students research and present water conservation methods or irrigation techniques.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### 1. **Homemade Water Filter & Purification Lab**\n   **For Home or Follow-Up Lesson:**\n   - Have students create a simple water filter using sand, gravel, and coffee filters to demonstrate that not all water from Earth's reservoirs is immediately drinkable.\n   - Students pour \"dirty\" water (food coloring + water) through layers and observe filtration.\n   - Connection: Links to understanding why freshwater reservoirs matter and how humans process water from the water cycle.\n   - Time: 20–30 minutes\n\n### 2. **Sunrise/Sunset Observation Journal**\n   **For 1–2 Week Follow-Up:**\n   - Have students observe and sketch fog, clouds, or atmospheric conditions at sunrise or sunset (or during morning arrival at school).\n   - Students record temperature, time, visibility, and describe conditions.\n   - After 5–7 observations, they write a short explanation: \"When does fog appear most? Why?\"\n   - Connection: Builds observational skills and deepens understanding of daily atmospheric changes and weather patterns (5-ESS2-1 shadow/appearance patterns).\n   - Time: 5–10 minutes daily for one week, then 15 minutes for analysis\n\n### 3. **Design a Fog-Catching Device**\n   **For Advanced/STEM Extension:**\n   - Challenge students to design a device that could \"catch\" fog water (real or theoretical) to collect drinking water.\n   - Provide materials (mesh, fabric, wire, containers) or have them sketch a design on paper.\n   - Students explain: \"How does your device use what we learned about fog to collect water?\"\n   - Connection: Real-world application in arid regions; combines Earth science with engineering design.\n   - Time: 30–45 minutes (design + explanation)\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson works well as two consecutive 45-minute sessions (Engage + Explore on Day 1; Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2) or as a single 90-minute block.\n- **Photography Connection:** Return to the photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. Students benefit from revisiting it to connect new vocabulary and concepts.\n- **Safety:** Ensure hot water is at a safe temperature; supervise closely during the Explore phase.\n- **Accessibility:** Read aloud all written materials for students with reading challenges; provide visuals and use hand motions when explaining evaporation/condensation.\n- **Next Steps:** This lesson pairs well with a follow-up on precipitation, weather patterns, or ecosystems that depend on freshwater reservoirs.",
