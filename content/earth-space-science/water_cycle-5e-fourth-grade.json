ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about winter weather's effects on plants and begin thinking about weathering and environmental change.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (projected or printed)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Winter photos or short video clip (optional: 2-3 minutes of frost/snow forming)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image of the snow-covered daffodil and surrounding plants on the board. Allow students 30-45 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Spark Curiosity with Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice happening to the plants in this picture? Describe everything you see.\"\n   - \"Why do you think the daffodil flower is still bright yellow even with all that snow and ice on top of it? What might be protecting it?\"\n   - \"How do you think the snow and ice got on these plants? What happens to plants when heavy frost and snow cover them for a long time?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen frost or ice on plants in your neighborhood? What did it look like? Did it change or damage the plant?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \n   \"I wonder what would happen to plants if we could protect them from frost and ice. How could we keep plants safe from winter's harshest effects?\"\n\n4. **Record Predictions:** On chart paper, write down student predictions about what happens to plants in winter and what might protect them. Title it \"Our Winter Predictions.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate how ice and snow affect plants and design solutions to protect them from winter damage.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the effects of freezing water on plant materials and develop solutions through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4-5 fresh plant stems or leaves (celery, ivy, or leafy branches; enough for small groups)\n- Water in cups or spray bottles\n- Freezer access or ice bath with salt (pre-made)\n- Thermometer\n- Magnifying glasses (1 per small group)\n- Protective materials (aluminum foil, plastic wrap, cheesecloth, cardboard, towels)\n- Paper towels for observation and measurement\n- Observation recording sheets (simple diagram with labels)\n- Rulers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Observe Ice Formation and Effects (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into small groups** of 3-4. Assign each group a fresh plant stem or leaf.\n\n2. **Baseline Observation:** Have students sketch their plant and describe its texture, flexibility, and appearance on the recording sheet. Measure the stem flexibility using a simple bend test (bend gently and record whether it bends easily or is stiff).\n\n3. **Apply Water and Freeze:** Spray or dip each plant sample in water. Place samples in a freezer or pre-made ice bath for 8-10 minutes while students observe and sketch the frost forming.\n\n4. **Examine Changes:** Remove samples and use magnifying glasses to observe ice crystals. Students should describe:\n   - How the ice covers the plant\n   - Changes in texture or color\n   - Any bending or drooping\n   - How ice crystals look under magnification\n\n5. **Record:** Sketch the frozen plant and note any changes in flexibility or appearance.\n\n**Part 2: Test Protective Solutions (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce the Problem:** \"Now we know what frost does to plants. How can we protect plants from freezing damage?\"\n\n2. **Design Challenge:** Each group receives 2-3 identical fresh plant samples and a selection of protective materials (foil, plastic wrap, cheesecloth, towels, cardboard). Their task:\n   - Choose ONE material to test as protection\n   - Wrap or cover one plant sample with their chosen material\n   - Leave one plant sample unprotected (control)\n   - Place both in the freezer for 8-10 minutes\n\n3. **Test and Observe:** Remove samples and carefully remove protective covering. Compare:\n   - Which plant has more frost accumulation?\n   - Which material was easiest to remove?\n   - Which plant seems less damaged (more flexibility, less ice damage)?\n   - Which material might work best for protecting a real garden plant?\n\n4. **Record Results:** Have students draw and label both protected and unprotected plants on their observation sheet, noting which solution was more effective.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice? How is this plant different from the unprotected one? What does this tell us about protection?\"\n- Do NOT provide answers; encourage students to make observations and inferences.\n- Ensure safe freezer/ice bath access and proper handling of materials.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students will observe that ice crystals form on plants when water freezes\n- Students will identify that some protective materials reduce frost damage better than others\n- Students will begin to understand that weathering by ice can be minimized with barriers\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to weathering and environmental processes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Photograph of frost-covered plants (original image)\n- Images of weathering damage (optional: cracked sidewalk, frost-heaved ground, broken branches)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to briefly share their observations: \"What happened when you froze your plant? What protected it best?\"\n   - Record key observations on chart paper under headings: \"What We Observed About Frost\" and \"What Protected Plants\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Present each term with a student-friendly definition and an example from their investigation or the photograph:\n\n   - **Weathering:** The process by which rocks, soil, and other materials on Earth's surface are broken down or worn away by water, ice, wind, or other natural forces. *Example: The frost and ice in our picture is breaking down the plant cells and causing damage.*\n   \n   - **Frost:** A thin layer of ice that forms on surfaces when water vapor freezes. *Example: You saw frost crystals on your plant samples in the freezer.*\n   \n   - **Ice Accumulation:** The buildup of ice and snow on surfaces over time. *Example: The daffodil in the picture is covered with accumulated ice and snow.*\n   \n   - **Freeze-Thaw Cycle:** The repeated process of water freezing and thawing (melting) on Earth's surface, which can damage rocks, soil, and plants. *Example: When frost forms and then melts, it can break plant cells.*\n   \n   - **Protection/Weathering Resistance:** Strategies or materials that help protect things from damage caused by natural processes. *Example: The plastic wrap or towel you used protected your plant from frost.*\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Return to the original image. \"This photograph shows weathering by ice and snow. The plant is experiencing frost accumulation. Even though the daffodil is covered in ice, it's still alive because daffodils have adapted to survive winter. But the weight of ice and snow can still damage or break branches.\"\n   - Point out: green leaves still visible, frost crystals, buds and stems under stress, yet the plant persists.\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"In your own words, what is weathering? Can you give me an example from what we did today?\"\n   - Invite 2-3 students to explain weathering and frost using evidence from their observations.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (display on wall for reference):**\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|------|-----------|\n| **Weathering** | The breaking down of rocks and materials by natural forces like water, ice, and wind |\n| **Frost** | A thin layer of ice that forms when water vapor freezes on cold surfaces |\n| **Ice Accumulation** | The buildup of ice and snow on surfaces over time |\n| **Freeze-Thaw Cycle** | Repeated freezing and melting of water, which can break apart rocks and damage plants |\n| **Weathering Resistance** | Features or materials that help protect things from being damaged by natural processes |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that ice and snow cause physical weathering to plants and structures\n- Students can explain how freeze-thaw cycles create damage\n- Students recognize that protection can reduce the effects of weathering\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing real-world solutions to protect plants and structures from winter weathering.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Design challenge worksheet or template\n- Sample materials (from earlier activity) or images of materials\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Real-world scenario cards (see below)\n- Rulers and measuring tools\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present Real-World Scenarios (2 minutes):**\n   Divide class into pairs or small groups and assign each a scenario:\n\n   - **Scenario A:** \"A farmer grows apples in an area that gets heavy frost. His trees are being damaged by ice accumulation. Design a solution to protect his orchard.\"\n   \n   - **Scenario B:** \"A city has concrete sidewalks that crack and break every winter due to freeze-thaw cycles. What solution could reduce this damage?\"\n   \n   - **Scenario C:** \"A gardener wants to grow vegetables year-round in a cold climate. How can they protect their garden from frost and ice damage?\"\n   \n   - **Scenario D:** \"A school playground has a wooden deck that splits and breaks in winter. Design a protection strategy.\"\n\n2. **Design Challenge (10 minutes):**\n   Each group must:\n   - **Identify the Problem:** Describe what weathering damage happens in their scenario\n   - **Propose a Solution:** Design a protection method using materials they tested or new ideas\n   - **Sketch the Solution:** Draw a labeled diagram showing how it works\n   - **Explain Why It Works:** Write or verbally explain how their solution reduces ice/frost weathering damage\n   - **Test for Practicality:** Consider: Is it affordable? Is it easy to use? Could it actually work?\n\n3. **Share and Compare Solutions (8 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to present their solutions\n   - Compare and discuss: Which solutions are most effective? Most practical? Most affordable?\n   - Identify common features of successful protection strategies\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide scenario cards and design templates\n- Ask guiding questions: \"How does your solution reduce ice damage? What could go wrong? How would you improve it?\"\n- Facilitate comparison discussion to highlight trade-offs (cost vs. effectiveness, ease of use vs. protection level)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design practical solutions that reduce weathering impacts\n- Students explain their reasoning using scientific vocabulary\n- Students compare solutions and evaluate trade-offs\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of weathering, ice effects, and protective solutions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation Checklists:** During Explore, observe whether students:\n  - Make detailed observations of frost formation\n  - Test protective materials systematically\n  - Record findings clearly with sketches and descriptions\n  - Use vocabulary accurately (\"frost,\" \"weathering,\" \"protection\")\n\n- **Discussion Checks:** During Explain and Elaborate phases, listen for:\n  - Accurate use of vocabulary in explanations\n  - Ability to connect observations to weathering concepts\n  - Evidence-based reasoning in solution design\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide students with a half-sheet exit ticket with the following questions:\n\n1. **Draw and Label:** Sketch what happens to a plant when frost forms on it. Label the frost, the plant, and any damage you observe.\n\n2. **Explain with Evidence:** \"Describe one way that ice and snow cause weathering to plants. Use a word from our vocabulary list (frost, weathering, freeze-thaw cycle, or ice accumulation) in your answer.\"\n   - *Example answer:* \"Ice accumulation breaks plant branches because the weight of ice pushes them down and the freeze-thaw cycle cracks the plant cells.\"\n\n3. **Design Thinking:** \"If you had to protect a school garden from frost damage next winter, what ONE material or method would you use? Why would it work?\"\n   - *Example answer:* \"I would use plastic wrap to cover delicate plants because it keeps frost from forming directly on the leaves, like we saw in our experiment.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n✓ Student identifies observable effects of frost/ice on plants (weathering signs)  \n✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary term correctly in explanation  \n✓ Student proposes a reasonable protective solution with evidence-based reasoning  \n✓ Student communicates ideas using drawings and words\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets demonstrate understanding of weathering by ice/frost\n- Students apply vocabulary appropriately\n- Solutions show critical thinking about real-world applications\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**SUPPORT (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet:** Provide a structured template with sentence frames:\n   - \"I see frost that looks like ______.\"\n   - \"The protected plant was ______ (better/worse) than the unprotected plant because ______.\"\n   - \"Weathering means ______.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary Support:** Create a picture-word card set for the 5 key vocabulary terms. Students can reference these during all activities and point to the card when using the term.\n\n3. **Paired Investigations:** Pair struggling readers/writers with stronger peers during Explore and Elaborate so they can focus on observation and discussion while partner handles recording.\n\n4. **Exit Ticket Choice:** Offer alternative formats—students may draw their answer instead of writing, or answer verbally to the teacher while drawing.\n\n---\n\n**CHALLENGE (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Quantitative Investigation:** Have students measure frost accumulation over time (every 2 minutes in the freezer) and create a line graph showing how frost thickness increases. Calculate the rate of frost formation.\n\n2. **Extended Research:** Assign students to investigate and report on real-world weathering impacts:\n   - How freeze-thaw cycles damage roads and buildings\n   - Strategies used by cities/farmers to prevent frost damage (road salt, anti-icing agents, frost blankets)\n   - Compare costs and environmental impacts of different solutions\n\n3. **Complex Design Challenge:** Ask advanced students to design a multi-layered protection system and test it against a single-layer method. Which is more effective? Is it worth the extra cost/complexity?\n\n4. **Comparative Analysis:** Have students compare weathering by ice to weathering by other forces (water, wind). Create a Venn diagram or chart showing similarities and differences.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n**1. Seasonal Observation Journal (1-2 weeks)**\nStudents observe plants or structures in their neighborhood throughout winter and document frost/ice damage with sketches and notes. They can photograph the same location weekly and compare weathering progression. This connects to real-world awareness of natural processes.\n\n**2. Freeze-Thaw Weathering Simulation (1 class period)**\nStudents test how freeze-thaw cycles damage materials. Place chalk, salt dough, or plaster in cups with water. Freeze and thaw repeatedly (3-5 cycles). Document how cracks and breaks form. This demonstrates accelerated weathering and connects to rock/landscape weathering.\n\n**3. Community Solution Proposal (1-2 class periods)**\nChallenge students to propose a weathering-reduction solution for a real school or community problem (cracked playground, damaged garden area, etc.). Have them present their solution to the principal or facilities manager, complete with sketches, cost estimates, and evidence from their investigations. This brings authentic purpose to STEM learning.\n\n---\n\n## Reflection Notes for Teachers\n\nThis lesson leverages students' natural curiosity about winter phenomena while building understanding of **weathering as a natural Earth process** (4-ESS2-1). The hands-on experiments make the abstract concept of weathering tangible and observable, and the design challenges (4-ESS3-2) empower students to think like problem-solvers. The photograph of the frost-covered daffodil is powerful because it shows both vulnerability (ice damage) and resilience (the flower still standing), mirroring real-world complexity.\n\nConsider timing: If your area doesn't experience winter, you can simulate freezing conditions using a freezer or ice bath. If you live in a snowy climate, consider outdoor observations of actual frost and ice on real plants—this adds authenticity and engagement.",
