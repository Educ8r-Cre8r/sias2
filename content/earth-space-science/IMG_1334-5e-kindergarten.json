Kindergarteners can observe that soil is brown, has texture, and is where plants and animals live.\n- **Local Habitats and Environments:** The image displays a specific environment (a garden or natural area) with soil, plants, flowers, and an animal. This is a real-world habitat that children can relate to.\n- **Plant and Animal Relationships in Local Environments:** The squirrel is interacting with plants in its environment, showing how animals depend on plants for food (the orange piece appears to be food).\n- **Natural Resources and How Living Things Meet Their Needs:** The photograph illustrates how animals use their local environment (plants, soil, shelter) to survive and gather food.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**Squirrels, Soil, and Seeds: Exploring Our Garden Homes**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 90–120 minutes (can be split into two 45–60 minute sessions)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - K-ESS3-1 (Use a model to represent the relationship between the needs of different plants and animals and the places they live)\n  - K-ESS2-2 (Construct an argument supported by evidence for how plants and animals can change the environment to meet their needs)\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Identify** soil, plants, and animals as parts of a garden habitat.\n2. **Describe** one way a squirrel uses its environment (soil, plants, food) to meet its needs.\n3. **Explain** why plants and soil are important to animals like squirrels in simple terms.\n4. **Model** a simple garden habitat using soil, plants, and other materials.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the squirrel in the garden\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster at student eye level. Say: \"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see? Who is in this picture?\"\n\n2. **Facilitate a brief observation discussion** using these specific questions:\n   - \"What animal do you see? What is it holding?\"\n   - \"What does the ground look like? What color is it?\"\n   - \"Can you see any flowers or plants? Where are they?\"\n   - \"Do you think this squirrel likes living in this place? Why?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge** with a wonder prompt: \"I wonder why squirrels like to live in places with soil and plants. What do you think squirrels need to be happy and healthy?\"\n\n4. **Record student responses** on chart paper (use pictures and words). Validate all responses without correcting.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore what squirrels and other animals need to live, just like the squirrel in this picture!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small shallow containers or trays (1 per pair of students, approximately 8\" × 6\")\n- Potting soil or clean garden soil (pre-gathered)\n- Small plants or seedlings (optional: bean plants, grass seedlings, or small flower seedlings—can be grown 1–2 weeks prior)\n- Seeds (sunflower, bean, or pumpkin seeds work well)\n- Small animal figures or pictures (plastic squirrels, chipmunks, or drawn pictures)\n- Water in spray bottles (1 per pair)\n- Pebbles or small rocks\n- Observation sheets (1 per student—simple picture cards showing: soil, plant, animal, rock)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"You and your partner will make a small garden in your tray, just like the one in our picture.\"\n2. \"First, pour soil into your tray until it covers the bottom about 1 inch deep. What does the soil feel like? Is it wet or dry? Soft or hard?\"\n3. \"Next, gently place your small plant into the soil. Press the soil around it. (If no plants, plant 2–3 seeds in the soil and press them down gently.)\"\n4. \"Now, add some pebbles or rocks around your plant. Why might rocks be in a garden?\"\n5. \"Use the spray bottle to give your plant a little water—not too much!\"\n6. \"Finally, place your animal figure in or near the garden. Where would your squirrel or animal like to rest or find food?\"\n\n**Connection to the Photograph:**\n\"You just made a mini garden like the one where the squirrel in our photo lives! The squirrel needs soil to find food and bugs, plants to eat or climb on, and rocks to hide under.\"\n\n**What Students Should Record/Document:**\n- Have students point to and name the parts of their garden: soil, plant, rocks, animal.\n- Use picture cards: students stick or draw what they included in their habitat on their observation sheet.\n- Optional: Take a photo of each student's garden habitat to display later.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among pairs, asking open-ended questions: \"Why did you put that rock there?\" \"What does your animal need from the soil?\"\n- Encourage sensory exploration: \"Can you describe how the soil feels?\"\n- Avoid telling; instead, ask, \"What do you notice?\" and \"What would happen if...?\"\n- Provide water as needed; supervise to ensure no soil ingestion.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will successfully create a small habitat with soil, a plant or seeds, and an animal representation.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that soil and plants are part of where animals live.\n- Students may spontaneously discuss why soil and plants matter for animals.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms and pictures\n- The original photograph (displayed again)\n- Student-created habitats (from Explore phase)\n- Picture cards of squirrels, soil, plants, and gardens\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3–4 volunteer pairs to show their garden habitat.\n   - For each: \"Tell us one thing your animal needs from this garden.\"\n   - Write responses on chart paper. (E.g., \"Food from plants,\" \"Place to dig in soil,\" \"Rocks to hide under.\")\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8–10 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph and to student habitats as you introduce each term.\n   - **Soil:** \"This brown, crumbly stuff is called soil. Soil is where plants grow and where animals find food and dig.\"\n   - **Habitat:** \"A habitat is a home. It's the place where an animal lives. Our photo shows a garden habitat. What does a squirrel's habitat have in it?\"\n   - **Plants:** \"These green living things are plants. Squirrels eat seeds from plants. Plants need soil to grow.\"\n   - **Animal:** \"A living creature like our squirrel. Animals need food, water, and a safe place to live—their habitat.\"\n   - **Needs:** \"The things a living thing must have to stay healthy and alive: food, water, air, and a home.\"\n\n3. **Make Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Return to the photograph: \"The squirrel in this picture is in a garden habitat. It has soil, plants, and rocks all around. The soil helps plants grow. Plants give the squirrel food. This is how the squirrel's needs are met!\"\n   - Point to student habitats: \"You made habitats just like this. Your animals have what they need!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask individual students: \"Point to the soil in the picture.\" \"Where do you see a plant?\" \"What does the squirrel need?\"\n   - Thumbs up/sideways/down: \"Do animals need homes?\" (Thumbs up = yes.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Soil** | Brown, crumbly stuff under our feet where plants grow and animals dig. |\n| **Habitat** | A home or place where an animal lives and can find food and water. |\n| **Plants** | Living green things that grow from soil and need water and sunlight. |\n| **Animal** | A living creature that moves and needs food and water to stay healthy. |\n| **Needs** | The important things a living thing must have to be healthy: food, water, air, and a home. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify soil, plants, and animals in a habitat.\n- Students understand that animals need habitats to meet their basic needs.\n- Students can use the vocabulary terms with teacher support.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheet of paper or bulletin board space\n- Pictures or drawings of different animals (squirrel, rabbit, bird, earthworm, beetle)\n- Picture cards of habitat features (soil, rock, tree, flower, water, log)\n- Tape or glue sticks\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario:** \"We know squirrels live in gardens with soil and plants. But do ALL animals live in the same habitat? Let's think about different animals.\"\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Show pictures of 3–4 different animals (squirrel, rabbit, bird, earthworm).\n\n2. **Ask for each:** \"Where does this animal live? What does it need?\" (Discuss briefly; accept all ideas.)\n\n3. **Collaborative Habitat Builder (10–12 minutes):**\n   - Divide the class into 3 small groups (or do this as a whole class if time is limited).\n   - Assign each group one animal (e.g., Group 1 = squirrel, Group 2 = earthworm, Group 3 = bird).\n   - Give each group a large paper and habitat picture cards.\n   - **Task:** \"Create a home (habitat) for your animal. Use the pictures to show what your animal needs. Glue or tape the pictures onto your paper.\"\n   - Groups work together; teacher circulates asking: \"Why did you choose that? Does your animal need that?\"\n\n4. **Gallery Walk (3–5 minutes):**\n   - Display the three habitats.\n   - Ask: \"Are these habitats the same or different? Why? What does each animal need?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide sentence starters: \"My animal needs ___.\" \"In my habitat, I see ___.\"\n- Ask probing questions: \"Does an earthworm need a bird house?\" \"Where does soil belong?\"\n- Encourage peer conversation: \"Do you agree with what your friend said?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that different animals have different habitats.\n- Students understand that habitats contain specific features that help animals survive.\n- Students can articulate (with support) why certain features belong in certain habitats.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observe students during Explore:** Do they place plants in soil? Can they identify soil, plants, and animal?\n- **Listen during discussions:** Do students use vocabulary terms? Can they explain why an animal needs its habitat?\n- **Check during Elaborate:** Do students select appropriate habitat features for their assigned animal?\n\n**Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\nUse one of these strategies:\n\n**Option A: Thumbs Check**\nAsk three yes/no questions:\n- \"Do squirrels need soil and plants to live?\" (Thumbs up = yes.)\n- \"Is a habitat an animal's home?\" (Thumbs up = yes.)\n- \"Can animals live without water?\" (Thumbs up = no; sideways = not sure.)\n\n**Option B: Picture Point**\nShow a picture of the original squirrel photograph and ask:\n- \"Point to something the squirrel needs to live.\" (Soil, plant, or rock.)\n- \"Can you tell me why?\" (Teacher listens for vocabulary: needs, habitat, food, soil, home.)\n\n**Option C: One Word Shout-Out**\nHold up the photograph and ask: \"In one word, what does this squirrel need?\" Accept: home, food, soil, plant, habitat. Record responses.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Students can **identify** soil, plants, and animals in a habitat image.\n- ✓ Students can **state** one need of an animal (e.g., \"Squirrels need food\" or \"Squirrels need a home\").\n- ✓ Students can **connect** habitat features to animal needs (e.g., \"Plants give food\").\n- ✓ Students can **create** or describe a simple habitat model with at least two features (soil, plant, animal).\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- During Explore and Elaborate, observe whether students successfully assembled a habitat with soil and plant.\n- During Exit Ticket, listen for use of vocabulary (habitat, soil, needs) and evidence of understanding.\n- Review observation sheets and photos of habitats for evidence of comprehension.\n- If students demonstrate 3 of the 4 success criteria, they have met the objectives.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners):\n\n1. **Pre-Made Habitat Demonstration:**\n   - Before the Explore phase, show a completed mini-habitat and narrate it: \"I put soil here. I planted a seed. I added a rock. Now my squirrel has a home.\"\n   - Let the student touch and observe before creating their own.\n\n2. **Sentence Frame Support:**\n   - Provide sentence strips during discussions: \"This animal needs ___\" or \"In the habitat, I see ___.\"\n   - Student points to or fills in the blank with teacher help.\n\n3. **Peer Pairing:**\n   - Pair a struggling student with a confident communicator during Explore.\n   - Assign the confident student as the \"guide\": \"Show your friend where to put the soil.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners):\n\n1. **Multiple Habitat Comparison:**\n   - Ask: \"Can you make TWO different habitats—one for a squirrel and one for a bird? How are they different? Why?\"\n   - Advanced students predict and justify differences.\n\n2. **\"What If\" Scenarios:**\n   - \"What if there was no soil in this garden? Where would the squirrel go? What would it eat?\"\n   - Encourage problem-solving and reasoning.\n\n3. **Detail Observation and Sketch:**\n   - Provide a hand lens (magnifying glass) to examine the photograph more closely.\n   - Ask: \"Draw what you see in the soil. Are there tiny things living there?\"\n   - Introduce decomposition and soil organisms at a simple level.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seed Planting Journal (1–2 weeks follow-up):**\n   - Students plant a bean seed in soil (in a cup or small pot).\n   - Over 1–2 weeks, observe and draw the seed growing into a plant.\n   - Discuss: \"Why did the plant need soil? What does soil give the plant?\"\n   - Connection: \"This is what happens in the garden where the squirrel lives!\"\n\n2. **\"Animals Around Our School\" Nature Walk:**\n   - Take students on a short walk around the school garden or yard.\n   - Observe real habitats (soil under trees, plants, rocks, insects, birds).\n   - Collect observations: \"Where do you see soil? What plants are growing? What animals live here?\"\n   - Upon return, create a class map or poster: \"Habitats Around Our School.\"\n\n3. **Squirrel Food Scavenger Hunt (Classroom or Sensory Activity):**\n   - Hide pictures or models of squirrel foods (acorns, seeds, nuts, berries) around the classroom or in a sensory bin filled with kinetic sand/soil.\n   - Students hunt for \"food\" and place it in a basket.\n   - Discuss: \"Why do squirrels need to find food? Where do they find it? (In plants and on the ground/soil!)\"\n   - Reinforce: Soil and plants are important because they provide food for animals.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure all soil is clean and untreated. Supervise handwashing after handling soil. Confirm no allergies to plants used.\n- **Prep Work:** Gather or grow small seedlings 1–2 weeks in advance. Pre-portion soil into containers to save time.\n- **Accessibility:** For students with mobility challenges, use adaptive tools (wider grips, raised trays). For English learners, use more visuals and fewer words; pair with fluent peers.\n- **Connection to Seasons:** If doing this in fall, mention: \"Squirrels gather food from plants in fall to prepare for winter. The soil protects seeds and plant roots.\"\n\nThis lesson builds foundational understanding of habitats and animal needs while keeping Kindergarteners engaged through observation, hands-on creation, and discovery. The photograph serves as the anchor throughout, grounding abstract concepts in a tangible, relatable image.",
