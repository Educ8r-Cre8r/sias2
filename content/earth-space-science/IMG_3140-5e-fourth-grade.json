Identify and describe evidence of water erosion and weathering visible in a beach photograph.\n2. Explain how moving water breaks down rocks and moves sediment along a coastline.\n3. Design and conduct a simple investigation demonstrating how water causes erosion.\n4. Compare erosion rates under different conditions and communicate findings using data.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about beaches, erosion, and water's power to change land.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color copy of the photograph (or digital display via projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Let students observe silently for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions to build curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the beach in this picture? What looks different from a beach you may have visited?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the sand and water look darker in some spots? What might those brown patches be?\"\n   - \"See those tall buildings in the far distance? Do you think the beach looks the same today as it did 100 years ago? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"If you came back to this beach in one year, in five years, or in 50 years, what do you think might be different?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"Turn to a partner and make a prediction: Do you think water is strong enough to break apart rocks and move sand? Show me with your hands how that might happen.\" Allow 2–3 partner share-outs.\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper under \"What We Think We Know About Beach Change.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great predictions! Today, we're going to become beach detectives and test whether water is really powerful enough to change our shorelines. Let's explore!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate water's erosive power through direct, hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3–4 students):**\n- Shallow aluminum baking pan or plastic storage container (at least 12\" × 8\")\n- Kinetic sand, wet sand from playground, or mixed sand and small pebbles (½ cup per group)\n- Water in a pitcher or spray bottle\n- Ruler (to measure before and after)\n- Paper towels\n- Student investigation sheet (see below)\n- Camera or phone to photograph results (optional but recommended)\n\n**Activity: \"The Water Erosion Challenge\"**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **Prepare your landscape:** Mound your sand and small pebbles into one corner of the baking pan to create a simple \"beach\" or \"cliff\" landform. Pack it down gently. Use the ruler to measure the height of your mound. Record the measurement on your investigation sheet.\n\n2. **Make a prediction:** Before adding water, draw or write on your sheet: \"I think the water will…\" (e.g., wash away some sand, create a channel, flatten the mound).\n\n3. **Test the water's power:** Slowly pour or spray water from the pitcher/spray bottle toward your sand mound. Observe for 1–2 minutes. Do not disturb the pan with your hands.\n\n4. **Record observations:** Using your ruler again, measure what's left of the mound. Sketch or describe what happened:\n   - Did the sand move? Where did it go?\n   - Did any \"channels\" or grooves form?\n   - Are there any particles in the water now? (Hold it up to the light—is the water clear or cloudy?)\n\n5. **Compare:** Write down the difference between your \"before\" and \"after\" measurements. How much did your landform change?\n\n6. **Clean-up:** Drain water carefully into a sink. Save your pan setup if possible for the Explain phase.\n\n**How this connects to the photograph:** \"The beach in our photo has waves and water flowing constantly, just like the water you poured on your sand. Over weeks, months, and years, all that water movement changes the real beach's shape and size—just like your sand landform changed today.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate with a clipboard, observing student setup and predictions.\n- Ask probing questions: \"What do you notice happening to the sand? Is the water carrying anything with it?\"\n- Resist explaining; instead, redirect: \"What do you observe? What might that mean?\"\n- Ensure groups record measurements and sketches, even if rough.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe sand displacement and water cloudiness.\n- Students record measurable changes (height reduction, visible channels).\n- Students generate predictions and compare them to results.\n- Students connect the small-scale model to the real beach in the photo.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize vocabulary and deepen understanding of erosion and weathering using evidence from Explore.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Completed investigation sheets from Explore phase\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Visual anchor chart (prepared in advance) with photographs or illustrations showing erosion examples\n- Vocabulary cards or poster board with key terms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** \n   - Invite 2–3 groups to show their baking pans and share one key observation: \"What surprised you about how water changed your sand?\"\n   - Ask: \"Did everyone's sand respond the same way? Why might that be?\" (e.g., some sand was wetter, some was packed tighter).\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (7–8 minutes):**\n   - Display and define these terms using the Explore activity as examples:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Erosion:** The wearing away or movement of rocks, soil, and sediment from one place to another. (Example: \"The water in your pan carried sand from the mound to the bottom—that's erosion.\")\n   - **Weathering:** The breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by wind, water, ice, or living things. (Example: \"Water can break rocks into smaller pieces over time, like your sand became more spread out.\")\n   - **Sediment:** Small pieces of rock, sand, and soil that can be picked up and moved by water or wind. (Example: \"The cloudy water in your pan was full of sediment being carried away.\")\n   - **Deposition:** When sediment (rocks, sand, soil) is dropped and settles in a new place. (Example: \"Sand settled at the edge of your pan—that's where it was deposited.\")\n   - **Landform:** A natural shape of Earth's land, like a mountain, valley, cliff, or beach. (Example: \"The sand mound you made was a landform, just like the real beaches and cliffs in the photo.\")\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the beach photo again.\n   - Point to the darker debris and sediment visible on the shore.\n   - Say: \"In the photograph, you see brown patches and debris on the beach. That's sediment being deposited—sand and rock pieces that water has moved from cliffs, rocks, or other parts of the shoreline. The waves and currents are like the water you poured in your pan, but they've been working on this beach for hundreds of years.\"\n   - Point to the tall buildings: \"Those buildings are built on this beach, where erosion is happening all the time. Engineers have to think carefully about how to protect them.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I pour water on sand again tomorrow, what do you predict will happen?\" (Students should reference erosion and sediment movement.)\n   - Ask: \"Where does the sand from an eroding beach go?\" (Students should discuss deposition and sediment movement.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the terms erosion, weathering, sediment, deposition, and landform correctly.\n- Students explain that water moves sediment from one place to another.\n- Students connect the small-scale investigation to real coastal erosion.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply erosion concepts to new scenarios and explore factors that affect erosion rate.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Additional baking pans or containers (same setup as Explore, enough for 2–3 new pans)\n- Sand, water, pebbles\n- Vegetation material (grass clippings, moss, or paper strips to simulate plants)\n- Different water delivery tools: spray bottle, pitcher, funnel\n- Ruler\n- Investigation sheet: \"Comparing Erosion Rates\"\n- Chart paper for class data collection\n\n**Activity: \"What Slows Down Erosion?\"**\n\n**Scenario setup:**\nExplain: \"Real beaches have plants, rocks, and different conditions. Let's test what slows down erosion.\"\n\n**Student choice investigation (students pick one comparison to test):**\n\n**Option 1 – Plant Power:**\n- Create two identical sand mounds in separate pans.\n- Add grass clippings, moss, or paper strips to simulate plant roots in one mound.\n- Pour the same amount of water on both.\n- Measure and compare which landform changes more.\n- Question: \"Do plants help protect beaches from erosion?\"\n\n**Option 2 – Different Water Forces:**\n- Create two identical sand mounds.\n- Pour water gently onto one with a pitcher.\n- Use a spray bottle (more forceful) on the other.\n- Measure and compare changes.\n- Question: \"Does the strength of water affect how much erosion happens?\"\n\n**Option 3 – Different Sediment Types:**\n- Create one mound of fine sand and one of coarser sand mixed with pebbles.\n- Apply the same water to both.\n- Measure and compare which erodes faster.\n- Question: \"Does the size of sediment affect erosion?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Assign groups to an option or let groups choose.\n- Distribute investigation sheets.\n- Circulate to prompt: \"What are you measuring? How will you compare your results fairly?\"\n- Encourage groups to create a data table or sketch.\n\n**Class data collection (5 minutes):**\n- Ask each group: \"What did you discover?\" \n- Record findings on a class chart: **\"Erosion happens faster/slower when ___\"**\n- Facilitate a brief discussion: \"What do these results tell us about protecting real beaches?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students test a variable affecting erosion rate.\n- Students collect and communicate data.\n- Students apply learning to explain real-world coastal protection (e.g., \"Beaches with plants might be protected better\").\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of erosion, weathering, and water's role in landscape change.\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- Observation of student predictions and Explore activity recordings.\n- Vocabulary use during group share-outs.\n- Quality of questions asked during discussions.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nDistribute a half-sheet exit ticket. Students respond to **one or two** of the following:\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Show a beach before and after water erosion. Label where sediment moved from and where it was deposited.\n\n2. **Explain in 2–3 sentences:** How is the investigation you did today similar to what happens at a real beach like the one in the photograph?\n\n3. **Answer this question:** Name one way erosion can change a beach. How would that affect people living near the beach?\n\n4. **True or False with explanation:**\n   - \"Water can break down rocks and move sand.\" (True. Water is a powerful force that causes weathering and erosion.)\n   - \"Once sand erodes from a beach, it disappears forever.\" (False. The sand is deposited somewhere else, like offshore or at the base of cliffs.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies erosion or weathering in a scenario.\n- ✓ Student uses at least two vocabulary terms (erosion, weathering, sediment, deposition, or landform) correctly.\n- ✓ Student explains that water moves sediment from one location to another.\n- ✓ Student connects their investigation to the real-world photograph.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that water causes erosion and moves sediment.\n- Students apply vocabulary accurately.\n- Students recognize erosion as an ongoing natural process affecting coastlines and human structures.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified investigation sheet:** Provide a graphic organizer with sentence frames:\n   - \"Before water: The sand was ____.\"\n   - \"After water: The sand ____.\"\n   - \"I observed that water ____.\"\n   - Eliminate the need to record exact measurements; accept descriptions like \"a little\" or \"a lot.\"\n\n2. **Vocabulary scaffolding:** Create a word wall with pictures. Pair each term with a simple illustration (e.g., erosion = arrow showing sand moving; deposition = sand piling up).\n\n3. **Buddy system:** Pair struggling readers/writers with a peer during investigation. Assign roles: one student observes and predicts while the partner records, then switch roles.\n\n4. **Simplified Elaborate phase:** Assign these students to **Option 3 (Different Sediment Types)** as it requires fewer variables to manage.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-variable investigation:** Ask: \"Can you test two things at once? What if plants were present AND the water was more forceful?\" Have students design a more complex investigation with multiple variables and a data table.\n\n2. **Real-world application:** Provide a map or diagram of a coastal area with erosion problems. Ask: \"Based on what you learned, how would you protect this beach? What solutions would work best and why?\"\n\n3. **Historical erosion analysis:** Provide before-and-after aerial photographs of a real coastline (search \"coastal erosion time-lapse\" online). Have students estimate erosion rates and predict future changes: \"If erosion continues at this rate, what will this beach look like in 20 years?\"\n\n4. **Weathering and erosion deep dive:** Challenge students to distinguish between the two: \"Erosion moved sediment, but what broke it into pieces in the first place?\" (Weathering.) Have them create a labeled diagram showing both processes happening at once.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Beach Profile Project:** Students create a cross-section drawing or 3D model of a beach showing layers of sediment, rocks, and the effects of water erosion. They label zones of high and low erosion and explain why certain areas erode faster.\n\n2. **Coastal Engineering Design Challenge:** Provide students with a problem scenario: \"A beach is eroding and threatening houses. Design a solution using materials like sand, rocks, plants (or craft materials to represent them), or barriers. Build a model and test it with water. Does your design slow erosion?\" (Connects to 4-ESS3-2: Generate solutions to reduce natural hazards' impacts.)\n\n3. **Erosion Journal: A Day in the Life of a Grain of Sand:** Students write a creative narrative from the perspective of a sand grain, describing its journey from a rock on a cliff, through weathering, erosion, transport by water, deposition on a beach, and possibly re-erosion. This deepens understanding of the complete erosion-deposition cycle while allowing creative expression.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Classroom Management Tips\n\n- **Timing flexibility:** If time is short, combine Explore and Elaborate into one 40-minute investigation block, or assign Elaborate as a follow-up lesson the next day.\n- **Water management:** Use shallow pans and have paper towels and a mop nearby. Conduct this lesson near a sink or outdoors if possible.\n- **Materials prep:** Gather pans and sand the day before. If using kinetic sand, it's reusable and cleaner than wet beach sand but may be pricier. Playground or sandbox sand works fine.\n- **Photo visibility:** Print the beach photograph in color and large (11\" × 14\" if possible) so students can see the detail of erosion, buildings, and sediment. Display it throughout all five phases.\n\nThis lesson directly addresses the NGSS emphasis on observation, measurement, and evidence-based reasoning—core practices of Fourth Grade science learners.",
