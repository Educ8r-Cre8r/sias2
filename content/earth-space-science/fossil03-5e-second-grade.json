Identify and describe what a fossil is and explain that it is a trace of a plant or animal that lived long ago.\n2. Use evidence from the photograph to explain that some Earth events (like fossil formation) happen very slowly over a long time.\n3. Compare rocks and fossils to make predictions about how they form and what they tell us about Earth's past.\n4. Create a model fossil to demonstrate understanding of how fossils are made.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the fossil.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Color printout of fossil photograph (or display on screen/projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"Mystery Object\" bag (optional: containing a smooth stone and a rock with visible crystals)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Do not yet reveal what it is. Say: \"I found this treasure buried in the ground. What do you think it is? What do you notice about it?\"\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (allow 1-2 minute thinking time, then share-outs):\n   - \"What do you see on this rock? Describe it to your neighbor.\"\n   - \"Does this look like anything you know? What does it remind you of?\" (Guide them toward noticing the fan or feather-like pattern.)\n   - \"How do you think this mark got on the rock? Who or what might have made it?\"\n   - \"Do you think this happened quickly, like when you drop something, or did it take a long, long time?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I'm going to tell you this is called a **fossil**. Before we learn more, what do you think a fossil is? Turn to your partner and make a guess. What was it before it became rock?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper titled \"What We Think Fossils Are.\" Leave this visible throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Let's become fossil scientists and make our own fossils to see how they form. That will help us understand what this fossil really is.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover fossil formation through hands-on modeling.\n\n**Materials:** (per student or pair)\n- Air-dry clay or Play-Doh (enough for a handful)\n- Small objects from nature: leaves, twigs, small shells, feathers, or plastic insects (have 3-4 options available)\n- Shallow containers or aluminum foil squares (to prevent table mess)\n- Water in a small cup\n- Paper towels\n- Pencils or craft sticks\n- Observation sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Choose one object from our 'nature basket' — it could be a leaf, twig, shell, or feather. This will be your 'organism.'\"\n\n2. \"Roll your clay into a ball about the size of an apple.\"\n\n3. \"Gently press your object into the clay to make an imprint — don't push too hard! Press it down as if it sank into mud.\"\n\n4. \"Lift your object carefully off the clay. Look at the mark it left. This is what a fossil impression looks like!\"\n\n5. \"Let your clay model sit on your table. In the next few days, it will harden and become more like real rock (we'll check on it tomorrow).\"\n\n6. **Record observations** on the Observation Sheet:\n   - Draw what your object looked like\n   - Draw what the imprint looks like\n   - Write or tell: \"My imprint shows _____ (the object).\"\n   - Circle: \"This imprint formed: **quickly** or **slowly**?\" (Help them understand that pressing the clay took a few seconds, but real fossils took millions of years.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What shape did your object have? Can you see that shape in the clay?\" \"If this clay took a long time to get hard, like real rocks, what would happen to it?\"\n- Do not explain fossil formation directly; let students discover through making the imprint.\n- Encourage students to compare their imprints to the fossil photograph on the board.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students create visible imprints showing the shape of their object.\n- Students recognize that the imprint is a record or \"picture\" of the original object.\n- Students make a connection between their quick clay impression and the slow formation of real fossils.\n- Students produce a filled-in observation sheet with drawings and descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect discoveries to the photograph and fossil science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Fossil photograph (still displayed)\n- Student clay imprints from Explore phase\n- Picture cards or simple drawings showing: plant/animal, burial in sediment, hardening into rock, exposed fossil\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-out from Explore:**\n   - Invite 3-4 students to show their clay imprints to the group.\n   - Ask: \"What does your imprint tell us? What was it before? Can we tell from the shape?\"\n   - Emphasize: \"Your imprint is a **record** of your object, just like the fossil in our photo is a record of something that lived long, long ago.\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions:\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Fossil** | A trace or print of a plant or animal that lived a very, very long time ago and got hard inside rock. It's like a picture that shows us what lived on Earth before. |\n   | **Imprint** | A mark or shape left behind when something presses into soft material (like your clay). It shows the outline of the object. |\n   | **Sediment** | Tiny bits of rock, sand, and mud that pile up and eventually get pressed together to make new rock. Think of sand on a beach! |\n   | **Hard/Hardened** | When soft material like clay or mud gets firmer and stronger over time. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the fossil on the screen. \"This is what we call a **fossil imprint**. See the pattern? It looks like a feather or fan. Scientists think this was from a sea creature that lived millions and millions of years ago.\"\n   - \"When this creature died, it fell into soft mud at the bottom of the ocean. Over time — longer than anyone has ever lived — the mud turned into rock, and the creature left a print behind.\"\n   - \"Your clay imprints happened in minutes, but Earth's fossils take MILLIONS OF YEARS.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Show a picture of a fossil and ask: \"Is this a real plant or animal, or a print of one? How do you know?\"\n   - Ask: \"How is your clay imprint like the fossil in the photo? How is it different?\" (Answer: Same shape/process, but the fossil took much, much longer to form.)\n\n**Vocabulary:** \n- **Fossil:** A trace or print of a plant or animal that lived a very, very long time ago, preserved in rock.\n- **Imprint:** A mark or shape left behind when something presses into soft material.\n- **Sediment:** Tiny pieces of rock, sand, and mud that pile up and harden into new rock over time.\n- **Hard/Hardened:** When soft material becomes firm and strong.\n- **Past/Long Ago:** A time before today, sometimes millions of years before.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can define \"fossil\" in their own words.\n- Students understand that fossils are not the actual animal or plant, but a record or print left behind.\n- Students recognize that fossils form slowly over very long time periods (connecting to 2-ESS1-1).\n- Students can identify the fossil in the photograph and describe what it shows.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by exploring how fossils tell us about Earth's history and past environments.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 3-4 different fossil pictures or specimens (or printed images): leaf fossil, shell fossil, fish fossil, dinosaur trace\n- Chart paper labeled \"What Fossils Tell Us\"\n- Markers\n- Optional: a sandy/muddy outdoor area or sensory bin with sand and water for students to bury objects\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Fossil Detective Lab** (if staying indoors)\n\n1. Divide the class into small groups. Give each group a different fossil image.\n\n2. Ask: \"Look at your fossil carefully. **What do you think this was before it became a fossil?** Was it a plant or an animal? Was it big or small?\"\n\n3. \"Why do you think we find **fossils of sea creatures** in rocks? What does that tell us about where the ocean used to be?\" (Guide students to understand that fossils are evidence of past environments.)\n\n4. **Create a class chart** titled \"What Fossils Tell Us\":\n   - \"Fossils show us what plants and animals lived on Earth a long time ago.\"\n   - \"Fossils show us where water used to be (we find sea creature fossils in places that are now dry!).\"\n   - \"Fossils remind us that Earth is always changing — slowly, over a very long time.\"\n\n5. Have students draw their fossil and write or dictate: \"This fossil shows us that _____ lived here a long time ago.\"\n\n**Option B: Model Fossil Formation** (if access to outdoor space/sensory area)\n\n1. Set up a sandbox, sensory bin, or muddy area.\n2. Have students bury a small object (toy fish, plastic leaf, shell) in the sand/mud.\n3. \"Let's pretend this is happening at the bottom of an ocean millions of years ago. Over time, sand and mud will pile on top.\"\n4. Ask students to predict: \"If we left this buried for a very, very long time, what would happen to the sand around it? How would it change?\"\n5. After a few minutes, carefully excavate and show: \"See how the sand is getting firmer? It's starting to stick together. Over millions of years, this would turn into rock with a fossil inside.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Facilitate small-group fossil discussions by asking: \"What clues do you see? What do you think this creature looked like?\"\n- Guide students toward the idea that fossils are **evidence of Earth's past**, not just interesting rocks.\n- Celebrate curiosity and scaffold thinking: \"You're asking great questions like real paleontologists (fossil scientists)!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can make inferences about what a fossil was based on its shape and features.\n- Students understand that fossils provide evidence of past life and past environments.\n- Students grasp that Earth changes slowly over very long times (2-ESS1-1).\n- Students produce drawings and writing describing what their fossil tells them about Earth's past.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossils, imprints, and slow Earth processes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during Explain and Elaborate):**\n\n- **Observation checklist** as students discuss fossils:\n  - ☐ Student can identify a fossil as a print or trace\n  - ☐ Student can explain that fossils take a long time to form\n  - ☐ Student can make a prediction or inference about what a fossil shows\n  - ☐ Student understands the difference between their clay imprint (quick) and real fossils (slow)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with a simple **Fossil Exit Ticket** (see below). Read the questions aloud; students can answer by drawing, pointing, or speaking to an adult.\n\n---\n\n**FOSSIL EXIT TICKET**\n\n**Name: _________________ Date: _________________**\n\n**1. Draw or point to show: Is this a fossil?**\n   - (Show picture of: actual butterfly / butterfly imprint in clay)\n   - Circle your answer: **YES / NO**\n   - Why did you choose that? ___________________________________________\n\n**2. A fossil forms:**\n   - ☐ Very quickly (in a few minutes)\n   - ☐ Very slowly (over millions of years)\n\n**3. What does a fossil show us?** (Circle all that are true)\n   - ☐ What plants or animals lived long ago\n   - ☐ The exact animal still alive\n   - ☐ Where water used to be on Earth\n   - ☐ How Earth changes over time\n\n**4. Our clay imprints are like real fossils because:**\n   - We pressed an object in soft material and it left a print/mark.\n   - *(Students can draw or write)*\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n- ✓ Student can identify a fossil as a print or trace (not the actual organism).\n- ✓ Student understands that fossils form very slowly (over millions of years).\n- ✓ Student can explain that fossils provide evidence of past life on Earth.\n- ✓ Student can compare their clay imprint to a real fossil and recognize the connection.\n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n1. Review Exit Tickets: Look for correct identification of fossils and understanding of slow formation.\n2. Observe clay imprints: Can students explain that their imprint is like a fossil?\n3. Listen to small-group conversations: Do students use vocabulary (fossil, imprint, sediment) correctly?\n4. Review drawings and writing: Can students describe what a fossil shows about Earth's past?\n5. Check Observation Sheets from Explore: Did students record accurate descriptions and predictions?\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use consistent language (e.g., always say \"fossil print\" instead of switching between \"imprint,\" \"impression,\" \"trace\"). Create a visual vocabulary chart with pictures.\n\n2. **Hands-on modeling:** Some students may need more time to process the clay-to-fossil connection. Let them create multiple imprints and label each with \"This is like a fossil because _____\" (providing sentence starter).\n\n3. **Paired exploration:** Pair struggling students with a peer buddy during Explore and Elaborate phases so they can talk through their thinking. Provide sentence frames:\n   - \"This fossil shows that _____ lived here.\"\n   - \"I know this is a fossil because _____.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Multi-layer fossils:** Invite students to create a \"fossil record\" by making several imprints in clay layers, one on top of another, to show how fossils from different times get stacked in rocks. Ask: \"Which fossil is oldest — the top one or the bottom one?\"\n\n2. **Paleontologist extension:** Give advanced students real fossil pictures or books and ask them to research what the fossil is, when it lived, and what environment it was in. Have them create an informational poster or short presentation.\n\n3. **Erosion connection:** Challenge students to think about how a buried fossil eventually becomes visible: \"If sediment takes millions of years to harden into rock, what has to happen for us to see the fossil in the rock now?\" (Introduce the idea of erosion: wind, water, and weathering slowly wear away the rock, exposing the fossil.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil Hunt Field Trip or Virtual Tour:**\n   - Visit a local museum with a fossil exhibit, or use a virtual museum tour (e.g., Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History online fossil collection).\n   - Have students observe real fossils and fill out a \"Fossil Detective Sheet\": What was it? Where was it found? How long ago did it live?\n   - Students can bring back sketches or photos to share with the class.\n\n2. **Create a Classroom \"Fossil Timeline\":**\n   - Display fossil images in order from oldest to most recent.\n   - Include: ancient sea creatures, dinosaur fossils, ice age animals, recent fossils.\n   - Add simple captions: \"This lived 500 million years ago\" or \"This lived 100 million years ago.\"\n   - Discuss: \"Earth's life keeps changing. What might fossils from 1 million years in the future look like?\"\n\n3. **Story or Poem: \"The Life and Death of My Fossil\":**\n   - Students write or dictate a creative story from the perspective of an ancient creature: \"I was a _____ living in an ocean/forest. One day I died and sank into the mud. Over millions of years, I became a fossil. Now a scientist found me!\"\n   - Illustrate the story with drawings showing the creature alive, being buried, and becoming a fossil.\n   - This reinforces the slow-motion, time-scale concept in an engaging, narrative way.\n\n---\n\n## Connections to NGSS Performance Expectations\n\n**2-ESS1-1: Use information from several sources to provide evidence that Earth events can occur quickly or slowly.**\n- *How this lesson addresses it:* Students compare the quick formation of their clay imprint (seconds/minutes) to the very slow formation of real fossils (millions of years). They examine fossil photographs and discuss how fossil formation is a slow Earth process. The Exit Ticket asks them to identify the timescale of fossil formation.\n\n**2-ESS2-1: Compare multiple solutions designed to slow or prevent wind or water from changing the shape of the land.**\n- *How this lesson addresses it (optional, depending on Elaborate option chosen):* If students do the outdoor/sensory bin activity in Elaborate, they observe how sediment (sand/mud) buries and protects the fossil. This shows how **sediment is a \"solution\"** that slows or prevents erosion of organisms by covering and preserving them. This can be extended: \"How does the sediment protect the fossil? What would happen if there were no sediment?\"\n\n---\n\n**Ready to teach! This lesson gives students a concrete, hands-on understanding of fossils while anchoring them firmly in second-grade appropriate ESS concepts of slow Earth processes and evidence of the past.**",
