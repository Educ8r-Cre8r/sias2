Observe and record winter weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, frost) in a data table and create a simple graph to show patterns across a season.\n2. Compare how plants survive in different seasonal climates and explain why some plants can handle cold weather better than others.\n3. Design and test a simple solution that protects plants from frost or freezing damage during winter weather.\n4. Use evidence from observations to make a claim about how weather affects plants during winter.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about winter weather and plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the frost-covered daffodil and plant buds (displayed on screen or printed large)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Winter imagery or classroom access to outdoor winter observations (if in a winter climate) or pictures from online resources\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it large. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without talking.\n\n2. **Launch with a hook question:** \"What do you notice on this flower and these plants? What's covering them?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate discussion using these guiding questions:**\n   - \"Why do you think this yellow flower still has buds and buds even though it's covered in frost and snow?\"\n   - \"What season do you think this is? What clues in the picture tell you?\"\n   - \"If you were this plant, how would you survive being so cold?\"\n   - \"Do you think all plants can survive this kind of cold? Why or why not?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"Right now, write or draw: If winter gets colder and colder, what do you predict will happen to this plant? Will it survive, or will it die? What evidence makes you think so?\"\n\n5. **Chart student ideas** on a \"Winter Weather Questions\" poster to revisit during Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become weather scientists. We'll track winter weather patterns, learn how plants survive the cold, and even design ways to protect plants from freezing.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate winter weather patterns and plant survival through hands-on data collection and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Outdoor access (or pictures of winter/frost conditions if not in a winter climate)\n- Thermometers (classroom or outdoor)\n- Data collection sheets (printed table with columns: Date, Temperature, Weather Condition, Plant Observations)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Small potted plant or access to outdoor plants\n- Pencils and crayons\n- Optional: Ice and salt, small bowls, plant cuttings (for Part B)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Winter Weather Data Collection (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into small groups** (3-4 per group).\n\n2. **Provide each group with a data collection sheet** that includes:\n   - Date\n   - Temperature (read from thermometer)\n   - Weather condition (sunny, cloudy, snowy, frosty)\n   - Plant appearance (buds open or closed? leaves green or brown? frost/snow on it?)\n   - Drawings or observations\n\n3. **If outdoors:** Lead students outside to observe frost-covered plants, snow, and temperature. Have groups use thermometers to record temperature and sketch/describe what they see. Focus on visible frost crystals, snow coverage, and how plants look. Have students touch a frost-covered leaf gently and describe the texture.\n\n4. **If indoors (no winter season available):** Show photographs of frost and snow-covered plants. Students still complete the data table by analyzing the pictures, recording what weather conditions are shown, and predicting the temperature based on ice and frost presence.\n\n5. **Students record observations** in their data sheet using words, pictures, and numbers.\n\n**Part B: Testing Plant Protection (8 minutes)**\n\n*Optional, if time permits—can extend to Session 2:*\n\n1. Provide each group with a small potted plant and access to materials: paper, plastic wrap, cloth, leaves, mulch (bark chips).\n\n2. Ask: \"What materials do you think would best protect a plant from frost and freezing?\"\n\n3. Students select one material and gently wrap or cover part of their plant with it. They leave part of the plant uncovered as a comparison.\n\n4. **They make a prediction:** \"Do you think the covered part will survive better than the uncovered part? Why?\"\n\n5. Students sketch their setup and label which part has protection and which doesn't.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What does the frost look like? Is it thick or thin? How cold do you think it is? Why might plants need protection?\"\n- Prompt students to compare different plant parts and materials without providing answers.\n- Ensure thermometers are read correctly; model if needed.\n- Encourage careful observations and accurate recording.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Completed data collection sheets with temperature readings, weather observations, and sketches.\n- Student drawings or descriptions of frost, snow, and plant buds/leaves.\n- Predictions about how materials protect plants.\n- Evidence of careful observation and recording.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of winter weather patterns and plant survival.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student data sheets from Explore phase\n- Picture of the original frost-covered daffodil photo\n- Simple seasonal temperature graph (blank, prepared ahead)\n- Vocabulary cards or poster with key terms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their weather observations and temperature readings.\n   - Record temperatures on a simple chart visible to all.\n   - Ask: \"Do we see the same temperatures everywhere? Why might some areas be colder than others?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (5-7 minutes):**\n   Present each term using the photograph and student observations as examples:\n\n   - **Frost:** Tiny ice crystals that form on plants and surfaces when water freezes. (Point to frost in the photo: \"See how the plant is covered in white crystals? That's frost.\")\n   - **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is. We measure it with thermometers using degrees.\n   - **Seasonal Pattern:** Weather that happens the same way each year in a season. Winter is always cold; summer is always warm.\n   - **Adaptation:** Special features that help living things survive in their environment. (Example: \"This plant has buds that stay closed tight in winter to protect them from freezing.\")\n   - **Climate:** The typical weather in a place over a long time. Some places have cold, snowy winters; others have mild winters.\n\n3. **Make Connections (3-5 minutes):**\n   - Return to the original photo: \"Now that we know about frost and winter weather, let's understand what's happening to this flower. Even though it's covered in frost and snow, the plant has adapted to survive. Its buds stay closed, its roots are protected under the soil, and in spring, it will bloom again.\"\n   - Ask: \"Which of our observations match what we see in the photo?\"\n   - Create a class chart: \"Winter Weather Patterns We Observed.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If temperature drops below freezing, what happens to water on plants?\" (It becomes frost or ice.)\n   - \"Why do you think plants in cold climates have special adaptations?\" (To survive the cold.)\n   - \"What season would we call the weather we observed today?\" (Winter, because it's cold and there's frost/snow.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Frost** | Tiny ice crystals that form on plants and ground when water freezes; makes things look sparkly and white. |\n| **Temperature** | How hot or cold something is; we measure it with a thermometer. |\n| **Seasonal Pattern** | Weather that happens the same way each year during a season (winter is cold, summer is hot). |\n| **Adaptation** | Special features that help plants and animals survive in their environment (like closed buds in winter). |\n| **Climate** | The typical weather in a place over a long time (some places are always cold, some are always warm). |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define frost, temperature, and seasonal pattern in their own words.\n- Students connect vocabulary to the photograph and their own observations.\n- Students understand that plants have adaptations that help them survive winter weather.\n- Students can identify examples of winter weather patterns from their data.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by designing and testing a solution to protect plants from winter weather hazards.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small potted plants or plant cuttings in small cups of soil (one per group or pair)\n- Various protective materials: plastic wrap, cloth strips, paper bags, straw/mulch, leaves, cardboard, aluminum foil\n- Thermometers\n- Freezer access OR observation of frost-covered plants outdoors\n- Data sheets for recording design choices and outcomes\n- Markers and labels\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Design Challenge: Protect the Plant! (Session 2 focus, or extended activity)**\n\n1. **Present the Challenge:** \"Winter frost and ice can damage delicate plants like the daffodil in our photo. Your job is to design a protection system that keeps frost and ice from damaging a plant. What material or design would work best?\"\n\n2. **Define the Problem:** Show the photo again. Explain: \"The buds and tender leaves on this daffodil are at risk of freezing. We need to design something that protects them without hurting the plant.\"\n\n3. **Student Design Process (in pairs or small groups):**\n   - **Step 1:** Choose ONE material or combination of materials that you think will best protect the plant from frost.\n   - **Step 2:** Wrap or cover part of your plant with your chosen material. Leave part uncovered as a comparison.\n   - **Step 3:** Label your design with the material name and explain why you chose it.\n   - **Step 4:** If using a freezer: Place your plant in a cold environment for 10-15 minutes. If outdoors: Observe frost formation. Record temperature.\n   - **Step 5:** Compare the covered and uncovered parts. Which looks better? Which leaves or buds appear less damaged?\n   - **Step 6:** Record observations and sketch your results.\n\n4. **Gallery Walk (if multiple designs):** Groups display their protected plants and designs. Students walk around and observe which design seems most effective.\n\n5. **Class Discussion:**\n   - \"Which material provided the best protection? Why do you think so?\"\n   - \"Would you change your design? How?\"\n   - \"How is our design similar to what plants do naturally to survive winter?\" (Closing buds, tough leaves, deeper roots.)\n\n6. **Make a Claim:** Each group completes: \"The best way to protect a plant from frost is __________ because __________.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate design choices without directing which material to use.\n- Ask: \"Why did you pick that material? What properties does it have?\" (Insulating, reflective, thick, etc.)\n- Encourage testing and revision.\n- Guide the comparison: \"What differences do you notice between the covered and uncovered parts?\"\n- Help students connect their design to real-world solutions (blankets over garden plants, row covers, mulch).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each group designs and tests a frost-protection system.\n- Students make observations and compare covered vs. uncovered plant parts.\n- Students provide evidence-based claims about which solution works best.\n- Students understand that design solutions are based on testing and evidence.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of winter weather patterns, plant adaptations, and design solutions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- Circulate during Explore and Elaborate phases; listen to student explanations and observe their data recording.\n- Ask probing questions: \"How did you measure that? What does the frost tell you about temperature? Why do you think that material worked?\"\n- Check data tables for accurate temperature readings and complete observations.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of lesson):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be written, drawn, or verbal for younger writers). Students respond to the following:\n\n**Question 1:** \"Look at this picture of a frost-covered plant (show photo again). What season is it? How do you know?\"\n- *Success Criteria:* Student identifies winter and gives at least one piece of evidence (cold, frost, snow, ice).\n\n**Question 2:** \"If you were a plant in winter, what could you do to survive the cold? Draw or write your answer.\"\n- *Success Criteria:* Student describes a realistic plant adaptation (close buds, drop leaves, go dormant, grow deeper roots, thick waxy coating, etc.) with some explanation.\n\n**Question 3:** \"We tested materials to protect plants from frost. Which material worked best in our test, and why do you think it protected the plant?\"\n- *Success Criteria:* Student names the most effective material from their group's test and gives a reason (thick, traps warmth, blocks ice, etc.).\n\n**Question 4 (3-ESS3-1 focus):** \"Make a claim: The best way to protect gardens from winter frost is __________ because __________.\"\n- *Success Criteria:* Student makes a claim and supports it with evidence from their observations or testing.\n\n**Data Table Check:**\n- Review student data sheets for:\n  - Accurate temperature recordings\n  - Complete weather observations\n  - Thoughtful plant observations and sketches\n  - Clear predictions and reasoning\n\n**Success Criteria for Overall Understanding:**\n- Students can identify and describe winter weather patterns (cold temperature, frost, snow).\n- Students can explain how plants adapt or survive winter conditions.\n- Students can design a simple solution and test it with reasoning.\n- Students can use evidence from observations to support claims about weather and plant protection.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 75% of students accurately record temperature and identify frost as evidence of winter.\n- 80% of students describe at least one plant adaptation for cold weather.\n- 70% of students design a protection system with a reason based on material properties.\n- 75% of students make a claim about frost protection supported by test results.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Sentence Starters for Writing/Speaking:**\n   - Provide pre-made sentence frames for exit tickets and explanations:\n     - \"I observed that the frost is __________ because __________.\"\n     - \"The plant survives winter by __________.\"\n     - \"The __________ material protected the plant because it __________.\"\n   - This reduces language demands while maintaining conceptual rigor.\n\n2. **Paired Data Collection:**\n   - Pair a struggling reader/writer with a stronger student during Explore. One records numbers while the other sketches; both discuss observations verbally.\n   - Provide a simplified data table with pictures and boxes to check rather than blank spaces.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Visual Supports:**\n   - Create a vocabulary anchor chart with pictures for each key term (frost photo, temperature scale, seasonal calendar, plant adaptation drawings).\n   - Reference the chart frequently during Explain and Elaborate phases.\n   - Allow use of the chart during assessments.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Comparative Climate Study:**\n   - Have advanced students research and compare winter weather in two different regions (e.g., Maine vs. Florida, or Canada vs. Texas).\n   - Ask them to represent this data in a graph and explain how plants in each region are different because of climate.\n   - Connection: 3-ESS2-2 (Obtain and combine information to describe climates in different regions).\n\n2. **Advanced Design Challenge:**\n   - Challenge students to design a frost-protection system that *also* allows sunlight in, or that can be removed and reused.\n   - Ask them to test TWO different materials head-to-head and create a formal comparison chart with their claim and evidence clearly labeled.\n   - Extend to: \"Would this design work in all winter climates? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Long-Term Observation Project:**\n   - Have advanced students create a seasonal observation log: track the same outdoor plant (or area) across multiple weeks/months of winter.\n   - Graph temperature changes week by week.\n   - Predict spring bloom timing based on warming patterns.\n   - Connection: 3-ESS2-1 (Represent data in tables and graphical displays to describe typical weather conditions expected during a particular season).\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frost Formation Science Demo (Homework or Next Lesson):**\n   - Send home a simple kit: small cup with soil, water bottle, freezer access instructions.\n   - Students observe frost or ice formation overnight in their freezer or outside.\n   - They sketch and describe the process, then explain it to the class using the term \"temperature,\" \"water,\" and \"freezing.\"\n   - *Connection:* Deepens understanding of frost formation (3-ESS2-1).\n\n2. **Winter Wildlife Survival:** \n   - Extend to animals: Research how animals survive winter (hibernation, migration, thicker fur).\n   - Create a \"Winter Survival Guide\" poster comparing plant and animal strategies.\n   - Compare how different creatures are adapted to cold climates.\n   - *Connection:* Links to life science (adaptations and survival).\n\n3. **Design a Winter Garden Plan:**\n   - If school has a garden, have students design a winter garden layout that includes frost protection for cold-hardy plants.\n   - Use their testing results to recommend specific protection methods for different plant types.\n   - Create a labeled diagram of the \"protected garden.\"\n   - *Connection:* Real-world application of 3-ESS3-1 (design solutions that reduce weather hazards).\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Timing Flexibility:** Spread this lesson across 2-3 sessions depending on student pace and available freezer/outdoor access. Explore and Elaborate can be extended over several days if tracking long-term frost patterns.\n- **Climate Adaptation:** If teaching in a non-winter climate, use the provided photograph as your primary data source and supplement with winter weather videos or pictures from online. Students can still complete all activities using visual data.\n- **Real-World Connection:** Gardeners, farmers, and landscapers use frost protection methods daily. Consider inviting a local gardener or showing a video of frost cloth in use.\n- **Safety Note:** Supervise all thermometer use and freezer access. Ensure cold exposure is brief (10-15 minutes maximum for any plant material).",
