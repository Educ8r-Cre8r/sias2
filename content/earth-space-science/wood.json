Each circular cross-section reveals beautiful patterns of tree rings - concentric circles radiating out from the center. The logs are different sizes, and you can see the bark still attached to the outer edges. The rings create patterns of light and dark bands. Some logs have knots where branches once grew. In the center of each log, you can see the tree's heartwood, which is often darker than the outer rings.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image demonstrates tree ring formation and how trees record climate history. Each ring you see represents one year of growth! During spring and summer when conditions are good (warm, rainy), trees grow quickly, creating wide, light-colored rings. During fall and winter when growth slows, trees form narrow, dark-colored rings. Scientists who study tree rings (dendrochronologists) can count rings to determine a tree's age and read the ring patterns to learn about past climate conditions. Wide rings = good growing year with plenty of rain; narrow rings = drought or harsh conditions.

Each ring represents one year of growth for the tree. The rings are like layers of wood that get added to the tree each year as it grows taller and wider. Some of the rings are wider, showing the tree had a good growing year with plenty of rain and sunshine. Other rings are narrower, which means the tree grew more slowly that year, maybe because of drought or other tough conditions.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe tree rings in this photo are a record of the tree's life and the climate conditions it experienced over the years. Just like the pages in a book, each ring tells a story about what happened that year. By counting the rings, scientists can figure out how old the tree is.
