Observe and describe how rocks can change and be covered by living things like moss.\n2. Explain that moss grows in places that are wet and shady.\n3. Identify rocks as natural materials that exist all around us and change over time.\n4. Communicate observations about rocks and moss using words and drawings.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about rocks and the green covering on them; activate prior knowledge about what they've seen outdoors.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the moss-covered rock (or display on tablet/smart board)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording \"I wonder\" statements\n- Markers (multiple colors)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the screen or as a large printed image. Give students 30 seconds of silent looking time.\n\n2. **Launch with an observation question:** \"What do you see in this picture? What colors do you see?\"\n   - Allow 3–4 students to share observations (they may mention green fuzzy stuff, rocks, bumpy texture, etc.)\n\n3. **Ask discovery questions calibrated to First Grade:**\n   - \"Have you ever seen rocks that look like this? Where?\"\n   - \"What is that green, fuzzy stuff? Have you ever touched something like it?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the green stuff is only on some parts of the rock, not all over it?\"\n   - \"What happens to rocks when they sit outside for a long, long time?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I'm thinking... this green stuff might be alive! What do you think? What do you wonder about this rock?\"\n   - Record student wonderings on chart paper using their exact words.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Today we're going to be rock scientists. We're going to explore rocks and find out what makes them change, just like in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rocks firsthand, observing their properties and discovering conditions where moss or lichen might grow.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 5–6 small rocks (various sizes, smooth and rough)\n- Magnifying glasses (one per pair or small group)\n- Spray bottle filled with water\n- Paper towels\n- Small tray or bin (to contain rocks and water)\n- Recording sheet (simple: rock drawings with spaces for observations)\n- Pencils or crayons\n\n**Activity — Rock Exploration Station:**\n\n**Step 1: Observe dry rocks (5 minutes)**\n- Distribute rocks to pairs or small groups.\n- Student directions: \"Look at your rock. Touch it. What does it feel like? Is it bumpy or smooth? What color is it? Draw your rock on your paper.\"\n- Students observe and draw rocks, labeling rough vs. smooth areas.\n\n**Step 2: Add water and re-observe (7 minutes)**\n- Teacher or student sprays rocks lightly with water.\n- Student directions: \"Now your rock is wet, like it rained on it. Does it look different? What changed? Feel it again. Does it feel different? Draw what you see now.\"\n- Students observe how wet rocks may look darker, and texture becomes more visible.\n\n**Step 3: Use magnifying glasses (5 minutes)**\n- Student directions: \"Now use your magnifying glass. Look very, very close at your rock. Can you see tiny bumps? Can you see small holes? What does the surface look like up close?\"\n- Record observations with drawings (and labeled details if they can write simple words like \"bumpy,\" \"wet,\" \"dark\").\n\n**Step 4: Predict and discuss (3 minutes)**\n- Teacher asks: \"If we left water on rocks for days and days, and if it was shady and damp, what might grow on the rock? What could live there?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask follow-up questions: \"What else did you notice?\" \"Why do you think it looks different when it's wet?\" \"Could something grow on a wet rock?\"\n- Avoid explaining moss yet; guide discovery through questions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that rocks have different textures (rough/smooth).\n- Students notice rocks change appearance when wet (darker, more visible detail).\n- Students begin thinking about conditions (wet, shady) where organisms might live.\n- Students create observable records (drawings with labels).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to the photograph and moss concept.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original moss-covered rock photograph (displayed again)\n- Magnified image or close-up photo of moss (if available) to show students\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words\n- Green construction paper or felt to represent moss\n- Picture cards of different rocks (some with moss, some without)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**1. Group share-out (5 minutes)**\n- Ask: \"What did you discover about rocks? What did they feel like? What happened when we added water?\"\n- Have 3–4 students share one observation each.\n- Record ideas on chart paper.\n\n**2. Introduce moss vocabulary (8 minutes)**\n\nDisplay the original photograph again.\n\nSay: \"Scientists have a special name for that green, fuzzy stuff you see on rocks. It's called **moss**. Moss is a tiny, tiny plant. It grows on rocks, trees, and soil when the place is wet and shady—just like in our picture!\"\n\n**Vocabulary (with First Grade-friendly definitions):**\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|---|---|\n| **Moss** | A tiny green plant that grows on wet, shady rocks and soil. It looks fuzzy or velvety. |\n| **Rock** | A hard, solid natural thing made of minerals. Rocks come in different colors, sizes, and textures. |\n| **Weathering** | When rocks slowly break apart and change because of wind, rain, ice, and other weather. It takes a very long time. |\n| **Living things** | Plants and animals. Moss is a living thing. Rocks are not living things, but moss can grow on them. |\n| **Damp/Moisture** | When something is a little wet. Moss likes to grow where it's damp. |\n\n**3. Connect to the photograph (4 minutes)**\n- Point to the rock in the photograph: \"Look at this rock. Is it in a sunny place or a shady place?\" (Shady—you can tell from the shadows.)\n- \"Do you think this rock gets rained on? Stays wet? Why?\"\n- \"That's why moss is growing on it! The moss found the perfect home—it's wet and shady.\"\n\n**4. Check for understanding (3 minutes)**\n- Ask: \"Can you say one thing that moss needs to grow?\" (Wet/damp, shady)\n- \"Is moss alive? Is a rock alive?\" (Moss yes, rock no)\n- Show picture cards of rocks—ask students to point to which ones might have moss (shady, damp-looking ones).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students learn that the green covering is called moss and is a living plant.\n- Students understand that moss grows where it's wet and shady.\n- Students recognize that rocks are natural materials and can change over time as plants grow on them.\n- Students make connections between their observations (wet, shady) and moss growth conditions.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their learning by creating a moss habitat model and predicting where moss would grow in the classroom or school.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small clear plastic containers or cups (one per pair)\n- Potting soil or sand\n- Small rocks (one per pair)\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Green crepe paper, green yarn, or felt cut into small pieces to represent moss\n- Craft glue\n- Images of different outdoor locations (sunny playground, shady forest, wet garden, dry field)\n- Picture chart of school grounds\n\n**Activity Option A: Create a Moss Habitat Model (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Introduce:** \"Now you're going to create a model. A model shows how something works in real life. We're going to make a place where moss can grow.\"\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - Place soil/sand in the bottom of a container.\n   - Place a small rock on top.\n   - Spray gently with water (2–3 mists).\n   - Glue green paper/yarn to the rock to show moss growing on it.\n   - Draw a picture on the side of the container showing where they think this moss habitat might be found (in the woods, by a stream, in a damp shady place).\n\n3. **Display models** as a classroom \"Moss Garden.\"\n\n**Activity Option B: Predict Moss Locations (15 minutes)**\n\n1. Show images of different outdoor locations: sunny sidewalk, shaded corner of building, near a downspout, open field, forest floor, wet rocks near water.\n\n2. **Student task:** For each location, students hold up a thumbs up if moss would grow there, thumbs down if it wouldn't. Discuss why.\n\n3. **Extension:** Create a class map of the school grounds. Mark with green stickers or drawings where students predict moss might be growing outdoors.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask: \"Why did you choose that spot?\" \"What does moss need?\" \"Is that place wet or dry? Sunny or shady?\"\n- Help students glue and model safely.\n- Facilitate discussion about habitat requirements.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that moss needs specific conditions (wet + shady).\n- Students can predict where moss would or wouldn't grow based on environmental conditions.\n- Students create a model or representation showing moss habitat.\n- Students communicate their reasoning using learned vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students understand that rocks change over time, that moss is a living plant, and that it grows in wet, shady places.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During lesson):**\n- **Observation notes:** During Explore, did students notice differences between wet and dry rocks?\n- **Discussion responses:** During Explain, could students identify characteristics of moss and what it needs?\n- **Model/prediction work:** During Elaborate, did students apply conditions for moss growth to new scenarios?\n\n**Summative Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nGive each student a simple one-page exit ticket with two tasks:\n\n**Task 1: Circle or point to the picture**\n- Show three pictures: (A) sunny rock, (B) wet shady rock, (C) dry rock\n- Instruction: \"Where would moss grow? Show me.\"\n- Correct answer: Picture B\n\n**Task 2: Draw and write (or dictate)**\n- Instruction: \"Draw a rock. Show where moss might grow on your rock. Tell me or write why moss would grow there.\"\n- Success criteria: Student draws moss on a shaded or damp-looking part of the rock and mentions \"wet,\" \"shady,\" \"rain,\" or \"damp.\"\n\n**Alternative assessment (oral, for emergent writers):**\n- Ask individually: \n  1. \"What is moss?\" (Expected: A tiny green plant / living thing)\n  2. \"Where does moss like to grow?\" (Expected: Wet and shady places)\n  3. \"Show me on the photograph where moss is growing. Why is it there?\" (Expected: Points to shaded areas and mentions moisture/dampness)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students correctly identify that moss grows in wet, shady conditions.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that moss is a living organism.\n- Students show that rocks can change and be covered by other living things.\n- Students can point to evidence in the photograph or model supporting their understanding.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify a wet, shady location as where moss grows.\n- Most students use at least one vocabulary word (moss, rock, wet, shady, damp) in their explanation.\n- Students show in drawings or models that they understand moss grows on rocks in specific conditions.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards:** Provide picture cards with one word (moss, rock, wet) instead of reading text. Pair students with a buddy or paraprofessional to read labels aloud.\n\n2. **Guided exploration:** Assign the struggling learner to a teacher-led small group during Explore. Pre-ask observation questions: \"Is this rock wet or dry? Hard or soft? What do you see?\" Help them draw and label one simple observation.\n\n3. **Oral responses only:** During exit ticket, allow students to answer questions verbally to you or a paraprofessional instead of writing. Record their responses on the ticket yourself.\n\n4. **Picture-based task:** For the elaborate phase, use only picture cards to match (sunny/shady) rather than requiring location predictions. Provide a choice of two options.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Research extension:** Provide picture books or a tablet with images of different types of moss and lichen. Challenge students to find and draw other organisms that live on rocks (lichen, algae). Ask: \"How are they the same or different from moss?\"\n\n2. **Prediction and timeline:** Ask: \"If moss keeps growing on a rock for many years, what might happen to the rock? Will it get smaller? Crumbly? Why?\" Encourage students to draw what the rock might look like after 10 years.\n\n3. **Habitat design:** Challenge students to design an ideal habitat for moss using the model activity. Ask them to explain all the conditions they included and why each one matters. Example: \"I made it shady by covering the top with black paper because moss doesn't like sun.\"\n\n4. **Seasonal observation:** Ask: \"When do you think moss grows the most—in summer when it's hot and dry, or in fall and spring when it rains more? Why?\" Introduce the idea of observing the same rock at different times of year.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rock Walk and Moss Hunt (20–30 minutes, outdoors)**\n   - Take the class on a nature walk to the school grounds, park, or garden.\n   - Challenge students to find real rocks with moss on them using their learning from the lesson.\n   - Document findings with photos or drawings. Ask: \"Why is moss here? Is it wet? Is it shady? Is there a tree nearby?\"\n   - Create a class chart: \"Mossy Rocks We Found\" with location and reason.\n\n2. **Grow Moss in a Jar (Observation over 2–3 weeks)**\n   - Place moss, rocks, soil, and water in a sealed clear jar.\n   - Students observe weekly: Does the moss change? Stay the same? Get bigger? Drier?\n   - Record observations with drawings and simple sentences: \"The moss is still green. It looks the same.\"\n   - Discuss: What did the moss need to stay alive? (Water, light, soil)\n\n3. **Compare Rock Types and Moss Growth (Science center activity)**\n   - Provide different rock types: smooth stones, rough bricks, sandstone, granite.\n   - Spray each with water and let sit for several days in a shady, damp location.\n   - Observe which rocks are \"best\" for moss growth. Predict why (texture, porousness, moisture retention).\n   - Create a chart: \"Which rocks do moss like best?\"\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- **Safety:** Rocks can be heavy; supervise handling. Ensure all water play is contained to prevent slipping.\n- **Photo discussion:** The moss-covered rock photo shows excellent real-world context—refer back to it throughout the lesson to anchor learning.\n- **Seasonal tie-in:** This lesson naturally connects to fall and spring observations when moss is most visible and moisture is high. Consider revisiting the photograph at different times of year.\n- **Home connection:** Send home a simple note asking families to look for moss on rocks, trees, or sidewalks near their home and draw or photograph findings to share in class.",
