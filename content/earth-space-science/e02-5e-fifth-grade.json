Identify how the geosphere (land), hydrosphere (water), biosphere (living things), and atmosphere (air) interact in a landscape.\n2. Explain why hills and valleys exist and how water shapes landforms over time.\n3. Describe how elevation affects weather patterns and the distribution of plants and water.\n4. Create a simple model showing how Earth's systems work together in a specific location.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (large format or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks and pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image on the screen or distribute printed copies. Allow students 60 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Pose Discovery Questions (ask these in sequence):**\n   - \"What do you notice about the landscape? Describe what you see at different distances from the building.\"\n   - \"Why do you think this hillside is so green and covered with trees? Where might the water for these plants come from?\"\n   - \"Look at the distant city—it looks hazy. What do you think is in the air that makes it harder to see far away?\"\n   - \"If you were standing on top of that tall hill, how do you think the weather or air might feel different compared to down in the valley?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Have students turn to a partner and share: \"I wonder why hills and valleys are shaped the way they are, and what helps create them.\"\n\n4. **Record on Chart Paper:** Capture 3-4 student wonderings on chart paper and post for reference throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be Earth scientists and discover how water, air, land, and living things all work together to create landscapes like the one in this photo.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Large aluminum baking pan or shallow container\n- Potting soil or sand (approximately 4-5 cups per group)\n- Water in a spray bottle or small cup\n- Large rocks or blocks to create elevation changes\n- Ruler\n- Paper towels\n- Observation worksheet (provided below)\n- Optional: food coloring or chalk dust to simulate erosion patterns\n\n**Activity: \"Building and Eroding Landforms\"**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Build the Landscape:** \n   - Place 2-3 rocks or blocks in your pan at different locations\n   - Fill the spaces around and between the rocks with soil/sand\n   - Pat down the soil gently to create a stable landscape\n   - Use a ruler to measure and record the height of your highest point\n\n2. **Make It Realistic:**\n   - Add a small cup of water to one side of your pan (this represents a \"water source\" like a lake or rain)\n   - Observe where the water naturally flows and pools\n\n3. **Simulate Water Erosion:**\n   - Use the spray bottle to gently spray water across your landscape\n   - Observe what happens to the soil as water moves across it\n   - Record what changes you see: Does soil move? Do valleys form? Does the highest point change?\n\n4. **Repeat the Process:**\n   - Continue spraying for 2-3 minutes\n   - Measure your highest point again—has it changed?\n   - Observe which areas have the most vegetation (if using actual plants) or where water collects\n\n5. **Document Your Observations:**\n   - Sketch your landscape before and after water erosion on your worksheet\n   - Answer: \"How did water change the shape of the land?\" and \"Where did the eroded soil go?\"\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** \n\"In the photo, we see hills and valleys. Your model shows us that water and gravity work together over long periods of time to create these different landforms. The green vegetation in the photo grows where water collects.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice about where the water flows?\"* and *\"How is your landscape changing?\"*\n- Resist providing answers; instead, redirect: *\"What do you think will happen if we add more water?\"*\n- Encourage students to make predictions before spraying more water\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that water creates channels and pathways through soil\n- Students recognize that soil is transported by water (erosion)\n- Students identify that water collects in low areas (valleys)\n- Groups complete observation worksheets with before/after sketches\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled diagram of Earth's systems\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures (4\" × 6\" index cards)\n- Photograph projected on screen\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to briefly share what they observed during erosion\n   - Record common observations on chart paper: *\"Water moved the soil,\" \"Valleys formed,\" \"Water collected in low places\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Formal Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Present each term with a student-friendly definition and a visual representation\n   - Point to the photograph to show real-world examples\n\n3. **Make Connections Back to the Photograph:**\n   - \"The hills and valleys in this photo were created over thousands of years by water, wind, and ice—just like our model showed us!\"\n   - \"The green plants grow here because water from rain flows down the hills and collects where plants need it\"\n   - \"The haze we see in the distance is part of the atmosphere—it's the air and water vapor mixed together\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Quick think-pair-share: *\"Turn to someone near you and explain in your own words: How do water and land work together to create hills and valleys?\"*\n   - Listen to 2-3 pair explanations to assess comprehension\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Landform** | A natural shape or feature of Earth's surface, like a hill, valley, or mountain |\n| **Erosion** | The wearing away and movement of rocks and soil by water, wind, or ice over time |\n| **Geosphere** | All the solid parts of Earth—rocks, soil, and the land beneath our feet |\n| **Hydrosphere** | All the water on Earth, including oceans, rivers, lakes, and rain in the clouds |\n| **Biosphere** | All the living things on Earth—plants, animals, and all organisms |\n| **Atmosphere** | The blanket of air that surrounds Earth and protects us |\n| **Topography** | The shape and features of the land, including hills, valleys, and the height of different areas |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary correctly to describe features in the photograph\n- Students explain that Earth's four systems (geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere) interact together\n- Students connect their model results to real-world landform creation\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Copies of \"Earth's Systems Interaction\" worksheet (see template below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: globe or map showing different biomes\n- Optional: elevation profile diagrams showing how mountains block rain\n\n**Activity: \"Systems Detective Challenge\"**\n\n**Scenario:**\n\"Look back at the photo of the city landscape. We're going to be systems detectives and trace how all four Earth systems interact in this ONE place.\"\n\n**Student Task:**\n\n1. **Identify Each System in the Photo (in pairs or small groups):**\n   - **Geosphere:** What landforms do you see? (hills, valleys, rocky areas)\n   - **Hydrosphere:** Where is water? (clouds, rain supporting plants, potentially streams/water sources)\n   - **Biosphere:** What living things can you see? (trees, vegetation covering the hillsides)\n   - **Atmosphere:** How does the air affect what we see? (haze, clouds, weather patterns)\n\n2. **Create a Systems Interaction Diagram:**\n   - Draw or label the photograph showing where each system appears\n   - Use arrows to show how they connect (e.g., \"Rain from the atmosphere → water in the hydrosphere → nourishes plants in the biosphere → which hold soil in the geosphere\")\n\n3. **Answer Application Questions:**\n   - \"If this hillside didn't have so many trees and plants, what might happen during heavy rain?\"\n   - \"Why do you think more plants grow on this hillside than in the distant hazy city area?\"\n   - \"How does gravity (Earth's pull) work with water to shape landforms?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: *\"Which systems interact here? What comes first—the water or the plants?\"*\n- Push thinking: *\"If we removed all the plants, would the land look different? Why?\"*\n- Affirm connections: *\"I love how you connected the water cycle to why vegetation grows here!\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify all four Earth systems visible in or inferable from the photograph\n- Students create labeled diagrams showing system interactions\n- Students explain cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., water → plant growth → soil stability)\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how Earth's systems interact.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Embedded Throughout):**\n- Listen to student explanations during think-pair-shares\n- Observe group erosion models and ask probing questions\n- Review observation worksheets from Explore phase\n- Check Systems Interaction Diagrams for accuracy and labeling\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide this handout at the end of the lesson:\n\n---\n\n**Name: ________________     Date: _______________**\n\n**Earth's Systems Exit Ticket**\n\n**1. Look at this small photo or drawing of a landscape. Label where you see:**\n   - The geosphere (G)\n   - The hydrosphere (H)\n   - The biosphere (B)\n   - The atmosphere (A)\n\n**2. Explain how water shapes the land. Use the word \"erosion\" in your answer.**\n   \n   _________________________________________________________________\n   \n   _________________________________________________________________\n\n**3. Why do you think there are more plants growing on the hillside than in the valley?**\n   \n   _________________________________________________________________\n   \n   _________________________________________________________________\n\n**4. Which two of Earth's systems do you think work together the most to create landforms? Explain why.**\n   \n   _________________________________________________________________\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- **Proficient:** Student correctly identifies all four systems in a landscape, uses vocabulary accurately (geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere), and explains at least two system interactions with clear reasoning.\n- **Developing:** Student identifies 3 of 4 systems, uses some vocabulary correctly, and explains one system interaction with minor clarity issues.\n- **Beginning:** Student identifies fewer than 3 systems or uses vocabulary incorrectly; explanations are vague or incomplete.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets reveal whether students understand that Earth's systems interact to create and shape landscapes\n- Students can identify real-world examples in photographs\n- Students recognize that erosion, water flow, and vegetation are interconnected processes\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Scaffolding for Struggling Learners):\n\n1. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a large, illustrated chart with pictures of each Earth system. Leave this posted throughout the lesson so students can reference it while completing worksheets and diagrams.\n\n2. **Guided Model Building:** For students who struggle with spatial reasoning, provide a step-by-step photo guide showing what each stage of landscape building should look like. Allow these students to work with a peer or paraprofessional.\n\n3. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Reduce to 2 questions (instead of 4) and provide answer sentence frames:\n   - \"Water shapes the land through _________.\"\n   - \"Plants grow where there is _________ and _________.\"\n\n### Challenge (Extensions for Advanced Learners):\n\n1. **Research Local Landforms:** Have students research the topography and climate of your actual location. How do rainfall patterns, vegetation, and landforms match what we learned? Create a poster showing local geography and Earth system interactions.\n\n2. **Erosion Rate Investigation:** Challenge students to design an experiment that tests how different soil types (clay, sand, potting soil, gravel) erode at different rates. Have them graph their results and discuss why this matters for construction or farming.\n\n3. **Water Distribution Challenge:** Using 5-ESS2-2 as a springboard, provide data on freshwater percentages and reservoirs. Have advanced students create pie charts and argue where freshwater is most plentiful and why some regions have more water than others (connect to landforms and precipitation patterns).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Watershed Model:** Have students construct a watershed model using a large tray, sand, rocks, and water. Add food coloring to \"rainfall\" and trace how water flows, collecting in a \"river.\" Discuss how watersheds connect landforms, water systems, and human communities.\n\n2. **Climate and Landforms Connection:** Introduce the idea that different landforms create different climates. For example, mountains force air upward, which cools and creates rain on one side (wet) but dry conditions on the other side (rain shadow). Have students predict climate patterns based on topography and then check their predictions on a climate/rainfall map.\n\n3. **Community Landform Scavenger Hunt:** Take students on a neighborhood walk or provide photographs of your local area. Have them identify hills, valleys, water sources, and vegetation patterns. Create a class map showing local landforms and discuss how human activities (buildings, roads, dams) interact with natural Earth systems. This connects to 5-ESS3-1 (protecting Earth's resources).\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\nThis lesson bridges physical geography with systems thinking—a key Fifth Grade skill. The photograph provides an authentic, complex landscape where all four Earth systems are visible or inferable. The progression from hands-on modeling (Explore) to formal vocabulary and system thinking (Explain/Elaborate) ensures that students build understanding from concrete to abstract.\n\nThe erosion model is the cognitive anchor for this lesson. Students will remember that *water moves soil, vegetation holds soil in place, and landforms result from these interactions over time*. Return to this model repeatedly during explanations to reinforce connections.\n\nIf you have access to a local watershed map, topographic map, or aerial photo of your school area, show it during Elaborate to demonstrate that these concepts apply to students' own communities—powerfully increasing relevance.",
