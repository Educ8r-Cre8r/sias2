ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about rocks and fossils using the photograph; activate prior knowledge about Earth materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Digital projector or large screen to display the fossil photograph\n- Chart paper and marker\n- 2–3 real rocks (various sizes and colors) placed on a table or windowsill visible to students\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the projector. Ask students to sit in a circle where they can all see clearly.\n\n2. **Show the photo and pause.** Say: *\"Look carefully at this picture. What do you see? It's a very special rock. Let's look closely together.\"*\n\n3. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause after each for responses):\n   - *\"What do you notice about this rock? Is it smooth or bumpy?\"*\n   - *\"Do you see any lines or shapes on the rock? What do they look like?\"*\n   - *\"Have you ever found a rock like this? Where do we find rocks?\"*\n   - *\"What could this shape be? Could it be from an animal? A plant? A creature from long, long ago?\"*\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** *\"This is called a fossil. It's a rock that shows us something very, very old—maybe from animals or plants that lived a very, very long time ago, before we were even born. I wonder... what do you think was here a long, long time ago?\"*\n\n5. **Record student responses** on chart paper to revisit during the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Let's go exploring! We're going to look at lots of rocks and discover what makes them special, just like this fossil rock.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rocks through hands-on observation and sorting; discover that rocks have different properties.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Collection of 12–15 rocks (various sizes, colors, and textures) — real rocks collected from outside or purchased; include:\n  - 3–4 smooth pebbles\n  - 3–4 rough/bumpy rocks\n  - 3–4 light-colored rocks\n  - 3–4 dark-colored rocks\n- Shallow baskets or bins (1 per 3–4 students)\n- Magnifying glasses (optional, but highly recommended)\n- Paper plates (1 per student or small group)\n- Crayons for drawing observations\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute materials:** Place one basket of rocks and a paper plate in front of each small group (3–4 students per group).\n\n2. **Introduce the exploration:** Say: *\"You are going to be rock scientists! Pick up each rock and look at it very carefully. Feel it. Is it bumpy or smooth? What color is it? Is it big or small? Draw what you see on your plate.\"*\n\n3. **Step-by-step student directions:**\n   - Pick up one rock at a time.\n   - Feel the surface (ask: bumpy or smooth?).\n   - Look at the color.\n   - Look for any lines, marks, or patterns on it (like in our special fossil photo).\n   - Use a magnifying glass to see small details (if available).\n   - On your paper plate, draw what the rock looks like or what you found interesting.\n   - Talk to your group friends about what you notice.\n\n4. **Teacher role:** Circulate among groups and use open-ended questions:\n   - *\"Tell me about the rock you're holding. What do you feel?\"*\n   - *\"Do you see any patterns or lines? What do they look like?\"*\n   - *\"Is this rock the same as the fossil rock we saw? How is it different?\"*\n   - **Do not tell students what fossils are yet** — let them explore and wonder.\n\n5. **Documentation:** Students draw their observations on paper plates. Teacher takes photographs of students exploring or their drawings.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will describe at least 2–3 physical features of rocks (color, texture, size).\n- Students will identify patterns or details on rocks.\n- Students will begin to understand that rocks vary in appearance.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce key vocabulary and explain fossil and rock concepts using exploration observations and the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The original fossil photograph (projected again)\n- Chart paper from Engage phase with student responses\n- A few sample rocks from the Explore activity\n- Picture cards or images showing:\n  - A modern animal (e.g., a shell, a leaf)\n  - The same type of fossil (ammonite, leaf fossil)\n  - A close-up of the fossil's details\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Gather students in a circle. Hold up 2–3 rocks from the Explore activity. Ask: *\"Who wants to tell us about a rock you found? What did it feel like? What color was it?\"* (Affirm all observations.)\n\n2. **Revisit the fossil photograph:**\n   - Project the image again.\n   - Say: *\"Remember this special rock? This rock is called a **fossil**. Let me tell you something amazing about it...\"*\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** (use visual supports and gestures):\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---------------------------|\n   | **Fossil** | A rock that shows us a very, very old plant or animal from a long, long time ago. It's like nature's photograph! |\n   | **Rock** | A hard, solid material that comes from the ground. Rocks are all around us—in dirt, on the beach, in mountains. |\n   | **Texture** | How something feels when you touch it—bumpy, smooth, rough, or scratchy. |\n   | **Pattern** | Lines, shapes, or marks that repeat or show a picture (like the shell shape in the fossil). |\n   | **Preserved** | Kept safe and kept the same for a very, very long time. The fossil kept the shape of the animal so we can see it now. |\n\n4. **Make connections back to the photograph and exploration:**\n   - *\"When we looked at our rocks, we saw bumpy ones and smooth ones, right? Well, this fossil is also a rock. But it has something really special inside it—it's the shape of a creature from millions of years ago!\"*\n   - Hold up a picture of a modern shell or leaf next to the fossil image: *\"Long, long ago, this shell (or leaf) was buried in sand and mud. Over and over and over again, more sand and mud covered it. The sand and mud turned into rock. And guess what? The shape of the shell stayed there in the rock. Now it's a fossil, and we can see what lived here a very, very long time ago!\"*\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: *\"Can you point to the fossil? What part of it looks like it could be from an animal?\"* (Have students point or gesture.)\n   - Ask: *\"Is a fossil a rock? How do you know?\"* (Expected: *\"Yes, because it's hard and solid like the rocks we picked up.\")\n   - Ask: *\"What do you think made this fossil? Was it a long time ago or yesterday?\"* (Expected: *\"Long, long ago.\")\n\n6. **Affirm student thinking:** *\"You are all rock scientists! You noticed patterns and textures in the rocks you explored, and now you know that fossils are special rocks that tell us about long, long ago.\"*\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (posted visually):**\n- **Fossil** = Very old plant or animal saved in rock\n- **Rock** = Hard, solid thing from Earth\n- **Texture** = How it feels (bumpy or smooth)\n- **Pattern** = Lines and shapes we can see\n- **Preserved** = Kept safe for a long time\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will understand that a fossil is a special rock containing an ancient plant or animal.\n- Students will use the vocabulary terms (fossil, rock, texture, pattern, preserved) with prompting.\n- Students will connect their exploration rocks to the fossil photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of fossils and rocks in a creative, hands-on activity; deepen learning through rock classification and fossil creation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Air-dry clay (1 ball per 2–3 students) or salt dough (flour, salt, water recipe prepared ahead)\n- Small objects to press into clay:\n  - Plastic shells, toy insects, leaves, shells from nature\n  - Forks, spoons, bottoms of containers (to create patterns)\n- Shallow trays or plates (1 per student or small group)\n- Optional: rolling pins or craft sticks to flatten clay\n- Labels: \"Smooth,\" \"Bumpy,\" \"Light,\" \"Dark\" (for sorting rocks)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the extension:**\n   Say: *\"We're going to make our own fossils! Long, long ago, animals and plants got buried in soft mud and sand. Over time, it turned into rock. We're going to pretend our clay is that mud. We'll press things into it to make a fossil, just like it happened in nature!\"*\n\n2. **Option A — \"Fossil Making\" (recommended for direct application):**\n   - Give each student or small group a ball of clay.\n   - Flatten it gently on a plate.\n   - Choose one small object (shell, leaf, or toy) and press it gently into the clay.\n   - Say: *\"Press slowly. Your fossil is being born!\"*\n   - Let the clay dry (or take a photo if time is limited).\n   - Have students observe the print left behind: *\"This is like the fossil we saw! The shape of the animal is saved in the clay-rock.\"*\n\n3. **Option B — \"Rock Sorting\" (for students who need scaffolding or more exploration):**\n   - Provide rocks from the Explore phase again, with visible category labels: \"Smooth,\" \"Bumpy,\" \"Light,\" \"Dark.\"\n   - Students sort rocks into piles based on texture and color.\n   - Ask: *\"Which rocks feel like the bumpy fossil? Which are smooth?\"*\n   - Create a class sorting chart with rocks taped to paper by category.\n\n4. **Teacher role:**\n   - Circulate and ask: *\"Tell me what your fossil looks like. What animal or plant is it from?\"*\n   - Affirm creative thinking: *\"What a wonderful fossil! You've preserved the shape!\"*\n   - Ask extension questions: *\"Do you think this fossil will stay in the clay for a very, very long time? Why?\"*\n\n5. **Share creations:** If time allows, have 3–4 students show their clay fossils and describe what they pressed into the clay.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create an imprint or model demonstrating understanding that fossils preserve shapes.\n- Students will classify rocks by observable properties (texture, color).\n- Students will explain (with prompting) that their clay fossil is like the real fossil because it shows the shape of something.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rocks, fossils, and their characteristics through observation and questioning.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist:** As you circulate, note:\n  - ✓ Student uses words like \"bumpy,\" \"smooth,\" \"light,\" \"dark\" to describe rocks\n  - ✓ Student recognizes that fossils are rocks\n  - ✓ Student can point to details in the fossil photograph\n  - ✓ Student connects their exploration to the fossil concept\n\n- **Questioning throughout:**\n  - *\"What is a fossil?\"*\n  - *\"How do you know a fossil is a rock?\"*\n  - *\"What could have left this mark in the fossil?\"*\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket — choose one format):**\n\n**Format 1 (Visual/Verbal):**\nShow the fossil photograph one more time and ask:\n1. *\"Point to the patterns you see. What do they look like?\"*\n2. *\"Is this a rock? How do you know?\"*\n3. *\"Something very, very old made this mark. Do you think it was a long time ago or yesterday?\"*\n\n**Format 2 (Drawing/Recording):**\nProvide a sheet with two boxes:\n- **Box 1:** Draw a rock you found today. Label it \"bumpy,\" \"smooth,\" \"light,\" or \"dark.\"\n- **Box 2:** Draw what you think made the fossil. Was it an animal? A plant?\n\nHave students draw and dictate labels for you to write.\n\n**Format 3 (Sorting/Performance):**\nPlace 5 rocks and the fossil photograph on a table.\nAsk: *\"Which of these rocks is most like the fossil? Why? What do you see?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student identifies that a fossil is a rock with something old preserved inside.\n- ✓ Student describes at least one physical feature (color, texture, or pattern) of a rock or fossil.\n- ✓ Student demonstrates (through drawing, pointing, or speaking) that they understand fossils come from very long ago.\n- ✓ Student sorts or groups rocks by at least one observable property (color or texture).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students (80%+) will recognize the fossil as a special rock and identify one physical feature.\n- Most students will use vocabulary introduced (fossil, rock, smooth, bumpy) with cueing.\n- Some students will spontaneously explain that fossils are from \"a long, long time ago.\"\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Provide a \"rock detective\" anchor chart** with pictures:\n   - Visual card showing bumpy, smooth, light, and dark rocks so students can reference during Explore and Elaborate.\n   - A picture of a fossil with arrows pointing to specific features you want them to notice.\n\n2. **Use hand-over-hand guidance during fossil creation:**\n   - If a student struggles to press into clay, gently guide their hand and say: *\"Feel the shape? That's like the fossil!\"*\n   - Reduce complexity by providing one pre-selected object to press (e.g., just a shell) rather than choices.\n\n3. **Partner struggling students with stronger peers during Explore:**\n   - Assign \"rock buddies\" so a student can observe and participate alongside a more verbal peer.\n   - Provide sentence starters: *\"This rock feels __________. It is __________ (color).\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Introduce \"paleontologist\" exploration:**\n   - Say: *\"Paleontologists are scientists who study fossils. Can you be a paleontologist and look for the shape of a creature in this fossil? What animal or plant do you think it is? Why?\"*\n   - Have them sketch and label their fossil \"discovery\" with detailed observations.\n\n2. **Compare two fossils:**\n   - If you have access to two different fossils (real or images), ask: *\"How are these fossils the same? How are they different? What different creatures made them?\"*\n\n3. **\"Fossil timeline\" activity:**\n   - Place 3 pictures in order: a modern animal → sand/mud → fossil in rock.\n   - Ask: *\"Can you put these in the right order? What happens first, second, and last?\"*\n   - Have them narrate the story of how the fossil formed.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Fossil Hunt\" — Classroom or Playground Exploration**\n   - Take students outside with collection bags to search for rocks and observe them.\n   - Back inside, compare found rocks to classroom rocks and the fossil photograph.\n   - Ask: *\"Did we find any fossils outside? Do our rocks look like the fossil?\"*\n   - Discuss: Where do rocks come from in our neighborhood? (Hills, gardens, building foundations.)\n\n2. **\"Salt Dough Fossil Art\" — Homework or Class Project**\n   - Send home a simple recipe (flour, salt, water) and instructions for families to make salt dough fossils with household items (pasta, leaves, toy figures).\n   - Students bring back dried fossils to display in a class \"Rock and Fossil Museum.\"\n   - Create labels: *\"[Student's name] made a [shell/leaf/dinosaur] fossil.\"*\n\n3. **\"Rock and Fossil Sort Anchor Chart\" — Ongoing Classification**\n   - Throughout the week, add rocks students find to a class chart sorted by color, texture, and size.\n   - Introduce categories: \"Smooth Rocks,\" \"Bumpy Rocks,\" \"Light Rocks,\" \"Dark Rocks.\"\n   - Revisit daily: *\"Can you find a smooth rock to add to our chart?\"*\n   - Take photos of the growing chart to show families what scientists do!\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Tips for Success:**\n\n- **Prepare rocks ahead of time** by collecting and cleaning them from outside, or purchase a classroom rock assortment kit (inexpensive and durable).\n- **Use the photograph repeatedly** — project it during each phase so students continuously reference and deepen their understanding.\n- **Normalize wonder:** When students ask *\"How old is the fossil?\"* or *\"What animal made it?\"* respond with: *\"That's a great scientist question! We don't know exactly, but we know it's very, very old!\"*\n- **Build vocabulary slowly** — Kindergarteners don't need to memorize all terms; repetition across multiple lessons is most effective.\n- **Connect to their world:** *\"Just like we found rocks in our playground, scientists find fossils in the ground all over the world!\"*\n\nThis lesson honors Kindergarteners' natural curiosity about objects, builds foundational Earth science vocabulary, and introduces the concept of geological time in an age-appropriate, concrete way.",
