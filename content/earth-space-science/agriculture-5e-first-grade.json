Students can observe that soil is an important part of Earth.\n- **Sunlight and plant growth:** The bright, clear sky and visible sunlight in the photograph indicate the role of sun's energy in helping plants grow on farms.\n- **Landforms and Earth's surface:** The photograph shows how humans change Earth's land through farming activities, demonstrating that the ground/land is dynamic and can be modified.\n- **Day and night patterns:** The photo captures late afternoon/evening sunlight with specific shadows and light quality, providing a concrete reference for discussing how sunlight changes throughout the day.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**Sun, Soil, and Farmer Friends**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** First Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 40-minute sessions (or can be consolidated into one 75-minute block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 1-ESS1-2: Make observations at different times of year to relate the amount of daylight to the time of year\n  - 1-ESS1-1: Use observations of the sun, moon, and stars to describe patterns that can be predicted\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Observe and describe the position and brightness of the sun at different times of day and explain how it helps plants grow.\n2. Identify soil as an important natural resource that comes from Earth and is used to grow food.\n3. Make predictions about when the sun will appear in the sky based on time of day patterns.\n4. Describe why farmers need both soil and sunlight to grow crops.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the farming operation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the green farm equipment on plowed soil\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student observation sheets (one per student, printed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it large. Ask students to sit where they can see it clearly. Say: \"Today we're going to explore a big picture of a farm. Look carefully and tell me what you see.\"\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (allow 5-10 seconds of think time before each):\n   - \"What do you see that is brown or dark in this picture? What is that?\" (Elicit: dirt, soil, mud)\n   - \"What do you see that is bright and yellow in the sky?\" (Elicit: the sun, light, bright)\n   - \"What does a farmer do with this soil and this bright light?\" (Elicit: grow food, grow plants)\n   - \"Have you ever helped someone plant a garden or grow food? What did you need?\" (Students share prior experiences)\n\n3. **Make a prediction prompt:** Say, \"This picture was taken in the afternoon when the sun is bright. If a farmer takes a picture tomorrow morning, where do you think the sun will be? Show me with your hand where the sun will be.\" (Guide students to point up and to the side, indicating the sun's position changes.)\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper: \"What do we want to know about farms, soil, and sunlight?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Great thinking! Now we're going to explore soil and sunlight ourselves to answer these questions.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the properties of soil and observe how sunlight affects their environment through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials (per pair or small group):**\n- Clear plastic cup or small container\n- Soil (potting soil or collected garden soil—about 1 cup per group)\n- Water in a small cup\n- Spoon or wooden stick for stirring\n- Paper towels\n- Magnifying glass (optional but helpful)\n- Two identical small plant seedlings (optional: fast-growing seeds like marigolds or beans, pre-sprouted if time is limited)\n- Two clear plastic bags or containers (one to place in sunlight, one in shade, for observing germination)\n- Hand lens or magnifying glass\n- Student investigation sheet (with pictures and simple sentences)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Soil Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Give each pair a container of soil. Say: \"This is soil. It comes from Earth. Let's be soil scientists and investigate it.\"\n\n2. **Step-by-step directions for students:**\n   - \"Look at your soil carefully. What color is it? What does it feel like?\" (Students touch and observe.)\n   - \"Use your magnifying glass to look really closely. Can you see tiny rocks or bits of plants?\" (Observe with lens.)\n   - \"Add a little water to your soil. Stir it gently. What happens? Does it get sticky? Does water soak in?\" (Observe water absorption and changes in texture.)\n   - \"Draw what your soil looks like on your investigation sheet.\"\n\n3. **Teacher facilitates:** Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice?\" \"Why might this be important for plants?\" \"Where do you think soil comes from?\" Do NOT tell students answers; let them discover through observation.\n\n4. **Students record:** On their sheet, draw the soil and write/dictate one word or sentence: \"Soil is ___.\"\n\n**Part B: Sunlight Observation (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. If using seedlings: Give each pair two small containers with seeds or young seedlings. Say: \"We're going to put one plant where the sun shines bright and one plant in a shadier spot. Then we'll watch them over a few days.\"\n\n2. **Alternative if no plants available:** Take students outside or to a window. Say: \"Find two spots—one where the sun shines bright and one where it's shady. Feel the difference. Which spot is warmer? Which is brighter?\"\n\n3. **Step-by-step directions:**\n   - \"Place one plant on a sunny windowsill (or in a sunlit area).\"\n   - \"Place the other in a shaded corner of the classroom.\"\n   - \"Every day for 3-4 days, observe: Is one plant looking greener or stronger? Is one taller?\"\n   - \"Draw pictures on your sheet showing what you see each day.\"\n\n4. **Teacher facilitates:** Ask: \"Which plant is getting more sunlight? How can you tell?\" \"Why might sunlight help plants grow?\"\n\n5. **Students record:** Sketch both plant locations and predict which will look healthier.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that soil has texture, color, and absorbs water.\n- Students observe that sunlight is bright and warm.\n- Students predict that the plant in sunlight will grow better.\n- Students document observations in drawings and simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts; connect exploration to the photograph and Earth science standards.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and illustrations\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Student vocabulary cards with pictures\n- Simple diagram showing the sun's position at morning, noon, and afternoon\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** \n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share one observation from their soil investigation: \"What surprised you about soil?\"\n   - Ask: \"Who put their plant in the sun? Who put theirs in the shade? What have you noticed so far?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary with student-friendly definitions (8 minutes):**\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Soil:** The brown, crumbly material on Earth that plants grow in. It is made from rocks, water, and once-living things.\n   - **Sunlight:** The bright, warm light and energy that comes from the sun. It helps plants grow and gives us warmth.\n   - **Sun:** A giant bright star in the sky that gives us light and warmth during the day.\n   - **Daylight:** The time when the sun is in the sky and it is bright outside. It happens at different times each day and changes with the seasons.\n   - **Natural resource:** Something from Earth that people use to live and grow food. Soil and sunlight are natural resources.\n\n   **How to introduce:** Show a simple picture or icon for each word. Use the photograph to point out the sun and ask: \"Where is the sun in this picture? Is it high in the sky or getting lower? Why do you think the farmer took this picture?\" (Guide students to see the angle of sunlight and shadows.)\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the soil in the farm photo: \"This is soil, just like what we explored. Farmers use it to grow food.\"\n   - Point to the bright sky and sun: \"See how bright the sun is? This sunlight is helping the crops grow in the soil.\"\n   - Say: \"The farmer is working in the afternoon. The sun is still bright. If the farmer came back early in the morning, where would the sun be?\" (Point to the eastern horizon; have students predict sun position.)\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Hold up a picture or object; ask: \"Is this soil? Is this sunlight? Is this a natural resource?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do plants need both soil AND sunlight?\" (Elicit: soil gives nutrients; sunlight gives energy.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary words in context.\n- Students explain that soil and sunlight are both needed for plant growth.\n- Students can point to or identify the sun and soil in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a farmer's plan and engaging in role-play or problem-solving.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or poster board (one per pair or small group)\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Pre-cut shapes: sun, soil, plants, rain clouds\n- Glue sticks\n- Optional: soil sample in a clear bag to glue onto poster\n- Picture cards of farms, gardens, and various times of day\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge (2 minutes):**\n   Say: \"Now you are farmers! You want to grow beautiful plants. You need to plan where to put your garden. You need to think about soil and sunlight.\"\n\n2. **Elaborate activity—\"Design a Farm Garden\" (13-18 minutes):**\n   - Give each pair/group a large sheet of paper.\n   - Say: \"Draw or paste your garden. Show where the sun is. Show where you will have soil. Draw plants growing. Remember: plants need BOTH sunlight AND soil to grow big and strong.\"\n   - Students may:\n     - Draw a sunny spot with soil and plants growing\n     - Glue a soil sample onto the paper\n     - Draw the sun in different positions (morning, afternoon)\n     - Add labels or dictate sentences: \"Our garden needs sunlight.\" \"We have good soil here.\"\n\n3. **Optional role-play extension (5 minutes):**\n   - Have 2-3 student volunteers act as farmers inspecting the gardens.\n   - Ask: \"Farmer, why did you put this garden in the sunny spot?\" \"What is the soil like here?\"\n   - Other students ask questions.\n\n4. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask:\n   - \"Tell me about your farm design. Why did you put your plants here?\"\n   - \"Where is the sunlight coming from?\"\n   - \"What does your soil look like?\"\n   Affirm student thinking and encourage elaboration.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a farm design showing both soil and sunlight.\n- Students explain why they chose a sunny location.\n- Students apply the concept that both resources are needed for growth.\n- Students use vocabulary in explaining their designs.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of soil, sunlight, and their roles in plant growth.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist during Explore:** Can students observe soil properties? Can they predict plant growth in sunlight vs. shade?\n- **Questioning during Explain and Elaborate:** Do students use vocabulary correctly? Can they explain why plants need soil and sunlight?\n- **Exit ticket (end of Session 2):** See below.\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple sheet showing three pictures:\n1. A plant in sunlight with soil\n2. A plant in shade with soil\n3. A plant with soil but no sun (or minimal sun)\n\n**Questions (read aloud; students point, draw, or dictate):**\n1. \"Which plant will grow the best? Point to it or circle it. Why?\" (Success: Student chooses Plant 1 and mentions sunlight or that it needs sun.)\n2. \"What does a plant need to grow?\" (Success: Student says \"soil,\" \"sunlight,\" or both. Accept drawings or dictation.)\n3. \"Where did the soil come from?\" (Success: Student says \"Earth,\" \"ground,\" or \"the dirt outside.\" Accept any response showing soil is a natural material from Earth.)\n\n**Alternate formative check during Explore phase:**\n- Observe whether students accurately describe soil texture and water absorption.\n- Listen to whether students predict plant growth differences based on sunlight.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student can identify soil and sunlight in the photograph.\n- ✓ Student can describe at least one property of soil (color, texture, absorbs water).\n- ✓ Student explains that plants need BOTH soil and sunlight (not just one).\n- ✓ Student makes a reasonable prediction about sun position changes during the day.\n- ✓ Student uses at least 2 vocabulary words correctly (soil, sunlight, sun, daylight, or natural resource).\n\n**How to determine if objectives were met:**\n- Review exit ticket responses and student farm designs.\n- Revisit the two seedlings planted in sunlight vs. shade after 3-4 days to confirm student predictions.\n- Observe discussions about the farm photograph; do students reference soil and sunlight without prompting?\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary scaffolding:** \n   - Introduce only two vocabulary terms instead of five: **soil** and **sun/sunlight**. \n   - Use repetition and real objects: Hold up soil, say \"soil\" three times; point to window with sun, say \"sunlight\" three times.\n   - Provide picture labels for all vocabulary so students can match pictures to words.\n\n2. **Concrete exploration focus:**\n   - Allow extra time in the Explore phase for sensory investigation of soil.\n   - Pair struggling students with stronger communicators so they can observe and learn through peer modeling.\n   - Provide pre-drawn outlines on investigation sheets; students only need to label or color rather than draw from scratch.\n\n3. **Simplified exit ticket:**\n   - Instead of written responses, use a \"thumbs up/sideways/down\" to show understanding: \"Do you think a plant needs sunlight to grow?\" (Thumbs up = yes, etc.)\n   - Allow dictation to teacher or aide rather than written/drawn responses.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extended sun observation:**\n   - Have students predict and observe sun position over several days (morning, noon, afternoon) by taking photos or sketching from the same location.\n   - Ask: \"Why does the sun look different at different times of day? What pattern do you notice?\" (Introduction to sun's apparent daily motion.)\n   - Have them track this on a simple map or diagram showing east, west, south, north.\n\n2. **Research and compare natural resources:**\n   - Provide picture cards of different soils (sandy, clay, rich garden soil).\n   - Ask: \"Which soil do you think is best for growing food? Why?\" \n   - Introduce the concept that different soils have different properties and that farmers choose good soil for their crops.\n\n3. **Design a problem-solving scenario:**\n   - Present: \"A farmer has a shady spot with great soil and a sunny spot with rocky soil. Where should they plant their crop?\" \n   - Have students debate, justify their choice, and think about trade-offs: Do you need sun more or good soil more?\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seasonal Sunlight Observation (ongoing):**\n   - Repeat the sun position observation over the next 2-3 months (winter, spring, summer).\n   - Create a class chart or poster showing \"Where is the sun?\" in December, February, April, and June.\n   - Ask: \"Does the sun look the same every month? When is the sun highest in the sky? When is it lower?\" This directly connects to 1-ESS1-2.\n\n2. **Farm Visit or Virtual Farm Tour:**\n   - Arrange a visit to a local community garden, farm stand, or u-pick farm in season.\n   - Alternatively, show video clips of farms and ask students to spot soil, plants, and sunlight.\n   - Have students photograph or sketch what they see and compare it to the original farm photograph.\n\n3. **Grow a Class Herb Garden:**\n   - Over 4-6 weeks, grow basil, mint, or cherry tomatoes on a sunny windowsill using the soil and sunlight concepts from the lesson.\n   - Have students measure plant height weekly, describe changes, and harvest leaves or fruit to use in the classroom (smelling activity, cooking, etc.).\n   - Create a graph showing plant growth over time, connecting to data observation and patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Timing:** The Explore phase with seedlings works best if spread over 3-4 days of observation, so consider running this lesson across two weeks with daily check-ins on plant growth.\n- **Materials sourcing:** Dollar stores and grocery stores carry small potting soil, seeds, and clear containers inexpensively. If outdoor soil is used, ensure it is safe (not treated with pesticides).\n- **Photograph connection:** Return to the farm photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. Have students point to soil and sun each time to anchor their learning.\n- **Accommodations:** For students with visual impairments, provide a tactile soil sample and describe the sun's warmth; for students with limited mobility, bring materials to them or adjust the layout so all students can participate.",
