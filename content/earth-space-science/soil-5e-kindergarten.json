Observe and describe what soil looks like, feels like, and what it contains.\n2. Explain that soil is where plants live and grow their roots.\n3. Identify that soil is made of different materials (rocks, dirt, and bits of plants).\n4. Recognize that plants need soil to grow strong and healthy.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge by examining the photograph of soil and plants.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of soil cross-section with grass/plants on top\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Small potted plant (if available, for tactile reference)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or in print form where all students can see it clearly. Point to the top part where the green plants are growing.\n\n2. **Ask engaging questions to spark curiosity:**\n   - \"What do you see growing on top of the ground?\" (Point to the grass/plants)\n   - \"What is the brown and dark stuff under the plants?\" (Point to the soil layers)\n   - \"Have you ever dug in dirt? What did it feel like?\"\n   - \"Why do you think plants are growing out of this brown stuff?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder... if we could look under the ground where plants grow, what might we find down there? Let's think about it!\" Encourage students to share wild and realistic predictions (rocks, worms, more dirt, water, roots, etc.). Record their ideas on chart paper without judgment.\n\n4. **Show or pass around a small potted plant:** \"Plants need soil to live, just like we need a house. Today, we're going to explore soil and discover why plants love it!\"\n\n**Transition:** Now let's get our hands dirty and discover what's really in soil by exploring it ourselves!\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate soil properties and discover that soil contains multiple materials and supports plant growth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small containers of potting soil (1 per pair of students, or 4-5 for group exploration)\n- Hand magnifying glasses (5-6)\n- Paper plates or shallow trays (1 per pair/group)\n- Wet wipes or damp paper towels\n- Small spoons for spreading soil\n- Small plant seedlings or seeds in soil cups (pre-planted; 2-3 for observation)\n- Paper and crayons for recording observations\n- Soil observation sheet (simple picture labels: rocks, dirt, plant bits, water)\n\n**Activity - Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Station Setup:** Divide students into pairs or small groups (no more than 3). Each pair gets a paper plate and a small container of potting soil.\n\n2. **Spread and observe:** \n   - \"Carefully spread a small handful of soil onto your paper plate.\"\n   - \"Use your eyes and magnifying glass to look closely at your soil. What do you see?\"\n   - Allow 3-4 minutes of sensory exploration without direction.\n\n3. **Feel the soil:**\n   - \"Now gently rub the soil between your fingers. How does it feel? Is it rough? Smooth? Wet? Dry? Crumbly?\"\n   - Students should notice texture variety within the soil.\n\n4. **Dig for items:**\n   - \"Use your spoon to mix the soil and see if you can find any special things inside.\"\n   - As students discover small rocks, twigs, or organic pieces, have them place them on the edge of their plate.\n\n5. **Observe the plant with roots:**\n   - Show students a pre-planted seedling cup or small potted plant with visible roots visible at the sides/bottom.\n   - \"Look! The roots of this plant are in the soil. The plant is living in the soil. Can you point to where the soil is touching the plant's roots?\"\n\n6. **Record observations:**\n   - Provide students with a simple picture chart showing: \"rocks,\" \"dirt/sand,\" \"plant bits,\" \"water.\"\n   - Students draw or mark with tally marks what they found in their soil sample.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate to each group and ask clarifying questions without leading:\n  - \"Tell me what you discovered.\"\n  - \"What does the soil feel like?\"\n  - \"Do you see anything that's not dirt?\"\n- Encourage students to use descriptive words (crumbly, bumpy, dark, wet, hard, soft).\n- Prompt students to compare their findings with a plant's roots: \"Why do you think the plant's roots grow into the soil?\"\n- Ensure no soil is ingested; use hand wipes afterward.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students discover that soil contains multiple materials (small rocks, sand/fine dirt, bits of leaves/twigs, and moisture).\n- Students observe that plants grow roots into soil.\n- Students use sensory language to describe soil (rough, crumbly, damp, cold, dark).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect discoveries to Earth and Space Science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Photograph from the Engage phase\n- Soil sample in clear container or in a clear plastic cup for demonstration\n- The observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:**\n   - Invite 3-4 groups to share what they found in their soil. Use sentence starters:\n     - \"In our soil, we found...\"\n     - \"The soil felt...\"\n     - \"We think plants grow in soil because...\"\n   - Display observation sheets on a board so the class sees they all found similar things.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with Kindergarten-friendly definitions:\n   - **Soil:** The brown, dark material on top of rocks under the ground where plants grow. Soil is made of broken-down rocks, sand, water, and bits of dead plants.\n   - **Roots:** The parts of a plant that grow down into the soil. Roots take in water and food from the soil to help the plant grow.\n   - **Minerals:** Tiny bits of rock in the soil that plants need to be healthy and strong.\n   - **Rock:** Hard material that breaks apart slowly to help make soil.\n\n3. **Revisit the photograph:**\n   - Point to the grass on top: \"This is the plant we can see.\"\n   - Point to the light brown/tan layer: \"This is the top soil—it has lots of good stuff for plants.\"\n   - Point to the deeper, darker layer: \"This is deeper soil—still full of materials that help plants.\"\n   - Point to visible roots: \"These are the roots. They go down into the soil to drink water and eat nutrients.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Show me with your hands—where do roots grow?\" (Students point down or make a digging motion.)\n   - Ask: \"Why did we find rocks in our soil?\" (Accept answers: rocks break into tiny bits; soil has rocks in it; plants need rocks to grow.)\n   - Ask: \"If we didn't have soil, what would happen to the plants?\" (Guide toward: plants couldn't grow; plants would fall over; plants wouldn't get food.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| **Soil** | The brown, crumbly stuff under our feet where plants grow. It's made of broken rocks, sand, water, and old plant bits. |\n| **Roots** | The parts of plants that grow down into the soil to suck up water and food. |\n| **Minerals** | Super tiny bits of rock mixed in soil that help plants grow big and strong. |\n| **Rock** | Hard chunks of material that break into smaller and smaller pieces to become part of soil. |\n| **Plant** | A living thing that grows in soil and needs water, soil, and sunlight. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students understand that soil is made of multiple materials (rocks, sand, water, plant bits).\n- Students understand that roots grow into soil.\n- Students can explain that plants need soil to grow.\n- Students use new vocabulary accurately in context.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a soil and plant model and exploring how soil helps plants live.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Clear plastic cups or clear jars (1 per pair)\n- Potting soil (pre-moistened)\n- Seeds (bean, sunflower, or marigold) or small seedlings\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Markers\n- Paper and crayons for illustration\n- Optional: roots visible to plants (radish seeds germinated in wet paper towels as a pre-made example)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Create a Soil Plant Home**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:** \"Now you're going to build a home for a plant. Just like soil helps the plant, we're going to help the plant by giving it soil!\"\n\n2. **Step-by-step:**\n   - Provide each pair with a clear cup and pre-moistened soil.\n   - \"Fill your cup halfway with soil. Press it down gently with your fingers.\"\n   - \"Now we're going to plant a seed. Make a small hole with your finger about the length of your pinky.\"\n   - \"Put a seed in the hole and cover it gently with soil.\"\n   - \"Give it a tiny drink of water from the spray bottle.\"\n   - \"Set your cup in a sunny window.\"\n\n3. **Prediction and documentation:**\n   - \"Predict: What do you think will happen to the seed in the soil?\"\n   - Students draw their prediction on paper.\n   - Label with name and date; place cups in a windowsill for observation over coming weeks.\n\n4. **Connection discussion:**\n   - \"The soil gives the seed water. The soil keeps the seed in place. The soil has minerals the plant needs. We're plant helpers, just like soil!\"\n\n**Option B: Observe Pre-Germinated Seeds**\n\n1. If seeds cannot be planted in-classroom, prepare bean seeds sprouted in damp paper towels 3-5 days prior.\n\n2. **Display the sprouted seed:**\n   - Show students a seed with visible white roots emerging.\n   - \"Look! This seed was in soil (or wet paper like soil) and now roots grew out! Roots need soil to grow into.\"\n\n3. **Illustration task:**\n   - Students draw a plant with roots in soil.\n   - Teacher or aide labels: plant, soil, roots.\n   - Students color and decorate.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions:\n  - \"Why are we putting the seed in soil instead of on a plate?\"\n  - \"What do you think the roots will do when they grow?\"\n  - \"How does the soil help the seed become a plant?\"\n- Encourage predictions and hypotheses without providing answers.\n- Ensure proper soil moisture and seed depth.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students create a model that demonstrates understanding of soil as a growing medium.\n- Students predict and observe plant growth in soil over time.\n- Students verbally explain that soil provides what plants need to grow (water, anchor for roots, minerals, nutrients).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of soil composition, plant-soil relationships, and the role of soil in plant growth.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n\n- **Observation during Explore:** Note which students correctly identified soil components (rocks, dirt, plant bits, water).\n- **Listen to explanations during Explain:** Track vocabulary use and student reasoning. Do students understand soil's role?\n- **Question prompts during Elaborate:** Assess predictions and observations. Do students explain cause-and-effect (seed + soil = growth)?\n\n**Summative Assessment - \"Soil Story\" Exit Activity (5-10 minutes):**\n\nUse one of the following methods to assess understanding:\n\n**Option 1: Picture Sort (Visual)**\n- Provide students with three pictures: (1) a seed in soil, (2) a seed on a table, (3) a seed in water with no soil.\n- \"Point to the picture where the plant will grow best. Why did you pick that one?\"\n- Student points to (1) and explains: \"The plant needs soil\" or \"Roots go in soil.\"\n- **Success Criteria:** Student selects the correct image and provides any reasoning related to soil.\n\n**Option 2: Verbal Exit Ticket (Conversation-Based)**\nAsk each student as they leave (can be quick, 20-30 seconds):\n1. \"What do we find inside soil?\" (Expect: rocks, dirt, plant bits, water)\n2. \"Where do plant roots grow?\" (Expect: in soil, under the ground, down)\n3. \"Why do plants need soil?\" (Expect: to grow, to drink water, to hold them up)\n\n- **Success Criteria:** Student answers at least 2 of 3 questions with accurate, complete answers.\n\n**Option 3: Draw-and-Label (Written/Visual)**\n- Provide paper divided in half: one side labeled \"Before\" (a seed), the other \"After\" (the same plant grown).\n- \"Draw what happens to a seed when you plant it in soil.\"\n- Student includes soil, roots, and plant growth.\n- **Success Criteria:** Drawing shows soil, roots underground, and a growing plant above ground.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes - Evidence of Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n\n- ✓ **Learning Objective 1 (Observe soil):** Students describe soil using at least 2 sensory words (crumbly, rough, dark, damp) and identify 2+ materials found in soil.\n- ✓ **Learning Objective 2 (Soil supports plants):** Students explain that plants live in soil or that \"soil is where plants grow\" or \"roots go in soil.\"\n- ✓ **Learning Objective 3 (Soil composition):** Students identify soil contains rocks, dirt, plant bits, and/or water during exploration or explanation phases.\n- ✓ **Learning Objective 4 (Plants need soil):** Students state that plants need soil to grow, with or without adult prompting by lesson's end.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Scaffolding for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary and definitions:**\n   - Use only 2-3 core vocabulary words: soil, roots, and plant.\n   - Define soil simply: \"The brown dirt where plants grow.\"\n   - Skip mineral vocabulary; focus on visible soil components instead.\n\n2. **Hands-on exploration extension:**\n   - Allow additional sensory time (5+ minutes) in the Explore phase; some students need longer to process tactile input.\n   - Provide a soil sample in a sealed plastic bag if students are hesitant to touch soil directly (sensory sensitivity).\n   - Use larger materials (larger rocks, bigger twigs) for easier discovery.\n\n3. **Visual supports and modeling:**\n   - Provide a photograph or real example of roots and soil before asking students to explain the relationship.\n   - Use teacher-drawn simple diagrams (plant above ground in green, soil below in brown, roots in between) throughout the lesson.\n   - Pair students with a more confident peer during Explore and Elaborate phases.\n\n### Challenge (Extensions for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deepen investigation into soil layers:**\n   - Introduce the concept of \"topsoil,\" \"subsoil,\" and \"bedrock\" using the photograph's visible layers.\n   - Challenge: \"Why do you think the soil is darker on top and lighter below? What might be different about each layer?\"\n   - Activity: Layer soil, sand, and pebbles in a clear cup to show soil stratification.\n\n2. **Explore soil's role in the water cycle:**\n   - \"Where does water go when it rains? Does soil drink the water? Where does the plant's water come from?\"\n   - Plant a seed and observe the soil moisture level as the plant grows; create a watering schedule chart.\n   - Introduce the idea: \"Soil holds water like a sponge, and plants drink it through their roots.\"\n\n3. **Investigate what lives in soil:**\n   - Show photographs or short videos of soil organisms (worms, bugs, fungi).\n   - Challenge: \"What else might be living in the soil with the plant roots? Why?\"\n   - Optional hands-on: Create a worm habitat or observe a compost bin to see decomposition and soil-making in action.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Soil Journal Over Time (1-2 weeks following lesson):**\n   - Students planted seeds in the Elaborate phase. Create a simple observation chart with three columns: \"Week 1,\" \"Week 2,\" \"Week 3.\"\n   - Each week, students draw what they observe in their planted cup: \"Is the plant growing? Are there leaves? Roots visible?\"\n   - Discussion: \"How did the soil help the plant grow? What did we give the soil (water)? What did the soil give the plant?\"\n   - **Connects to:** K-ESS3-1 (recognizing the plant's need for soil and environment).\n\n2. **Soil Scavenger Hunt - Outdoor Extension:**\n   - Take students outside (school yard, playground, garden, or nearby park).\n   - Distribute magnifying glasses and paper.\n   - Task: \"Find three places where soil is different. Is it darker somewhere? Lighter? Wetter? Drier?\"\n   - Record with drawings or photos.\n   - Discussion: \"Why is soil different in different places? What do you think is in the soil under the playground vs. under the flowers?\"\n   - **Connects to:** K-ESS3-1 and K-ESS2-2 (observing how plants live in different soil environments).\n\n3. **Make Edible \"Soil\" - Sensory/Molecular Activity:**\n   - **Materials:** Chocolate wafer cookies (crushed), chocolate pudding, gummy worms, whipped cream, cups, spoons.\n   - Create layers: pudding (water/minerals), crushed cookies (soil), gummy worms.\n   - Discussion: \"Our real soil has rocks, water, and sometimes tiny creatures. This pretend soil has similar layers. But this soil you can eat!\"\n   - Taste and compare: \"Does our pretend soil feel like the real soil we explored? What's the same? What's different?\"\n   - **Connects to:** Sensory review and fun reinforcement of soil concepts; K-ESS3-1.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Assessment Tools\n\n### Simple Observation Checklist for Teacher\n\n| Student Name | Identified soil materials | Used sensory words to describe soil | Explained that plants need soil | Understood roots grow down | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | |\n| | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | |\n\n### Picture Sort Assessment Printable (Option 1)\nProvide three simple illustrations:\n- **Image A:** Seed on top of a table (no soil)\n- **Image B:** Seed in brown soil in a pot\n- **Image C:** Seed in a cup of water only\n\nStudent indicates Image B and explains why soil is important.\n\n---\n\nThis 5E lesson plan is now ready to implement.
