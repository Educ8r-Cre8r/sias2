Exploring Soil, Erosion, and Earth's Garden**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fourth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (90 minutes total)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 4-ESS2-1 (Effects of weathering and erosion)\n  - 4-ESS3-1 (Natural resources derived from Earth)\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. Observe and describe the layers and composition of soil using evidence from investigations.\n2. Explain how weathering and erosion change Earth's surface by testing the effect of water and vegetation on soil.\n3. Identify soil as a natural resource that living things depend on for survival and growth.\n4. Compare how soil with plants and soil without plants responds differently to water and erosion.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image of the squirrel in the garden\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: soil sample in a clear container to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (write student responses on chart paper):\n   - \"What do you notice about where this squirrel is standing? What can you see under and around the animals?\"\n   - \"The squirrel is holding an orange piece of food. Where do you think this food came from—what does it need to grow?\"\n   - \"Look at the soil. Why do you think some areas have plants growing in them and other areas look bare?\"\n   - \"If it rains hard on this garden, what do you think will happen to the soil? Will it stay in the same place or move?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what's actually *inside* the soil that we can't see. Let's become soil scientists and dig into this mystery!\"\n\n4. **Pass around the soil sample** (if available) so students can observe texture, color, and feel.\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do some hands-on exploration to discover what soil is made of and how it changes.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 clear plastic cup or jar\n- Soil (approximately 2 cups per group)\n- Water (pitcher or spray bottle)\n- Small plants or grass clippings\n- Paper towels\n- Observation sheet (template provided below)\n- Craft stick or spoon for stirring\n- Optional: sand, pebbles, leaf litter to add to soil samples\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Exploring Soil Composition (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute soil samples** to each group. Provide this student direction:\n   - \"Spread your soil on a paper towel. Using your craft stick or spoon, gently break apart the soil.\"\n   - \"Look closely. Draw or list what you see in your soil. Is it all the same? What colors do you see? Do you notice any rocks, sticks, or other materials mixed in?\"\n   - \"Rub a small pinch of soil between your fingers. How does it feel? Is it rough, smooth, sticky, or crumbly?\"\n\n2. **Record observations** on the observation sheet (picture + words).\n\n**Part B: Testing Erosion with and Without Plants (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide the group's soil** into two cups:\n   - **Cup A (Control):** Plain soil, no plants\n   - **Cup B (Variable):** Soil with grass clippings or small plant inserted\n\n2. **Tilt both cups at a slight angle** (rest the cup rim on a block or book so it's sloped).\n\n3. **Slowly pour water** down the slope of Cup A. Students observe and record:\n   - \"Does the water move through the soil or over it?\"\n   - \"Does the soil move with the water? Where does it go?\"\n   - \"What happens to the water?\"\n\n4. **Repeat with Cup B** (soil with plants). Record observations:\n   - \"Does the water move differently?\"\n   - \"Does the soil wash away the same way?\"\n   - \"What job does the plant do?\"\n\n5. **Students draw pictures** showing what happened in both cups and write one-sentence conclusions.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice happening? Is it the same in both cups? What's different?\"\n- Avoid explaining; prompt students to describe what they see using their own words.\n- Provide additional water if needed for clearer observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that soil is made of many materials (rocks, dirt, organic matter).\n- Students discover that water runs through soil and carries it away (erosion).\n- Students notice that plants slow down or prevent soil erosion.\n- Students record observations in drawings and simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words pre-written\n- Projected photograph (original squirrel image)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n- Optional: cross-section diagram of soil layers (pre-made poster)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their observations from the Explore phase.\n   - Ask: \"What did you find in your soil? What happened when water was added?\"\n   - Record findings on chart paper. Highlight differences between Cup A and Cup B.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Display words on chart paper and discuss each:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Soil:** A natural resource made up of tiny broken rocks, dead plants, and other materials. Soil is where plants grow and where many animals live.\n\n- **Weathering:** The slow process where rocks and land are broken down into smaller pieces by water, wind, ice, or plant roots. (Connect: \"In our exploration, the water started to break apart the soil.\")\n\n- **Erosion:** The movement of soil and rocks from one place to another, usually by water, wind, or gravity. (Connect: \"In Cup A, the water washed the soil downhill—that's erosion!\")\n\n- **Natural resource:** Something from nature that humans and animals need or use to survive. (Connect: \"Soil is a natural resource because plants need it to grow, and the squirrel eats plants grown in soil.\")\n\n- **Vegetation:** Plants that grow in an area, including grass, flowers, and trees. (Connect: \"The grass in Cup B slowed down the erosion. Plants protect the soil!\")\n\n3. **Make connections back to the photograph (4 minutes):**\n   - Point to the original image: \"Look at where the squirrel is standing. The bare soil areas (where no plants are) could erode more easily if it rains hard. But see how thick the grass and flowers are? Those plants hold the soil in place!\"\n   - \"Soil is a natural resource that plants need to grow. The squirrel depends on this garden for food, which depends on healthy soil.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Quick question: \"If we removed all the plants from a hillside, what do you think would happen to the soil when it rains?\"\n   - Listen for students to connect: more erosion, soil washes away, plants can't grow without soil.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that soil is a complex natural resource.\n- Students grasp the relationship between weathering, erosion, and vegetation.\n- Students connect their Explore observations to formal vocabulary.\n- Students can explain why plants are important for protecting soil.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or poster board\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- Magazine pictures or printed images of different landscapes (hillside, garden, bare field, forest)\n- Optional: photos of erosion problems (gully erosion, mudslides, riverbank erosion)\n- Scenario cards (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario-Based Problem Solving:**\n\n1. **Divide the class into groups** and assign each group one scenario:\n\n   - **Scenario 1:** \"A farmer just planted a new field. There's heavy rain coming. What can the farmer do to prevent erosion?\"\n   - **Scenario 2:** \"A community built a park on a bare hillside with no plants. Soil keeps washing away. How could they reduce erosion?\"\n   - **Scenario 3:** \"A river is flooding and carrying away topsoil from the banks. The soil is washing into the river and making it muddy. What natural solution could help?\"\n   - **Scenario 4:** \"Construction workers removed all the trees from a forest to build a road. Now the soil is eroding fast. What could they do to fix this?\"\n\n2. **Group task:** Students create a labeled diagram or poster showing:\n   - The problem (erosion/weathering happening)\n   - The cause (why is the soil eroding?)\n   - The solution (how does their solution use vegetation or other methods?)\n   - Labels using vocabulary from the Explain phase\n\n3. **Gallery walk:** Groups post their solutions and view others' ideas (3 minutes).\n\n4. **Brief discussion:** \n   - \"What solutions did different groups use? Did most groups use plants or vegetation? Why?\"\n   - \"What does this tell us about how nature protects itself?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide guiding questions if groups struggle: \"What did the plants do in Cup B? Could plants help in this scenario?\"\n- Validate all reasonable answers; emphasize that preventing erosion often involves adding vegetation.\n- Prompt deeper thinking: \"Would this solution work on a steep mountain? Why or why not?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply knowledge of weathering and erosion to real-world contexts.\n- Students recognize vegetation as a natural solution to erosion problems.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that Earth systems (soil, water, plants) are interconnected.\n- Students generate multiple possible solutions (higher-order thinking).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of soil, erosion, and natural resources.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Did students accurately describe soil composition and differences between erosion with/without plants?\n- Vocabulary check-in during Explain phase: Can students explain weathering vs. erosion?\n- Group discussions during Elaborate phase: Are students connecting vegetation to erosion prevention?\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket**\n\nDistribute an exit ticket (half-sheet of paper) with the following prompts. Students respond in drawings, words, or both:\n\n1. **\"Draw and label what you learned about soil. What's in soil? Show at least 3 things.\"**\n\n2. **\"Look at this picture [show a bare hillside vs. a vegetated hillside side-by-side].\"**\n   - **A:** \"Which hillside will have more erosion when it rains? Circle A or B.\"\n   - **B:** \"Why? Use the word 'erosion' or 'weathering' in your answer.\"\n\n3. **\"Complete this sentence: Soil is a natural resource because…\"**\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student accurately identifies multiple components of soil, correctly identifies which area will erode more and explains using vocabulary, and explains soil's role as a natural resource for plants/life.\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student identifies some soil components, makes a reasonable prediction about erosion with partial explanation, and mentions soil's importance.\n\n✓ **Beginning:** Student shows emerging understanding of soil, makes a guess about erosion without clear reasoning, or provides minimal explanation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that soil is composed of multiple materials.\n- Students explain the relationship between vegetation and erosion prevention.\n- Students articulate that soil is a natural resource essential for life.\n- Students use Earth and Space Science vocabulary accurately.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pair with a stronger reader/writer:** During the Explore phase, assign a buddy to help record observations. The struggling student can draw detailed pictures while the partner writes labels and simple sentences.\n\n2. **Provide a soil observation checklist:** Instead of open-ended observation, give a pre-made checklist: \"I see: ☐ tiny rocks ☐ brown dirt ☐ sticks ☐ other ___.\" Students check boxes, reducing the cognitive load of generating descriptions.\n\n3. **Use sentence stems for explanations:** During the Explain and Evaluate phases, offer frames:\n   - \"Soil is made of ________________.\"\n   - \"The plants helped because ________________.\"\n   - \"Erosion happens when ________________.\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Investigate soil layers and composition:** Ask students to create a more detailed soil profile diagram showing different layers (topsoil, subsoil, bedrock). Have them research and label what lives in each layer and why.\n\n2. **Test variables in erosion:** Challenge advanced groups to design a controlled experiment with different slopes, water amounts, or soil types. Ask: \"How does the *angle* of the slope affect erosion speed? What about different soil types?\"\n\n3. **Research and present real-world erosion solutions:** Have advanced learners research one erosion problem (e.g., gully erosion in a specific region, mudslides, riverbank erosion) and present multiple solutions, explaining the pros and cons of each.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Create a Rain Garden Model:** Students design a small-scale rain garden using a clear container, layers of soil, and plants. They pour water through it and observe how the garden filters water and prevents erosion. Connect to water conservation and stormwater management.\n\n2. **Soil Profile Investigation:** Provide cross-sections of real soil (from a local garden store or create using layered sand, soil, and gravel in a clear jar). Students draw and label the layers, discussing what lives in each layer and why soil structure matters for different organisms.\n\n3. **Erosion in the Playground:** Take students on a nature walk around the school grounds. Locate areas with erosion (bare patches on hillsides, gullies, washed-away soil near downspouts). Document with photos or sketches. Back in the classroom, propose solutions for reducing erosion in these real locations (e.g., \"Should we plant grass here? Add wood chips? Create a rain barrel?\"). Write persuasive letters to the principal with evidence-based recommendations.\n\n4. **Compare Soil Types:** Obtain soil samples from different locations (forest, desert, clay-heavy area, sandy beach if possible). Students test and compare: color, texture, water absorption rate, and what grows in each. Graph results and discuss how different soils support different plants and organisms.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wash hands after handling soil. Use non-toxic, pesticide-free soil samples.\n- **Preparation:** Pre-collect soil samples the day before, or use commercially available potting soil for consistency.\n- **Inclusivity:** The photograph features both living and non-living components of Earth systems. Some students may be interested in the animal; others in geology. Honor both entry points to the concepts.\n- **Real-world connection:** If your region experiences erosion issues (flooding, landslides, construction-related runoff), reference these to increase relevance.\n- **Photography link:** Invite students to take photos of erosion or vegetation in their neighborhoods to create a class exhibit titled \"Protecting Our Soil.\"\n\n---\n\nThis lesson seamlessly moves from observation (the squirrel's garden setting) through investigation (hands-on erosion testing) to application (real-world scenarios), ensuring students understand both the **why** (plants protect soil resources) and the **how** (weathering and erosion are natural processes that vegetation can mitigate).",
