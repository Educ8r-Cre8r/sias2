Observe and describe how frost forms on plants during cold winter weather using scientific vocabulary.\n2. Record daily weather conditions (temperature, presence of frost) in a table and explain patterns they notice.\n3. Identify ways plants and people adapt to or protect themselves from freezing temperatures.\n4. Make a claim about how a winter design (clothing, plant covering, or building feature) helps protect against cold weather and frost damage.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about frost and winter weather patterns using the photograph as an anchor.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital display of the ornamental grass photograph (frost-covered)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"Wonder Board\" (a designated wall space or poster for questions)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it large. Do NOT explain what students are looking at yet. Ask them to look silently for 20 seconds and notice details.\n\n2. **Ask guiding questions calibrated for Third Grade:**\n   - \"What do you notice covering the grass and flowers in this picture? What does it look like?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the grass looks white and sparkly? Have you ever seen plants look like this?\"\n   - \"When do you think this picture was taken? What time of year might this be?\"\n   - \"If you touched these plants, what do you think they would feel like? Cold? Wet? Hard?\"\n\n3. **Prediction/Wonder Prompt:** \"Let's say this is a plant in your backyard. What do you wonder might happen to it if it got even colder? Would the frost help it or hurt it?\"\n\n4. **Record 2-3 student wonderings on the Wonder Board** to revisit at the end.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today we're going to become Frost Detectives. We'll explore how frost forms and why it matters to plants and people during winter.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate frost formation through a hands-on experiment and observe real-world weather data.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Ice cubes (prepared ahead)\n- Small potted plant or fresh plant leaves in a cup of water (brought to room temperature)\n- Thermometers (one per pair of students, or one class set)\n- Shallow trays or plates\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Paper towels\n- Observation sheets (see below)\n- Access to a freezer or very cold outdoor area (ideal: -10°C or 14°F or colder)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Frost Formation Mini-Experiment (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Divide students into pairs.** Each pair receives:\n   - One ice cube on a tray\n   - One thermometer\n   - One spray bottle with water\n   - An observation sheet (simple, with spaces to draw and write)\n\n2. **Student Directions (read aloud and display visually):**\n   - \"Spray your ice cube lightly with water from the bottle—just a little mist.\"\n   - \"Now watch what happens over the next 2-3 minutes. Does the water freeze? Does it stick to the ice?\"\n   - \"Feel the thermometer—it shows how cold things are. Is your ice cube very cold?\"\n   - \"Draw what you see happening to the water on your ice cube.\"\n   - \"Write one sentence: 'When water touches very cold ice, it _______.' \"\n\n3. **Teacher Role:** Circulate and ask questions:\n   - \"What's happening to that water droplet?\"\n   - \"Is it getting hard and solid? That's freezing!\"\n   - \"Can you feel how cold the ice is with the thermometer?\"\n   - **Do NOT say \"frost is forming\"**—let students observe and describe.\n\n4. **Students document observations** with drawings and simple written descriptions on observation sheets.\n\n**Part B: Real Weather Observation (5 minutes)**\n\n5. **Show students a 3-day weather chart** (prepared by you in advance, or displayed from a weather app):\n   - Dates and temperatures (e.g., Monday -5°C, Tuesday -8°C, Wednesday 2°C)\n   - Visual indicators of frost or no frost\n   - Simple weather icons\n\n6. **Ask:** \"On which days was it cold enough for frost to form? How do you know?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe water freezing onto ice and describe it (hard, cold, white, sparkly).\n- Students match cold temperatures with frost formation.\n- Students create simple drawings/writing showing they understand ice and water are connected.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and clarify the frost formation process using Explore evidence.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Enlarged photograph (same as Engage)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore\n- Picture cards showing: water vapor, condensation, freezing, frost\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 pairs to share their drawings and what they discovered about the ice and water.\n   - Display their sheets on a board or wall.\n   - Ask the class: \"What happened when cold water touched the very cold ice?\"\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Explanation (10 minutes):**\n\n   \"Great observations! Now I'm going to explain what's happening. Look at our photograph again. See all those sparkly, white crystals? That's **frost**.\"\n\n   **Create a simple visual anchor chart while explaining:**\n\n   ```\n   FROST FORMATION\n   \n   Step 1: WATER VAPOR (invisible water in the air)\n           ↓\n   Step 2: CONDENSATION (water vapor touches something very cold)\n           ↓\n   Step 3: FREEZING (water freezes into ice crystals)\n           ↓\n   Result: FROST (beautiful ice crystals on plants!)\n   ```\n\n   - **Point to the photograph:** \"See the grass? Water from the air touched the cold grass last night and froze into those crystals. That's frost!\"\n   - **Connect to their ice experiment:** \"Remember how the water droplets froze on your ice cube? That's similar to how frost forms on grass!\"\n   - **Emphasize seasonal connection:** \"Frost happens when it gets very cold—usually in fall, winter, and early spring.\"\n\n3. **Key Vocabulary (with student-friendly definitions):**\n\n   | Term | Third Grade-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|-----------------------------------|\n   | **Frost** | Tiny ice crystals that form on plants and ground when it gets very cold |\n   | **Freezing** | When water turns hard and becomes ice because it gets very, very cold |\n   | **Temperature** | How hot or cold something is (we measure it with a thermometer) |\n   | **Winter** | The coldest season of the year, when frost and snow are common |\n   | **Weather** | What the air outside is like (hot, cold, rainy, sunny, etc.) |\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your hands: How big are the frost crystals on the grass?\" (small, like grains of salt)\n   - \"Can frost form when it's warm outside? Why or why not?\" (No, because water doesn't freeze when it's warm)\n   - \"What do we call the invisible water in the air?\" (water vapor)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students define frost and freezing in their own words.\n- Students can explain the connection between cold temperature and frost formation.\n- Students recognize frost as a seasonal, weather-related phenomenon.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of frost and winter weather to real-world protection scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Picture cards or photographs showing winter adaptations (plant covers, frost-resistant plants, winter clothing, heated buildings, etc.)\n- Design paper (large, half-sheet)\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- Optional: plant sample (like a small ornamental grass similar to the photo) that students can examine\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Design Challenge: \"Protect the Plant from Frost\"**\n\n1. **Set the Scenario (2 minutes):**\n   - \"Imagine you have a beautiful plant like the one in our photograph. It's now late fall, and frost will come soon. You need to design a way to protect it from freezing and frost damage. What would you do?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Design Ideas (3 minutes):**\n   - Show picture cards of real winter protections:\n     - Plant covers or blankets\n     - Moving plants inside\n     - Mulch around roots\n     - Spraying plants with water (farmers do this!)\n   - Ask: \"Which of these ideas would work? Why?\"\n\n3. **Student Design Task (10 minutes):**\n   - **Individual or partner work:** Students draw and label their design solution for protecting a plant from frost.\n   - **Prompt on board:** \"Draw your design. Label it. Write one sentence: 'My design works because _______.' \"\n   - Students should include a label for their design and one reason why it protects against frost.\n\n4. **Gallery Walk or Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Students post designs around the room or share with a partner.\n   - Ask: \"Which designs would keep frost from forming? Which would keep the plant warm?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"How does your design stop frost? What part of keeping the plant warm does it do?\"\n- Guide students toward designs that acknowledge cold temperatures: \"Would a blanket help because it keeps heat around the plant?\"\n- Accept creative solutions (moving plants, building a greenhouse idea, etc.).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students sketch a realistic design for frost protection.\n- Students write a claim connecting their design to preventing frost damage.\n- Students show understanding that frost occurs in cold weather and protection reduces harm.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of frost, winter weather, and design solutions through formative and summative strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing, during all phases):**\n- **Observation Notes:** Circulate during Explore and Elaborate; note which students:\n  - Can describe frost formation using vocabulary (frost, freezing, water, cold)\n  - Connect temperature to frost occurrence\n  - Propose logical design solutions\n- **Questions During Discuss:** Listen to student responses to check-for-understanding questions.\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes, end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (digital or printed). Students respond with drawings and/or words:\n\n1. **Question 1 (Observation & Vocabulary):**\n   - \"Look at this photo of frost again. What is frost made of? (Circle one: ice crystals / water / snow)\"\n   - Students should circle \"ice crystals\" with confidence.\n\n2. **Question 2 (Temperature Connection):**\n   - \"Frost forms when the temperature is _______. (Circle: very warm / very cold / medium)\"\n   - Students should circle \"very cold.\"\n\n3. **Question 3 (Real-World Application):**\n   - \"Name one way to protect a plant from frost damage.\" (Draw or write)\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student response shows understanding that the method prevents or reduces freezing (e.g., cover, move inside, add mulch).\n\n4. **Question 4 (Reflection—Optional, for advanced learners):**\n   - \"When you see frost on grass in the morning, what season do you think it probably is? Why?\"\n   - **Success Criteria:** Student identifies fall, winter, or early spring and connects to \"cold weather.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ **All students:** Correctly identify frost as ice crystals formed in cold weather; describe one protection method.\n- ✓ **Most students:** Explain the connection between freezing temperatures and frost formation using vocabulary.\n- ✓ **Some students:** Make logical claims about design solutions and test their thinking against alternatives.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that frost is frozen water vapor.\n- Students can match frost formation to cold winter temperatures.\n- Students propose a realistic design solution that reduces frost damage to plants.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for students who need scaffolding)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Chart:** Create a visual chart with pictures (frost, freezing, temperature, winter) that students can reference during activities. Pair struggling students with strong observers during Explore.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames:** Provide sentence starters for writing and speaking:\n   - \"Frost forms when the temperature is _______.\"\n   - \"I can protect a plant by _______.\"\n   - \"In the photo, I see _______.\"\n\n3. **Hands-On Thermometer Practice:** Before the lesson, practice reading a thermometer with concrete examples: \"This is cold [show -5°C]; this is warm [show 20°C]; frost forms at _______ [point to cold end].\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Weather Data Analysis:** Provide a week of real weather data (temperature, frost yes/no, precipitation). Ask: \"On which days would you expect frost? How do you know? Can you predict tomorrow's frost based on the temperature?\"\n\n2. **Frost Prevention Research:** Ask students to investigate and present: \"How do farmers protect crops from frost? What method do they use?\" (Answer might include: frost cloth, irrigation, burning frost, heaters.) Students create a presentation or poster.\n\n3. **Compare Seasonal Weather Patterns:** Use 3-ESS2-1: Ask students to compare frost occurrence across three seasons (fall, winter, spring). Create a table showing temperature and frost occurrences; identify which season has the most frost and why.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Winter Weather Journal (Multi-day Follow-Up):**\n   - Over 2 weeks, students check for frost on school grounds or at home each morning.\n   - They record the date, temperature (from a weather app or thermometer), whether frost was present (yes/no), and weather conditions in a simple table.\n   - After 2 weeks, they graph their data: \"On how many days did frost form? What temperatures did frost form at?\"\n   - This directly supports **3-ESS2-1** (represent weather data in tables and graphical displays).\n\n2. **Design a Winter Shelter (Elaborate Extension):**\n   - Challenge students to design a protective structure (greenhouse, cold frame, plant cover) using craft materials (paper, cardboard, plastic wrap, aluminum foil).\n   - Discuss insulation: \"Which materials keep heat in? Which materials let light in so plants can still grow?\"\n   - This connects to **3-ESS3-1** (design solutions to reduce weather hazards).\n\n3. **Frost and Ice Observation Walk:**\n   - On a cold morning (if frost is present), take students outside for a 10-minute observation walk.\n   - Ask them to find different types of frost: on grass, on leaves, on metal, on pavement.\n   - Compare textures and shapes: \"Why does frost look different on different surfaces?\"\n   - Collect leaf or plant samples (with permission) to examine under a magnifying glass indoors.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Success\n\n- **Timing Note:** This lesson works best when real winter weather and frost are present or expected. If teaching in a warm climate, use the photograph as the primary reference and adjust the Explore activity to simulate conditions (ice cubes in a cold space).\n- **Safety:** Ensure students handle ice cubes and thermometers carefully; supervise freezer access if used.\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Use the photograph throughout the lesson as a visual anchor. Point back to it in every phase.\n- **NGSS Alignment:** The lesson hits 3-ESS2-1 (weather data, seasonal patterns) during the Explain and Evaluate phases and 3-ESS3-1 (design solutions) during Elaborate and Extension activities.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson empowers Third Grade students to observe, wonder, experiment, and design—the heart of science thinking—while building deep understanding of a visible, seasonal phenomenon they'll encounter throughout their lives.",
