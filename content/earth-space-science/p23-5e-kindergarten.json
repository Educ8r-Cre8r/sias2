Observe and describe how water moves rocks and soil in their local environment.\n2. Explain that water can change the shape of land over time.\n3. Identify different sizes and colors of rocks and soil found near water.\n4. Discuss ways to protect streams and hillsides from too much washing away.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color photograph (at least 8.5\" × 11\", or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Optional: small dish of water and a handful of soil\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (one at a time, wait for responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Can you point to something?\" (Accept: rocks, water, dirt, stream, plants)\n   - \"Where is the water moving? What is it moving?\" (Guide them to see flowing water carrying rocks and soil)\n   - \"Why do you think some rocks are big and some are tiny?\" (Accept predictions; hint: the water may have broken them)\n   - \"What do you think happened here? How did it look before?\" (Encourage imagination and wonder)\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what happens to all these rocks and dirt when it rains hard and more water comes down the hill? Let's find out!\"\n\n4. **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be water detectives and see how water can move rocks and change the land, just like in this picture.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how water moves materials through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Shallow trays or aluminum pans (one per pair or small group) — at least 9\" × 12\"\n- Potting soil or playground dirt (approximately 2 cups per tray)\n- Small rocks and pebbles (mixed sizes: 1/4\" to 1\" diameter) — 1 cup per tray\n- Water in pitchers or spray bottles\n- Spoons or small shovels\n- Paper towels\n- Optional: measuring tape or string\n- Observation recording sheet (simple pictures or boxes to draw in)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Setup:** Arrange students in pairs or small groups (3-4 students). Give each group one tray. Have them build a \"hillside\" by:\n   - Pushing soil to one side of the tray to create a slope\n   - Scattering rocks and pebbles across the slope\n   - Patting it down gently\n\n2. **Investigation:** Direct students:\n   - \"Slowly pour water at the top of your hillside. Watch what happens to the rocks and dirt.\"\n   - Allow water to flow naturally down the slope for 15-20 seconds.\n   - Stop and observe.\n   - Repeat 2-3 times, allowing students to notice patterns.\n\n3. **Student observations to document** (students draw or point out):\n   - Where did the rocks move?\n   - Where did the soil move?\n   - Did big rocks move the same as small rocks?\n   - Where did the water go?\n   - What does the hillside look like now compared to before?\n\n4. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice? Which rocks moved? Why do you think that happened?\"\n   - Do NOT say \"water erodes soil\"—let them observe and describe it themselves.\n   - Encourage students to pour more water or try pouring in different spots.\n   - Help students make comparisons: \"Is this hillside the same as before, or different?\"\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students observe that water moves small rocks and soil down the slope.\n   - They notice bigger rocks don't move as much as smaller ones.\n   - They see that water collects at the bottom of the tray (creating a \"stream\").\n   - They begin to see cause-and-effect: **water makes things move and change**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect hands-on discovery to the original photograph and Earth processes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with key vocabulary and pictures\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Optional: picture cards of streams, mountains, rain\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:**\n   - Invite groups to share one thing they noticed: \"What did the water do in your hillside?\"\n   - Record their observations on chart paper using their words (e.g., \"The water moved the little rocks,\" \"The dirt went to the bottom\").\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** (with pictures and gestures):\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|----------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Stream** | Moving water that flows downhill and can move rocks and dirt. |\n| **Erosion** | When water, wind, or weather moves rocks and soil from one place to another. |\n| **Sediment** | Tiny pieces of rock and dirt that get carried by water. |\n| **Slope** | A hill or side that goes up or down. |\n| **Weather** | The way it looks outside (sunny, rainy, windy). |\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph:**\n   - \"Remember this picture? Let's look at it again. Those brown and white rocks—the stream moved them there!\"\n   - Point to visible water flow: \"See the water here? It's doing the same thing your water did—moving rocks and dirt.\"\n   - Point to the green plants: \"These plants stay in one place so they don't wash away.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If we have a big rain, what do you think will happen to this hillside?\" (Guide them: more water = more rocks and dirt move)\n   - Ask: \"Are the rocks here now the same as they were before the water moved them?\" (Affirm: the stream changed them)\n\n5. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students understand that **water moves rocks and soil** and changes the land.\n   - They use the word \"stream\" to describe flowing water.\n   - They understand that the photograph shows a real example of what they just did in their trays.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to a real-world scenario and think about protecting Earth's water and land.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The hillside trays from Explore (with soil/rocks still in them)\n- Additional materials: sticks, leaves, paper, grass clippings, or cardboard pieces\n- Water pitchers\n- Chart paper titled \"How to Protect the Hillside\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-world scenario:** \"What if that hillside in the picture is near someone's house or a road? The water keeps moving all the dirt and rocks. How could we slow down the water or protect the hillside?\"\n\n2. **Student experimentation:**\n   - Give groups their trays again.\n   - Introduce materials: sticks, leaves, paper, grass, etc.\n   - Challenge: \"Try placing some of these materials on your hillside. Then pour water again. Does the water move as much stuff? What happened?\"\n   - Groups test and observe.\n\n3. **Real-world connection:**\n   - Share: \"In real life, people plant trees, bushes, and grass on hillsides. The roots hold the soil in place so the water doesn't wash it all away.\"\n   - Show a simple picture of planted hillside vs. bare hillside if available.\n\n4. **Class discussion:**\n   - \"What helped stop the water from moving so much?\"\n   - \"How do plants help protect the land?\"\n   - Record their ideas on \"How to Protect the Hillside\" chart (accept: plants, rocks, trees, bushes, grass).\n\n5. **Teacher Role:**\n   - Facilitate without directing the answer. Ask: \"What do you think will happen if we add those sticks?\"\n   - Celebrate discoveries and encourage comparisons to their first experiment.\n\n6. **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n   - Students discover that **natural materials can slow down water flow**.\n   - They make the connection: **plants protect the land**.\n   - They begin thinking about solutions to environmental problems in an age-appropriate way.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of how water moves rocks and soil, and why protecting land matters.\n\n**Activity — Three-Part Assessment:**\n\n#### **Formative Assessment (During lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** (teacher records during Explore and Elaborate):\n  - ☐ Student accurately describes how water moves rocks/soil\n  - ☐ Student notices differences between small and large rocks\n  - ☐ Student identifies materials that slow water movement\n  - ☐ Student uses vocabulary: stream, water, rocks, soil, move, change\n\n#### **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes):**\n\nConduct a quick one-on-one or small-group interview using these prompts:\n\n1. **Show the original photograph again.** \"What is the water doing to the rocks and dirt in this picture?\" (Success: Student says water is moving them, washing them away, or something similar)\n\n2. **Picture-sort or pointing activity:** Show or describe three scenarios:\n   - A bare, muddy hillside in the rain\n   - A hillside with trees and grass\n   - A stream with rocks and water\n   \n   \"Point to the one where plants are helping protect the land.\" (Success: Student selects the hillside with trees/grass)\n\n3. **Open-ended reflection:** \"What did you learn about water and rocks today?\" (Success: Student mentions water moves things, changes land, or need for plants)\n\n#### **Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they can:\n- **Describe** what water does to rocks and soil (moves, carries, washes away—using own words)\n- **Compare** what happens with and without plants/materials present\n- **Predict** what might happen in similar situations (e.g., after heavy rain)\n- **Identify** a reason to protect hillsides and streams\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### **Support (For struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Focus on just \"water,\" \"rocks,\" \"move,\" and \"change.\" Skip complex terms like \"erosion\" and \"sediment\" initially; revisit later.\n\n2. **Guided observation:** Pair students with a stronger peer during Explore phase. Ask leading questions: \"Look—did the small rock move? Did the big rock move?\"\n\n3. **Concrete visual support:** Use the photograph and the tray experiment side-by-side throughout the lesson. Physically point to matching features: \"See the water here [photo] and here [tray]?\"\n\n### **Challenge (For advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Design engineering task:** \"Design a barrier to stop the water from washing away ALL the dirt. What would work best? Why?\"\n\n2. **Prediction and hypothesis:** Before pouring water, ask: \"If we use bigger rocks, do you think the water will move them? Why or why not? Let's test your idea.\"\n\n3. **Extension vocabulary:** Introduce \"weathering\" and \"transportation\" informally: \"The water is like a delivery truck—it picks up dirt and rocks and delivers them down the hill!\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Class nature walk:** Take students to a local stream, creek, or drainage area (with permission). Have them observe rocks of different sizes, look for plant growth on banks, and sketch what they see. Discuss: \"How is this like our trays?\"\n\n2. **Rainy day observation:** On a rainy day, take photos or video of water flowing down the playground or parking lot. Revisit these images and ask: \"What is the water moving? Where is it going?\" Connect to the lesson.\n\n3. **Seed planting project:** Plant grass seed or fast-growing seeds in one tray (no slope, flat), keep another tray bare. Over 2-3 weeks, occasionally water both and observe which holds together better. Discuss why: \"Plants are holding the soil together with their roots!\"\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure water play is supervised. Use trays to contain spills. Have paper towels ready.\n- **Timing flexibility:** This lesson can span two 45-minute sessions (Engage + Explore on Day 1; Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2).\n- **Inclusive access:** Pair students flexibly; allow verbal and non-verbal responses (pointing, drawing, gesturing).\n- **Real-world connection:** This lesson naturally connects to local storms, rain, and outdoor observation—use these teachable moments to reinforce concepts.",
