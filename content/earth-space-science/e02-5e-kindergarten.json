Describe what they observe about hills, valleys, and different landforms in a landscape.\n2. Explain why people might choose to build homes on hills or in valleys based on their needs (protection, views, shelter).\n3. Identify weather conditions (clouds, haze, clear sky) visible in photographs and discuss how weather changes what we see.\n4. Model how plants and trees help keep our environment healthy and provide homes for animals.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about landforms, buildings, and weather by examining a dramatic landscape photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed color copy of the photograph (or projected on screen)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard for recording observations and questions\n- Markers (multiple colors)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the photograph at eye level where all students can see clearly. Give them 30 seconds of silent looking time.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Questions:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Point to something and tell me about it.\" (Look for: big building, trees, hills, hazy sky, city in distance)\n   - \"Where is the house in this picture—is it high up or down low?\" (Encourage: on a hill, up high, on the mountain)\n   - \"What do you see in the sky? Does it look clear and sunny or cloudy and hazy?\" (Accept all observations; record on chart)\n   - \"Why do you think someone built a big house way up here on this hill?\" (Record student predictions: \"To see far away,\" \"To be safe,\" \"To look at the view,\" etc.)\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder why people build homes in different places. Let's explore what we can learn from this hill and the home on it!\"\n\n**Teacher Notes:** Accept all student responses without judgment. Record questions and observations on chart paper—this becomes your reference throughout the lesson. This is *their* curiosity driving the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Great questions! Today we're going to explore hills and valleys using our own hands, and then we'll think about why this house sits right where it does.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students use tactile and kinesthetic learning to understand how landforms (hills and valleys) are shaped and how they affect where things can be built.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Brown playdough or modeling clay (one ball per student or pair)\n- Shallow trays or cookie sheets (one per pair of students)\n- Small plastic toy houses or figures (1-2 per pair)\n- Green tissue paper or green construction paper scraps (to represent trees/plants)\n- Spray bottle with water (for demonstration only, teacher-controlled)\n\n**Activity: \"Make Your Own Hill and Valley\"**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Take your ball of clay and place it in the middle of your tray.\"\n\n2. \"Use your fingers and hands to squeeze and push the clay to make a hill—make it tall and bumpy, just like the hill in our picture!\"\n\n3. \"Now, use your finger to poke and slide down from the top of your hill to make a valley—a low place between hills.\"\n\n4. \"Look at your landscape. Where would you put the small house? On the tall hill or in the valley? Pick a spot and place your house there.\"\n\n5. \"Tear or place green paper scraps around your hills and valleys to show trees and plants. Spread them all around—not just one spot!\"\n\n6. \"Now use your finger to trace a path from your house down to the valley. Think: Would water from rain roll down this path?\"\n\n**How It Connects to the Photograph:**\n- Point out: \"Just like the big house in our photo sits on a real hill, your house sits on the hill you made. The real house has trees all around it, like your green paper plants.\"\n\n**What Students Record/Document:**\n- Students should show their finished model to a partner and answer: \"Why did you put your house where you did?\" (Encourage: \"To see far,\" \"Because it's higher up,\" \"The trees protect it\")\n- Teacher takes a quick photo of 3-4 student models for documentation.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"Tell me why you chose that spot for your house.\" \"What do you think happens when rain falls on your hill?\" \"Where are your trees?\"\n- Do NOT tell students where to place the house—let them decide and justify.\n- Model the activity once with a demonstration clay model before students begin.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a 3D model showing understanding that hills are raised landforms and valleys are low places between them.\n- Students place a structure on a chosen location and can verbally explain at least one reason for their choice (safety, view, shelter, trees nearby).\n- Students demonstrate awareness of vegetation by adding \"plant\" elements to their landscape.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student exploration to concepts of landforms, weather, and human needs.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with student observations from Engage phase\n- Printed photograph (or projected)\n- Large word cards with pictures: HILL, VALLEY, TREES, WEATHER, HOME\n- Optional: tactile model (one teacher-made clay landscape) for reference\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share-Out from Explore:**\n   - Invite 3-4 students to show their clay models and explain where they put their house and why.\n   - Record their reasons on chart paper: \"Hills are high places,\" \"Trees help plants,\" \"Houses need good spots.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (with Kindergarten-Friendly Definitions):**\n\n   - **HILL:** A big bump of land that goes up high. (Point to the photo: \"See the hill with the house on it?\")\n   \n   - **VALLEY:** A low place between hills where the land goes down. (Use your hand to show: dip down in the middle, up on both sides)\n   \n   - **LANDFORM:** The shape of the land—like hills, valleys, mountains. (Point: \"These are all landforms. The house sits on a landform.\")\n   \n   - **WEATHER:** What it is like outside—sunny, cloudy, rainy, windy, hot, or cold. (Show the photo: \"Look at the sky. It looks cloudy and hazy. That's the weather.\")\n   \n   - **TREES and PLANTS:** Living things that grow in the ground and need sun, water, and soil. (Point to green in the photo: \"All those trees help keep the Earth healthy.\")\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph:**\n   - Display the photo again. Say: \"This house is built on a **hill**. Around it are lots of **trees** and **plants**. The sky shows us the **weather**—you can see haze and clouds.\"\n   - Ask: \"Where are the hills in this photo? Where do you see valleys?\" (Have students point and describe.)\n   - Ask: \"What does the weather look like today in our photo? Is it clear and sunny or cloudy and hazy?\" (Record observations.)\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Quick partner talk: \"Turn to a friend and point to a hill on the photo. Tell your friend: 'That is a hill because...'\"\n   - Listen in on 2-3 pairs. Correct gently if needed: \"Right! Hills are high bumps of land!\"\n\n**Vocabulary Reference Chart:**\nCreate a visual anchor chart with each word, a simple drawing, and a photo example from the lesson photo. Leave this posted for Elaborate and Evaluate phases.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary words: hill, valley, weather, trees, home when discussing the photograph.\n- Students show understanding that hills are raised landforms and that weather is visible in the sky.\n- Students can point to and name at least one landform and one weather feature in the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Deepen understanding by applying concepts to real-world context (why homes are built where they are) and how humans depend on natural features.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Three large floor circles made from tape or drawn areas (labeled: \"HILL,\" \"VALLEY,\" \"FLAT GROUND\")\n- Picture cards or simple drawings representing: rain, wind, sun, animals, trees\n- Optional: Local map or aerial photo of your own community (if available)\n\n**Activity: \"Where Should We Build?\"**\n\n1. **Scenario Setup:**\n   Explain: \"We need to build a new school. We have three choices: on a **hill**, in a **valley**, or on **flat ground**. Let's think about what's best!\"\n\n2. **Exploration by Landform:**\n   - Create three stations (or discussion circles) labeled HILL, VALLEY, and FLAT GROUND.\n   - At each location, ask students in small groups: \"If our school was here, what would be good? What would be hard?\"\n   - Introduce the picture cards showing rain, wind, sun, animals, trees.\n   - Ask: \"Where would we see trees? Where would rain go? Where is it windy?\"\n\n3. **Guided Discussion:**\n   - \"On the **hill**: We can see far away. Lots of wind. Trees are all around. The house in our photo is on a hill—why do you think?\"\n   - \"In the **valley**: It's lower, more protected. Water from rain goes down there. Animals might drink from water there.\"\n   - \"On **flat ground**: Easy to build, but no view. Less protection from wind.\"\n\n4. **Make a Decision Together:**\n   - Ask the class: \"For our school, which place is best? Why?\" (There's no single right answer—the goal is reasoning.)\n   - Vote or chart responses: \"Who thinks the hill? Valley? Flat ground?\"\n   - Discuss: \"The house in our photo chose the hill. What are some reasons?\" (View, protection, height, trees nearby for shade)\n\n5. **Real-World Connection (if appropriate for your students):**\n   - \"Look at our neighborhood. Where are buildings in our town? Are they on hills, valleys, or flat ground? Can you spot them from the window?\" (Brief observation if possible)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended \"why\" and \"what if\" questions.\n- Guide without dictating the \"right\" answer.\n- Validate all reasoning as long as students explain their thinking.\n- Connect their ideas back to the original photograph continuously.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students articulate at least one reason why a location might be chosen for a building (protection, view, trees, drainage of water).\n- Students demonstrate understanding that landforms affect where humans choose to live and build.\n- Students recognize that natural features (trees, hills, water) influence human choices.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of landforms, weather, and why humans build homes in specific places.\n\n**Activity: Multi-Method Assessment**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observe clay models** during Explore: Do students show a hill/valley and place a house with reasoning?\n- **Listen to explanations** during Explain: Do students use vocabulary (hill, valley, weather, trees)?\n- **Watch participation** during Elaborate: Can students discuss why places are chosen for buildings?\n- **Check-in questions:** Ask 3-4 students at random: \"Show me a hill in this photo. Why do you think the house is up there?\"\n\n**Summative Assessment: \"Show What You Know\"**\n\nUse **one of the following** methods (choose based on your class):\n\n**Option 1: Photo Labeling & Drawing** (most concrete for K)\n- Show the photograph again.\n- Ask each student to point to or circle:\n  - A hill\n  - A tree or plant\n  - The house\n  - The cloudy sky (weather)\n- Follow-up question: \"Why do you think the house is on the hill?\" (Record their 1-2 sentence response; scribe if needed.)\n\n**Option 2: Oral Interview** (small group or individual)\n- Show the photo.\n- Ask: \n  - \"What is the shape of the land here? Is it a hill or a valley?\"\n  - \"What do you see in the sky? (weather observation)\"\n  - \"Why did someone build a house on this hill?\"\n  - \"What plants or trees do you see?\"\n\n**Option 3: Gesture & Movement** (kinesthetic)\n- Call out statements; students respond by doing:\n  - \"Show me a hill with your hands!\" (Students raise hands high)\n  - \"Show me a valley!\" (Students dip their hands down)\n  - \"Show me a tree!\" (Students stand tall with arms up)\n- Ask: \"Is this place good for a home? Why or why not?\" (Thumbs up/down + verbal explanation)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\nStudents have met the learning objectives if they can:\n1. ✓ Point to or identify at least ONE landform (hill or valley) in the photograph.\n2. ✓ Describe the weather visible in the sky (cloudy, hazy, sunny, etc.).\n3. ✓ Give at least ONE reason why someone might build a home on a hill (view, protection, shelter from wind, near trees, etc.).\n4. ✓ Recognize that trees and plants are part of the landscape.\n\n**How to Determine Success:**\n- Document responses with photos, notes, or short video clips of students explaining.\n- If students meet 3 out of 4 criteria, they have solid understanding.\n- If students meet all 4, they have strong mastery of K-ESS standards.\n- If students meet 1-2 criteria, they need reinforcement in Extend/Re-teach phase.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will identify the hill and house.\n- Most students will describe the sky as cloudy or hazy.\n- Most students will give a reason related to height (\"up high\"), view, or trees.\n- Advanced students will make connections to protection, water drainage, or animal habitat.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplify Vocabulary Focus:**\n   - Focus on only **HILL** and **HOUSE** in Explain phase.\n   - Teach these two terms repeatedly and have students repeat.\n   - Use the photograph multiple times, always labeling these terms.\n\n2. **Guided Clay Model:**\n   - Provide a pre-made hill in a tray (teacher-prepared ahead of time).\n   - Student task becomes only: \"Place the house on this hill. Where would you put it?\" and \"Add trees around it.\"\n   - This reduces cognitive load while maintaining the core exploration.\n\n3. **Simplified Assessment:**\n   - Instead of open-ended \"why,\" use yes/no questions:\n     - \"Is this a hill?\" (point to photo)\n     - \"Are there trees here?\"\n     - \"Do you see clouds in the sky?\"\n   - Accept pointing and one-word answers; scribe their response for the record.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Multi-Landform Models:**\n   - Provide a larger tray and ask students to build **multiple hills with valleys between them**.\n   - Challenge: \"Create a place where rain would gather (valley) and a place where the sun would shine most (hilltop).\"\n   - Ask: \"How would animals use each part of your landscape?\"\n\n2. **Weather Connections:**\n   - Ask: \"If it rains heavily on the hill in this photo, where would the water go? Would it stay on the hill or roll to the valley?\"\n   - Have them trace water paths on their clay model and predict where water would collect.\n\n3. **Decision-Making Task:**\n   - Provide scenario cards:\n     - \"You need to build a garden. Where would you put it—on the hill or valley?\"\n     - \"You need to protect trees from strong wind. Hill or valley?\"\n   - Challenge them to justify using 2-3 reasons and Earth science vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### Extension 1: \"Weather Watch Over Time\"\n**For Days 3-5 (ongoing after this lesson)**\n- Create a simple weather chart with columns: SUNNY, CLOUDY, HAZY, RAINY.\n- Each day, look out the window or at your local photo and mark the current weather.\n- After one week, discuss: \"What weather did we see the most? The least?\"\n- Connection: Just like the photo showed a cloudy, hazy day, we're watching how weather changes—**connecting to K-ESS2-1**.\n\n### Extension 2: \"Animal Homes on the Hill\"\n**For Follow-Up Lesson (30 minutes)**\n- Show students the photograph again and ask: \"What animals might live in these trees?\"\n- Create a chart: \"Hill Animals,\" \"Valley Animals,\" \"Tree Animals.\"\n- Use picture cards or have students draw pictures of animals they think live in hills, valleys, or trees (birds, squirrels, rabbits, insects).\n- Activity: \"Build a hill, then add pictures or toy animals where they would live.\"\n- Connection: **K-ESS3-1** (Relationship between animal needs and the places they live).\n\n### Extension 3: \"We Care for Our Hill\" (Environmental Stewardship)\n**For Follow-Up Lesson (20-30 minutes)**\n- Ask: \"In the photo, there are lots of trees on the hill. Why are trees important?\"\n- Brainstorm together: \"Trees give shade. Trees give homes for animals. Trees clean the air.\"\n- Activity: \"How can we help the trees and hills near our school or home?\"\n  - Create a simple poster with student suggestions: \"Don't throw trash on hills,\" \"Water trees,\" \"Plant seeds,\" \"Leave space for animals.\"\n- Connection: **K-ESS3-3** (Solutions to reduce human impact on the environment).\n\n---\n\n## Materials Checklist\n\n- [ ] Printed or projected photograph\n- [ ] Brown playdough/modeling clay (enough for each student)\n- [ ] Shallow trays or cookie sheets\n- [ ] Small plastic toy houses or figures\n- [ ] Green tissue paper or construction paper scraps\n- [ ] Spray bottle (teacher use only)\n- [ ] Chart paper and markers\n- [ ] Word cards: HILL, VALLEY, TREES, WEATHER, HOME\n- [ ] Tape (for floor circles or labeling)\n- [ ] Camera or phone for documentation\n- [ ] Optional: Local community map or aerial photo\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Timing:** This lesson works best spread over two days (Engage + Explore on Day 1; Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2). However, you can compress to one long session if needed.\n- **Classroom Management:** Clay models can get messy. Have wet wipes ready, and consider aprons or old shirts to protect clothing.\n- **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Keep the \"HILL, VALLEY, WEATHER, TREES, HOME\" poster up for the rest of the unit—you'll reference these terms repeatedly.\n- **Photograph Engagement:** Return to this exact photograph multiple times throughout the lesson. Kindergarteners need repetition to build understanding; familiarity with the image builds confidence and deeper thinking.\n- **Student Voice:** This lesson prioritizes student prediction and reasoning over \"correct\" answers. Honor their thinking, even if it's unexpected—this develops scientific curiosity.\n\n---\n\n**You're all set!** This lesson honors the Kindergarten learner by balancing concrete hands-on exploration, playful discovery, and guided vocabulary introduction. It keeps them centered on the compelling photograph while building foundational Earth and Space Science understanding. Enjoy the hill-building! 🏔️",
