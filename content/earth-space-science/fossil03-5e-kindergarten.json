Identify rocks as natural materials found in their environment and describe their properties (color, texture, size).\n2. Observe and communicate that some rocks contain evidence of living things from long ago.\n3. Use rocks and natural materials to create impressions that show how fossils form.\n4. Explain that rocks and fossils are part of Earth that we should care for and protect.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about rocks and the special marks found on them.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected image or printed enlargement of the fossil photograph (at least 8.5\" × 11\")\n- Chart paper and marker\n- Small basket or container of classroom rocks (5-6 samples)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Display & Introduction:**\nHold up the fossil photograph and say: *\"Look at this special rock! It has something very interesting on it. Do you see those pretty lines? Can you guess what made them?\"*\n\nAllow students to look closely at the projected image for 30 seconds without comment.\n\n**Discussion Questions (calibrated for Kindergarten):**\n1. *\"What do you see on this rock? What does it look like to you?\"* (Accept all answers: a leaf, a fan, lines, a fish, wings, etc.)\n2. *\"Have you ever found a rock like this? Where do rocks come from?\"*\n3. *\"What if I told you that this mark in the rock came from a plant or animal that lived a very, very, very long time ago? What do you think happened?\"*\n4. *\"Can you make a shape in the dirt or sand? How is that like what we see in this rock?\"*\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n*\"Today we're going to be fossil detectives. We'll hunt for rocks in our classroom, make our own fossil marks, and discover the stories that rocks tell.\"*\n\n**Teacher Notes:** Use dramatic, wondering tone. Validate all student theories. Write student ideas on chart paper: *\"Our Ideas About This Special Rock.\"*\n\n**Transition:** \n*\"Let's go explore and find rocks in our classroom, and then we'll make our own fossil marks to see how this happens!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students manipulate rocks and natural materials to discover how impressions and marks form, mimicking fossil formation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Play dough or modeling clay (enough for each student, 2-3 oz.)\n- Tray or paper plate per student\n- Found objects with interesting textures: leaves, twigs, plastic dinosaur/animal toys, shells, pine cones, textured buttons, carved forks, plastic leaves\n- Optional: small sand/soil bins (rice or dried beans work too if no access to actual sand)\n- Aprons or smocks (optional but recommended)\n- Wet paper towels for cleanup\n- Magnifying glasses (optional but helpful)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1 — Rock Hunt (5 minutes):**\nHave students bring a small rock from home (assigned previous day) or provide rocks from your classroom collection. Ask: *\"What do you notice about your rock? Is it smooth or bumpy? What color is it? Feel it. Is it hard?\"*\n\nDocument observations on a class chart: *\"What We Notice About Rocks.\"*\n\n**Step 2 — Make Impressions (12-15 minutes):**\n\nTeacher demonstrates first:\n- Flatten a ball of play dough on the tray.\n- Press a shell or leaf firmly into it.\n- Remove it slowly.\n- Say aloud: *\"Look! The shape is pressed into the clay, just like the mark in the fossil rock. The shell left a copy of itself!\"*\n\n**Student turns:**\n1. Give each student a ball of clay. Have them flatten it like a pancake on their tray.\n2. Choose one object from the material collection and press it firmly into the clay.\n3. Press hard for 3-5 seconds, then lift slowly.\n4. Observe the impression left behind.\n5. Try 2-3 different objects if time allows.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: *\"What do you see? What made this mark? Can you tell what made the impression without looking at the object?\"* \n- Help students who struggle with hand strength.\n- Validate observations without correcting guesses.\n- Take photos of student work if possible.\n- Ask: *\"Do you think this is how the mark got into the rock in the picture?\"*\n\n**Documentation:**\nStudents can point to their favorite impression and tell a neighbor: *\"This is a _____ mark. I pressed it hard.\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that pressing objects into clay creates visible impressions.\n- Students make the connection: *\"The rock has a mark because something pressed into it a long time ago.\"*\n- Students realize rocks aren't just random — they have a story.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and anchor learning in Earth and Space Science concepts through guided discussion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with student impressions displayed or photos projected\n- Original fossil photograph\n- Vocabulary cards with images (printed or hand-drawn)\n- Three actual rocks of different types (if available) to handle and observe\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\nInvite 3-4 students to hold up their clay impressions and tell the class:\n- *\"What did you press into the clay?\"*\n- *\"How does it look like the mark in the special rock?\"*\n\nAs students share, say: *\"You're all fossil scientists! You made impressions just like what happened millions of years ago.\"*\n\n**Key Vocabulary Introduction (8 minutes):**\n\nIntroduce each term by pointing to examples, using the photograph, and having students repeat after you. Use simple, repetitive language.\n\n1. **Rock** — *\"A rock is a hard, natural thing from Earth. (Hold up a rock.) Rocks are everywhere — in your backyard, at the beach, in the park. What things did we do with rocks today?\"* (Students: pressed things into clay, felt them, looked at them.)\n\n2. **Fossil** — *\"A fossil is a mark or shape in a rock that shows us an animal or plant from long, long, long ago — before your grandparents' grandparents were born! (Point to photograph.) This fossil shows that something lived here a long time ago.\"*\n\n3. **Impression** — *\"An impression is a mark pushed into something soft. Today you made impressions in clay. (Hold up student work.) Long ago, animals and plants made impressions in mud and sand. After a long, long time, the mud became hard like rock!\"*\n\n4. **Natural Resource** — *\"Rocks and fossils are natural resources. That means they come from Earth and we use them. We can collect them, study them, and care for them so they last a long time.\"*\n\n**Connection Back to Photograph & Activity (4 minutes):**\n\nDisplay the fossil photograph again and the student impressions side by side.\n\nSay: *\"Look! Your impressions and the fossil rock are the same kind of thing. Both have marks pushed into them. Both tell a story. The difference is: your clay impression is fresh and new, but the fossil mark is so, so old that the mud turned into rock. That's called fossilization.\"*\n\nPoint to the photograph: *\"This fossil tells us: 'A long time ago, an animal lived here. It touched the mud. The mud got harder and harder until it became rock. Now we can see what that animal looked like!'\"*\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n\nAsk individual students questions:\n- *\"What is a rock? (Answer: something hard from Earth)\"*\n- *\"What is a fossil? (Answer: a mark that shows an old animal or plant)\"*\n- *\"How did your clay impression remind you of the fossil? (Answer: both have marks pressed in)\"*\n\nProvide sentence frame for English learners: *\"A fossil is ___.\" (Answer: a mark that shows an old animal/plant)*\n\n**Vocabulary Chart:**\nDisplay on the wall with simple drawings or photos next to each word:\n- **Rock** — hard, natural material\n- **Fossil** — a mark showing old animals or plants\n- **Impression** — a shape pressed into something soft\n- **Natural Resource** — something from Earth we can use and care for\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word *fossil* correctly to describe the marks.\n- Students understand that fossils are old impressions that became hard.\n- Students recognize that the rock in the photo contains a story from the past.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply fossil and rock concepts to a new context (classroom/outdoor environment) and practice caring for natural resources.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper titled \"Our Rock Collection Needs Care\"\n- Actual rocks collected from playground or school garden (clean, safe ones)\n- Small containers or baskets for rock collection\n- Pictures or drawings of where rocks are found (beach, mountains, desert, river, park)\n- Optional: outdoor space for rock hunting\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A — Fossil Detective Hunt (Classroom/Outdoor) (10 minutes):**\n\nTake students on a guided hunt around the classroom, hallway, or outdoor area to find rocks.\n\nAs you find each rock, hold it up and ask:\n- *\"Is this rock smooth or bumpy?\"*\n- *\"Could a fossil be hiding in this rock? Why or why not?\"*\n- *\"Where did this rock come from?\"*\n\nCollect 8-10 rocks in a basket and bring them back to the circle.\n\n**Option B — Rock Care Discussion (5 minutes):**\n\nDisplay the collected rocks and discuss:\n\nTeacher says: *\"Fossils and rocks are natural resources. They're part of Earth. We need to take care of them so they don't disappear. How can we take care of rocks?\"*\n\nStudents might suggest:\n- *Keep them safe in a container.*\n- *Don't break them.*\n- *Don't throw them.*\n- *Put them back where we found them (or in our collection).*\n- *Tell people rocks are special.*\n\nCreate a class chart: **\"How We Take Care of Rocks and Fossils\"**\n\nList student ideas with simple drawings.\n\n**Rock Sorting Activity (5 minutes):**\n\nGive pairs of students 2-3 rocks from the collection. Ask them to sort and organize by:\n- Color\n- Size (big, small, medium)\n- Texture (smooth, bumpy, rough)\n\nDisplay sorted rocks and celebrate the different ways students organized them.\n\nSay: *\"Every rock is special and different — just like fossils! Each one has its own story.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask open-ended questions about rock properties.\n- Encourage careful handling.\n- Connect sorting to observation and description skills.\n- Reinforce that rocks are resources we protect.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students handle rocks with care.\n- Students describe rock properties using descriptive words.\n- Students explain one way they can care for rocks and fossils.\n- Students begin to see rocks as valuable natural materials, not just \"stuff.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of fossil formation, rock properties, and stewardship through observation, questioning, and student demonstrations.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Ongoing During Lesson):**\n\nThroughout the lesson, observe and record student responses to these questions:\n\n| Checkpoint | Evidence | What to Listen/Look For |\n|-----------|----------|----------------------|\n| During Engage | Student predictions about the fossil | *Can they make connections to things they know?* |\n| During Explore | Student descriptions of their impressions | *Do they notice how the mark matches the object?* |\n| During Explain | Vocabulary repetition and use | *Can they say and use fossil, rock, impression?* |\n| During Elaborate | Rock sorting and care suggestions | *Do they describe properties? Show care?* |\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes):**\n\nConduct a brief 1:1 or small group informal assessment. Show each student the fossil photograph and ask **two of the following three questions** (adjust based on student ability):\n\n1. **\"What do you see in this rock? What made the mark?\"**\n   - ✓ **Proficient:** Student identifies a plant, animal, or object and explains it made an impression long ago.\n   - ✓ **Developing:** Student describes the mark but isn't sure what made it.\n   - ✓ **Beginning:** Student sees lines but can't explain them yet.\n\n2. **\"If I gave you clay and a leaf, what would happen if you pressed it in? How is that like the fossil?\"**\n   - ✓ **Proficient:** Student explains the leaf makes a mark, and that's how fossils form.\n   - ✓ **Developing:** Student says the mark would show the leaf shape.\n   - ✓ **Beginning:** Student presses but doesn't connect to fossil.\n\n3. **\"Why do we need to take care of rocks and fossils?\"**\n   - ✓ **Proficient:** Student explains rocks are special or tell stories and we should keep them safe.\n   - ✓ **Developing:** Student says we should be nice to rocks.\n   - ✓ **Beginning:** Student repeats that rocks are hard.\n\n**Success Criteria for Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Evidence of Success |\n|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Identify and describe rock properties | Student names at least 2 properties (color, texture, size, shape) |\n| Observe fossil evidence | Student points to mark in photograph and names what made it (plant/animal) |\n| Create and explain impressions | Student presses object, removes it, and explains the mark shows what touched the clay |\n| Explain care for natural resources | Student gives 1 example of caring for rocks (don't throw, keep safe, etc.) |\n\n**Recording Assessment Data:**\n- Use a simple checklist (list student names and mark ✓ for each objective met)\n- Take photos of student clay impressions with captions of their explanations\n- Write down verbatim quotes of student reasoning about fossils\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify the fossil photo as showing something from long ago.\n- 100% of students can make an impression and explain that the object made the mark.\n- 75% of students can name at least one way to care for rocks and fossils.\n- All students engage with rocks as interesting natural materials, not mere play objects.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Hand Strength & Motor Support:**\n   - Provide pre-flattened clay discs (use a rolling pin before the lesson).\n   - Offer sculpting tools or wooden spoons to press into clay instead of fingers if hand strength is limited.\n   - Pair student with peer helper for rock hunt.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Scaffolding:**\n   - Use vocabulary cards with large, clear images paired with words throughout.\n   - Repeat key words (fossil, rock, impression) frequently in songs or chants: *\"Fossil, fossil, rock so old! Fossil, fossil, stories told!\"*\n   - Provide sentence frames: *\"This rock is ____. It feels ____.\"* or *\"A fossil is an old ____.\"*\n\n3. **Simplified Questioning:**\n   - Ask yes/no or either/or questions: *\"Is this rock big or small?\" \"Does the fossil show a plant or an animal?\"*\n   - Allow pointing or drawing instead of speaking to demonstrate understanding.\n   - Provide think-pair-share time before whole-group responses.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Fossil Investigation:**\n   - Provide images of 3-4 different fossils (ammonite, trilobite, leaf, fish print) and ask: *\"What animal or plant made each fossil? How are they different? Which one is your favorite and why?\"*\n   - Introduce concept of \"paleontologist\" (scientist who studies fossils) and discuss what they do.\n   - Ask: *\"If we found a fossil fish in our town, what does that tell us? Was it once under water? How do you know?\"*\n\n2. **Multi-Step Impressions:**\n   - Provide two layers of clay and different objects. Ask: *\"Can you make two different impressions? Which one do you think scientists would notice first if they dug?\"* (Introduces concept of layers and time)\n   - Challenge: *\"Make a fossil story — press three objects to show what happened: first this animal, then this plant, then this animal. Tell the story of your fossil.\"*\n\n3. **Care & Stewardship Extension:**\n   - Ask: *\"If we found a real fossil outside, what rules should we make to keep it safe? Should we take it home, leave it, or take a picture?\"*\n   - Create a classroom \"Fossil Protection Plan\" with student input and enforce it during outdoor explorations.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil Art Gallery (Take-Home Project):**\n   - Send home a baggie with air-dry clay and a sheet with pictures of 4 objects (leaf, shell, dinosaur, flower). \n   - Students make impressions at home and bring them back. Create a classroom \"Museum\" display with labels and student descriptions.\n   - *Connects to:* K-ESS3-1 (relationship between living things and places); strengthens fine motor skills; extends learning to home/family.\n\n2. **Story Rocks — Adding Narrative to Observations:**\n   - Students pick their favorite rock or fossil impression and dictate or draw a story: *\"Long ago, this fossil was made when...\"*\n   - Record student voices (audio or video) describing their fossil stories.\n   - Create a classroom book: *\"Stories in Stone: Our Fossil Adventures.\"*\n   - *Connects to:* K-ESS3-1 (understanding Earth as home for living things); supports literacy integration.\n\n3. **Outdoor Rock & Fossil Hunt Adventure (Field Extension):**\n   - Plan a supervised outdoor exploration (playground, park, or garden).\n   - Give students clipboards with simple scavenger hunt: *\"Find a smooth rock. Find a bumpy rock. Find a rock you think might have a fossil. Find the biggest rock you can see.\"*\n   - Collect items in a labeled basket and bring back for classroom study and documentation.\n   - Create a class map of where rocks and possible fossils are found.\n   - *Connects to:* K-ESS3-1 (relationship between living things and their environment); increases environmental awareness.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure all rocks are clean and free of sharp edges. Supervise closely during clay activities (not for eating). Avoid small objects that could be choking hazards for students under 5.\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Use the fossil photo daily for one week after the lesson. Point to it during transitions and ask different questions to reinforce concepts.\n- **Real Fossil Comparison:** If you can borrow or bring a real fossil (ammonite or trilobite are common and inexpensive from educational suppliers), showing it side-by-side with student impressions is powerful.\n- **Sensory-Rich Language:** Use descriptive words constantly: smooth, bumpy, hard, soft, ancient, long-ago, impressed, shaped, marked, natural.\n- **Cultural Connection:** Mention that people around the world have found and valued fossils for thousands of years. Some cultures used fossils in art and stories.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
