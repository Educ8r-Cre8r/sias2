Describe the properties of hail and explain how it forms in the atmosphere.\n2. Make observations and measurements to provide evidence of how ice and frozen precipitation can cause weathering and erosion.\n3. Identify the impacts of hail and other severe weather on the environment and human structures.\n4. Generate and compare at least two solutions to reduce the damage caused by hail storms.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about precipitation and ice using the photograph of hail.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of hail (displayed on projector, smartboard, or printed copies)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without context. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds and think about what they see.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see covering the ground in this picture? Is it snow? Ice? Something else?\"\n   - \"These are balls of ice that fell from the sky. Have you ever seen ice balls fall from the clouds? What was happening in the weather?\"\n   - \"Look at the size of these ice balls compared to the dirt and gravel. How do you think something this hard and round could change the land or damage buildings?\"\n   - \"If you were a farmer with crops, or someone with a car parked outside, how might these ice balls affect you?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today we're going to learn about hail—frozen precipitation that falls during severe storms. Before we explore, I want you to predict: How might hail change Earth's surface over time? Turn to a partner and share your ideas.\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n**Transition:** \"Your ideas about hail are great. Now we're going to investigate how ice and frozen water can actually change rocks and soil, just like hail does.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how ice can cause weathering and erosion through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small rocks or chalk pieces (1-2 per student pair)\n- Ice cubes (prepared ahead, or frozen water in small containers)\n- Freezer access (for making ice ahead of time)\n- Measuring tape or ruler\n- Paper towels\n- Shallow trays or containers (to contain melting water)\n- Spray bottles filled with water\n- Observation sheets (see below)\n- Pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up stations or pair work:** Give each pair of students a rock or chalk piece and an ice cube.\n\n2. **Provide step-by-step directions:**\n   - \"First, observe your rock carefully. Use your measuring tape to measure its length and width. Record these measurements on your observation sheet.\"\n   - \"Now, place your ice cube on top of the rock. Leave it there for 3-5 minutes while we continue exploring.\"\n   - \"After the ice melts, observe your rock again. Look for cracks, chips, or changes. Measure the rock again and record any differences.\"\n   - \"What happened to the rock? Did anything break off or change? Draw or write what you observe.\"\n\n3. **Extended exploration (if time permits):**\n   - \"Let's try a second test. Use the spray bottle to wet your rock, then place it in the freezer for 5 minutes.\" (This mimics the freeze-thaw cycle that hail and ice cause.)\n   - \"Remove it and observe. Do you see any new cracks or damage? How is this different from the first test?\"\n\n4. **Documentation:** Students should record observations, measurements, and drawings on their observation sheet, noting any changes to the rock's surface.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What changes do you notice?\" \"Do you see any cracks?\" \"How is your rock different now?\"\n- Do NOT tell students the answer; instead, ask them to look more carefully and describe what they observe.\n- Help students measure accurately but allow them to draw their own conclusions about what caused the changes.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe that ice, water, and freeze-thaw cycles can crack or chip rocks.\n- They collect data (measurements and observations) showing physical changes to the rock.\n- Students begin to understand that ice and frozen water are agents of weathering.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts, connecting exploration to hail and real-world weathering.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Photograph of hail (displayed again)\n- Images of hail damage (optional: hail dents in cars, damaged roofs, crop damage—search online for age-appropriate examples)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:** Invite pairs to share one observation from their exploration. Record responses on chart paper, grouping similar observations (e.g., \"Cracks appeared,\" \"Ice melted and water seeped in,\" \"Pieces broke off\").\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions:\n\n   - **Hail:** Frozen balls of ice that form in thunderstorm clouds and fall to Earth as precipitation.\n   - **Weathering:** The breaking down or wearing away of rocks and soil by water, ice, wind, and other natural forces.\n   - **Erosion:** The movement of rock and soil from one place to another, usually caused by water, wind, or ice.\n   - **Freeze-thaw cycle:** When water freezes (turning to ice), it expands; when it thaws (melts back to water), it contracts. This repeated expanding and contracting causes rocks to crack and break.\n   - **Precipitation:** Water that falls from clouds to Earth, including rain, snow, sleet, and hail.\n\n3. **Connect to the photograph and exploration:**\n   - \"In our exploration, we saw how ice can crack rocks. Hail is ice that falls from the sky. When hail hits the ground, rocks, soil, and buildings, it causes weathering—breaking them apart slowly over time.\"\n   - \"Look at this hailstone. It's hard and round. Thousands of these falling at once can damage crops, dent cars, and crack roofs. That's weathering and erosion caused by this extreme weather.\"\n   - \"The freeze-thaw cycle we simulated in our experiment happens in nature when hail melts and refreezes, or when water seeps into cracks and freezes. This is one way Earth's surface is constantly changing.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to your partner and explain in your own words: What is weathering, and how does ice cause it?\"\n   - Ask 2-3 students to share their explanations aloud.\n   - Pose a quick question: \"If hail falls on a mountain over many, many years, what do you think will happen to the mountain?\" (Allow students to reason: rocks will break down, the surface will change.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Hail** | Frozen balls of ice that fall from thunderstorm clouds. |\n| **Weathering** | The slow wearing away and breaking down of rocks and soil by water, ice, wind, and other natural forces. |\n| **Erosion** | The movement of rocks and soil from one place to another, usually by water, wind, or ice. |\n| **Freeze-thaw cycle** | When water freezes and expands, then thaws and contracts, causing cracks in rocks over time. |\n| **Precipitation** | Water that falls from clouds to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can define and use vocabulary terms related to weathering and precipitation.\n- Students connect their exploration results to real-world processes of weathering by ice and hail.\n- Students understand that extreme weather (hail) is both a natural process and a hazard to humans.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of hail's impacts and generate solutions to reduce damage from severe weather.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large poster boards (1 per group of 3-4 students)\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- Images or descriptions of hail damage scenarios (provided by teacher or found online)\n- Scenario cards (see below) OR teacher-guided discussion\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present real-world damage scenarios:**\n   - Show images or describe: hail damage to a farmer's corn crop, a hailstone dent in a car hood, a cracked roof on a house, or a shattered window.\n   - Discuss: \"These are real problems that happen when severe hailstorms occur. Engineers and farmers have to think about how to protect their property and reduce damage.\"\n\n2. **Small-group challenge—Generate solutions:**\n   - Divide the class into groups of 3-4 students.\n   - Assign each group ONE scenario (or let them choose):\n     - **Scenario A:** A farmer wants to protect the apple orchard from hail damage.\n     - **Scenario B:** A car manufacturer wants to design a car roof that resists hail dents.\n     - **Scenario C:** A homeowner wants to protect the roof and windows from hail.\n     - **Scenario D:** A construction company wants to design a hailproof shelter for outdoor workers.\n\n3. **Guide the solution-generation process:**\n   - \"Talk with your group: What materials or designs could reduce hail damage? Think about things that are hard, flexible, layered, or angled. Draw or describe at least TWO different solutions.\"\n   - \"For each solution, discuss: Would it work? Why? Would it be practical and affordable? What are the pros and cons?\"\n   - Record solutions on poster paper with drawings and labels.\n\n4. **Gallery walk and comparison:**\n   - Post all solutions around the room.\n   - Have students do a brief gallery walk to see how other groups solved the same or different scenarios.\n   - Lead a class discussion: \"Which solutions do you think are the most effective? Why? What do the best solutions have in common?\" (e.g., durability, multiple layers, protective barriers)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What material could protect from hard ice balls?\" \"What's something already in nature that protects things from weather?\" (e.g., tree bark, animal fur).\n- Encourage students to think about real-world solutions that already exist (car designs, crop nets, insurance).\n- Validate all ideas while encouraging critical thinking about practicality.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students generate at least two creative solutions to reduce hail damage.\n- Students compare solutions and identify which are most practical and effective.\n- Students apply their understanding of weathering and impact to real-world engineering challenges.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of hail formation, weathering, and solutions to natural hazards.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (throughout the lesson):**\n- Observation of student exploration and data collection (Do they accurately measure and observe changes?)\n- Listen to partner discussions during Engage and Explain phases (Can they articulate ideas about ice and weathering?)\n- Monitor group work during Elaborate phase (Are they generating reasonable solutions?)\n- Check vocabulary use in explanations (Do they correctly use terms like weathering, erosion, hail, precipitation?)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with a short response sheet with these prompts (students may draw and/or write):\n\n1. **\"Explain how hail is different from rain. Where does hail come from?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student identifies that hail is frozen water/ice and forms in thunderstorm clouds.\n\n2. **\"Look at this picture of a cracked rock. Explain how hail could cause this crack over time.\"**\n   (Show a photo of a cracked or weathered rock.)\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student describes weathering, freeze-thaw cycle, or impact of ice on rock.\n\n3. **\"If you were protecting a garden from hail, what would you use? Why would it work?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student proposes a protective barrier and provides a reason (e.g., \"a net because hail can't get through\" or \"a metal frame because it's strong\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students demonstrate understanding that hail is a form of precipitation made of ice.\n- Students explain the connection between ice/water and weathering of rocks.\n- Students propose practical solutions to reduce hail damage with reasoning.\n- Students use vocabulary terms (hail, weathering, erosion, precipitation, freeze-thaw) accurately in responses.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support:**\n\n1. **Guided observation sheets:** For struggling readers or writers, provide illustrated observation sheets with fill-in-the-blank prompts instead of open-ended questions (e.g., \"The rock looked ______ before. Now it looks ______\").\n\n2. **Vocabulary cards with visuals:** Provide laminated vocabulary cards with pictures alongside word definitions. Students can reference these during discussions and writing activities.\n\n3. **Partner-based exploration:** Pair students who need support with stronger peers during the Explore phase, allowing them to verbally share observations before recording them.\n\n4. **Simplified exit ticket:** Offer multiple-choice options or sentence frames (e.g., \"Hail is made of _____. [options: water, ice, rain, snow]\").\n\n**Challenge:**\n\n1. **Research real hail events:** Advanced students can research a major hail storm (e.g., 2017 Denver hailstorm) and present data about size, damage costs, and affected areas. They can create graphs showing the relationship between hailstone size and damage severity.\n\n2. **Design a detailed prototype:** Challenge students to create a scale model or detailed blueprint of a hail-resistant structure or device. They must justify material choices and explain how their design reduces weathering/damage.\n\n3. **Investigate freeze-thaw mechanics:** Have advanced students investigate and explain (with diagrams) WHY water expands when it freezes and how this molecular change causes weathering. They can connect this to density and molecular movement.\n\n4. **Comparative analysis:** Ask students to compare weathering caused by different natural processes (ice, wind, water, plant roots) and create a chart ranking which is most destructive or fastest. They can support their ranking with evidence from research.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Hail Damage Survey:** Have students survey the school grounds or neighborhood (with permission) to look for evidence of weathering caused by ice, water, or previous hailstorms. They can photograph examples, map locations on a diagram, and present findings about which surfaces are most affected.\n\n2. **Build a Hail-Proof Structure:** Challenge students to construct a model building (using craft materials: popsicle sticks, plastic, foam, etc.) that can withstand \"hail\" (marbles or ice cubes dropped from a height). Test structures and discuss which materials and designs worked best. Connect results to real engineering.\n\n3. **Weather Data and Hail Patterns:** Have students research and graph hail frequency data in your region or across the United States (using NOAA or weather websites). Create maps showing where hail is most common and investigate why (altitude, geography, seasonal patterns). Discuss how understanding hail patterns helps communities prepare.\n\n4. **Interview Project:** Students interview a farmer, insurance agent, meteorologist, or contractor about how hail affects their work and what precautions they take. They present findings to the class, creating a community understanding of hail as a natural hazard.\n\n5. **Historical Erosion Investigation:** Using photographs or field trips, students identify and document evidence of erosion in your local area. They hypothesize whether ice/hail, water, wind, or other forces caused the weathering, and support their reasoning with observations.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Plan End",
