  "content": "### Visible Elements in Photo\n\n- A large, roughly spherical rock or boulder covered in lichen (white and pale green patches) and moss (darker green growth)\n- Surrounding ground covered with brown leaf litter and wood chips\n- Green grass and plant growth adjacent to the rock on the right side\n- Moist, shaded forest floor environment\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n\n- **From lichen and moss coverage**: The rock's surface provides habitat for slow-growing organisms that thrive in moisture and shade; different organisms favor different areas (inference: microhabitats with varying light and moisture conditions exist on a single surface).\n- **From leaf litter and proximity to grass**: The rock is partially buried or settled into organic material, suggesting it has been in place long enough to accumulate soil and support plant colonization.\n- **From dense growth patterns**: The rock's irregular surface and crevices trap moisture and organic matter, creating shelter for decomposers and small organisms.\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2:**\nDesign a cozy home for tiny bugs and creatures that need a damp, shady place to live. Use rocks, sticks, leaves, and soil to build a shelter that stays wet and keeps bugs safe from the sun. Can you make it so water doesn't wash it away?\n\n**3-5:**\nDesign a wildlife shelter structure (using rocks, wood, soil, and natural materials) that maintains moisture and shade for decomposer organisms and small arthropods. Your shelter must:\n- Retain moisture for at least 24 hours without active watering\n- Provide at least two distinct microhabitats (e.g., a damp crevice and a covered space)\n- Be stable enough to withstand light rain or water spray without collapsing\n- Measure no larger than 30 cm across\nTest your design by placing it outside for one week and observing what organisms colonize it.\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem** — This phase fits best because the photo reveals a real environmental need (small organisms require shelter and moisture) without showing an existing solution. Students must first observe and question *why* organisms live on rocks like this, then define what conditions a shelter must provide. This observation-first approach builds scientific thinking before engineering.\n\n### Suggested Materials\n\n- Rocks of various sizes (collected from schoolyard or provided)\n- Sticks and twigs\n- Dried leaves and bark pieces\n- Soil or potting mix\n- Moss or grass clippings (optional, to jumpstart colonization)\n- Spray bottle or watering can\n- Observational tools (hand lens, notebook)\n\n### Estimated Time\n\nTwo 30-minute sessions (Day 1: design and build; Day 2-7: observation and iteration) or one extended 45-60 minute session for design and initial build with follow-up observation over 1-2 weeks.\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.A (defining and delimiting problems)** and **ETS1.B (developing possible solutions)** by asking students to identify real environmental constraints (moisture, shade, stability) and engineer a structure that meets them, grounding abstract engineering in observable natural systems.",
