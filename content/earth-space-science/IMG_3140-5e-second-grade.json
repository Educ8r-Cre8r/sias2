Identify beaches and oceans as bodies of water on Earth and describe how waves move water and sand.\n2. Explain how water (waves) slowly changes the shape of beaches over time through erosion.\n3. Compare different ways people can protect beaches from being washed away by waves and water.\n4. Create a model of a beach and ocean that shows how water moves and changes the land.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about beaches and water's power to change land using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color copy of the photograph (or displayed digitally on a projector)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Tell students: \"Today, we're going on an adventure to a beach! Look carefully at this picture. What do you notice?\"\n\n2. **Ask these specific discovery questions** (allow 30-60 seconds thinking time before responses):\n   - \"What do you see in the water? Can you describe how the water looks?\" (Students should notice waves, movement, water in motion.)\n   - \"Do you see sand on the beach? What do you think happens to the sand when those big waves come in?\"\n   - \"Why do you think there are so many people at the beach, and what might the water be doing to the sandy beach while they play?\"\n   - \"Have you ever been to a beach or seen water move sand or rocks? What did you notice?\"\n\n3. **Record student observations** on chart paper with sketches. Validate all responses. This activates prior knowledge and builds excitement.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what happens to beaches over a long time when waves keep crashing on them day after day. Do you think the beach stays exactly the same, or does the water change it? Today, we're going to discover how water is like a powerful sculptor that changes beaches!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do an experiment to see how water can move sand and change the shape of land, just like waves do at a beach.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how water moves sand and changes landforms through a hands-on simulation.\n\n**Materials (per small group or pair):**\n- 1 shallow aluminum pan or plastic tray (at least 8\" × 12\")\n- 2-3 cups of dry sand (kinetic sand works well; regular sandbox sand is acceptable)\n- Water in a spray bottle OR a small watering can\n- 1 cup of water in a container for pouring\n- Wooden block or book to tilt the tray slightly\n- Paper towels and newspaper for cleanup\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Spread sand evenly in your pan, about 1½ inches deep. Use your fingers to smooth it flat. This is your pretend beach!\"\n\n2. \"Now, carefully pour water in one spot from the cup. Watch what happens. Does the sand stay in place? Does it move? Draw or write what you see on your observation sheet.\"\n\n3. \"Try spraying water gently with the spray bottle on different parts of your beach. What happens? Does it move the same as when you poured it? Record what you notice.\"\n\n4. \"Now, tilt your pan slightly and pour water from the higher end. Let it flow down like a stream or wave. What happens to the sand? Does the water create a channel? Does it move a lot of sand or a little?\"\n\n5. \"Try pouring water faster and slower. Which moves more sand—fast water or slow water? How do you know?\"\n\n6. \"Clean up your sand, reshape your beach, and try one more thing: pour water on your beach and then let it sit for 10 seconds. What does the sand look like now? Is it the same or different?\"\n\n**How the activity connects to the photograph:**\nExplain to students: \"The waves in the beach picture are doing something similar to what you just did—they are pouring and spraying water on the sand over and over again. The moving water is changing the shape of the beach!\"\n\n**What students should record:**\n- Drawings or simple sketches of what happened each time\n- Words or phrases: \"water moved sand,\" \"made a hole,\" \"made it wet,\" \"made a path\"\n- Comparisons: \"fast water moved MORE sand than slow water\" or \"spray water made small changes\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What do you see happening?\" \"Is the sand moving or staying still?\" \"Why do you think that happened?\"\n- **Do NOT tell students the answers.** Let them observe and discover.\n- Help with setup and overflow management without directing outcomes.\n- Encourage students to test their own questions: \"You have an idea? Try it!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents should discover that:\n- Moving water causes sand to move.\n- Faster water moves more sand than slower water.\n- Water can change the shape of sand/land.\n- Repeated water movement (like waves) creates bigger changes.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to earth science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Vocabulary poster or word cards with definitions (prepared in advance)\n- Small sand tray with water for demonstration (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask students: \"What did you discover about water and sand?\" Invite 4-5 students to share one observation.\n   - Record key ideas on chart: \"Water moves sand,\" \"Fast water moves more,\" \"Sand changes shape\"\n   - Affirm all contributions.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Use student-friendly language and point to visuals or demonstrate concepts:\n\n   - **Beach:** The sandy area where the land meets the ocean or sea. (Show in the photograph: the sandy area where people stand)\n   - **Ocean:** A very large body of water that covers most of Earth. (Point to the water in the photograph and explain it goes on for very far.)\n   - **Waves:** Moving water in the ocean that goes up and down. (Point to the wavy lines visible in the photograph; move your arm like a wave)\n   - **Erosion:** When water, wind, or ice slowly wears away rock and soil and moves it to a different place. (Show the sand movement in the photo and explain: \"The waves in this picture are eroding—or wearing away—the beach\")\n   - **Landform:** The shape of the land, like mountains, valleys, or beaches. (Explain that waves change the landform of beaches)\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph and Explore activity (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the photograph again.\n   - Ask: \"Do you see the waves in this picture? Just like in our experiment, those waves are pouring water on the beach over and over. What do you think is happening to the sand on this beach?\"\n   - Explain: \"The beach in this picture has been pounded by waves for years and years. The water is slowly eroding—or wearing away—the sand. This is why beaches are always changing shape!\"\n   - Point out: \"The people in this picture are playing on a beach that looks different today than it did 5 years ago because of erosion from waves.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2 minutes):**\n   Use a thumbs check: \n   - \"If you understand that waves move water and change beaches, give me a thumbs up.\"\n   - \"If you're not sure yet, thumbs in the middle.\"\n   - \"If you have questions, thumbs down—let's talk about it!\"\n\n**Vocabulary List:**\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Beach** | The sandy place where the land meets the ocean |\n| **Ocean** | A very large body of water that covers a huge part of Earth |\n| **Waves** | Moving water that goes up and down in the ocean |\n| **Erosion** | When water slowly wears away and moves rocks and sand to a different place |\n| **Landform** | The shape of the land, like a beach or mountain |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify beaches and oceans in images or describe them.\n- Students understand that waves cause erosion (water moves sand and changes beaches).\n- Students can use the words \"beach,\" \"waves,\" \"erosion,\" and \"ocean\" in sentences.\n- Students can explain that water changes land over time.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of erosion and water movement to design protective solutions.\n\n**Materials (per group):**\n- Shallow aluminum pans or trays (same as Explore)\n- Fresh sand (about 2 cups per group)\n- Water in spray bottle or small container\n- Building materials to choose from:\n  - Popsicle sticks or craft sticks\n  - Small rocks or pebbles\n  - Seashells or shells (or plastic shells)\n  - Barrier materials: cardboard strips, plastic bags, or paper towels\n  - Tape or clay to hold materials in place\n- Observation sheet or notebook\n- Photograph (displayed)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present the real-world scenario (2 minutes):**\n   - Show the photograph again and explain: \"In some beaches, like this one, the water from waves is eroding the sand faster and faster. People who live near beaches want to protect them. We're going to be beach engineers today!\"\n   - Ask: \"If you were trying to stop the waves from washing away the sand, what could you build?\"\n\n2. **Design challenge (13 minutes):**\n   - \"Build something in your sand tray that will slow down or stop the water from moving the sand. You can use sticks, rocks, shells, or other materials. Make a barrier or wall—whatever you think will work!\"\n   - Student directions:\n     - Reshape sand into a beach shape in your tray\n     - Choose materials from the \"supply area\"\n     - Build a structure to protect your sand from water\n     - Predict: \"Will this stop the water? Slow it down? Why?\"\n     - Test your design by carefully pouring or spraying water\n     - Observe what happens\n     - Improve your design if needed and test again\n\n3. **Documentation (2 minutes):**\n   - Students sketch their design and label it\n   - Write or say: \"This worked because...\" or \"Next time I will...\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide the scenario but let students choose their own solutions (this builds critical thinking).\n- Ask: \"Why did you choose that material?\" and \"What happened when the water hit your barrier?\"\n- Encourage iteration: \"Do you want to try a different design?\"\n- Connect to real solutions: \"Real beach cities use big rocks called breakwaters, and sand dunes to protect beaches, just like your barriers!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create at least one protective structure.\n- Students test their design and observe results.\n- Students can explain their choice: \"Rocks worked because they were strong and didn't move.\"\n- Students understand that different solutions can slow erosion.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of beaches, waves, erosion, and how water changes land.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Do students observe that water moves sand?\n- Questioning during Explain: Can students explain erosion in their own words?\n- Thumbs check and vocabulary use during Explain phase.\n- Design choices during Elaborate: Do students select materials based on logical reasoning about water resistance?\n\n**Exit ticket or summative assessment (end of Session 2, 5 minutes):**\n\n**Option A: Illustrated Response (for students who prefer drawing)**\nProvide a sheet with a simple beach outline and ask:\n- \"Draw what happens to the sand when waves crash on a beach.\"\n- \"Draw one thing people can build to protect a beach.\"\n\n**Option B: Short-answer questions (teacher reads aloud; students respond orally or write/draw)**\n1. \"What is erosion? Tell me what you learned.\" (Success: Student mentions water moving sand/rocks)\n2. \"How are waves like the water we poured in our experiment?\" (Success: Student says \"Both move sand\" or \"Both change the beach\")\n3. \"What could a city build to slow down erosion on a beach?\" (Success: Student names one structure like rocks, a wall, or dune)\n\n**Option C: Show-me assessment**\n- Show students the photograph again and ask: \"Point to where erosion is happening and explain why.\"\n- Listen for: References to waves, water movement, and sand changing.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n✓ Student identifies a beach or ocean in the photograph.\n✓ Student explains that water (waves) moves sand or rocks.\n✓ Student uses the word \"erosion\" or describes erosion in their own words.\n✓ Student proposes at least one way to slow water erosion.\n✓ Student can compare their experiment to what happens at a real beach.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- All students can explain that water changes the shape of land.\n- Most students can use vocabulary (beach, ocean, waves, erosion).\n- All students can identify at least one strategy to protect a beach.\n- Students show evidence of understanding that erosion happens slowly over time.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:**\n   - Use simpler terms: \"water moves the sand\" instead of \"erosion\"\n   - Pre-teach vocabulary with images the day before\n   - Provide vocabulary cards with pictures during activities\n\n2. **Hands-on support:**\n   - Pair struggling readers with a partner or bilingual peer\n   - Allow extended time for Explore; provide a pre-made \"beach\" model so they focus only on water's effect\n   - Use water and sand with strong visual/tactile difference (e.g., blue-dyed water or colored sand)\n\n3. **Reduced writing requirements:**\n   - Allow drawings instead of sentences for observations\n   - Offer sentence frames: \"The water made the sand ___\" or \"The rocks stopped the water from ___\"\n   - Use oral responses instead of written answers for exit ticket\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Deeper investigation:**\n   - Ask: \"What happens if you make waves by moving your tray back and forth instead of pouring water? Does it change the sand the same way?\"\n   - Challenge: \"Design a beach that stays protected even with strong waves. Test it multiple times.\"\n\n2. **Real-world connections:**\n   - Research: \"Find a picture of a real beach protection structure (breakwater, seawall, or sand dune). Explain how it slows erosion.\"\n   - Create a presentation: \"If you were hired to protect a beach city, what would you build and why?\"\n\n3. **Extended vocabulary:**\n   - Introduce additional terms: \"sediment,\" \"weathering,\" \"deposition,\" \"barrier\"\n   - Ask: \"Where does all the sand go when water carries it away? Can it build up somewhere else?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n**1. Beach Journey: A Sand Transport Investigation (20-30 minutes)**\nStudents create a longer water channel using multiple trays connected with tape or placed in a line. Pour water and sand at the top and observe where the sand settles. Discuss how erosion in one place can create new land (deposition) in another place. Connect to real-world examples: \"Rivers carry sand from mountains to oceans, and that sand builds up and creates new beaches or islands.\"\n\n**2. Build a Beach Dune Model (30-40 minutes, homework or follow-up session)**\nStudents create a 3D model using:\n- Shallow box or shoebox\n- Sand and rocks\n- Grass, moss, or green paper (to represent beach vegetation)\n- Label parts: ocean, beach, dune, vegetation\n- Explain: \"Dunes protect beaches from erosion because plants hold the sand in place and slow down water.\"\nStudents display models and present to the class.\n\n**3. Interview a Beach Expert: Role-play and Research (15-20 minutes)**\nAssign roles: \"beach engineer,\" \"scientist who studies erosion,\" \"lifeguard,\" or \"person who lives near a beach.\" Each student researches or imagines what their role-person knows about beach erosion. Host a classroom \"beach protection panel\" where students present solutions or describe their observations.\n\n**Bonus: Home Connection Activity**\nSend home a one-page guide:\n- \"Observe water at home: How does water change dirt in your garden, driveway, or sandbox? Sketch what you notice.\"\n- \"Optional: Build a mini beach erosion model at home using a shoebox, sand, and water. Take a photo and share!\"\n\n---\n\n**This lesson directly uses the photograph to anchor all learning.** Students see a real beach affected by waves and water, conduct parallel experiments, discover erosion firsthand, and apply solutions to a genuine environmental challenge. The 5E model ensures scaffolding from curiosity to independent application—exactly what Second Grade learners need to understand how Earth's systems work.",
