ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about seasonal water changes and activate prior knowledge about Earth's water systems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color print or digital projection of the thawing pond photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: ice cube in a shallow dish (to observe melting during discussion)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the water in this photograph? Does it look different from a pond you've seen in summer? Why?\"\n   - \"Where do you think the water came from? What might have been here a few weeks ago?\" (Guide them to think about snow and ice.)\n   - \"If I told you this photo was taken in early spring, what might happen to this water over the next few months? Where could it go?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the trees are bare and there's no green grass? How does that connect to the water you see?\"\n\n3. **Make a wonder anchor chart** by writing student predictions and questions on chart paper. Examples: *\"Does all the pond water come from melted snow?\" \"Where does water go in summer?\" \"Why does ice melt?\" \"Can water be in different forms at the same time?\"*\n\n4. **Display the ice cube** in a shallow dish and tell students: \"We're going to investigate how water moves and changes in nature, just like this ice cube. Your observations today will help us understand why spring looks like this photograph.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Now that you're wondering about Earth's water, let's investigate how water moves through our world during springtime.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate water state changes and how water moves through Earth's systems using a model activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Per small group (3-4 students):\n  - Clear plastic bag (freezer bag, gallon-size)\n  - Ice cubes (about 6-8 per group)\n  - Warm water (teacher-prepared, about 2 cups in a small pitcher)\n  - A thermometer (optional but recommended)\n  - Paper towels\n  - Labels and markers\n  - Observation worksheet (provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Water State Changes (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** to each group. Have students place ice cubes in the clear plastic bag.\n\n2. **Give these step-by-step directions:**\n   - \"Look at the ice in your bag. Draw or describe what you see on your observation sheet. What state is the water in?\"\n   - \"Now I'm going to pour warm water into your bag. This warm water represents heat from the spring sun. Before I do, predict: What will happen to the ice? Will it change?\"\n   - \"After I pour the warm water, observe every 2-3 minutes for 10 minutes. Record what you see: Is the ice changing? Is it getting smaller? What's happening to the water in the bottom of the bag?\"\n   - \"Use these words if they fit: melting, liquid, solid, mixed, cold, warm.\"\n\n3. **Circulate while students observe.** Ask guiding questions without answering:\n   - \"What changes do you notice?\"\n   - \"Where did the solid ice go?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the water temperature matters?\"\n   - \"What would happen if we waited longer?\"\n\n**Part B: Connecting to the Photograph (5 minutes)**\n\n4. **Regroup and ask:**\n   - \"What you saw in your bag happens in nature during spring. The sun warms the ground and water. The ice in the pond, like your ice in the bag, starts to melt. Where does all that melted water go? Look back at the photograph—can you see where some of that water might go?\" (Guide them to notice the slope of the land, the stream or runoff, the water body itself.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Prepare warm water ahead of time (lukewarm, about 110-120°F—not boiling).\n- Circulate to each group, listening to their observations and asking clarifying questions.\n- Do not tell students *why* the ice melts; let them observe and describe the change.\n- Encourage students to use sensory language: \"Does it look the same?\" \"Is it moving?\" \"Can you see the change?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students observe that ice melts when exposed to warm water.\n- Students recognize that the solid ice becomes a liquid.\n- Students document observations using words and drawings.\n- Students make a connection: spring warmth melts ice, creating water that moves through the landscape (like in the photograph).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain how water moves through Earth's systems using the Explore activity and photograph as anchors.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Printed diagram showing the water cycle with labels (or draw one with students)\n- The thawing pond photograph (display again)\n- Optional: globe or map showing water bodies\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations from Explore phase** (3-5 minutes):\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share what they observed. Record their descriptions on chart paper.\n   - Highlight key observations: ice melted, became liquid, filled the bottom of the bag, changed form.\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary** (5-7 minutes):\n   - Write and define these five terms on the board, using student-friendly language:\n\n     **Vocabulary:**\n     - **Melting:** When a solid (like ice) becomes a liquid (like water) because it gets warmer.\n     - **Geosphere:** All the rock, soil, and land that make up Earth's solid parts.\n     - **Hydrosphere:** All the water on Earth—in oceans, lakes, rivers, ice, and water vapor in the air.\n     - **Atmosphere:** The layer of air and gases that surrounds Earth.\n     - **Biosphere:** All the living things on Earth—plants, animals, and organisms.\n\n3. **Explain the connection** (5-8 minutes):\n   - Point to the photograph. \"In this spring landscape, we see all four of Earth's systems interacting. Let's name them:\n     - **Geosphere:** The slope, the soil, the ground where the trees grow.\n     - **Hydrosphere:** The pond, the melting ice, the water seeping into the ground.\n     - **Atmosphere:** The warmer air in spring that melts the ice—that's part of the atmosphere warming Earth.\n     - **Biosphere:** The bare trees that will get water from the melted snow, the plants that will grow.\"\n   - Draw a simple diagram on the board showing: Sun → warm air → ice melts → water collects in pond → water soaks into ground → trees use water to grow.\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Which sphere is the water?\" (Hydrosphere.) \"Which sphere is the ground?\" (Geosphere.) \"Which sphere includes the sun's warmth that melted the ice?\" (Atmosphere—the air and energy.) \"Which sphere includes the trees?\" (Biosphere.)\n   - Have students point to the photograph and label: \"Show me the hydrosphere. Show me where the geosphere is. Where do you see the atmosphere's effect?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can define melting and name Earth's four spheres.\n- Students understand that water changes state (solid to liquid) and moves between spheres.\n- Students recognize that Earth's systems interact—warmth (atmosphere) affects water (hydrosphere) and land (geosphere), which supports life (biosphere).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by modeling how water moves through Earth's systems and researching how communities manage spring water.\n\n**Materials:**\n- **For Modeling Activity:**\n  - Large resealable bag (gallon-size) per group\n  - Soil or sand (2-3 cups)\n  - Small rocks or gravel\n  - Water (colored blue with food coloring, about 1-2 cups)\n  - Cup with hole poked in bottom (to simulate \"rain\")\n  - Paper towels\n  - Labels\n\n- **For Research Activity:**\n  - Tablets, laptops, or printed articles about spring water management (community storm drains, rain gardens, wetland protection)\n  - Graphic organizer worksheet (provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Water Movement Model (all students, 15-20 minutes)**\n\n1. **Build a water systems model:**\n   - Distribute materials to groups.\n   - Students layer soil/sand and rocks in the bag to represent land (geosphere).\n   - Teacher pours blue water at the top (simulating spring runoff or \"rain\").\n   - Students observe: How does water move through the soil? Does it collect? Does it drain? Where does it go?\n   - Students label their model: water, soil, rocks, and any areas where water collects (mini \"pond\").\n\n2. **Discuss:**\n   - \"This model shows how water from melted snow and spring rain moves through Earth's systems. The water seeps into the ground (geosphere), is used by plants (biosphere), and may collect in ponds or streams (hydrosphere). What happens next? Where does it go?\" (Evaporation back into the atmosphere—introduced for deeper understanding.)\n\n**Option B: Community Water Protection Research (small group or whole class, 15-20 minutes)**\n\n1. **Provide information** about how communities manage spring water and protect water resources:\n   - Rain gardens (areas designed to capture runoff)\n   - Wetland preservation (natural filters for water)\n   - Stormwater management systems\n   - Fencing to protect banks from erosion (visible in the photograph!)\n\n2. **Students complete a graphic organizer:**\n   - Problem: *Spring runoff can cause flooding or erosion.*\n   - Community Solution: *[Student research]*\n   - How it works: *[Students explain using Earth systems language]*\n   - How it helps: *[Students connect to water quality, safety, habitat]*\n\n3. **Examples to share:**\n   - \"Fencing along the pond (like in the photo) keeps animals and people from disturbing the banks, which prevents erosion and keeps the water clean.\"\n   - \"Rain gardens trap water so it doesn't flood, and it filters down into the ground slowly.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups during the model activity; ask: \"What's happening to the water?\" \"Where is it going?\" \"How is this like the spring thaw in the photograph?\"\n- For research, guide students to identify the problem being solved and how Earth's systems are involved.\n- Help students see that communities use science to protect water resources.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students create a working model showing water moving through land and collecting in areas (ponds).\n- Students understand that water doesn't just disappear—it moves and interacts with soil, rocks, and living things.\n- Students identify real-world examples of how communities protect water during spring thaw.\n- Students use vocabulary (melting, geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere) accurately in explanations.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of water systems interactions and seasonal water movement.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lessons):**\n- Observe students during Explore: Are they accurately describing state changes? Do they connect observations to the photograph?\n- Listen to student explanations during group share-outs: Do they use correct vocabulary? Can they identify Earth's spheres in the photograph?\n- Review observation worksheets: Do sketches and descriptions show understanding of melting?\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket or End-of-Lesson Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with a blank diagram of a spring landscape (similar to the photograph but simplified, with a pond, bare trees, slope, and clouds). Students complete the following:\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Label the diagram with at least three of these terms: geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, ice, melting, water.**\n\n2. **Write or draw an arrow showing one way water moves from the ice to another part of the landscape.** (Example: Ice melts → runs downhill to pond, or ice melts → soaks into ground → trees drink water.)\n\n3. **Finish this sentence:** \"In spring, the water in the pond comes from _______________. I know this because _______________.\"\n\n4. **Name one way a community could protect the water and land near a pond like the one in the photograph.**\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- ✓ Student correctly labels at least 3 parts of the diagram using vocabulary from the lesson.\n- ✓ Student shows water moving between systems with an accurate arrow or description.\n- ✓ Student explains that spring water comes from melted ice/snow and provides a reason (warmth, sun, season).\n- ✓ Student identifies a real-world water protection strategy (fencing, rain gardens, wetland care, stormwater management).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students demonstrate understanding that Earth's systems interact through the water cycle.\n- Students explain state changes (melting) and water movement.\n- Students apply knowledge to real-world scenarios (community water management).\n- All learning objectives are met, as evidenced by exit ticket responses and model accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified diagram with visual cues:** Provide a labeled diagram of Earth's spheres with pictures (sun for atmosphere, rocks for geosphere, water for hydrosphere, trees for biosphere). Students identify where melting ice fits into each sphere.\n\n2. **Sentence frames for explanations:** Provide sentence starters: \"The ice melted because _____.\" \"The water moved to _____ because _____.\" \"Communities protect water by _____.\" Students complete with one or two words.\n\n3. **Peer modeling during activities:** Pair struggling students with stronger peers during Explore and Elaborate phases. Assign the struggling student a specific observation role (e.g., \"Watch the ice and tell us every 2 minutes what changed\").\n\n4. **Vocabulary card reference:** Create large visual cards for each vocabulary term (with a picture and simple definition) that students can keep at their desks during the lesson.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Extend the water cycle:** Ask: \"What happens to the water in the pond after it melts? Where does it go in summer? How does it get back to the clouds?\" Challenge students to research and draw a complete seasonal water cycle (melting → runoff → evaporation → condensation → precipitation → melting again).\n\n2. **Quantitative water distribution research:** Use 5-ESS2-2 (graphing water reservoirs). Have advanced students research what percentage of Earth's water is fresh vs. salt water, or what percentage of fresh water is in ice, lakes, and groundwater. Create a pie chart or bar graph showing distribution. Discuss: \"If ice melts during spring, does that change the percentages?\"\n\n3. **Design a water protection system:** Challenge students to design their own rain garden or stormwater system for the landscape in the photograph. Provide simple materials (sand, gravel, soil, water) and ask: \"How would you capture the melted water to prevent flooding while keeping the water clean?\" Students build and test their design.\n\n4. **Research climate impacts:** Advanced students explore: \"If spring comes earlier each year due to climate change, how might that affect the water cycle and the ecosystems that depend on spring thaw timing?\" Connect to 5-ESS3-1 (communities protecting resources).\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Water Cycle in a Bag (long-term observation):**\n   - Create a sealed plastic bag with water, soil, and a plant (or just water and soil).\n   - Tape it to a sunny window.\n   - Over 2-3 weeks, students observe and record: Does condensation form on the bag (atmosphere)? Do water droplets collect (hydrosphere)? Does the plant grow (biosphere)? What does this tell us about how water moves in a closed system?\n   - *Connects to:* Water cycle, all spheres interacting.\n\n2. **Spring Phenology Observation (ongoing throughout the season):**\n   - Take regular photos of a local pond, stream, or landscape over 6-8 weeks.\n   - Students track: When does ice disappear? When do trees leaf out? When do wildflowers bloom? When does water level change?\n   - Create a timeline showing when different biosphere events happen relative to water system changes.\n   - *Connects to:* Seasonal patterns, biosphere-hydrosphere interactions, Earth systems.\n\n3. **Community Water Walk & Report:**\n   - Coordinate a walking field trip to a local pond, stream, or wetland (if possible).\n   - Students observe and photograph: evidence of spring runoff, water management structures (drains, ditches, fences), living things depending on water, erosion or land changes.\n   - Students create a poster or presentation: \"Spring Water in Our Community—What We Observed and How We Can Protect It.\"\n   - Invite a local park ranger, water authority, or environmental scientist to speak to the class.\n   - *Connects to:* 5-ESS3-1 (communities using science to protect resources), real-world application.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
