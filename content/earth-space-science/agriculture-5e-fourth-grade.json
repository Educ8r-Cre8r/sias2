Explain how soil is disturbed and moved by farming equipment and natural processes.\n2. Describe two ways that human activities change Earth's landscape.\n3. Predict how different forces (water, wind, machines) cause soil and rock to break down or move.\n4. Identify soil as an important natural resource that must be protected.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about how farms change the land and activate prior knowledge about soil.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large display of the tractor photograph (printed or projected)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Small jars of different soil samples (topsoil, sand, clay) to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or large screen. Allow students 1-2 minutes to look silently and observe details.\n\n2. **Ask focus questions to draw out observations:**\n   - \"What do you notice about the ground in this picture? What does it look like?\"\n   - \"What is the big machine doing to the soil? Why do you think the farmer is doing this?\"\n   - \"Where does the soil go after the machine plows it? What happens next?\"\n   - \"Have you ever noticed a garden or dirt area being worked on? What did it look like?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what happens to soil when we disturb it with machines. Does it stay the same, or does it change? Let's investigate!\"\n\n4. **Activate prior knowledge:** Have students turn and talk with a partner about what they already know about soil. Chart responses: *\"Soil is made of...\" / \"Soil helps plants by...\" / \"Soil can be...\"*\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become soil scientists and explore how soil changes when it gets disturbed—just like in this farm picture.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how soil breaks down and moves through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 clear plastic cup per student or pair\n- 1 cup of mixed soil (garden soil, sand, clay, small pebbles) per group\n- Spray bottle with water\n- Paper towels\n- Shallow trays (aluminum pans or plastic containers)\n- Popsicle sticks or wooden spoons\n- Magnifying glasses\n- Observation sheets (provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Soil Disturbance (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials.** Give each pair a shallow tray with soil, a popsicle stick, and a spray bottle.\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - Observe your soil closely using the magnifying glass. Draw or describe what you see in your soil (color, size of pieces, texture).\n   - Use the popsicle stick to disturb and plow the soil back and forth, mimicking a tractor. Do this 10 times.\n   - Spray a small amount of water on the plowed soil. Watch what happens for 30 seconds.\n   - Record: What changed? What happened to the soil? Did any soil move? Where?\n\n3. **Teacher role:** Circulate and ask guiding questions without providing answers:\n   - \"What are you observing happening to the soil?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the water caused that to happen?\"\n   - \"How is this similar to what the tractor does?\"\n\n4. **Expected student outcomes:** Students will observe that:\n   - Plowing breaks up compacted soil into smaller pieces.\n   - Water causes loose soil to move or erode.\n   - Different soil pieces (sand, clay, rocks) separate and move at different rates.\n\n**Documentation:** Students complete an observation sheet with drawings or written descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to the photograph and Earth science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart with vocabulary terms (written beforehand)\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):** Ask 3-4 pairs to briefly describe what they observed. Record key words on chart paper: *\"soil moved,\" \"broke apart,\" \"water made it flow,\" \"machines disturbed it.\"*\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (8 minutes):** Using student observations as anchors, teach these terms:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   \n   - **Soil:** The loose material covering Earth's surface, made of broken rock, minerals, and dead plants and animals. *\"It's what plants grow in!\"*\n   \n   - **Erosion:** When soil, rock, or sand is worn away and moved from one place to another by water, wind, or ice. *\"In your experiment, the water caused erosion when it washed the soil away.\"*\n   \n   - **Weathering:** The breaking down of rock and soil into smaller and smaller pieces over time. *\"Your popsicle stick acted like a machine to weather (break up) the soil.\"*\n   \n   - **Natural resource:** Something found in nature that people use. Soil is a natural resource because we use it to grow food. *\"Farmers depend on soil to grow crops!\"*\n\n3. **Make connections to photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the plowed field in the photo: \"See how the earth is all turned up and disturbed? That's what happens when machines plow the soil to prepare it for planting.\"\n   - \"The farmer is using tools to cause weathering and erosion intentionally—to prepare the soil for seeds. But rain and wind also cause erosion on this field naturally.\"\n   - \"Soil is being changed right in front of us. Some of that soil might wash away in heavy rain, just like in your experiment!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:** Ask:\n   - \"Can you point to the soil in this photo?\"\n   - \"What happened to the soil when we added water to our experiment? That was _____ (erosion).\"\n   - \"Why is soil important to farmers?\"\n\n**Expected student outcomes:** Students understand that soil is a natural resource that changes due to both human activities (plowing) and natural processes (weathering and erosion).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to a new scenario and think about real-world impacts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 3-4 different soil samples in jars (sandy soil, clay-heavy soil, rich topsoil, soil mixed with mulch or compost)\n- Images of farmland, construction sites, and eroded hillsides (printed or displayed)\n- \"Soil Detective\" investigation sheet (provided below)\n- Magnifying glasses\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**\"Soil Detective: Which Soil Erodes Fastest?\" (15-20 minutes)**\n\n1. **Set up a new challenge:** Display three soil samples and explain:\n   - \"Different types of soil erode at different rates. Some soil washes away quickly in rain, and some stays put. Farmers need to understand their soil to protect it.\"\n\n2. **Student directions:**\n   - Examine each soil sample using the magnifying glass. Look at grain size, color, and texture.\n   - Predict (guess): Which soil do you think will erode the fastest if water flows through it? Why?\n   - Optional: If time allows, test one or two samples by pouring water through them in a filter or funnel—observe which releases more sediment (cloudy water).\n   - Record your predictions and observations on the \"Soil Detective\" sheet.\n\n3. **Discuss real-world application:**\n   - Show images of erosion: a construction site, a plowed field after heavy rain, an eroded hillside.\n   - Ask: \"How does understanding soil help farmers? What problems might erosion cause on a farm?\"\n   - Guide students to recognize that soil loss affects crop growth and water quality in streams.\n\n4. **Teacher role:** Facilitate thinking without giving answers. Ask:\n   - \"Why do you think that soil would erode faster?\"\n   - \"Where does the eroded soil go? Does it stay in the field or wash away?\"\n\n**Expected student outcomes:** Students recognize that soil type affects erosion rate and that protecting soil is important for farming and the environment.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of soil change, erosion, and human impact on Earth systems.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing):**\n- Observation during Explore: Are students able to describe what they observe about soil disturbance and water movement?\n- Vocabulary check-in (during Explain): Can students use \"erosion,\" \"weathering,\" and \"soil\" correctly in context?\n- Prediction accuracy (during Elaborate): Do student predictions about soil erosion show cause-and-effect reasoning?\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket with these questions:\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Show a picture of plowed farmland. Label the soil, and draw an arrow showing how water causes erosion.\n\n2. **Fill in the blank:**\n   - \"Soil is a natural resource because _________________________.\"\n   - \"When a machine plows the ground, it causes __________________ (weathering/erosion).\"\n\n3. **Think about it:** \"A farmer plants crops on a hillside. Heavy rain comes. What might happen to the soil? Why?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate proficiency if they:\n- Correctly identify soil in visual representations.\n- Use at least one vocabulary term (erosion, weathering, or natural resource) appropriately.\n- Show understanding that soil changes and moves due to both human activities and natural processes.\n- Make a reasonable prediction about erosion based on their observations.\n\n**Expected student outcomes:** Most students will show growing understanding of soil as a dynamic natural resource and recognize how both farming and weather cause soil to move and change.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary anchor chart:** Create a classroom display with pictures, definitions, and examples for soil, erosion, weathering, and natural resource. Students can reference this during activities.\n\n2. **Sentence frames for explanations:** Provide frames like:\n   - \"The soil changed because __________________.\"\n   - \"The water caused __________________ when it moved the soil.\"\n   - Allow students to use drawings or models instead of written explanations.\n\n3. **Simplified exit ticket:** Reduce to 2 questions and allow yes/no or multiple-choice options:\n   - \"Did the water move the soil? Yes / No\"\n   - \"Is soil a natural resource that people use? Yes / No\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Soil conservation research:** Ask students to research and present one farming practice that protects soil from erosion (e.g., contour plowing, terracing, cover crops, windbreaks). Create a simple poster or presentation.\n\n2. **Quantitative investigation:** Have students measure and compare erosion rates from different soil types using a timed water pour. Record how much sediment (cloudy material) is in the water from each sample after 30 seconds, 1 minute, etc. Graph results.\n\n3. **Design challenge:** \"Design a system to slow down erosion on a farm field.\" Students sketch or build a model using available materials (sand, rocks, barriers) to show how to reduce soil loss.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Soil Profile in a Jar:** Students layer different materials (sand, gravel, soil, leaves, water) in a clear jar to create a model soil profile. They observe how layers separate and settle, connecting to real soil layers seen in road cuts or farm excavations. This extends understanding to how soil forms over time (4-ESS1-1).\n\n2. **Water Runoff Investigation:** Set up a simple model farm field (tray of soil on an incline) and compare runoff water clarity when soil is bare versus planted with grass or covered with mulch. Students predict and test which cover reduces erosion most effectively, connecting to real land management practices (4-ESS3-2).\n\n3. **Farm Field Visit or Virtual Tour:** Use Google Earth or a virtual farm tour to examine farmland in your region. Have students look for evidence of erosion, plowing patterns, and different crops. Discuss why farmers make the choices they do based on their soil and local weather (4-ESS3-1).\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure students wash hands after handling soil. Use non-toxic soil samples.\n- **Preparation:** Collect soil samples from different local sources (garden, construction site, potted plant, sandy area) a few days before the lesson.\n- **Photography Connection:** The tractor image is powerful for Fourth Graders—most will connect to farming through food or family experience. Use this entry point generously.\n- **Real-world link:** If possible, invite a local farmer or soil scientist for a brief video call or visit to share why soil matters to their work.\n\nThis lesson directly honors the photograph's depiction of soil disturbance while keeping focus on Earth science concepts of erosion, weathering, and natural resources.",
