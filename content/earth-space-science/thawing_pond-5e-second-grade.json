Observe and describe how water changes from solid (ice) to liquid during spring and explain that this change happens slowly over time.\n2. Identify water in different forms (solid ice and liquid water) in the photograph and in their local environment.\n3. Create a simple model or drawing showing how land and water interact in a landscape like the one in the photograph.\n4. Use observations to explain that Earth events, like ice melting, can happen slowly and take many days or weeks.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about water changing states and landscapes changing over time using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the thawing pond\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: ice cubes in a cup (real-world connection)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it for the whole class. Ask students to sit in a gathering area where they can all see clearly.\n\n2. **Pose these opening questions** (allow 30 seconds of think-time before calling on students):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Tell me about the water you notice.\"\n   - \"Do you see anything that looks frozen or icy? What makes you think that?\"\n   - \"If this is springtime, what might have been here a few weeks ago?\"\n   - \"What do you think happened to make the ice turn into water?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge** by asking: \"Has anyone seen ice melting before? Maybe an ice cube in a glass of water, or ice on a puddle, or icicles on a house? Tell us what you noticed.\"\n\n4. **Show a real ice cube melting** (if available) in a clear cup. Set it on a windowsill or near a heat source and say: \"We're going to watch this ice cube start to melt during our lesson today. It's going to change slowly—we might not see it happen all at once, but by the end of class, we should see a difference.\"\n\n5. **Chart student observations** on paper: \"What we see in the photograph\" (trees, water, land, brown grass, fence, etc.).\n\n**Transition:** \"The water in that pond used to be completely frozen in ice, just like our ice cube. Let's do some exploring to understand how water changes and how it shapes the land around it.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the properties of water in solid and liquid states and observe how water interacts with land.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Ice cubes (enough for pairs or small groups)\n- Cups or small containers\n- Water (liquid, at room temperature)\n- Paper towels\n- Hand lenses (magnifying glasses) if available\n- Sandy soil or sand in shallow trays or containers\n- Water spray bottles or watering cans\n- Notebook paper or exploration sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Observing Ice and Water (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs or small groups** (3-4 students per group works well).\n\n2. **Give each group an ice cube, a cup of liquid water, and a hand lens** (if available).\n\n3. **Provide student directions:**\n   - \"Look at the ice cube with your hand lens. How does it feel? Is it hard or soft? Can you describe its color and shape?\"\n   - \"Now look at the water in the cup. How is it different from the ice? What do you notice about how it moves?\"\n   - \"Touch the ice cube gently. Touch the water. How do they feel different?\"\n   - \"Record what you observe by drawing a picture of the ice and a picture of the water. Label which is solid and which is liquid.\"\n\n4. **Circulate and ask guiding questions** without providing answers:\n   - \"What changes do you notice in the ice cube over time?\"\n   - \"How is water different when it's solid ice versus liquid water?\"\n   - \"If I pour this water on the ground, what would happen?\"\n\n**Part B: Water and Land Interaction (10-12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Transition:** \"Now we're going to see how water can change the land, just like the pond in our photograph changes the banks around it.\"\n\n2. **Set up a sandy soil tray or shallow container of sand** for the class to observe.\n\n3. **Ask:** \"What do you think will happen if we pour water on this soil?\" (Let students predict.)\n\n4. **Pour water slowly onto one side of the soil** while students observe. Ask:\n   - \"What's happening to the sand?\"\n   - \"Is the water moving? Which way?\"\n   - \"How is the shape of the land changing?\"\n\n5. **Allow pairs to experiment:** Give each pair a small amount of sand in a container and a spray bottle of water. Let them gently spray the sand and observe how water changes its shape.\n\n6. **Have students sketch what happens** to the sand when water touches it.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Observe without immediately correcting; listen to student explanations.\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"Why do you think that happened?\" \"What would happen if we added more water?\"\n- Note which students can describe water as solid and liquid, and which students understand that water changes land.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that ice is hard and water is liquid and moveable.\n- Students will see that water can move soil and sand, slowly changing the shape of the land.\n- Students will create drawings showing the difference between ice and water.\n- Students will notice the ice cube melting slightly over the time period.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts; connect exploration to the photograph and larger Earth systems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms and simple definitions\n- The original photograph (projected or printed)\n- Pictures or drawings from the Explore phase (student work)\n- Thermometer (optional, to show temperature change)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather as a whole class.** Have students bring their observation sheets and drawings.\n\n2. **Facilitate a group share-out:**\n   - \"Who wants to tell us about their ice cube? What happened to it?\"\n   - \"What did you notice when we poured water on the sand?\"\n   - \"How is water different when it's ice and when it's liquid?\"\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** (write each on chart paper with simple pictures):\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Solid:** Matter that has its own shape and doesn't change form easily (like ice). Point to the ice cube: \"Ice is solid—it keeps its shape.\"\n   - **Liquid:** Matter that can flow and takes the shape of its container (like water). Point to the water: \"Water is liquid—it moves and pours.\"\n   - **Melting:** When a solid changes into a liquid, usually because it gets warmer. \"Our ice cube is melting—it's turning into liquid water.\"\n   - **Water:** A substance that is essential for life and is found all over Earth in oceans, lakes, ponds, rivers, rain, and ice.\n   - **Erosion:** The slow wearing away or moving of soil and rock by water, wind, or ice. \"The moving water wore away the sand—that's erosion.\"\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the pond in the image: \"This is a body of water—liquid water, like what we just explored.\"\n   - Point to the banks and ground: \"Look at the shape of the land around the pond. Water can slowly change the shape of land over many weeks and months.\"\n   - \"In winter, this pond was probably frozen solid with ice, just like our ice cube. As spring came and got warmer, the ice melted slowly into liquid water. This didn't happen all at once—it took many days.\"\n\n5. **Show the real ice cube again:** \"How much has it melted since we started class? Even though we can see it's changed, it happened very slowly. The pond in our picture melted the same way—very, very slowly over many weeks.\"\n\n6. **Check for understanding using these strategies:**\n   - \"Show me with your hands: Is ice a solid or a liquid?\" (Make a shape with your hands; don't change it.)\n   - \"Is water a solid or a liquid?\" (Let your hands move freely, like water flows.)\n   - \"Can anyone tell me what melting means in your own words?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will understand that ice is solid and water is liquid.\n- Students will learn that melting is a change that happens when ice gets warm.\n- Students will recognize that water exists in different places on Earth (ponds, lakes, rivers, rain, snow, ice).\n- Students will understand that water slowly changes the shape of land over time.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a model of the landscape in the photograph and predicting what happens over seasons.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Shallow containers or trays (one per pair or small group)\n- Sand and soil mixture\n- Water spray bottles\n- Small twigs or popsicle sticks (to represent trees)\n- Rocks or pebbles\n- Blue paper or plastic sheet (to represent water/pond)\n- Chart paper: \"Changes Over Time\" (seasons chart)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Build a Model Landscape (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Explain:** \"You're going to build a small model of a landscape like the one in our photograph. Your model will have land, water, and trees.\"\n\n2. **Provide student directions:**\n   - \"Place your blue paper or plastic in one area of your tray—this is your pond or lake.\"\n   - \"Use sand and soil to build land around your water. Make it sloped, like in our photograph.\"\n   - \"Place twigs or sticks to represent trees.\"\n   - \"Add rocks or pebbles if you want.\"\n\n3. **Once models are built:** \"Now we're going to add water to your model. Very gently spray water on the land near your pond. What happens? Does the water flow? Does it change the shape of the sand? Draw or describe what happens.\"\n\n4. **Ask:** \"If we kept spraying water on this model for many days, what would happen to the land? How would it change?\"\n\n**Part B: Seasonal Changes Chart (5-8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Create a chart on paper with four columns:** Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall.\n\n2. **Discuss with students:** \"What do you think the pond looked like in each season?\"\n   - Winter: \"Frozen ice\"\n   - Spring: \"Ice melting, becoming liquid water\"\n   - Summer: \"Liquid water, maybe warm\"\n   - Fall: \"Getting colder, water might start to freeze\"\n\n3. **Have students draw or write** what they think happens to the pond and land in each season. Encourage them to include whether water is solid or liquid.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: \"Why did you build your landscape that way?\" \"What do you think will happen if water keeps moving across this sand?\"\n- Help students recognize patterns: ice → liquid water → moving water → erosion over time.\n- Ask questions that encourage prediction: \"What would happen in the winter? Would this happen quickly or slowly?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create a model showing land, water, and how they interact.\n- Students will observe that water moving across land can change its shape (erosion).\n- Students will predict seasonal changes to water and landscape.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding that these changes happen slowly.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of water states, water location, and slow Earth changes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observe students' descriptions of ice versus water during Explore phase.\n- Listen to vocabulary use during group discussions.\n- Review student drawings and models for evidence of understanding water states and landscape changes.\n- Ask individual students: \"Can you show me where water is in the photograph?\" \"What does melting mean?\"\n\n**Exit Ticket (given at end of lesson, 5-8 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a simple exit ticket (can be verbal for students who need support, or written/drawn for others). Ask:\n\n1. **\"Draw or tell me: Is this ice a solid or a liquid? How do you know?\"** (Show a picture of ice, or hold up an ice cube.)\n\n2. **\"What does 'melting' mean? Give an example.\"**\n\n3. **\"The pond in our photograph was frozen in winter. Tell me what happened to it in spring. Did it melt quickly or slowly?\"**\n\n4. **\"Where is water found on Earth? Name at least two places.\"** (Accept answers like: ponds, lakes, oceans, rivers, rain, ice, snow.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n✓ **Students have met learning objectives if they can:**\n- Identify water in solid form (ice) and liquid form in the photograph and in real objects.\n- Describe melting using the word \"change\" or explain that solid turns to liquid.\n- State that the pond's ice melting is a slow change (takes many days/weeks).\n- Identify at least two places where water exists on Earth (pond, ocean, lake, river, rain, ice, snow).\n- Create or describe a simple model showing land and water together.\n\n✓ **If most students answer 3-4 of the above, they have met the standards.**\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of second graders should be able to distinguish between solid ice and liquid water.\n- 75% should be able to explain that melting happens slowly.\n- 85% should be able to identify water in at least two different places on Earth.\n- 70% should be able to describe or model how water and land interact (even simply).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Concrete demonstration with repetition:** Provide additional time with real ice and water. Repeat vocabulary multiple times using the actual objects (hold up ice: \"This is solid.\" Hold up water: \"This is liquid.\"). Use a thermometer to show warmth causing the change, making the cause-and-effect visible.\n\n2. **Simplified vocabulary and visual aids:** Create a visual word wall with pictures of ice, water, and melting. Use only the word \"melting\" and \"water\" if other terms feel too abstract. Allow students to point and match pictures rather than write or draw.\n\n3. **Paired exploration:** Partner struggling learners with a peer or provide teacher-guided small-group exploration. Ask simpler questions: \"Is this cold or warm?\" \"Does it move?\" \"Can you pour it?\" rather than abstract questions about states of matter.\n\n4. **Modified exit ticket:** Ask students to simply point to pictures of ice versus water, or answer yes/no questions: \"Is ice a liquid? Is water a liquid?\"\n\n#### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deeper investigation of erosion:** Ask: \"If water keeps flowing over sand, what will happen after many days? What about after a whole month?\" Have them predict and design a more complex model where they test different amounts of water or slopes.\n\n2. **Multiple water sources:** Extend to asking: \"Where else on Earth is water found? Is it all the same—solid or liquid?\" Introduce glacier, snowpack, and groundwater concepts. Have them research and create a poster: \"Water All Around Earth.\"\n\n3. **Timeline and rates of change:** Ask students to estimate: \"How long would it take for all the ice in this pond to melt? One day? One week? One month?\" Have them keep a daily observation log of the ice cube, measuring it or drawing its size daily, and graphing the change.\n\n4. **Real-world connection:** Research a local body of water (pond, lake, river) and find images of it in different seasons. Have them compare and explain the seasonal changes they observe using their new vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Water Detective\" Walk (15-20 minutes):** Take students on a short outdoor walk around the school grounds to find water in different places (puddle, rain barrel, stream, water faucet, wet soil after rain). Have them photograph or sketch each location and create a class map showing \"Where Water Lives at Our School.\"\n\n2. **Winter-to-Spring Photo Comparison:** Collect images (or have students bring photos from home) of the same outdoor location in winter and spring. Compare and discuss: \"Where is the snow and ice? Where is liquid water? How did the land change? Was it fast or slow?\" Create a bulletin board titled \"Our Environment Changes.\"\n\n3. **Melting Speed Experiment:** Students predict which will melt faster: an ice cube in sunlight, an ice cube in shade, or an ice cube in cold water. They check every 5 minutes and record observations. Discuss: \"Why do some melt faster? How does this connect to our pond in the photograph? (The sun warmed the pond in spring.)\"\n\n4. **Story Writing:** \"Where Does Water Go?\" Students draw and write (or dictate) a story following water from ice in winter, through melting, to flowing as a liquid in spring, then evaporating or flowing into a larger body of water. Use vocabulary: solid, liquid, melting, water.\n\n5. **Model Erosion Challenge:** Give students sand, water, and containers. Challenge: \"Design the steepest slope possible. Predict where the water will erode the most sand. Then test your prediction by pouring water at the top. Were you correct?\"\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Timing flexibility:** This lesson can be taught over two consecutive 45-minute periods, or as three shorter 30-minute sessions if students need more processing time.\n- **Real-world connection:** If it's actually spring where you teach, take photos of local thawing ponds or melting ice and compare to the photograph. This makes the learning immediate and relevant.\n- **Safety:** Supervise ice and water activities closely. Ensure floor is not slippery; use towels to dry spills.\n- **Vocabulary repetition:** Second graders need to hear new words 5-10 times in context. Use \"solid,\" \"liquid,\" and \"melting\" consistently throughout all phases.\n- **Assessment note:** Some second graders may still be developing abstract thinking about states of matter. Anchor all instruction to concrete objects (real ice and water) they can touch and observe.",
