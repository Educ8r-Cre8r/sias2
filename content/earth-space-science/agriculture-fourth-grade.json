  "content": "Look at this powerful green tractor working in a field! This heavy machine uses its big wheels and strong engine to pull farming tools that help prepare soil for planting crops. The tractor's large tires spread out its weight so it doesn't sink into soft dirt. Farmers use tractors like this to grow the food we eat every day. What do you think would happen if this tractor tried to work in your backyard?",
