Identify and describe different types of rocks by size, color, and shape.\n2. Explain how rocks and stones can be used to build structures and change the land.\n3. Predict what might happen to a stack of rocks when wind or water pushes against it.\n4. Build a stable rock structure and test how different arrangements affect its strength.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about rocks and landforms using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or large digital display of the photograph (IMG_4086.jpeg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- \"Wonder Wall\" bulletin board or paper strip collection\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or as a printed poster where all students can see clearly. Ask students to sit where they have a good view.\n\n2. **Direct students' attention** to the prominent rock stack in the center of the image. Say: \"Look at this special pile of rocks in someone's yard. What do you notice about it?\"\n\n3. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause after each to allow thinking time):\n   - \"Why do you think someone stacked all these rocks here? What is this rock pile doing?\"\n   - \"Look at the rocks. Are they all the same size? What differences do you see?\"\n   - \"Do you think wind and rain could make this rock stack fall apart? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"Have you ever made a stack with rocks, blocks, or other things? What happened to your stack?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** Say, \"I want you to think like a scientist. If strong wind blew on this rock stack, what do you predict would happen? Turn to a neighbor and share your idea.\" Record 3-4 student predictions on chart paper.\n\n5. **Wonder prompt:** Ask, \"What questions do you have about how we can stack rocks to make them stay strong?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become rock builders! We'll explore how to stack and arrange rocks, just like the builders did in this picture, and we'll test if our rock stacks can stand up to wind and water.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how rocks can be arranged and test the stability of rock structures.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- 15-20 rocks or stones of varying sizes (collect beforehand from playground, local landscaping supplier, or purchase river rocks from a hardware store)\n- Shallow trays or plastic bins lined with paper towels (to contain rocks)\n- Small spray bottles filled with water\n- Cardboard cards or chart paper squares (for recording observations)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Tape\n\n**Activity — Student Directions:**\n\n**Part A: Sorting and Observing Rocks (8 minutes)**\n\n1. Distribute a tray with 15-20 mixed rocks to each group.\n\n2. Say to students: \"Spread out your rocks on your tray. Look at each one carefully. Now, sort your rocks into piles. You can sort by size (big and small), color (light and dark), or shape (round and flat). You decide! What makes sense to you?\"\n\n3. As groups sort, ask: \"Tell me about your sorting choice. Why did you sort this way?\"\n\n4. Have groups share one sorting choice aloud. Then ask: \"Could we sort these rocks a different way?\" Demonstrate re-sorting if needed.\n\n**Part B: Building and Testing Rock Stacks (12-15 minutes)**\n\n1. Say: \"Now, you're going to be rock builders. I want you to make a stack with your rocks. Stack them so they stay together. Make it as tall and strong as you can. You have 5 minutes to build.\"\n\n2. **Circulate** and observe. Ask guiding questions (don't give answers):\n   - \"Which rocks did you choose for the bottom? Why?\"\n   - \"Are your rocks fitting together tightly? What happens if they don't?\"\n   - \"What else could you try to make it stronger?\"\n\n3. Once stacks are built, say: \"Now we're going to test your stacks. I'm going to spray a little water near your rocks. This is like rain. Watch what happens.\"\n\n4. Using spray bottles, gently spray near each stack with 2-3 spritzes. Ask: \"What happened to your rocks? Did any rocks move? Did your stack stay strong?\"\n\n5. Provide each group a **recording sheet** (simple drawing):\n   - Top half: Draw your rock stack BEFORE water\n   - Bottom half: Draw your rock stack AFTER water\n   - Write or tell: \"What happened?\"\n\n6. Have students sketch their observations and dictate or write one sentence about what happened.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate to each group, ask open-ended questions, and observe problem-solving strategies without providing answers.\n- Ensure water testing is done safely; supervise spray bottles.\n- Encourage students to describe what they observe in specific terms: \"tall,\" \"wobbly,\" \"strong,\" \"flat rocks,\" \"rocks sliding.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create varied rock stacks using different arrangements.\n- Students will observe that water/spray affects their structures differently depending on how rocks are stacked.\n- Students will record observations through drawings and simple descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to real-world rock structures.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Printed photographs of natural rock formations (optional: Google Images of balanced rocks, stone walls, cairns)\n- Vocabulary cards with pictures and words\n- Student-drawn recording sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to show their rock stack drawings and briefly describe what happened during the water test.\n   - Ask the class: \"Why do you think some stacks stayed strong and others didn't?\"\n   - Record student ideas on chart paper without judgment.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (5-6 minutes):**\n   \n   Display and explain these terms using visuals and the student-built stacks as references:\n   \n   - **Rock:** A hard, solid piece of Earth that is made of minerals. (Point to the rocks: \"These are rocks. They are hard and don't break easily.\")\n   \n   - **Landform:** A shape of the land, like a hill, valley, or mountain. (Show the rock stack: \"When we stack rocks, we make a small landform. In nature, rocks pile up to make real landforms.\")\n   \n   - **Stack:** To place one thing on top of another. (Demonstrate with your hands: \"Stack, stack, stack—one on top of another.\")\n   \n   - **Stable:** Able to stay standing and not fall over or move easily. (Point to sturdy stacks from Explore: \"A stable stack has rocks fitted together tightly.\")\n   \n   - **Erosion:** When wind, water, or weather wears away rocks and land over time. (Say: \"The water spray tested erosion—we saw how water could shift your rocks, just like water wears away rocks in nature.\")\n\n3. **Connect to Photograph (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Redisplay the original photograph.\n   - Say: \"Look at this rock structure. It's built on someone's land. The rocks are stacked to stay strong, like we did in our experiment. Over a long time, rain and wind might slowly move these rocks, just like the water spray moved some of your rocks. That's erosion!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I want to build a stack that stays strong even when water splashes it, what should I do?\" (Accept responses: use flat rocks, put big rocks on bottom, pack rocks tight together)\n   - Have students give thumbs up if they understand \"stable\" and thumbs sideways if they're not sure.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define rock, landform, stack, stable, and erosion in their own words.\n- Students recognize that their exploration activity was similar to how natural erosion works.\n- Students understand that how rocks are arranged affects their stability.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their learning by building improved structures and testing different solutions to prevent collapse.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- 20-25 rocks of varying sizes\n- Spray bottles with water\n- Soil or sand in a shallow bin\n- Small objects to represent barriers: sticks, cardboard pieces, plastic blocks\n- Paper for recording predictions and results\n\n**Activity — \"Build a Better Stack\":**\n\n1. **Introduce the challenge:** Say, \"Now you're going to be engineers. Your job is to make a rock stack that is EVEN STRONGER. You can try different ways. Some ideas: Use the flattest rocks you have. Put the biggest, heaviest rocks on the bottom. Pack the rocks tightly. Or, you could build a wall or barrier to protect your stack from water. What do you think will work best?\"\n\n2. **Student task:** Rebuilding with a focus on stability (5-7 minutes)\n   - Groups rebuild one stack using at least ONE new strategy from the suggestions.\n   - Encourage experimentation: \"What if you tried...?\"\n   - Have students predict: \"Do you think this stack will be stronger? Why?\"\n\n3. **Test and compare (5-6 minutes):**\n   - Test the new stacks with spray water again.\n   - Ask: \"Did your new stack stay stronger? What did you change? Did it help?\"\n\n4. **Real-world connection (2-3 minutes):**\n   - Show pictures of real stone walls or cairns (stacked rock structures used by hikers, farmers, and ancient peoples).\n   - Say: \"People build with rocks all over the world. Farmers build stone walls to keep animals in fields. Hikers stack rocks to mark trails. These builders know about stability, just like you do!\"\n\n5. **Record improvements:**\n   - Have students draw or describe ONE change they made and why it helped (or didn't help).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate problem-solving; ask, \"What happens if you try...?\" rather than directing.\n- Validate all attempts: \"That's a smart idea to test. What did you learn?\"\n- Celebrate persistence: \"You tried that three times! That's how scientists work.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will apply concepts of stability and arrangement to redesign structures.\n- Students will articulate reasons why certain arrangements work better.\n- Students will recognize real-world applications of rock building.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rocks, landforms, stability, and erosion.\n\n**Activity — Multi-Part Assessment:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** during Explore and Elaborate:\n  - Does student identify different rock sizes/shapes?\n  - Does student attempt to build intentionally (not randomly)?\n  - Does student observe and describe changes after water test?\n  - Does student use vocabulary (stable, stack, rock, erosion) appropriately?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Individual, 3-5 minutes):**\nProvide each student with a simple drawing or question sheet:\n\n**Option 1 (Drawing-Based, good for all readers):**\n- Draw a picture of a strong rock stack.\n- Draw an arrow showing where water is splashing.\n- Circle the part of your stack that might move first.\n\n**Option 2 (Question-Based, for students with stronger literacy):**\nRead aloud or display these questions:\n1. \"What is one thing you learned about rocks today?\"\n2. \"Why do some stacks stay strong and others fall?\"\n3. \"If you built a rock stack outside, what might break it apart?\" (Accept: wind, rain, water, erosion)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- Correctly identify at least 2 characteristics of rocks (size, color, shape, hardness).\n- Explain that rock arrangement affects stability (use words like \"flat,\" \"bottom,\" \"tight,\" \"heavy\").\n- Recognize that water/weather can move rocks (basic understanding of erosion).\n- Can describe or draw a stack and predict what happens when water interacts with it.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will correctly complete the exit ticket with drawings or simple written responses.\n- Students will use vocabulary from the lesson (rock, stack, stable, water, wind).\n- Students will show understanding that structure and material arrangement matter for stability.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners):\n\n1. **Reduced complexity in sorting (Explore Phase):**\n   - Provide pre-sorted rocks in only 2 categories (big/small OR light/dark) rather than mixed piles.\n   - Partner student with a stronger peer during stacking.\n\n2. **Vocabulary scaffolding (Explain Phase):**\n   - Use picture cards alongside words; repeat vocabulary 4-5 times throughout lesson.\n   - Provide a word wall with photos of each term.\n   - Allow student to respond with pointing or thumbs up/down rather than verbal responses initially.\n\n3. **Modified recording (Explore & Elaborate):**\n   - Provide sentence frames: \"My stack is _____ (tall/short). Water made the rocks _____.\"\n   - Allow verbal descriptions instead of writing; scribe for student.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners):\n\n1. **Extend exploration to real-world engineering:**\n   - Ask: \"How could we build a rock wall to protect a garden from wind? What do you know about how walls are built?\"\n   - Challenge: Build a multi-section wall or barrier and test its effectiveness.\n\n2. **Introduce variables:**\n   - Explore how different liquids affect rocks: water vs. oil vs. salt water. Record predictions and results.\n   - Test rocks of different types (if available): granite, limestone, sandstone. Which is strongest?\n\n3. **Connect to Earth systems:**\n   - Research erosion in nature using photos; create a poster: \"How Erosion Shapes Mountains.\"\n   - Design a solution to prevent erosion at a real location (e.g., riverbank, hillside near school).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### 1. **Erosion in a Pan** (Follow-up lesson, 20-25 minutes)\nSet up a sloped pan filled with soil and small rocks. Slowly pour water at the top and observe how soil and rocks move (sediment transport/erosion simulation). Students predict, observe, and describe the \"rivers\" of water created. Connect to the idea that water shapes landforms over time.\n\n### 2. **Rock Collection and Classification** (Homework or independent work)\nSend home instructions for students to collect 3-5 rocks from their neighborhood or yard. Have them sort by color, size, or texture and bring them back to create a classroom rock display with labels. This reinforces observation skills and extends learning beyond school.\n\n### 3. **Stone Structures Around Our School** (Real-world observation walk, 15-20 minutes)\nTake students on a short walking tour of the school grounds to find human-made and natural rock/stone features: playground rocks, landscaping stones, brick walls, pavers. Have students sketch or photograph one structure and discuss: \"Why is it built this way? What keeps it stable?\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Tips for Success\n\n1. **Collect rocks beforehand:** Gather a variety of sizes and shapes. River rocks (smooth) and rough stones both work well. Aim for 15-20 rocks per group.\n\n2. **Keep water testing controlled:** Use spray bottles with a gentle mist, not heavy streams. This prevents splashing and keeps the activity contained.\n\n3. **Emphasize observation language:** Encourage students to use descriptive words (wobbly, tight, uneven, strong, flat, round) to build academic vocabulary naturally.\n\n4. **Celebrate failure:** Stacks that fall apart are powerful learning tools. Say: \"Great! Now we know what NOT to do. What should we try next?\"\n\n5. **Connect to prior knowledge:** Ask students about their own experiences building with blocks, sand, or LEGO to activate schema before the lesson begins.",
