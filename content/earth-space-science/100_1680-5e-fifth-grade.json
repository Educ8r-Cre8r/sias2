ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about water, freezing, and seasonal change using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph projected on screen or printed large (1 copy per small group or whole-class display)\n- Chart paper and markers (optional, for recording predictions)\n- Access to globe or map showing where freezing winters occur\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph** (2 minutes): Show the winter landscape image without providing context. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Opening Discussion Questions** (8–12 minutes):\n   - \"What do you notice about the water in this picture? Can you describe its form—is it liquid like a cup of water, or something different?\"\n   - \"Where do you see water in this image? Look carefully—it might not all look like a regular puddle or lake!\"\n   - \"Why do you think the evergreen tree on the left looks different from the bare trees in the background? What does the white covering tell us about temperature?\"\n   - \"If we visited this same spot in July, what would look different? What would happen to all that snow and ice?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt** (2–3 minutes):\n   - Pose this challenge: *\"If all the snow and ice in this winter scene melted, where would the water go? Would there be more water in the lake, the ground, or the air?\"*\n   - Have students turn to a partner and make one prediction they can draw or write.\n\n**Transition:** \"You've noticed that water changes form when it gets really cold. Today, we're going to investigate how water moves between the ground, air, and sky during winter—and discover why frozen water is so important to Earth's systems.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how water exists in frozen and liquid forms and model how freezing affects different environments.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2–3 students):**\n- 1 clear plastic cup (8 oz)\n- Water (room temperature)\n- Ice cubes (5–6 per group)\n- Thermometer (optional but helpful)\n- Aluminum foil\n- Paper towels\n- Small twigs, pebbles, or soil samples (to represent landscape features)\n- Observation sheet (printed, see directions below)\n- Freezer access or cooler with ice pack (prepared by teacher beforehand)\n\n**Activity: \"Freeze Frame Landscapes\"**\n\n**Step-by-Step Directions:**\n\n1. **Set Up** (3 minutes):\n   - Give each group a clear plastic cup with room-temperature water.\n   - Have them add soil, pebbles, and twigs to represent a landscape (like the lakeside in the photo).\n   - Ask: \"What does this represent?\" (A landscape with water and land.)\n\n2. **Observe the Starting State** (2 minutes):\n   - Students draw or describe what they see (liquid water, soil, objects).\n   - Record observations on the observation sheet.\n\n3. **Simulate Winter Freezing** (3 minutes):\n   - Carefully place 3–4 ice cubes into the cup of water.\n   - If thermometers are available, check the temperature.\n   - Ask: \"What is happening to the water now?\"\n\n4. **Wait and Observe** (5 minutes):\n   - As ice melts or water begins to chill, students observe.\n   - Teacher circulates: \"What shape is the ice? Is it moving? How does the water feel now compared to before?\"\n\n5. **Deep Freeze Scenario** (5 minutes):\n   - Tell students: \"Imagine the temperature drops even more—so much that the water freezes solid, like a frozen lake.\"\n   - Place cups in a cooler with an ice pack (or in a freezer if available for 10–15 minutes) **OR** have teacher-prepared \"frozen\" cups ready to swap in.\n   - When water is frozen (or partially frozen), students observe and record:\n     - How does the ice look different from liquid water?\n     - What happened to the soil and objects? Are they still visible or frozen in place?\n     - Can you bend or move the ice like you could move liquid water?\n\n6. **Reverse the Process** (2 minutes):\n   - Remove the frozen cup and allow it to sit at room temperature.\n   - Ask: \"What do you predict will happen as it warms up? Where will the water go?\"\n   - Students record predictions.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: *\"What changed? Why did the water become solid? If the sun warmed this cup up, what would happen next?\"*\n- Do NOT explain freezing or the water cycle yet—let students discover through observation.\n- Redirect observations back to the photograph: *\"Do you see similar frozen water in the picture we looked at?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that water changes from liquid to solid (ice) when temperature drops.\n- Students observe that frozen water holds its shape and can trap objects within it.\n- Students predict that melting will reverse the process.\n- Student observation sheets show sketches/descriptions of the starting, frozen, and (predicted) melting states.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and Earth systems concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms pre-written (or interactive whiteboard)\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Visual aids: diagrams of the water cycle, or images of frozen water reservoirs\n- Markers for annotating the photograph\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out** (5 minutes):\n   - Ask 2–3 groups to share their observations: \"What did you notice when the water froze? What changed?\"\n   - Record key observations on chart paper.\n   - Affirm discoveries: *\"You found that water becomes solid and hard when it's very cold. That's exactly what happens in winter!\"*\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (7–10 minutes):\n   - Display and define these terms using student-friendly language:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Freezing**: When liquid water becomes solid ice because the temperature drops below 32°F (0°C).\n   - **Hydrosphere**: All the water on Earth—in oceans, lakes, rivers, ice, snow, and even clouds.\n   - **Frozen Water Reservoir**: A large storage area of frozen freshwater, like a frozen lake, snow cover, or icicles.\n   - **Precipitation**: Water that falls from clouds to Earth, such as rain or snow.\n   - **Geosphere**: The solid parts of Earth, including soil, rocks, and land.\n   - **Biosphere**: All living things on Earth, including plants and animals.\n\n3. **Connect Back to the Photograph** (3–5 minutes):\n   - Display the winter photograph again.\n   - Point to specific features and label them using new vocabulary:\n     - *\"The snow on the lake is part of the **hydrosphere** right now—it's frozen water.\"*\n     - *\"The bare trees are part of the **biosphere**—they've adapted to cold by dropping leaves.\"*\n     - *\"The ground and rocks are part of the **geosphere**, and they're frozen hard by the cold **hydrosphere** (water) on top.\"*\n   - Ask: *\"How are all these parts working together in this winter scene?\"*\n\n4. **Explain the Winter Water Cycle** (3–5 minutes):\n   - Use simple, age-appropriate language:\n     - *\"In winter, when clouds drop snow (precipitation), the snow lands on the ground, trees, and lakes. The water freezes solid because it's so cold. This frozen water—the snow and ice—stays on Earth until spring, when the sun warms it up and melts it back into liquid water.\"*\n     - *\"During winter, the hydrosphere (water), geosphere (land), atmosphere (air with clouds), and biosphere (trees and plants) all interact. Cold air makes water freeze. Ice covers the land. Trees adapt by resting.\"*\n\n5. **Check for Understanding** (1–2 minutes):\n   - Ask: *\"Turn to your partner and point to one thing in this photograph. Then tell them: Is that part of the hydrosphere, geosphere, atmosphere, or biosphere?\"*\n   - Listen to partner conversations to gauge comprehension.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can identify and use vocabulary terms accurately (freezing, hydrosphere, reservoir, etc.).\n- Students understand that winter water is frozen because of low temperatures.\n- Students recognize how Earth's systems (atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, biosphere) interact in a winter landscape.\n- Students can point to examples in the photograph and label them by system.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply concepts to analyze freshwater distribution and predict seasonal changes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Handout: \"Where Is Earth's Freshwater?\" (pie chart template, see below)\n- Handout: \"Seasonal Water Journey\" (scenario cards)\n- Photograph (for reference)\n- Optional: globe or map\n\n**Activity A: Freshwater Reservoirs Sorting** (8–10 minutes)\n\n1. **Display a list of freshwater reservoirs** on chart paper:\n   - Snow on mountains and polar regions\n   - Frozen lakes and rivers\n   - Liquid lakes and rivers\n   - Groundwater (underground water)\n   - Glaciers\n   - Rain in the air (clouds)\n\n2. **Ask students to categorize** (in pairs or small groups):\n   - Which of these are **frozen** right now in winter?\n   - Which are **liquid**?\n   - Which are the **largest** amounts?\n   - Which are **smallest**?\n\n3. **Discuss findings**:\n   - *\"In winter, a lot of Earth's freshwater is frozen. It's locked up as snow and ice. This means less liquid water is available for plants, animals, and people until it melts.\"*\n   - Reference the photograph: *\"That frozen lake and the snow covering everything are freshwater reservoirs in solid form.\"*\n\n**Activity B: Seasonal Water Journey** (7–10 minutes)\n\n1. **Present a scenario** (read aloud or provide scenario cards):\n   - *\"Imagine you are a water droplet. It's January, and you're part of the snow on the frozen lake in this picture. Winter temperatures keep you frozen. The sun is low in the sky. What happens next?\"*\n\n2. **Have students predict and sketch** the journey for spring and summer:\n   - **Spring**: Temperature rises. Snow and ice melt. Water flows into the lake (now liquid).\n   - **Summer**: The sun heats the lake. Water evaporates and becomes water vapor in the air.\n   - **Fall**: Temperature drops. Water condenses into clouds and precipitation falls as rain.\n   - **Winter**: Starts again—rain falls, temperatures drop, water freezes.\n\n3. **Students create a visual** (simple labeled diagram or comic strip) showing the water droplet's journey through one year.\n\n4. **Share and discuss**:\n   - *\"How does a water droplet's journey change based on the season?\"*\n   - *\"Why is winter important? What's the water doing while it's frozen?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate small-group discussions without providing all answers.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"Where does that water go next? What happens when the sun is hotter?\"*\n- Affirm connections to the photograph and earlier observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students categorize freshwater by state (frozen vs. liquid).\n- Students understand that freshwater distribution changes with seasons.\n- Students predict how water moves through Earth's systems based on temperature and season.\n- Students create a visual representation of seasonal water changes.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of water systems, freezing, and Earth systems interactions.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore**: Teacher notes which students accurately describe freezing and solid water properties.\n- **Vocabulary Check (Explain phase)**: Listen to partner conversations when students identify systems in the photograph.\n- **Questioning during Elaborate**: Ask individuals: *\"If the temperature in this winter scene rose to 50°F, what would happen to the hydrosphere?\"* Listen for understanding of melting and state change.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with this one-page exit ticket (can be printed or written on a whiteboard):\n\n---\n\n**Exit Ticket: \"Understanding Winter Water\"**\n\n1. **Look at this winter photograph again.** Point to one place where you see frozen water (ice or snow). Draw a circle around it or write its location.\n\n2. **Complete this sentence:**\n   - \"Frozen water is different from liquid water because ___________________.\"\n\n3. **True or False** (circle one):\n   - \"The snow and ice in this picture are part of Earth's hydrosphere.\"\n   - **True** or **False**\n\n4. **Make a prediction:**\n   - \"When spring arrives and the temperature warms up, what do you think will happen to all the snow and ice? Where will it go?\"\n   - Your answer: ___________________________________________________________\n\n5. **Challenge Question** (for advanced learners):\n   - \"This frozen lake is a freshwater reservoir. Why is it important for people and animals to have freshwater, even when it's frozen as ice?\"\n   - Your answer: ___________________________________________________________\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate mastery if they:\n- ✓ Correctly identify at least one frozen water feature in the photograph.\n- ✓ Explain that freezing changes water's state from liquid to solid.\n- ✓ Recognize frozen water as part of the hydrosphere.\n- ✓ Predict that warming temperatures will melt ice and change water back to liquid form.\n- ✓ (Advanced) Recognize the importance of freshwater reservoirs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students (80%+) will accurately identify frozen water and explain freezing.\n- Students will correctly categorize frozen water as part of the hydrosphere.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding of seasonal water movement and state changes.\n- Exit tickets reveal whether reteaching is needed on Earth systems interactions.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary List**: Provide a visual vocabulary card set with pictures showing frozen water, liquid water, and labeled systems. Students can reference these during all activities.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Sheet**: Create a fill-in-the-blank observation sheet for the Explore phase with sentence starters:\n   - \"The water started as ________________.\"\n   - \"After we added ice, the water became ________________.\"\n   - \"I noticed the ice felt ______________.\"\n\n3. **Photograph Annotation**: During Explain, provide the photograph with boxes already drawn around key features (lake, snow, trees). Students only need to label the system each belongs to (hydrosphere, biosphere, geosphere) with teacher support.\n\n### Challenge (for Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Freshwater Percentage Investigation**: Provide data on Earth's water distribution (e.g., 97% is saltwater, 3% is freshwater, and of that, ~79% is frozen). Have students create a pie chart showing these percentages and explain what this means for water availability in winter vs. summer.\n\n2. **Predict Impact on Biosphere**: Ask advanced students to research and present: *\"How do animals survive winter when so much of the freshwater is frozen? What adaptations do they have?\"* Connection to biosphere interactions.\n\n3. **Seasonal Comparison Project**: Have students collect local weather and precipitation data for one week during winter and compare it to spring/summer data. Create a graph showing how freezing temperatures correlate with snow accumulation and frozen water storage.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Build a Model Landscape\"**: Students use a clear shoebox, sand/soil, twigs, and water to create a miniature landscape. They observe it over one week in a cool location, then in a warm location, documenting how water state changes. Display models in the classroom and discuss observations.\n\n2. **Frozen Freshwater Around the World**: Research project where small groups investigate one frozen freshwater reservoir (Antarctic ice sheet, Arctic sea ice, mountain glaciers, permafrost). Students present where it is, how much freshwater it holds, and what happens to it seasonally. Connection to **5-ESS2-2** (water distribution).\n\n3. **Interview a Winter Water Expert**: Invite a local water utility official, watershed manager, or meteorologist to discuss how freezing affects drinking water supplies, water treatment, and seasonal water management in your region. Students prepare questions beforehand.\n\n4. **Melting Simulation Over Time**: Place identical cups of snow/ice in warm versus cool locations. Measure the water level daily as they melt. Create a line graph showing the melting rate. Discuss variables (sunlight, temperature) that affect the speed of melting.\n\n---\n\n## Answer Key / Teacher Notes\n\n**Exit Ticket Expected Responses:**\n\n1. Students should circle the frozen lake, snow on trees, or snow on ground.\n\n2. \"Frozen water is different from liquid water because **it is hard and solid, holds its shape, and doesn't flow.**\"\n\n3. **True** — Snow and ice are part of Earth's hydrosphere (all water on Earth).\n\n4. \"When spring arrives, the snow and ice will **melt and turn into liquid water, which will flow into the lake or ground, or evaporate into the air.**\"\n\n5. (Advanced) \"Frozen freshwater is important because **it stores water for dry seasons, provides drinking water after melting, and supports ecosystems when it's available again.**\"\n\n---\n\n## NGSS Alignment Summary\n\n| Standard | How This Lesson Addresses It |\n|----------|------------------------------|\n| **5-ESS2-1** | Students develop a model (the cup with water, soil, and ice) and describe how the geosphere (soil, rocks), hydrosphere (water), atmosphere (cold air), and biosphere (twigs representing plants) interact during freezing and seasonal change. |\n| **5-ESS2-2** | Students categorize freshwater in different forms (frozen lakes, snow, liquid water) and discuss how winter changes the distribution of frozen vs. liquid freshwater, providing evidence that a significant portion of freshwater is locked in solid form. |\n\n---\n\nThis lesson moves students from observation → discovery → vocabulary → application, ensuring they understand not just *what* happens when water freezes, but *why* it matters to Earth's systems and seasonal cycles.",
