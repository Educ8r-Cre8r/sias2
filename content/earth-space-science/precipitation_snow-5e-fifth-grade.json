ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of snow falling on a brick courtyard.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph of snowy courtyard scene\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the screen or as a large printed image. Allow students 20-30 seconds of silent viewing.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing think-pair-share time before whole-group responses):\n   - \"What is falling from the sky in this picture? How do you know?\"\n   - \"Where do you think all that snow came from before it fell? Can you trace it backward?\"\n   - \"Why do you think snow falls in winter but rain falls in other seasons? What might be different up in the clouds?\"\n   - \"If we collected all the snow in that courtyard, what would happen to it if it got warmer?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what happens to snow when it melts, and where that water goes next. Let's investigate!\"\n\n4. **Record** student predictions on chart paper (don't correct them yet—these become reference points for the Explain phase).\n\n**Transition:** \"Now we're going to become weather detectives and run an experiment to see how precipitation moves through Earth's systems.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the water cycle and state changes through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials** (per group of 3-4 students):\n- Clear plastic bag or sandwich bag (gallon-sized works best)\n- Water (about 1 cup)\n- Blue food coloring or washable marker\n- Tape\n- Paper towel or coffee filter\n- Warm location (sunny windowsill or heat lamp area)\n- Thermometer (optional, but helpful)\n- Observation journal or worksheet (printed)\n- Cup of ice\n\n**Activity: \"Water's Journey in a Bag\" Investigation**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the bag model:**\n   - Pour 1 cup of water into the plastic bag.\n   - Add 2-3 drops of blue food coloring to the water so you can track it visually.\n   - Seal the bag completely with tape, removing as much air as possible.\n   - Label the bag with your group's name and the date.\n\n2. **Place the bag in a warm location** (windowsill or under a heat lamp) where it will stay undisturbed for 15-20 minutes.\n\n3. **Make observations every 3-5 minutes** and record in your observation journal:\n   - Describe what you see on the *inside* of the bag. Is there water? Is there mist? Where is it?\n   - Use sketches and words to show the blue water, any water droplets on the sides, and changes you observe.\n   - If using a thermometer, record the temperature inside the bag.\n\n4. **Halfway through the exploration,** hold a cup of ice against one side of the bag (without opening it). Observe what happens over the next 5 minutes.\n\n5. **Record your findings** in a labeled diagram showing:\n   - Where the blue water went\n   - Where water droplets appeared\n   - What role the ice (cold) played\n\n**How this connects to the photograph:** \"The warm sun heats water on Earth's surface—just like the warm windowsill heated the water in your bag. The water rises as an invisible vapor. In the clouds (and on the cold side of your bag), that vapor turns back into tiny water droplets. When enough droplets gather, they become heavy and fall as precipitation—like the snow in our picture.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each group; ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice? Where did the water go? Why do you think the mist formed on the cold side?\"* (Don't explain—let them hypothesize.)\n- Ensure bags are sealed and placed safely.\n- Gently redirect observations without correcting student thinking.\n- Encourage sketching and labeling of observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe water droplets forming inside the bag (condensation).\n- Students will notice more droplets form on the cold side where ice was placed.\n- Students will create labeled diagrams showing water movement.\n- Students will recognize that the water from the bottom \"traveled\" to become droplets on the sides.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected diagram of the water cycle (showing evaporation, condensation, precipitation)\n- Chart paper labeled with vocabulary terms\n- Photograph from Engage phase (displayed again)\n- Student observation journals from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out from Explore:** (5 minutes)\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to briefly share their observations and diagrams.\n   - Ask: \"What surprised you? What did the water do?\"\n   - Listen for student language around \"water disappeared,\" \"mist formed,\" \"droplets appeared,\" etc.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** (5-7 minutes) using the water cycle diagram and students' own observations:\n   - **Evaporation:** When water on Earth's surface (like in the ocean, lakes, or your bag) heats up and turns into an invisible gas called water vapor that rises into the atmosphere. *(Point to students' bags: \"This happened when heat warmed your water.\")*\n   - **Condensation:** When water vapor cools down and turns back into tiny water droplets you can see. *(Point to the bag: \"This is the mist and droplets on the inside of your bag.\")*\n   - **Precipitation:** Water falling from clouds to Earth's surface in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. *(Point to the photograph: \"The snow in our picture is precipitation.\")*\n   - **Atmosphere:** The layer of air surrounding Earth where clouds form and water vapor rises.\n   - **Hydrosphere:** All of Earth's water—oceans, lakes, rivers, ice, and groundwater.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph and systems:** (3-4 minutes)\n   - \"The snow in our picture shows the **atmosphere** (clouds and water vapor) and **hydrosphere** (water) working together.\"\n   - \"Evaporation pulled water from oceans and lakes into the atmosphere. Condensation formed clouds. Precipitation brought that water back down as snow.\"\n   - Refer back to student predictions from Engage and validate any correct thinking.\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"If I have a puddle on the pavement and the sun comes out, what happens to it? Which word describes that process?\" (Evaporation)\n   - Ask: \"When clouds get heavy with water droplets, what falls? Which word?\" (Precipitation)\n   - Have students do a quick hand signal: thumbs up (got it), sideways (sort of), down (still confused).\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Evaporation:** The process where liquid water turns into invisible water vapor and rises into the air when warmed by heat.\n- **Condensation:** The process where water vapor cools and turns into tiny visible water droplets or ice crystals.\n- **Precipitation:** Water that falls from clouds to Earth in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n- **Atmosphere:** The blanket of air surrounding Earth where clouds form and weather happens.\n- **Hydrosphere:** All the water on Earth, including oceans, lakes, rivers, ice caps, and groundwater.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will correctly match vocabulary terms to processes observed in their bags and the photograph.\n- Students will explain that the water cycle involves interactions between the atmosphere and hydrosphere.\n- Students will understand that precipitation is water falling from clouds to Earth's surface.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by connecting precipitation to real-world water distribution and seasonal patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Graph paper or pre-drawn bar graph template (printed)\n- Ruler\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- \"Precipitation Data Sheet\" (provided below or created with local weather data)\n- Optional: globe or map showing Earth's water distribution\n\n**Activity: \"Tracking Precipitation Patterns\"**\n\n**Scenario:** \"You are a water scientist! Your job is to collect and organize data about how much precipitation falls in different months. This helps us understand how water moves through the water cycle during different seasons.\"\n\n**Step-by-Step Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute data:** Provide each group with a simple data table showing monthly precipitation for your area (or use example data: e.g., inches of rain/snow for each month).\n   - *Example format:*\n     | Month    | Precipitation (inches) |\n     |----------|------------------------|\n     | January  | 3.5                    |\n     | February | 2.8                    |\n     | March    | 4.2                    |\n     | April    | 5.1                    |\n     | (etc.)   |                        |\n\n2. **Students create a bar graph:**\n   - Label x-axis with months.\n   - Label y-axis with precipitation amounts.\n   - Use colored pencils to draw bars for each month.\n   - Title: \"Monthly Precipitation in [Your City/Region]\"\n\n3. **Analyze the data with guiding questions:**\n   - \"Which months have the most precipitation? Which have the least?\"\n   - \"Why might winter months have more snow and spring months have more rain?\" (Connect to temperature and atmospheric conditions.)\n   - \"How does this relate to the water cycle? Why is there more evaporation in summer?\"\n\n4. **Connect to Earth systems:**\n   - Display a globe or world map.\n   - Ask: \"Water doesn't just disappear—it's part of the cycle. When it snows or rains here, where does that water go? Can you trace its path?\" (Students can point to oceans, groundwater, or other reservoirs.)\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask: *\"What does your graph show? Which months are wettest? Why might that be?\"*\n- Support students in reading and creating graphs.\n- Make connections explicit: \"Notice how precipitation changes with the seasons. That's because temperature in the atmosphere changes, affecting how much evaporation and condensation happen.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will successfully create a bar graph representing precipitation data.\n- Students will identify seasonal patterns (e.g., \"winter has more snow; spring is wetter\").\n- Students will explain why precipitation amounts vary (temperature, evaporation rates).\n- Students will articulate that water moves between reservoirs through the water cycle.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of the water cycle, precipitation, and Earth system interactions.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation of student responses during Engage discussion.\n- Review of labeled diagrams and sketches from Explore phase.\n- Listening to group discussions during Elaborate; note who can explain the water cycle versus who needs clarification.\n- Hand signals during Explain check-for-understanding.\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket** (provide at end of Session 2)\n\n**Exit Ticket Prompt (choose one or use all three depending on time):**\n\n**Question 1:** *\"Draw and label a simple diagram showing how water gets from the ocean to the sky, and then back to Earth as snow or rain. Label at least three steps.\"*\n\n**Question 2:** *\"A puddle disappears on a hot, sunny day. Explain what happens to the water using two vocabulary words from our lesson.\"* (Expected answer: Evaporation—the water turns into invisible vapor and rises into the atmosphere.)\n\n**Question 3:** *\"Look at this picture of snow falling. Explain how the atmosphere and hydrosphere are working together to make this precipitation happen.\"* (Expected answer: The hydrosphere (water in oceans/lakes) evaporates into the atmosphere. In the cold atmosphere, it condenses into clouds. Precipitation falls as snow.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they can:\n\n✓ Correctly identify and use the vocabulary terms: **evaporation, condensation, precipitation, atmosphere, hydrosphere** in context.\n\n✓ Explain that **precipitation is water falling from clouds** and that it is part of the **water cycle**.\n\n✓ Describe how **the atmosphere and hydrosphere interact** (water rises from Earth's surface into the air, forms clouds, and falls back down).\n\n✓ Use **observations from the bag investigation** to support explanations of state changes and the water cycle.\n\n✓ Read a precipitation graph and identify **seasonal patterns** (e.g., \"More snow falls in winter\").\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified diagram template:** Provide a partially filled water cycle diagram where students only need to label blanks or circle the correct term (multiple choice options). This reduces the cognitive load of creating from scratch.\n\n2. **Vocabulary word bank:** During Explain and Evaluate, provide a printed list of vocabulary terms students can refer to while speaking or writing. Use consistent visuals (icons) paired with each word.\n\n3. **Structured sentence frames for exit ticket:** \n   - *\"When the sun heats water, __________ happens.\"*\n   - *\"When water vapor gets cold, it __________ and forms clouds.\"*\n   - *\"Precipitation is water that falls as __________ or __________.\"*\n\n4. **Pair with a peer mentor:** During Explore, pair struggling readers/writers with a strong peer to co-record observations and co-create diagrams.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Investigate the full water cycle:** Have advanced students research and present on another phase or location in the water cycle not covered in depth, such as:\n   - Sublimation (ice turning directly into vapor without melting)\n   - Infiltration and groundwater storage\n   - Transpiration (water released by plants)\n   - Present findings to the class with a visual aid.\n\n2. **Compare precipitation in different climates:** Provide data from three different regions (e.g., desert, rainforest, temperate zone) and have students create comparative graphs. Ask them to hypothesize why these regions have such different precipitation patterns and how this affects the organisms living there.\n\n3. **Design a water conservation plan:** Challenge students to analyze how much precipitation falls in your area per year and calculate (with guidance) how much water is \"lost\" to evaporation versus stored. Have them propose a community plan to collect or conserve rainwater. Include a cost estimate and presentation.\n\n4. **Model advanced systems:** Have students create a more complex closed-system model (e.g., using a terrarium or sealed container with soil, plants, and water) to observe evaporation, condensation, and how plants participate in the water cycle.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Precipitation Collector Challenge:** \n   - Have students design and build a simple rain gauge or precipitation collector from household materials (ruler, clear cup, tape).\n   - Place collectors outside and record daily/weekly precipitation for 2-3 weeks.\n   - Graph the real data they collected and compare it to the meteorological data from the lesson.\n   - Write a reflection: \"How did your measured data compare to the official data? What could explain any differences?\"\n\n2. **Water Cycle in Your Watershed:**\n   - Research your local watershed (the area where all water drains to one river, lake, or ocean).\n   - Create a large poster or digital map showing where precipitation falls in your watershed, where it flows, and where it ends up.\n   - Invite a local water/environmental scientist to speak, or take a virtual field trip to a water treatment plant.\n\n3. **States of Water Investigation:**\n   - Extend learning by freezing water, melting it, and observing evaporation over time.\n   - Document the process with photos and write descriptions using vocabulary: solid, liquid, gas, melting, freezing, evaporation.\n   - Create a poster showing the three states of matter using your own photos/observations.\n\n4. **Snow Science Deep Dive:**\n   - If snow is available in your region, collect fresh snow samples and examine them under magnifying glasses.\n   - Measure depth, density, and how quickly it melts indoors.\n   - Research different types of snow (wet snow, powder, etc.) and their properties.\n   - Predict and test: Which melts faster—packed snow or loose snow? Why?\n\n5. **Water Distribution Simulation:**\n   - Use a beaker of water to represent all of Earth's water.\n   - Using droppers, pipettes, and cups, demonstrate how much is salt water (most), fresh water (very little), and accessible fresh water (even less).\n   - This reinforces 5-ESS2-2 and helps students appreciate how precious fresh water is.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for the Teacher\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure heat lamps or hot surfaces are secure and monitored. Use warm (not boiling) water in the Explore phase.\n- **Timing:** The lesson is designed for two 45-minute sessions. You can compress it into one 90-minute block by reducing discussion time, or expand it across three sessions if students need more processing time.\n- **Photography:** Revisit the snowy courtyard photograph multiple times throughout the lesson—during Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. Each time students look at it, they'll understand it more deeply.\n- **Real data:** If possible, use precipitation data from your own school's weather station or your city's meteorological service. This makes the Elaborate phase more authentic and relevant.\n- **Vocabulary wall:** Create a classroom anchor chart with the five vocabulary terms, definitions, and an icon or illustration for each. Leave it visible for future reference.\n\nThis lesson honors the 5E model by starting with curiosity (Engage), moving to discovery (Explore), building scientific understanding (Explain), and applying knowledge to real contexts (Elaborate) before assessing mastery (Evaluate).",
