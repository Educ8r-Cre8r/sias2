Identify and describe fossils as evidence that living things existed long ago.\n2. Explain how fossils form and become preserved in rocks.\n3. Use observations and evidence to make claims about Earth's history.\n4. Recognize that rocks and fossils are natural resources that provide information about the past.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about the fossil and activate prior knowledge about rocks and living things.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large digital display or printed photograph (8.5\" × 11\" minimum)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: magnifying glasses (one per student or pair)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or large poster where all students can see it clearly. Don't reveal any labels or explanations yet.\n\n2. **Pose an opening mystery statement:**\n   - \"I found something amazing hidden in a rock. It looks like it might have once been alive, but it's made of stone now. Look carefully—what do you notice?\"\n\n3. **Guide observation with specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What shapes and patterns do you see in this rock? Describe them to a partner.\"\n   - \"Does this rock look like anything that is alive today? What animal or plant does it remind you of?\"\n   - \"How do you think something that was once alive could become part of a rock?\"\n   - \"Why might scientists care about finding things like this in rocks?\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on chart paper with the header \"Our Fossil Questions.\" Accept all responses without judgment—this activates prior knowledge and genuine wonder.\n\n5. **Prediction prompt:**\n   - \"If this *is* something that was alive a very, very long time ago, how do you think it got trapped inside the rock? Turn and talk with a neighbor about your ideas.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be rock detectives. We'll learn how things from long, long ago can be preserved in rocks, and then we'll create our own fossils to see how this amazing process works!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students engage in hands-on investigation of fossil formation through modeling and observation.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- One small shallow container or paper cup (4-6 oz)\n- Plaster of Paris (dry mix) or salt dough (flour, salt, water)\n- Water (for plaster)\n- Small natural objects: shells, leaves, twigs, imprints made by toy dinosaurs or insects\n- Spoon or popsicle stick for mixing\n- Paper towels\n- Optional: toy organisms (small plastic dinosaurs, insects) to create imprints\n- Observation sheet (printed or handwritten) with labeled boxes for \"Before,\" \"During,\" \"After\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part 1: Creating Model Fossils (15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute materials** to each group. Explain that students will create a model of how fossils form.\n\n2. **Provide step-by-step student directions:**\n   - \"Step 1: Choose one natural object (a shell, leaf, or twig). This will be your 'ancient organism.'\"\n   - \"Step 2: If using plaster, mix according to package directions (or prepare salt dough ahead). It should be thick like peanut butter.\"\n   - \"Step 3: Pour or spread a thin layer into your container.\"\n   - \"Step 4: Gently press your object into the mixture to make an imprint. Press it completely, then carefully remove it.\"\n   - \"Step 5: Observe the imprint left behind. Draw and label what you see on your observation sheet.\"\n   - \"Step 6: Set aside to dry (note: this will dry more fully by the next session, but students can observe the beginning of the process).\"\n\n3. **Guiding questions while students work:**\n   - \"What do you think happened to your object? Is it still there?\"\n   - \"What shape is left behind in the plaster or dough?\"\n   - \"This imprint looks like something from nature was here once. How is that like what we see in the photograph?\"\n\n**Part 2: Observation & Comparison (5 minutes)**\n\n4. **While mixtures set**, project or display the fossil photograph again.\n\n5. **Ask students to compare:**\n   - \"Look at the fossil in the photo and at the imprints you just made. How are they similar?\"\n   - \"In both cases, what is the original living thing, and what is left behind?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups to ask open-ended questions rather than provide answers.\n- Listen for student explanations of what's happening and gently redirect thinking: *\"What do you think the rock is doing to the organism?\"*\n- Help students move toward the concept of preservation without stating it directly.\n- Ensure all students handle materials safely and complete their imprints.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create and observe impressions of natural objects in plaster or dough.\n- Students record observations with drawings or simple descriptions.\n- Students begin to understand that imprints preserve the shape of organisms.\n- Students make connections between their model and the photograph.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts; connect to the photograph and students' discoveries.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Vocabulary posters or cards (printed or hand-drawn)\n- Fossil photograph (displayed)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to show their imprints and describe what they observed.\n   - Ask: \"What made the shape stay in the plaster/dough? What does that tell us?\"\n   - Record key words students use on chart paper (e.g., \"shape,\" \"stuck,\" \"imprint,\" \"remember\").\n\n2. **Teacher-led explanation (8 minutes):**\n   - Display the fossil photograph again.\n   - \"Long, long ago—millions of years ago—there were different plants and animals living on Earth. Some of them died and fell into mud, sand, or sediment. Over a *very* long time, layers and layers of sediment piled on top, pressing down harder and harder. The sediment turned into rock. The shape and sometimes the bones or shells of the organism got preserved—trapped inside—just like your imprint in the plaster!\"\n   - Point to the fossil in the photograph: \"This is a real fossil. It shows us that a living thing—probably a sea creature with this fanned shape—lived here long, long ago. We can tell from the pattern in the rock.\"\n\n3. **Key vocabulary introduction (5-7 minutes):**\n\n   Present these terms using student-friendly definitions and the photograph/models as examples:\n\n   - **Fossil:** The preserved remains or imprint of an organism that died long, long ago and got trapped in rock. (Point to the photograph: \"This is a fossil.\")\n   - **Organism:** A living thing like an animal, plant, insect, or creature. (Show pictures or refer to classroom animals/plants.)\n   - **Preserve/Preservation:** To keep something safe and unchanged. When sediment buries an organism, it preserves it—keeps it from breaking apart. (Gesture to the models: \"The plaster preserved the shape of your leaf or shell.\")\n   - **Sediment:** Tiny pieces of rock, sand, and soil that get pushed together by water or wind. Over time, these pieces stick together and turn into rock. (Show a small jar with layered sand/soil if available.)\n   - **Evidence:** Clues or information that help us figure something out. Fossils are evidence of ancient life. (Refer to the Engage chart: \"Your observations were evidence that something lived in that rock.\")\n\n4. **Check for understanding (2-3 minutes):**\n   - \"Show me with your hands: If I'm a fossil, how would I move? How would I talk? Why not?\" (Students become still, silent—reinforcing that organisms are now rock.)\n   - \"Can you point to the fossil in the photograph and describe what organism it might have been?\"\n   - Quick think-pair-share: \"Why do you think scientists study fossils?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that fossils are preserved evidence of ancient organisms.\n- Students use vocabulary (fossil, organism, preserve) correctly in context.\n- Students can explain a basic mechanism for fossil formation (organism buried, sediment hardens into rock).\n- Students recognize that fossils tell us about Earth's history.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by predicting, categorizing, and connecting fossils to real-world contexts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of 4-6 different fossils (printed 4\"×6\" cards or displayed digitally): ammonite, trilobite, leaf, dinosaur footprint, fish, insect in amber\n- Observation sheets or worksheets with images\n- Optional: Rock and fossil field guide or picture book (library resource)\n- Chart paper labeled \"What We Can Learn From Fossils\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Fossil detectives gallery walk (8 minutes):**\n   - Display 4-6 fossil images around the room (or on a slide show).\n   - \"These are all real fossils. Visit each one and observe. What was this organism? What does its fossil tell us?\"\n   - Provide a simple recording sheet: Image name / What organism was it? / How do we know?\n   - Students rotate (with a partner or small group) and record their observations.\n\n2. **Group discussion—What can fossils teach us? (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Gather as a whole group.\n   - Ask: \"Why are fossils important to scientists and to us?\"\n   - Guide toward these ideas using the chart:\n     - Fossils show us **what lived long ago.**\n     - Fossils show us **where different organisms lived.**\n     - Fossils help us understand **how life has changed over time.**\n     - Fossils help us learn **about Earth's history.**\n   - Record student responses on \"What We Can Learn From Fossils\" chart.\n\n3. **Real-world connection—Paleontologists (2-3 minutes):**\n   - \"Scientists called **paleontologists** study fossils. They are detectives of deep time. They dig carefully, clean fossils, and piece together Earth's story.\"\n   - Show a brief image (1-2 minutes) of a paleontologist working, or describe one at work.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions that push thinking beyond the photograph: *\"If we found this fossil, what does it tell us about the climate or environment back then?\"*\n- Validate all observations; redirect incomplete answers: *\"That's a good observation! How might we find out more?\"*\n- Facilitate discussion without lecturing—let students lead discoveries.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students categorize and describe multiple fossils.\n- Students make evidence-based claims about what organisms were and where they lived.\n- Students articulate the significance of fossils for understanding Earth's past.\n- Students show enthusiasm for paleontology as a real-world science career.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossil formation, vocabulary, and evidence-based reasoning.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Did students successfully create imprints and make connections to the photograph? Could they explain what happened to their object?\n- **Questioning during Explain:** Did students use fossil-related vocabulary accurately when responding to questions?\n- **Gallery walk engagement:** Were students able to observe fossils and record reasonable hypotheses about organisms and habitats?\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes, end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a card or sheet with the following three prompts (read aloud for accessibility):\n\n1. **Draw or write:** \"What is a fossil? Draw a picture and write or tell me one sentence.\"\n   \n2. **Circle the correct answer:** \"A fossil is:\n   - A living animal you can see today\n   - The preserved remains of something that lived long ago\n   - A type of rock you find at the beach\"\n\n3. **Evidence question:** \"We found a fossil of a sea creature in a rock on a mountain far from the ocean. What does this fossil tell us? (How do we know this sea creature lived here?)\"\n\n**Success Criteria—Students demonstrate understanding if they:**\n- Define fossil accurately (preserved ancient organism or imprint)\n- Correctly identify preserved remains as evidence of past life\n- Explain that fossils tell us about environments and organisms from long ago\n- Use at least one vocabulary word (fossil, organism, preserve, sediment, or evidence) correctly\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly define a fossil\n- Most students recognize fossils as evidence of ancient life\n- Students make reasonable inferences about past environments using fossil evidence\n- Student responses show conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards with pictures:** Provide laminated, illustrated vocabulary cards that students can reference throughout. Use consistent visual representations (e.g., a fossil picture for \"fossil,\" a layered rock diagram for \"sediment\").\n\n2. **Sentence frames for sharing:** Provide frame cards like:\n   - \"A fossil is _______________.\"\n   - \"In the rock, I can see _______________.\"\n   - \"This tells us that _______________.\"\n   - Students fill in blanks orally or in writing, building confidence and language.\n\n3. **Guided observation sheets:** Create a more scaffolded Explore observation sheet with labeled diagrams, checkboxes, and sentence starters rather than open-ended questions. Example:\n   - ☐ I pressed my object into the mixture.\n   - ☐ The mixture is ___________ (wet/hard/soft).\n   - ☐ The shape left behind looks like _______________.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Paleontologist research mini-project:** Assign advanced students to research a specific fossil or paleontologist and prepare a 2-3 minute presentation for the class. Provide scaffolding (e.g., guiding questions: *Where/when did this organism live? How do we know? What makes this fossil special?*).\n\n2. **Erosion and fossil discovery connection:** Provide a cross-section diagram showing rock layers and ask: \"How does erosion (weathering and breakdown of rock) help us discover fossils? Why is erosion both good and bad?\" Students sketch and explain, connecting this lesson to weather and Earth changes.\n\n3. **Deep-time timeline activity:** Create a simple timeline of Earth's history (with pictures: dinosaurs → early mammals → early humans → us). Advanced students position various fossils on the timeline and explain the order. Introduce the concept of \"millions of years ago\" through visualization.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Make a sediment layer model:** Layer different colors of sand, soil, and crushed chalk in a clear jar with water to show how sediment layers build up. Bury small objects (toy organisms) between layers. Over days/weeks, observe settling and discuss how this mirrors fossil formation. This reinforces the Explore concept in a different, visual format.\n\n2. **Field exploration or digital museum tour:** Take students on a virtual tour of a museum's fossil collection (many natural history museums have free online exhibits—e.g., Smithsonian, American Museum of Natural History) or organize a local nature walk to look for rocks that *might* contain fossils. Students sketch interesting rocks and hypothesize about what might be inside.\n\n3. **Fossil storytelling:** Give each student (or pair) a fossil image and ask them to write or dictate a short \"story\" from the organism's perspective: *\"I was a [sea creature/plant/insect] that lived long ago in [environment]. One day, I became buried in sediment, and over millions of years, I turned into a fossil. This is my story.\"* Display stories alongside fossil images for a gallery or class book.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Plaster drying time:** If using plaster of Paris, it may not fully set during the lesson. You can prepare plaster mixes ahead of time (5 minutes before lesson start) or use salt dough (flour, salt, water—mixed 2:1:1 ratio), which sets slightly faster.\n- **Safety reminder:** Ensure students wash hands after handling plaster or dough.\n- **Photograph reference:** Keep the fossil photograph visible throughout all five phases. Students' understanding deepens through repeated, purposeful observation.\n- **Vocabulary practice:** Use the vocabulary words consistently in your own language throughout the lesson; students internalize through modeling.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson honors the 5E model by building from wonder (Engage) through hands-on discovery (Explore), explicit instruction (Explain), application (Elaborate), and evidence-based assessment (Evaluate). Third graders leave with a concrete understanding of fossils as time-capsules of Earth's history.",
