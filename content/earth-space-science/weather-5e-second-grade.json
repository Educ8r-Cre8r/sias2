ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the approaching storm.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph of the storm (or display on screen)\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph without explanation. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. Ask students: \"What do you see happening in this picture?\" Let them share initial observations (dark sky, clouds, buildings, roads, trees).\n\n3. Pose these specific discussion questions:\n   - \"Does the sky look like it normally does when you play outside? How is it different?\"\n   - \"What do you think is happening in those dark clouds? Where does all that water come from?\"\n   - \"If you were outside when this storm arrived, what would change very quickly? What might change slowly?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen the sky look like this before a rainstorm or big storm? What happened next?\"\n\n4. Wonder prompt: \"I wonder what would happen to the things we see in this picture (the road, trees, buildings) if a big storm hit this place right now. What parts might change? Which might change fast, and which might change slow?\"\n\n5. Record student predictions on chart paper titled \"What We Wonder About Storms.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to be storm watchers and learn how quickly weather can change and what water in the sky has to do with it!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how weather changes occur and explore water in different forms.\n\n**Materials (per group of 4-5 students):**\n- Clear cups or glass jars (4 per group)\n- Hot water (teacher-prepared, in a kettle)\n- Ice cubes\n- Small mirror or clear plastic sheet\n- Food coloring (optional)\n- Thermometers or temperature sticks\n- Paper towels\n- Weather observation chart (printable template)\n- Window access (if possible for real-world observation)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Observing Water in the Air (15 minutes)**\n\n1. Divide students into small groups. Give each group a clear cup with hot water and a thermometer.\n\n2. Student directions:\n   - \"Carefully look at your cup of hot water. Do you see anything coming out of it? That's water vapor—water that has turned into an invisible gas and is floating into the air.\"\n   - \"Now, hold a cold mirror or plastic sheet just above the cup (teacher demonstrates first).\"\n   - \"Watch what happens to the mirror. What do you see forming on it?\"\n   - \"That's water vapor from the cup turning back into tiny water droplets—just like how clouds form in the sky when water vapor rises and cools!\"\n   - Record: \"Did water droplets form on the mirror? How long did it take?\"\n\n3. Have students touch the mirror gently and describe what they feel (cold, wet).\n\n4. Connect to the photo: \"In the storm picture, those dark clouds are full of billions of tiny water droplets, just like the ones we made on the mirror. They're so small you can see through millions of them, but together they make clouds.\"\n\n**Part B: Quick vs. Slow Changes (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Ask students: \"In our experiment, how long did it take for the water vapor to turn into droplets on the mirror? That was a QUICK change!\"\n\n2. Show images or discuss: \"But some weather changes happen very slowly. Snow melting in spring takes weeks or months. A big rainstorm can start in minutes.\"\n\n3. Have students record in their weather observation chart:\n   - One weather change that happens QUICKLY (thunder, lightning, heavy rain starting)\n   - One weather change that happens SLOWLY (seasons changing, snow melting)\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Circulate to each group and ask: \"What do you observe on the mirror? Why do you think that happened?\"\n- Avoid explaining; instead, ask guiding questions: \"What was hot? What was cold? What changed?\"\n- Ensure safe handling of hot water; facilitate the demonstration yourself with student observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe water droplets forming on a cold surface, connecting it to cloud formation.\n- Students begin to understand that water can change forms (vapor to liquid).\n- Students can articulate one quick change and one slow change in weather.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to storm science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary\n- Student notebooks or science journals\n- Chart showing forms of water (solid, liquid, gas) with simple illustrations\n- Real objects: ice cube, cup of water, damp sponge (to represent vapor)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out** (5 minutes):\n   - Ask groups to share what they observed: \"What did you see on the mirror? What was it made of?\"\n   - Record observations on chart paper: \"Water droplets formed on the cold mirror because the hot water turned into vapor and cooled down.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (8 minutes):\n   - Write each term on chart paper with a simple illustration.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Water Vapor**: Water that has turned into an invisible gas and floats in the air. (Use the sponge example: \"Like when water disappears from a puddle into the air.\")\n  \n- **Condensation**: When water vapor cools down and turns into tiny water droplets we can see. (Refer to the mirror experiment: \"That's what happened on the mirror!\")\n  \n- **Cloud**: Billions and billions of tiny water droplets floating together in the sky. (Point to the photograph: \"Those dark clouds are full of water droplets, just like our experiment!\")\n  \n- **Storm**: A weather event with strong winds, heavy rain, and dark clouds that happens quickly. (Reference the photograph: \"The dark sky in our picture shows a storm is coming.\")\n  \n- **Weather**: What the air and sky are like at any moment—hot, cold, rainy, sunny, windy, cloudy. (Ask: \"What's the weather like outside right now?\")\n\n3. **Connections Back to Photo and Explore** (5 minutes):\n   - Point to the photograph: \"See those dark clouds? Those are full of water droplets formed by condensation, just like on our mirror.\"\n   - \"The wind is pushing them across the sky. A storm like this can bring heavy rain and strong winds—big changes that happen QUICKLY.\"\n   - \"But look at that lighter sky in the distance. Weather is always changing!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding**:\n   - Ask individual students: \"Where does the water in clouds come from?\" (Students should reference vapor rising and condensing.)\n   - \"Did we see water vapor in our experiment? What did it look like?\" (Invisible; we saw it when it became droplets.)\n   - \"Is this storm a quick change or a slow change in weather?\" (Quick!)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that water vapor rises, cools, and condenses into clouds.\n- Students can use vocabulary: water vapor, condensation, cloud, storm, weather.\n- Students connect the photograph to the science concepts explored in the experiment.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to predict and document storm weather patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Weather Prediction Cards\" (illustrated cards showing sky conditions: clear sky, partly cloudy, dark clouds, lightning, rain)\n- Simple weather diary template (printable, with date, weather picture, and space to draw)\n- Crayons or colored pencils\n- Optional: Access to a real window to observe current weather\n- Picture sequence cards (showing progression from clear sky → clouds → storm)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Storm Prediction Game** (8 minutes):\n   - Show students the weather prediction cards in mixed order.\n   - Ask: \"If you saw THIS sky (show dark clouds card), what would happen next?\" \n   - Students arrange cards in order: Clear → Partly Cloudy → Dark Clouds → Rain/Storm\n   - Discuss: \"These changes happen quickly, sometimes in minutes!\"\n\n2. **Create a Weather Diary Entry** (7 minutes):\n   - Give each student a weather diary template.\n   - Instruction: \"Draw what you think the sky will look like tomorrow. Will it have water droplets in clouds? Will it be stormy or clear? Draw and write one sentence.\"\n   - Students can reference the photograph: \"Will our weather look more like the clear sky or the dark storm clouds in our picture?\"\n\n3. **Real-World Observation** (optional, if window access):\n   - Take students to a window for 2 minutes.\n   - Ask: \"What do you see in the real sky right now? What form is water in? Do you see clouds (water droplets)? Might a storm come soon, or is it clear?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the prediction game by asking: \"Why do you think dark clouds come before the rain?\"\n- Circulate during diary writing to listen to student thinking and ask: \"How did you decide what the weather would look like? What made you think that?\"\n- Validate connections to the photograph and exploration.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students sequence weather events logically and understand the rapid progression of a storm.\n- Students apply their learning by predicting future weather based on observable signs.\n- Students create visual representations of weather concepts, demonstrating their understanding of water in the atmosphere.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of quick weather changes and water in the atmosphere.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n- Observe student responses during the mirror condensation experiment. Can they describe what they observe?\n- Listen to group discussions during the prediction game. Do students correctly sequence weather events?\n- Review weather diary entries for understanding of cloud formation and storm progression.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nAdminister orally or in written form (teacher writes student responses):\n\n1. \"Where does water in clouds come from? Can you use the word 'vapor' in your answer?\"\n   - **Success Criterion:** Student mentions water rising from Earth, turning into vapor, and cooling to form clouds.\n\n2. \"Look at this picture of a dark, stormy sky. Is this a quick change or a slow change in weather? Why?\"\n   - **Success Criterion:** Student correctly identifies it as quick and explains that storms develop and bring rain within minutes or hours.\n\n3. \"Describe what you saw happen to the mirror when we held it over the hot water. What was that called?\"\n   - **Success Criterion:** Student explains water droplets formed and can name this as condensation (or describe it: \"water vapor turning into water drops\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify where water in clouds comes from (with teacher scaffolding if needed).\n- 80% of students correctly classify storms as quick changes in weather.\n- 75% of students can describe the condensation process in their own words.\n- Student weather diaries show logical progression of weather events.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary**: Use picture cards paired with words (water vapor, condensation, cloud, storm). Refer to pictures during discussion rather than relying on recall of vocabulary words alone.\n\n2. **Guided Observation in Explore Phase**: Pair struggling students with a peer or position the teacher to guide their mirror observation step-by-step: \"First, what do you see on the mirror? Is it wet or dry? What made it wet?\" Use leading questions rather than open-ended ones.\n\n3. **Visual Sequence Cards**: Provide a 3-step sequence (Clear Sky → Clouds Form → Storm Arrives) to arrange rather than asking students to create their own sequence. Students can point to the steps as they describe them.\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Exploration**: Challenge students to predict: \"If we made our water vapor experiment colder and colder, what would happen? Could water droplets turn into ice crystals?\" Introduce the concept of freezing as another form change.\n\n2. **Real Weather Data**: Provide access to a simple weather app or printed weather forecast for the next week. Ask: \"How many days show storms? How many show clear weather? Can you predict which days will be quick changes and which will be slow changes?\"\n\n3. **Create a Storm Safety Poster**: Ask advanced students to research and create a poster: \"When a storm is coming (dark clouds forming), what should people do to stay safe?\" This applies their understanding to real-world impact.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Water Cycle Model**: Build a simple water cycle model in a clear plastic bag. Tape it to a sunny window. Students observe water droplets forming on the plastic (condensation) and can draw and label the cycle, using their new vocabulary.\n\n2. **Storm Safety and Preparation**: Invite students to list things that change quickly when a storm arrives (lights on, wind blows, people go inside). Create a classroom \"Storm Readiness Checklist\" and discuss why quick weather changes require quick responses. Connect to 2-ESS1-1 (quick vs. slow Earth events).\n\n3. **Weather Journal—One Week Observation**: Provide a weekly weather journal. Each day, students draw the sky and record one sentence about the weather: \"Today the sky was _____. I saw _____ (clouds/rain/sun). This weather changed (quickly / slowly) because _____.\" Review patterns at the end of the week to reinforce that weather patterns can be observed and sometimes predicted.",
