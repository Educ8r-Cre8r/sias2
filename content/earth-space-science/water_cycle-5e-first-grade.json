Make observations about weather patterns during different times of year (spring and winter).\n2. Describe how plants and animals are affected by changes in seasons.\n3. Identify and predict predictable seasonal patterns they can observe in their own environment.\n4. Record observations over time to track seasonal changes.\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest by introducing the surprising image of snow and a blooming flower together, activating curiosity about seasons and weather patterns.\n\n- **Materials:** \n  - Large, full-color print of the photograph (or digital display on smartboard)\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Student observation notebooks or paper\n\n- **Activity:** \n  - Display the photograph on the board without explanation. Ask students to look carefully.\n  - Pose these discussion questions:\n    1. \"What do you see in this picture? Can you point out the different things?\"\n    2. \"Do we usually see snow and pretty yellow flowers at the same time? Why or why not?\"\n    3. \"When do you see snow where you live? When do flowers bloom?\"\n    4. \"What do you think is happening with the weather in this picture?\"\n  - Invite students to share their observations using \"I notice...\" sentence stems.\n  - Record student observations on chart paper to revisit later.\n  - Ask: \"If we watched this plant every month, what do you think we might see change?\"\n\n- **Transition:** Today we're going to become weather scientists and observe how things in nature change with the seasons, just like this flower and snow do!\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate seasonal patterns through observation and hands-on documentation of a plant's growth and changes over time.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Quick-growing plant seedlings (bean, radish, or grass seeds) — one small pot per student or pair\n  - Water spray bottles\n  - Observation notebooks or \"Season Detective\" recording sheets (simple template with picture boxes for \"Winter,\" \"Spring,\" \"Summer,\" \"Fall\")\n  - Colored pencils or crayons\n  - Large calendar showing all four seasons on classroom wall\n  - Sunny windowsill for plant placement\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Plant Planting (Day 1):** Students each plant a bean seed or small seedling in a small cup with soil. Guide them to water it gently and place it in a sunny spot.\n  2. **Weekly Observations:** Over the next 4 weeks, students observe their plant at least 2-3 times per week and record what they see on their \"Season Detective\" sheet by drawing:\n     - Is the plant growing?\n     - Are there new leaves?\n     - What color is it?\n     - How much sunlight is there today?\n  3. **Temperature and Weather Tracking:** Provide a simple thermometer at the windowsill. Students check the temperature each day and record if it's cold, warm, or hot using three colored stickers or drawings on a class chart.\n  4. **Daylight Tracking:** Ask students to notice when the sun rises and sets. Create a class routine: \"Sun Up/Sun Down\" check-in where students note if it gets light early or stays light late using a simple visual timeline.\n  5. **Documentation:** Students draw pictures of what they see each week and dictate or write simple observations: \"My plant grew. The weather is warm. The sun comes up earlier now.\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate to observe student plants and ask guiding questions: \"What changed from last week? Why do you think your plant looks different?\"\n  - Do NOT tell students what will happen next; let them discover growth and seasonal patterns.\n  - Help students notice the connection between sunlight, warmth, and plant growth without explaining it fully.\n  - Encourage peer observation: \"Ask your neighbor what they noticed about their plant.\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students will draw and describe weekly changes in their plant (growth, new leaves, color changes).\n  - Students will notice and record changes in temperature over several weeks.\n  - Students will begin to identify a pattern: \"My plant grows when it's sunny and warm.\"\n  - Students will document that daylight changes throughout these weeks.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain the patterns students discovered, connecting back to the snow-and-flower photograph.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper with vocabulary words\n  - Picture cards showing four seasons\n  - The original photograph\n  - Student observation notebooks from Explore phase\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Group Share-Out:** Gather students in a circle. Ask volunteers to share their plant observations:\n     - \"What did you notice happening to your plant week by week?\"\n     - \"Did anyone's plant look different when it was cold vs. warm?\"\n     - Display several student drawings and discuss patterns aloud.\n  2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary:** Write and illustrate these terms on chart paper, using the photograph and student plant observations as visual references:\n     - **Season:** A time of year with its own weather pattern (hot, cold, wet, dry).\n     - **Spring:** The season when flowers bloom, plants grow, and weather gets warmer.\n     - **Winter:** The cold season when snow falls and plants rest.\n     - **Pattern:** Something that happens the same way again and again (plants grow in spring; snow falls in winter).\n     - **Observe:** To watch and notice something carefully.\n  3. **Connect to the Photograph:**\n     - Return to the original image: \"This picture shows something amazing—snow in winter AND a flower blooming like it's spring. This must be early spring when both things can happen in the same place!\"\n     - Ask: \"Why does the flower bloom? Because spring is coming and plants know it's time to grow.\"\n     - Explain: \"Plants are like nature's calendar. They show us what season it is!\"\n  4. **Check for Understanding:**\n     - Ask individual students: \"When do you see flowers bloom—in winter or spring?\" \n     - \"What season do we get the most sunlight?\"\n     - Have students point to season pictures as you describe weather: \"I'm thinking of a season with lots of snow—which one am I thinking of?\"\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Season:** A time of year with its own kind of weather—spring (warm, flowers grow), summer (hot, bright sun), fall (cool, leaves change), winter (cold, snow).\n  - **Spring:** The time of year when it gets warmer, flowers bloom, and plants start growing again.\n  - **Winter:** The cold time of year when snow falls and most plants rest.\n  - **Pattern:** Something that happens in the same way over and over again at certain times.\n  - **Observe:** To look at and notice something very carefully.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students can name the four seasons and describe simple characteristics of each (hot/cold, sunny/snowy).\n  - Students understand that plants bloom in spring and rest in winter.\n  - Students recognize that the changes they saw in their plants follow a pattern tied to seasons.\n  - Students can use the word \"observe\" and \"pattern\" in simple sentences.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding of seasonal patterns to predict and plan observations in their own environment.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - \"My Seasonal Observation Plan\" worksheet (simple template with four season boxes)\n  - Pictures of trees, flowers, and landscapes in all four seasons (from magazines, books, or printed images)\n  - Outdoor observation clipboards (or paper with clip)\n  - Crayons, colored pencils, glue sticks\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Plan a Real-World Observation:** Show students pictures of the same outdoor location (park, tree, garden) in different seasons. Ask: \"What changes from season to season? What stays the same?\"\n  2. **Create an Observation Plan:** Give each student or pair a worksheet with four boxes labeled \"Winter,\" \"Spring,\" \"Summer,\" and \"Fall.\" \n     - Students draw or glue pictures showing what they think they will see in nature during each season.\n     - Students write or dictate one thing they predict: \"In spring, I will see flowers. In winter, I will see snow.\"\n  3. **Real Outdoor Observation:** Take students outside on the school grounds for 5-10 minutes. Have them observe one tree, shrub, or garden area and note:\n     - Is there snow or flowers?\n     - Is it sunny or cloudy?\n     - Is it warm or cold?\n     - What color are the plants?\n  4. **Connect to the Photograph:** Ask: \"In the picture, we saw snow AND flowers. Where do you think the photographer took that picture? What time of year was it?\"\n     - Students can predict: \"Maybe it was early spring when it's still cold but flowers are starting to bloom.\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Guide outdoor observations with open-ended questions: \"What do you notice about the plants right now? How would they look different in summer?\"\n  - Help students record their observations through drawing or dictation (do not write for them; guide them to do it).\n  - Point out real-world seasonal changes visible on your school grounds.\n  - Validate student predictions and observations without correcting them; instead, ask: \"Why do you think that will happen?\"\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students create a prediction plan showing expected seasonal changes in a local place.\n  - Students make real outdoor observations and record them.\n  - Students explain simple cause-and-effect: \"Flowers bloom in spring because it gets warm.\"\n  - Students apply vocabulary (season, observe, pattern) to describe what they see.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of seasonal patterns and their ability to make observations and predictions.\n\n- **Activity:**\n\n  **Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n  - Observe student plant care and weekly recordings for evidence of careful observation and emerging pattern recognition.\n  - Listen to student explanations during group discussions for use of vocabulary and understanding of seasons.\n  - Review \"My Seasonal Observation Plan\" worksheet for evidence that students can predict seasonal changes.\n\n  **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (End of Lesson 2):**\n  \n  Provide each student with a simple 3-question exit ticket (can be verbal, drawn, or written):\n  \n  1. **\"Look at this picture of a snowy flower. What season is it? How do you know?\"**\n     - Expected answer: \"Spring\" or \"Early spring\" with reason: \"Because there's snow and flowers\" or \"Because the flower is blooming.\"\n  \n  2. **\"What did you observe about your plant during our experiment? How did it change?\"**\n     - Expected answer: Students describe growth, new leaves, or changes in color/size from week to week.\n  \n  3. **\"Predict: What will you see outside in three months? Why?\"**\n     - Expected answer: Student makes a reasonable prediction based on the current season and explains it simply: \"It will be warmer and have more flowers because summer is coming.\"\n\n  **Success Criteria:**\n  - ✓ Student correctly identifies at least one seasonal characteristic (hot/cold, snow/flowers, sunny/cloudy).\n  - ✓ Student describes at least one change they observed in their plant or outdoor environment.\n  - ✓ Student makes a simple prediction about a future seasonal change with a reason.\n  - ✓ Student uses at least one vocabulary word correctly (season, observe, spring, winter, pattern).\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students demonstrate understanding that seasons follow predictable patterns.\n  - Students can observe and describe changes in plants and weather tied to seasons.\n  - Students can predict future seasonal changes based on patterns they have observed.\n  - Students use appropriate vocabulary to communicate their observations.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n- **Support (for struggling learners):**\n  1. **Simplified Observation Template:** Provide a 2-box chart (instead of 4) showing just \"Winter\" and \"Spring\" with large picture boxes for drawing. Teacher scribes student observations while student draws.\n  2. **Vocabulary Word Cards:** Create large, laminated cards with pictures for each season and vocabulary word. Students point to cards during discussions to identify seasons and patterns.\n  3. **Guided Observation Walks:** Pair struggling students with a peer or teacher for outdoor observations. Ask very specific, scaffolded questions: \"Is it hot or cold today? Is that hot, warm, or cold weather?\"\n  4. **Reduced Plant Care Responsibility:** Assign this student to a \"plant buddy\" system where a stronger student shares responsibility for watering and observation, but the struggling student still participates in drawing and recording.\n\n- **Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n  1. **Multi-Location Comparison:** Have students track two different plants or outdoor locations (e.g., sunny spot vs. shady spot) and compare how they change across seasons. Create a Venn diagram showing similarities and differences.\n  2. **Monthly Prediction Calendar:** Ask students to create a 12-month calendar showing predicted changes in their plant for each month, with explanations: \"In December, my plant will rest because it's winter and there's less sunlight.\"\n  3. **Extended Observation Project:** Have students photograph their plant weekly (or draw it in detail) to create a stop-motion animation or flip-book showing seasonal growth. Write captions explaining each change.\n  4. **Why Questions:** Challenge students to investigate why seasons exist. Read a short, age-appropriate book about Earth's tilt or seasons, and have them draw a picture explaining why we have different seasons.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seasonal Nature Collection:** Create a \"Seasons Collection Box\" where students collect (with teacher guidance) natural objects from different seasons—fall leaves, winter twigs, spring flowers (or photos), summer rocks. Label each with the season and display in the classroom with student-written or dictated descriptions.\n\n2. **Four Seasons Storytelling:** Students create a simple story or comic strip showing a plant, animal, or person through all four seasons. Use the story circle: \"In winter... In spring... In summer... In fall...\" Students can draw illustrations with teacher-scribed or student-written text for each season.\n\n3. **Family Observation Project:** Send home a \"Seasons Detective\" sheet asking families to observe seasonal changes in their neighborhood together (sunrise/sunset time, weather, plants, animal activity). Students report back with drawings or photos, creating a class display of community seasonal observations.\n\n4. **Seasonal Weather Graph:** Over several weeks, create a class bar graph showing the temperature or cloud cover for each day. Help students see the pattern: warmer temperatures in spring/summer, cooler in fall/winter. Discuss: \"What pattern do we see? Can we predict next week's weather?\"\n\n5. **Plant Lifecycle Timeline:** Display the weekly drawings of students' plants on a long paper timeline, labeled with months. This visual representation reinforces that growth happens in a pattern and connects to seasons.",
