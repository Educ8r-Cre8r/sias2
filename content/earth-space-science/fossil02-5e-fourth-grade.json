Identify and describe fossils as evidence that organisms lived on Earth long ago.\n2. Explain how rock layers and fossils help scientists understand how Earth's landscape has changed over time.\n3. Observe and describe how weathering breaks rocks into smaller pieces.\n4. Use fossil and rock evidence to make predictions about past environments.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the fossil photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, clear projection of the fossil photograph (or printed color copies for small groups)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the projector or document camera without any introduction. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (one at a time, allowing think-pair-share between each):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe the shapes and textures.\"\n   - \"What do you think these objects are? Have you seen anything like this before?\"\n   - \"How do you think a spiral shell got trapped inside a rock?\"\n   - \"If we found this rock in the ground, what might it tell us about what this place was like a long, long time ago?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"These are called fossils. They are the remains or traces of organisms that lived a very, very long time ago. What do you think we can learn by studying fossils and the rocks around them?\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper to return to at the end of the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become fossil detectives and learn how rocks and fossils tell us the story of Earth's past.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate fossils and rock textures through hands-on observation and model-making.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- Modeling clay (air-dry or regular)\n- Small shells, pasta shapes, or imprints of small objects (seashells, snail shells, ammonite images)\n- Plaster of Paris or salt dough (prepared by teacher ahead of time)\n- Water\n- Small cups or containers\n- Spoons for mixing\n- Paper towels\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (one per student)\n- Rocks of various sizes (sandstone, shale, limestone if available; otherwise any classroom rocks)\n- Observation worksheets (see template below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Fossil Model Creation (12 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute modeling clay** to each group. Have students flatten it into a 1-inch-thick base.\n\n2. **Provide shells or objects.** Ask students: \"Press your shell gently into the clay. What happens? What do you observe?\"\n\n3. **Remove the shell carefully.** Students observe the impression left behind—this is what a fossil impression looks like.\n\n4. **Teacher demonstrates** pouring plaster (or salt dough if plaster is unavailable) over the impression to create a cast fossil. Students follow along.\n\n5. **While drying, students sketch** the shell and its impression on their observation worksheet.\n\n**Part B: Rock Texture Investigation (8 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute rocks and hand lenses.** Ask students to examine the rocks closely without talking for 1 minute.\n\n2. **Guide observations with questions:**\n   - \"How does this rock feel? (Smooth? Rough? Bumpy?)\"\n   - \"Do you see layers in the rock?\"\n   - \"Can you see tiny pieces stuck together?\"\n   - \"What colors do you notice?\"\n\n3. **Students document observations** by drawing the rock's surface and labeling textures (smooth, bumpy, grainy, layered, etc.).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice? What does this remind you of?\"\n- Redirect to observations rather than conclusions: \"Tell me what you see\" rather than \"Why do you think that?\"\n- Ensure students handle materials gently and use tools safely.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a fossil impression model and observe its details.\n- Students identify and describe multiple textures and characteristics in rocks.\n- Students document observations through drawings and simple labels.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to Earth science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary terms and illustrations\n- Displayed student fossil models (still drying is fine)\n- The original fossil photograph\n- Images of real fossils (from textbook or printed images)\n- Index cards with vocabulary terms\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 groups to show their fossil models and describe what they observed.\n   - Ask: \"How is your model like a real fossil? How is it different?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (10 minutes):**\n   Present each term on chart paper with a student-friendly definition and a visual example. Allow students to repeat each word aloud.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Definitions:**\n   - **Fossil:** The remains or trace (imprint or cast) of a living thing that was preserved in rock over millions of years.\n   - **Rock layer:** A sheet of rock formed in the ground; older layers are usually deeper, and newer layers are on top.\n   - **Weathering:** The slow breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by wind, water, ice, or other natural forces.\n   - **Impression fossil:** The shape or outline of an organism left in rock (like your clay model).\n   - **Cast fossil:** A fossil formed when sediment fills an impression and hardens (like your plaster model).\n\n4. **Connect back to observations (3-4 minutes):**\n   - Hold up the original fossil photograph. \"This is a real ammonite fossil—an animal that lived in oceans millions of years ago. When it died, it was buried in mud. Over time, the mud turned to rock, and the shell left an impression. Now we can see it!\"\n   - Explain: \"By studying fossils and the rocks around them, scientists can figure out what Earth was like long, long ago. The rocks tell us stories about ancient environments—whether it was an ocean, a desert, or a forest.\"\n\n5. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Turn to a neighbor. Explain what a fossil is in your own words.\"\n   - Listen to 2-3 pair explanations to gauge understanding.\n   - Ask: \"Can anyone tell me why fossils are important to scientists?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define fossil, rock layer, and weathering in their own words.\n- Students understand that fossils provide evidence of past life and environments.\n- Students make connections between their models and real fossils.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply fossil and rock knowledge to interpret a real scenario.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Rock Layer Detective\" scenario cards (one per group; see template below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Chart paper\n- Diagram of rock layers showing fossils at different depths (teacher-prepared or from textbook)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present a scenario** (show on board or document camera):\n   - \"A construction crew is digging a foundation for a new building. They dig down and find three different layers of rock. In the top layer, they find fossils of plants and insects. In the middle layer, they find fossils of ocean shells and fish. In the bottom layer, they find fossils of different types of ocean creatures.\"\n\n2. **Pose the challenge:** \"What can these fossils tell us about how this place has changed over time? Was it always an ocean? Was it always land? Use what you've learned about fossils and rock layers to explain.\"\n\n3. **Distribute Rock Layer Detective cards** (differentiated by reading level). Each card describes a specific scenario with 2-3 rock layers and fossils found in each.\n\n4. **Student task:**\n   - Draw the three rock layers in order (top to bottom).\n   - Label what fossils were found in each layer.\n   - Write or draw a prediction: \"What was happening in this location in the past?\"\n\n5. **Gallery walk:** Post completed diagrams around the room. Students walk and observe others' interpretations.\n\n6. **Class discussion (3-4 minutes):**\n   - \"How do rock layers help us read Earth's story?\"\n   - \"Why is it important that older rocks are usually at the bottom?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide sentence stems for struggling learners: \"This layer has _____ fossils, so this place was probably _____ long ago.\"\n- Ask higher-order questions to advanced learners: \"What would need to happen to change an ocean into land?\" or \"How long do you think it took for these changes?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create and label diagrams of rock layers with fossils.\n- Students make evidence-based inferences about past environments.\n- Students explain how rocks and fossils show that Earth has changed over time.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossils, rock layers, and Earth's changing landscape.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Listen to student language during pair-shares and group work.\n- Check observation worksheets for accurate descriptions of textures and details.\n- Review fossil model sketches for evidence of careful observation.\n- Observe participation in gallery walk and class discussions.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes):**\n\nDistribute an exit ticket with the following prompts. Students may write, draw, or use a combination.\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **Look at this fossil photograph.** What organism do you think made this fossil? (Accept any reasonable answer—emphasis is on reasoning.)\n\n2. **How did this fossil get trapped in rock?** Use the vocabulary word \"fossil\" in your answer.\n\n3. **What does this fossil tell us about this location long ago?** (Was it land or ocean? Hot or cold? Wet or dry?)\n\n4. **Complete this sentence:** \"Rock layers are important to scientists because _____________.\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n- Student can identify and name a fossil (4-5 out of 5 points if accurate).\n- Student can describe a reasonable process for fossil formation, using the word \"fossil\" correctly (4-5 out of 5 points).\n- Student makes a logical inference about the past environment based on the fossil type (4-5 out of 5 points; reasoning matters more than correctness).\n- Student explains one reason rock layers help scientists (4-5 out of 5 points).\n\n**Scoring Guide:**\n- 16-20 points: Student demonstrates strong understanding of fossils and rock layers as evidence of Earth's changes.\n- 12-15 points: Student shows developing understanding; may need review of vocabulary or inference skills.\n- Below 12 points: Student needs additional support; review fossil definition and rock layer concepts individually.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students articulate connections between fossils, rocks, and Earth's history.\n- Students demonstrate vocabulary retention through written and verbal responses.\n- Students provide evidence-based reasoning for conclusions about past environments.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Sentence stems and word banks:** Provide pre-written phrases for exit tickets and elaboration activities (e.g., \"This fossil shows that long ago, this place was a _____. I know this because _____.\")\n\n2. **Simplified fossil exploration:** Instead of creating both impression and cast models, allow these students to create only an impression fossil. Provide pre-made plaster casts for them to observe rather than making their own.\n\n3. **Paired observation:** Assign these students to work with strong partners during rock texture investigations. Use hand lenses together and discuss observations before recording.\n\n4. **Visual anchor chart:** Create a large, colorful anchor chart labeled \"Fossils Tell Stories\" with illustrations showing a fossil formation sequence (organism dies → buried in mud → mud turns to rock → fossil remains). Post this visibly and reference it multiple times throughout the lesson.\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper time thinking:** Ask: \"How old do scientists think fossils like ammonites are? How do they figure that out?\" (Introduce the concept of relative dating in age-appropriate language: \"Rocks at the bottom are older than rocks on top.\") Challenge students to create a timeline showing different fossil types from oldest to newest.\n\n2. **Weathering investigation:** Ask students to predict: \"If we left rocks outside exposed to rain and wind, how would they change over weeks or months? How might weathering affect fossils?\" Have them design a simple plan to test this (e.g., comparing rock surfaces before and after weathering).\n\n3. **Ancient environment reconstruction:** Provide images of three different fossil assemblages (sea creatures, desert animals, forest plants). Have students work in pairs to determine what the ancient environment was like, what the climate might have been, and what evidence supports their conclusions. Challenge them to present findings to the class.\n\n4. **Fossil detective challenge:** Provide a real or high-quality photograph of an unfamiliar fossil. Ask: \"What organism do you think this came from? What type of environment did it live in? What clues helped you decide?\" Students must justify reasoning with evidence.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil field guide project:** Students create a \"fossil encyclopedia\" of 5 different fossils (ammonites, trilobites, brachiopods, etc.). For each fossil, they draw it, write where it lived, and describe what it tells us about Earth's past. Display in the classroom or media center.\n\n2. **Build a rock and fossil model:** Using a shoe box or clear container, have students create a layered model with three or four distinct \"rock layers\" using different materials (sand, small pebbles, clay, etc.). Embed toy dinosaurs or shells at different levels to represent fossils from different time periods. Label each layer and create a legend explaining what each represents.\n\n3. **Virtual fossil dig:** Use free online resources (e.g., Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History online collections, PBS Learning Media paleontology simulations) to let students explore real fossil collections. Have them select a fossil, research it, and present findings to the class in 2-3 minutes.\n\n4. **Erosion and weathering time-lapse project:** If weathering investigation from the Challenge section is not completed, have interested students photograph rocks or outdoor surfaces (concrete, stone walls) over 2-3 weeks, documenting visible changes due to weathering. Create a simple photo story showing how Earth materials change over time.\n\n5. **Guest expert interview:** Invite a local geologist, paleontologist (check university geology departments), or museum educator to visit virtually or in person. Students prepare 3-4 questions: \"How do you find fossils? What's the oldest fossil you've studied? How do fossils help us understand climate change?\" This reinforces the real-world application of the lesson.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Preparation:** Create plaster of Paris casts (or salt dough) the day before so they are dry during Explain phase. If unavailable, air-dry clay impressions work well.\n- **Safety:** Ensure shells or objects used for impressions have no sharp edges. Supervise plaster mixing (follow package directions; use water-safe containers).\n- **Engagement:** The fossil photograph is highly visual and tactile. Maximize its impact by displaying it prominently throughout the lesson and referencing it often.\n- **Vocabulary retention:** Repeat key vocabulary in context multiple times. Create a word wall students can reference during activities.\n- **Real-world connection:** If your region has accessible fossil sites, mention this. Many states have state geological surveys with local fossil information available online.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson builds from concrete, hands-on exploration to abstract reasoning about deep time and Earth's changes—a developmentally appropriate progression for Fourth Grade learners. The 5E model ensures students construct their own understanding before formal instruction, leading to deeper, more durable learning.",
