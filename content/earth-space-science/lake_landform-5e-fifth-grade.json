The lake in the photograph is a visible example of Earth's hydrosphere.\n- **Seasonal Changes and Biosphere-Hydrosphere Interaction:** The autumn foliage (changing leaves on trees) demonstrates how organisms respond to seasonal changes, which affects how they interact with water systems. Trees near water provide shade, drop leaves into water, and stabilize banks.\n- **Erosion and Weathering of Land:** The fallen log in the water and the sculpted shoreline show how water reshapes the geosphere through erosion. The sediment visible on the beach-like shore is evidence of this ongoing process.\n- **Geosphere-Hydrosphere Interaction:** The rocky/sandy shore, the submerged log, and the water's interaction with the landscape demonstrate how Earth's solid surface and water systems work together to create landforms.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Where Water Shapes the Land: Exploring Lake Ecosystems and Earth's Systems**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions or 90 minutes total (can be split across two days)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-ESS2-1: Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere interact.\n  - 5-ESS2-2: Describe and graph the amounts and percentages of water and fresh water in various reservoirs to provide evidence about the distribution of water on Earth.\n  - 5-ESS3-1: Obtain and combine information about ways individual communities use science ideas to protect the Earth's resources and environment.\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. **Identify and describe** how the geosphere (land), hydrosphere (water), and biosphere (living things) interact in a lake ecosystem shown in the photograph.\n2. **Model and explain** how water and land interact to cause erosion and shape landforms over time.\n3. **Analyze** the distribution of freshwater in Earth's systems and explain why protecting lakes is important for communities.\n4. **Create a labeled diagram or model** showing at least three ways that Earth's spheres interact at a lake or local water system.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about lakes and how Earth's systems interact by examining the photograph closely.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph (lake_landform.jpg)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector without explanation. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds, then think-pair-share with a neighbor about what they see.\n\n2. **Facilitate a whole-group discussion** using these guiding questions:\n   - \"What do you notice about the trees in this picture? How are they different from the trees in the background?\" (Guide students to observe autumn colors and the variety of colors changing.)\n   - \"What is that long, brown object in the water? How did it get there?\" (Encourage ideas about fallen trees, erosion, natural change.)\n   - \"If you were an animal living in this lake or the surrounding forest, what resources would you need from both the water and the land?\" (Prompt thinking about food, shelter, water sources.)\n   - \"Why do you think the shore looks the way it does? What might have shaped it?\" (Introduce erosion and water's power.)\n\n3. **Record student observations and questions** on chart paper. Ask: \"What do you wonder about how this lake formed or how it changes over time?\" Encourage predictions.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore how water, land, and living things all work together to create and change the places we see, like this lake. Let's investigate!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate erosion and the interaction of water and land through hands-on modeling.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 aluminum foil pan or shallow plastic container per pair/small group\n- Potting soil or sand (enough to fill pan halfway)\n- Water in a pitcher or spray bottle\n- Small rocks, pebbles, or gravel\n- Paper towels or newspaper (for cleanup)\n- Observation sheets or science notebooks\n- Pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up the model:** Distribute materials to each pair or small group. Have students:\n   - Fill their pan with a mixture of soil and sand, piling it on one side to create a \"hillside\" or sloped landscape.\n   - Add small rocks or pebbles to represent trees, boulders, or other features.\n   - Leave the other side of the pan lower (this will be the \"lake\").\n\n2. **Simulate water flow and erosion:**\n   - Students slowly pour water from a pitcher or spray water with a spray bottle onto the highest point of their soil pile.\n   - Encourage them to observe what happens to the soil, where the water flows, and how the landscape changes.\n   - Repeat the process 2-3 times, allowing water to pool at the lower end (representing the lake).\n\n3. **Facilitate observation and recording:**\n   - Ask students to **sketch and label** their model before and after water flows.\n   - Students record observations using these prompts:\n     - \"Where did the water go?\"\n     - \"How did the land change?\"\n     - \"What happened to the soil and rocks?\"\n     - \"How does this look like the fallen log and shoreline in the photograph?\"\n\n4. **Extend the investigation (optional):**\n   - If time allows, have students add a \"tree\" (twig) to one part of their landscape and observe how it affects water flow and erosion. Compare areas with and without vegetation.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask clarifying questions: \"What do you observe? Why do you think that happened? How is this like the lake in the photograph?\"\n- Avoid explaining the process; instead, guide students to their own discoveries.\n- Encourage careful observation and documentation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that moving water causes soil and sediment to move and reshape the land.\n- Students observe that erosion creates channels and deposits sediment elsewhere.\n- Students begin to understand the connection between the photograph's landscape and natural erosion processes.\n- Models show visible changes in landform and sediment movement.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts, connecting exploration to Earth's systems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or interactive whiteboard\n- Colored markers\n- Diagram or graphic organizer showing the geosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere\n- Optional: globe or world map showing water distribution\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Facilitate a group share-out** from the Explore phase:\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to briefly describe their observations and what they discovered about how water changes land.\n   - Ask other students: \"Did you notice the same things? What was different?\"\n\n2. **Introduce and define key vocabulary** (write on chart paper):\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---------------------------|\n   | **Geosphere** | All of the solid land on Earth—soil, rocks, mountains, and the seafloor. |\n   | **Hydrosphere** | All of the water on Earth—oceans, lakes, rivers, ice, and water vapor in the air. |\n   | **Biosphere** | All living things on Earth—plants, animals, fungi, and microscopic organisms—and where they live. |\n   | **Erosion** | The process where wind, water, or ice wears away rock and soil and moves it to a new place. |\n   | **Freshwater** | Water that is not salty; it is found in lakes, rivers, and ice, and is needed by most plants and animals. |\n   | **Interaction** | When two or more things affect each other or work together. |\n\n3. **Build a visual model** on the board or chart:\n   - Draw or display a simple diagram showing a lake landscape with:\n     - **Geosphere:** Land, soil, rocks, shoreline\n     - **Hydrosphere:** Lake water\n     - **Biosphere:** Trees, plants, and animals\n   - Draw arrows showing connections:\n     - Water (hydrosphere) erodes the land (geosphere).\n     - Tree roots hold soil in place and prevent some erosion (biosphere affects geosphere).\n     - Trees drop leaves and provide shade and shelter for animals (biosphere interacts with hydrosphere and biosphere).\n     - Animals drink water and depend on both land and water (biosphere depends on hydrosphere and geosphere).\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph and Explore activity:**\n   - \"The fallen log in our photograph shows erosion in action. Like in your models, water moved and reshaped the land until a tree fell into the lake.\"\n   - \"The different colored leaves show that fall is happening. In autumn, trees prepare for winter, and fewer leaves fall into the water than in spring. How might this change the lake ecosystem?\"\n   - \"The sandy shore formed because water and wind eroded the rock and soil—just like water moved soil in your pan.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Point to the geosphere in our diagram. Now point to the hydrosphere. Where is the biosphere?\"\n   - \"Why is the lake in this photo an example of Earth's systems interacting?\"\n   - Exit slip (see Evaluate section): Students answer one reflection question.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary:**\n- Geosphere, Hydrosphere, Biosphere, Erosion, Freshwater, Interaction\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that Earth's systems (geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere) interact and affect each other.\n- Students can explain erosion as a process where water reshapes land.\n- Students recognize that freshwater in lakes is a vital resource that must be protected.\n- Students can identify examples of these interactions in the photograph and their models.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding of Earth's systems to analyze freshwater distribution and protection strategies.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Freshwater distribution data chart (teacher-provided or created from the U.S. Geological Survey)\n- Graph paper or digital graphing tool\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- Optional: information handout on how communities protect freshwater sources\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Graphing Freshwater Distribution**\n\n1. **Present data** about Earth's water:\n   - \"About 97% of Earth's water is saltwater in the oceans. Only 3% is freshwater.\"\n   - \"Of that 3% freshwater, about 69% is locked in ice caps and glaciers, 30% is groundwater (water under the soil), and only 1% is in lakes and rivers where we can easily use it.\"\n\n2. **Have students create a bar graph or pie chart** showing:\n   - Total water on Earth vs. freshwater\n   - Distribution of freshwater among ice, groundwater, and lakes/rivers\n\n3. **Facilitate analysis:**\n   - \"Why is freshwater so precious? Where is most of it?\"\n   - \"Why is the lake in our photograph important for people and animals in the community?\"\n   - \"If pollution gets into a lake, what systems would be affected?\" (Guide them to see how all three spheres are affected.)\n\n**Option B: Community Protection Strategies**\n\n1. **Present a case study** (choose one relevant to your region or use a general example):\n   - A community that restored a lake ecosystem after pollution\n   - A city that protects its watershed from erosion and runoff\n   - A region that manages water distribution during drought\n\n2. **Have students analyze the strategy:**\n   - What problem was the community trying to solve?\n   - How did they use science ideas to protect the freshwater resource?\n   - Which Earth systems did their solution help protect? (Geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere)\n\n3. **Facilitate discussion:**\n   - \"What role do humans play in protecting Earth's systems?\"\n   - \"How could your community protect its water sources?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to make connections between local water systems and the photograph's lake.\n- Encourage critical thinking about resource management and human impact.\n- Facilitate group discussion without providing a single \"correct\" answer.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that freshwater is limited and unevenly distributed on Earth.\n- Students recognize that protecting lakes and freshwater sources is a community responsibility.\n- Students can explain how human activities depend on and affect the hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere.\n- Graphs and analyses show clear understanding of freshwater availability and the importance of protection.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of Earth's systems interactions, erosion, and freshwater protection.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during the lesson):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Circulate and observe whether students are correctly identifying erosion, sediment movement, and landform changes in their models. Take notes on their explanations.\n- **Check-for-Understanding questions in Explain:** Monitor responses to questions about geosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere identification and interactions.\n- **Group discussions in Elaborate:** Listen to student explanations of freshwater distribution and protection strategies.\n\n**Summative Assessment (Exit Ticket or Diagram Task):**\n\n**Option 1: Labeled Diagram Assessment**\nStudents create a labeled diagram of the lake ecosystem in the photograph, showing:\n- At least three features of the **geosphere** (land, rocks, soil, shoreline)\n- At least two features of the **hydrosphere** (water, water movement)\n- At least three living things from the **biosphere** (trees, plants, animals)\n- At least three arrows showing how these spheres interact (label each arrow with a brief explanation)\n\n**Option 2: Written Response Exit Ticket**\nStudents answer the following questions in their science notebook:\n1. \"How does water change the shape of the land? Give an example from the photograph or your model.\"\n2. \"Name the three Earth systems (spheres) and explain how each one is connected to the lake in the photograph.\"\n3. \"Why is it important for communities to protect freshwater lakes? Give one reason.\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students correctly identify and label features of all three Earth systems.\n- Students describe at least two interactions between different Earth systems with accurate explanations.\n- Students explain erosion as a real process visible in natural settings.\n- Students articulate that freshwater is a limited resource that requires protection.\n- Responses demonstrate understanding appropriate for fifth-grade level (clear, concise, uses some vocabulary from the lesson).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that the geosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere interact in dynamic ways.\n- Students recognize erosion as a visible, ongoing process that shapes landscapes.\n- Students understand that freshwater is precious and that protecting it is a community responsibility.\n- Assessment products (diagrams, written responses, graphs) show clear, labeled thinking about Earth's systems.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (For Struggling Learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Diagram Template:** Provide a partially labeled diagram with blanks for students to fill in. Include picture labels or icons for geosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere rather than only text.\n\n2. **Guided Erosion Model:** Work with a small group during Explore. Ask yes/no questions instead of open-ended ones (\"Is the water moving the soil? Where is the soil going?\") and help students record observations sentence-by-sentence.\n\n3. **Vocabulary Support:** Use a color-coded vocabulary chart (geosphere = brown, hydrosphere = blue, biosphere = green) and post it where students can reference it during work. Use consistent color-coding in diagrams and discussions.\n\n4. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Offer multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank options instead of open-ended written response. Example: \"Erosion is when ___ moves soil and rocks. (water / wind / ice)\" Provide sentence starters: \"The three Earth systems interact because _____.\"\n\n**Challenge (For Advanced Learners):**\n\n1. **Extended Erosion Investigation:** Have students test variables in their erosion models. Questions: \"What happens if we add a lot of water at once versus slowly? Does vegetation slow erosion? What if we add rocks or clay?\" Have them design and conduct a controlled experiment with one variable changed at a time.\n\n2. **Research Freshwater Distribution Beyond Lakes:** Challenge students to investigate where else freshwater is found and stored (aquifers, glaciers, soil moisture). Create a more detailed pie chart showing all freshwater reservoirs and percentages. Discuss why each source is important to different communities.\n\n3. **Community Water Management Case Study:** Have students research a specific freshwater system in your state or region (a lake, river, or watershed). Create a presentation explaining the geosphere-hydrosphere-biosphere interactions in that system and one challenge the community faces in protecting it.\n\n4. **Modeling Feedback Loops:** Challenge students to create a cause-and-effect diagram showing how changes in one sphere cause changes in another. Example: \"If trees are removed (biosphere change), erosion increases (geosphere change) because there are no roots to hold soil. More sediment enters the lake (hydrosphere change). This makes the water cloudier, which affects plants that need sunlight.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Virtual Lake Visit or Field Trip:** If possible, visit a local lake or park with a water feature. Have students use the same observation skills from the lesson to identify examples of geosphere-hydrosphere-biosphere interaction. Have them photograph or sketch examples of erosion, vegetation near water, and signs of seasonal change. Create a digital presentation or poster showing their findings.\n\n2. **Water Conservation Project:** Challenge students to calculate how much freshwater their household uses in a week (toilet flushes, showers, drinking water, laundry). Compare to classmates and discuss conservation strategies. Create an infographic or PSA poster for the school about freshwater protection, using data and Earth systems concepts from the lesson.\n\n3. **Seasonal Lake Change Study:** Track a local water system (lake, pond, or creek) across seasons using photographs or journal entries. Observe and record changes in the biosphere (migration, leaf changes, animal activity), geosphere (erosion, sediment changes), and hydrosphere (water level, ice formation, clarity). Create a \"Lake Through the Seasons\" display showing how Earth's systems interact and change over time.\n\n4. **Historical Erosion and Geology Project:** Research how a specific lake or body of water in your region was formed. Did glaciers carve it? Was it created by a river or erosion? Create a timeline or poster showing the geological processes that shaped the landscape. Connect to the lesson by explaining how the geosphere and hydrosphere continue to interact to maintain or change the lake today.\n\n5. **Microplastics and Freshwater Pollution Investigation:** Extend the lesson by introducing the idea that human activities affect freshwater. Have students research or discuss how plastic and other pollutants enter lakes and rivers. Design a simple filtration experiment or write a proposal for how their community could reduce pollution entering freshwater sources.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
