The white snow sticks to the dark green branches and needles, creating a beautiful contrast. You can see the trees are still standing tall even with all the heavy snow on top of them.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Snow accumulation on evergreen plants during winter\n\n**Why This Is Happening:**\nWhen winter arrives, temperatures drop below freezing (32°F or 0°C). Water in the air forms ice crystals instead of rain—this is snow. The snow falls and collects on the branches and needles of evergreen trees because the trees stay green all year long, unlike deciduous trees that lose their leaves. The shape of evergreen branches (especially on conifers like pines and spruces) naturally catches and holds snow. This is a normal seasonal change that happens every winter in cold climates.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Seasonal Weather Changes:** Winter is a season when temperatures become very cold, and water falls as snow instead of rain. Snow only forms when it is cold enough.\n\n* **Properties of Snow:** Snow is frozen water that falls from clouds. It is white, cold, and can pile up on surfaces like branches, ground, and roofs.\n\n* **Evergreen Trees:** Some trees keep their leaves (needles) all year long, even in winter. These are called evergreens. Deciduous trees lose their leaves in fall, but evergreens do not.\n\n* **Seasonal Plant Adaptations:** Evergreen trees have special needles and waxy coatings that help them survive cold, snowy winters. Their branches are shaped to shed heavy snow so they don't break.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFor Kindergarteners, focus on observable, sensory-friendly language: \"Look at the white, fluffy snow!\" rather than abstract concepts. Use real objects like branches and artificial snow in your classroom to let children touch and explore. Kinesthetic experiences help young learners understand seasonal changes better than pictures alone.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Engagement:** Bring in branches from outside (safe, clean ones) and let students feel the texture.

    "firstgrade": "# Winter Seasons: Snow-Covered Plants\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\nThis image shows evergreen trees and shrubs covered in thick, fluffy white snow on a bright, sunny winter day. You can see the green needles and branches peeking out from underneath the heavy snow blanket. In the background, more snow-covered plants and a frozen landscape stretch across the snowy ground.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Snow accumulation on plants during winter.\n\nThis phenomenon occurs because water vapor in the air freezes into ice crystals when temperatures drop below 32°F (0°C). These ice crystals collect together to form snowflakes, which fall from clouds and land on trees, shrubs, and the ground. The snow sticks to the evergreen branches because the trees are still \"alive\" during winter and have sticky, waxy needles. The bright sunlight in the photo shows how snow reflects light, making it appear white and shiny—this is an important observable characteristic that helps First Graders understand why winter landscapes look different from other seasons.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **Seasonal change:** Winter is a season when temperatures are very cold, and water freezes into snow instead of falling as rain.\n\n* **States of matter:** Water can be a liquid (rain), solid (ice and snow), or gas (water vapor). Snow is frozen water—a solid state.\n\n* **Plant adaptation:** Evergreen trees keep their needles all winter long, while other trees lose their leaves. The waxy coating on evergreen needles helps them survive cold temperatures.\n\n* **Weather patterns:** Snow is a type of precipitation that happens in winter when it is cold enough for water in clouds to freeze.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nUse this image as an anchor to help students distinguish between winter and other seasons. Ask students: \"What do you notice that tells us it's winter?\" This helps develop observational skills and connects abstract seasonal concepts to concrete, visible evidence they can see and relate to their own experiences.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nProvide multiple means of engagement by offering a choice of response formats: students could draw what they observe, use physical manipulatives (cotton balls to represent snow), or dictate observations to you. For students with visual processing needs, describe the image aloud in detail, emphasizing the contrast between white snow and green plants. For kinesthetic learners, create a tactile activity using white fabric or cotton to \"cover\" toy plants.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 1-ESS1-1 Use observations to describe patterns of the sun, moon, and stars. (Connections to [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] and seasonal observation)\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:1-ESS1.A]] Patterns of the sun, moon, and stars can be observed, described, and predicted.

Have them use clipboards to draw or mark what they observe: snow on plants, bare branches, evergreen trees still being green, frost, or icicles. This builds observational skills and connects the anchor image to their real world.\n\n2. **\"Melting Snow\" Experiment:** Bring clean snow into the classroom (or use ice) in a clear container. Place it on a sunny windowsill and observe how it changes over time. Record observations with drawings and dictated notes. Ask: \"Where did the snow go? What happened to it?\" This demonstrates phase change and builds understanding of cause and effect.\n\n3. **\"Winter Plant Sort\":** Show pictures of different winter plants (evergreens vs. deciduous trees). Have students sort them into \"keeps leaves/needles\" and \"loses leaves\" categories. Create a simple chart together. This reinforces the concept that different plants have different adaptations for winter survival.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Snow* by Manya Stojic (explores snow in different environments)\n- *In the Snow: Who's Been Here?* by Lindsay Barrett George (winter animals and tracks)\n- *Winter* by Gerda Muller (seasonal observation and change)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"How Snowflakes Form\"** - National Geographic Kids (2:30) - Simple, engaging explanation of snow formation with clear visuals.

    "secondgrade": "# Winter Seasons: Snow-Covered Plants & Trees\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\nThis image shows evergreen trees and shrubs completely blanketed with thick, fluffy snow during winter. The bright white snow contrasts beautifully with the green branches underneath, and the frozen landscape in the background reminds us that winter is a cold season. You can see how snow sticks to different parts of the plants in interesting, bumpy shapes.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Snow accumulation on plants during winter weather conditions.\n\n**Why This Happens (Scientific Explanation):**\nWhen temperatures drop below freezing (32°F/0°C), water in the air becomes snow instead of rain. As snow falls, it lands on tree branches and plant leaves. Because the branches are cold, the snow sticks to them instead of sliding off. The heavier the snowfall, the more snow accumulates on the plants. Eventually, the weight of all that snow creates these beautiful, puffy shapes we see in the photo. This demonstrates the water cycle in winter and how weather affects living things in their environment.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **States of Water:** Water exists in three forms—solid (ice and snow), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor). In winter, water from clouds falls as snow, which is frozen water in solid form.\n\n2. **Seasonal Weather Patterns:** Winter is characterized by cold temperatures that cause precipitation to fall as snow rather than rain. Temperature changes throughout the year affect what we see in nature.\n\n3. **Environmental Adaptation:** Evergreen plants (like the ones in this photo) keep their needles or leaves all year long, unlike trees that lose their leaves. This allows them to survive harsh winter conditions with snow on their branches.\n\n4. **Properties of Snow:** Snow is light but can accumulate to create significant weight. Snow has texture and can stick to surfaces because of moisture and cold temperatures.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nUse this image as a \"minds-on\" hook before jumping into winter weather activities. Have students observe the photo silently for 30 seconds and write or draw one thing they notice. This activates prior knowledge and builds curiosity before direct instruction. Second graders learn better when they first wonder about phenomena before learning the \"why.\"\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nTo support diverse learners: (1) Provide multiple means of representation by showing both this photo and a real snow-covered branch brought into the classroom (if possible) so visual and tactile learners can both engage; (2) Offer vocabulary support by pre-teaching \"evergreen,\" \"accumulate,\" and \"freeze\" with picture cards and gestures; (3) Allow students to respond to discussion questions through drawing, speaking, or writing depending on their literacy level.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n2-ESS1-1: Use information from several sources to provide evidence that Earth events can occur quickly or slowly.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-ESS1.A]] (Earth's Materials and Systems) — Understanding that weather and seasonal patterns affect the physical world\n- [[NGSS:DCI:K-PS1.A]] (Structure and Properties of Matter) — Recognizing different states of matter and their properties\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] — Recognizing that snow accumulation follows predictable winter patterns\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] — Understanding that cold temperatures cause water to freeze and snow to stick to surfaces\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why do you think the snow sticks to the branches instead of just falling straight to the ground?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **What would happen to this plant if the snow got heavier and heavier?** (Bloom's: Predict/Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n3. **Look at the bare trees in the background compared to the snowy evergreen trees in front. Why might the evergreen trees have more snow on them?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n4. **How is this snow different from the water you drink or the rain you see in other seasons?** (Bloom's: Compare | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Snow:** Frozen water that falls from clouds in winter when it's very cold.\n* **Evergreen:** A plant that keeps its green leaves or needles all year long, even in winter.\n* **Accumulate:** To collect or gather together in larger and larger amounts.\n* **Freeze:** When a liquid (like water) gets so cold it turns into a solid (like ice).\n* **Winter:** The coldest season of the year when snow often falls and temperatures drop.\n* **Weather:** The condition of the air outside, including temperature, rain, snow, and wind.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Bring Winter Indoors\" Observation:** Collect a small snow-covered branch from outside (if you have access to snow) and bring it into the classroom in a container. Place it on a tray and observe what happens as the classroom warmth affects the snow. Have students predict what will happen, observe the changes, and record their observations through drawing or writing. This demonstrates the water cycle and state changes in real time.\n\n2. **Paper Snowflake Construction & Stacking:** Have students fold and cut paper snowflakes, then tape or glue them onto paper cutouts of branches. Ask students to predict how many paper snowflakes they can stack on a drawn branch before it \"breaks\" (bends too much). Test their predictions and discuss why real snow has weight and can bend branches, just like their stacked snowflakes.\n\n3. **Winter Weather Data Collection:** Over one week, have students observe the outdoor environment (from a window or quick outdoor time) and record whether they see snow, rain, or clear skies. Create a class chart or picture graph showing the weather patterns observed. Discuss why winter weather changes from day to day and connect it to the snow-covered plants in the photo.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Snow* by Manya Stojic (Observing snow and winter weather through different perspectives)\n- *Winter Trees* by William Carlos Williams (Poetry and observation of winter plants)\n- *The Snowy Day* by Ezra Jack Keats (A classic introduction to snow and winter play)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"How Does Snow Form?\"** by National Geographic Kids (2:15 minutes) — Simple, animated explanation of the water cycle and snow formation.

Pair it with direct observations (if snow is available in your region) and simple experiments with ice and water to deepen conceptual understanding. Second graders are concrete learners, so hands-on exploration significantly increases retention of abstract concepts like state changes and seasonal patterns.",
    "thirdgrade": "# Winter Seasons: Snow-Covered Evergreen Trees\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\nThis image shows evergreen trees (like pine and spruce trees) completely covered with thick, fluffy snow during winter. The bright white snow clings to the green branches, and you can see bare deciduous trees in the background. The sunny day makes the snow sparkle and shine brightly against the blue sky and snowy ground.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why do evergreen trees get covered with heavy snow while deciduous trees lose their leaves?\n\n**Scientific Explanation:** During winter, water vapor in the air freezes into snow crystals when temperatures drop below freezing (32°F or 0°C). Evergreen trees keep their needle-like leaves year-round, giving snow many surfaces to accumulate on. The snow sticks to these branches and builds up into thick, heavy layers. Deciduous trees (shown bare in the background) have already dropped their leaves to conserve water and energy during the cold season, so they have fewer surfaces for snow to collect on. This visible difference helps us observe how different plants adapt to winter conditions.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **States of Water:** Water exists in three states—solid (ice/snow), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor). In this image, we see water as snow (solid) and can infer the water vapor that froze to create it.\n\n2. **Seasonal Changes:** Winter is a season characterized by cold temperatures, snow, and shorter days. Trees and plants respond differently to winter conditions based on their species.\n\n3. **Plant Adaptations:** Evergreen trees keep their leaves year-round as an adaptation to winter, while deciduous trees shed their leaves to survive harsh winter conditions with less water loss.\n\n4. **Weather and Snow Formation:** Snow forms when water vapor in clouds freezes into ice crystals high in the atmosphere, then falls to the ground when it becomes heavy enough.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nWhen teaching about snow formation, help students make the connection between what they observe (snow on trees) and the invisible process (water freezing in clouds). Use the phrase \"frozen water vapor\" repeatedly so students understand snow is not just \"cold water\" but water that has changed states.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Representation:** Provide images comparing evergreen vs. deciduous trees side-by-side. Use video of snow falling or melting to show the water cycle in action. **Engagement:** Allow students to touch real evergreen branches and compare needle texture to deciduous twigs. **Action & Expression:** Let students sketch the two tree types or create a physical model using pipe cleaners (evergreen) vs. bare sticks (deciduous) and sprinkle artificial snow on both to compare accumulation.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 3-ESS2-1: Represent data in tables and graphical displays to describe typical weather conditions expected during a particular season.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-ESS2.D]] - Weather and climate (seasonal patterns and how living things respond)\n- [[NGSS:DCI:3-LS1.A]] - Structure and function (how different plants have different structures suited to their environment)\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Seasonal patterns of weather and plant behavior\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Structure and Function]] - How evergreen needles capture snow differently than bare branches\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why do you think evergreen trees keep their leaves in winter when other trees lose theirs?** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n2. **What do you observe about where the snow is piling up on these trees?

Shake the box gently and observe which type accumulates more. Record observations in a data table. Discuss why the shapes of the branches matter.\n\n2. **Seasonal Tree Sorting:** Provide pictures of various trees in different seasons. Students sort them into \"Evergreen\" and \"Deciduous\" categories and explain their reasoning. Create a class chart showing which trees are visible during each season in your region.\n\n3. **Winter Weather Tracking:** Over 2-3 weeks, have students record daily temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover on a simple weather chart. Create a class graph showing temperature changes and connect observations to the photo (i.e., \"We had 2 snowy days like in the picture!\").\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *Snow* by Manya Stojic (explores snow across different ecosystems)\n- *Winter Trees* by William Carlos Williams (age-appropriate poetry about winter plant changes)\n- *Stranger in the Woods* by Carl R.

    "fourthgrade": "# Winter Weather: Snow-Covered Evergreens\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows evergreen trees heavily covered with thick snow and frost during winter. The snow has accumulated on all the branches, bending them downward under the weight. In the background, you can see bare deciduous trees and a frozen or snow-covered pond, showing how different trees respond differently to winter conditions.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Why does snow stick to evergreen trees during winter?\n\nSnow accumulates on evergreen branches because of how the branches grow and their surface texture. Evergreen trees have needle-like leaves (or small flat needles) that point outward in many directions, creating a large surface area for snow to collect on. When temperatures stay near freezing and snow is wet and heavy, it sticks more easily to these surfaces. Additionally, the evergreen's cone or pyramid shape and dense branching pattern naturally trap and hold snow. The weight of accumulated snow can actually bend the branches downward, as you can see in this photo. This is a seasonal pattern that happens repeatedly each winter in snowy climates.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **States of Matter and Phase Changes:** Water exists in three states—solid (ice/snow), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor). Snow is frozen water that forms in clouds and falls to Earth when conditions are cold enough.\n\n* **Seasonal Weather Patterns:** Winter brings predictable changes in temperature, precipitation, and daylight hours. Snow is a form of precipitation that occurs in cold climates during winter months.\n\n* **Plant Adaptations to Winter:** Different trees have adapted differently to survive winter. Evergreen trees keep their needles year-round, while deciduous trees drop their leaves to conserve water and energy during cold months.\n\n* **Properties of Snow and Accumulation:** Snow has low density compared to liquid water, but when compressed or when wet snow sticks together, it becomes heavy and can exert significant weight on objects like tree branches.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nRather than simply telling students \"snow is frozen water,\" allow them to **observe and compare** real samples: fresh snow, compressed snow, and ice. Ask them to predict which will melt fastest and why. This hands-on comparison deepens their understanding of how water's properties change with temperature and density—key concepts for this grade level.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Multiple Means of Engagement:** Some students may have limited experience with snow if they live in warm climates. Provide high-quality images, videos, or virtual tours of snowy landscapes. Pair visual learning with tactile experiences (if possible, using ice and water in the classroom) and discussions about winter in different regions. This honors diverse student backgrounds while building conceptual understanding.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** \n4-ESS2-1: Make observations and measurements to provide evidence of the effects of weathering or the rate of erosion by water, ice, wind, or vegetation.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n* [[NGSS:DCI:4-ESS1.A]] - The repeating patterns of seasons result from Earth's tilt and orbit around the sun\n* [[NGSS:DCI:4-ESS2.A]] - Rainfall helps shape the land and affects the types of living things found in a region\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Seasonal weather patterns repeat year after year\n* [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] - Cold temperatures cause water to freeze into snow; snow accumulation causes branches to bend\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why do you think the evergreen tree's branches are bending down so much while the bare trees in the background are standing straight?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **Compare how this evergreen tree looks in winter to how you think it looks in summer.

Ask them to record observations about how much snow accumulated, which objects hold the most snow, and how the snow changes as temperatures fluctuate. This reinforces observation skills and understanding of seasonal patterns.\n\n2. **Build a Winter Landscape Model:** Using white playdough or papier-mâché, students can construct miniature evergreen and deciduous trees, then use shaving cream or cotton balls to simulate snow accumulation. This tactile activity helps them understand structural differences between tree types and visualize how snow affects different branches.\n\n3. **Water State Exploration Station:** Set up a classroom station with ice cubes, snow (if available), liquid water, and a heat source (like a sunny windowsill or lamp). Students make predictions about which states of water will change and how, then observe the transitions from solid to liquid to gas (evaporation). Connect this to the photo by explaining that the snow in the photo could eventually melt and evaporate.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n* *Stranger in the Woods* by Carl R.

    "fifthgrade": "# Fifth Grade Science Lesson Analysis: Winter Seasons\n\n## 📸 Photo Description\nThis image shows evergreen trees heavily covered in snow during winter. The bright white snow clings to the dark green branches and needles, creating a beautiful contrast. You can see a frozen landscape in the background, with bare deciduous trees and a snowy ground, demonstrating how the environment changes during the coldest season of the year.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Snow accumulation on evergreen vegetation during winter\n\n**Why This Happens:** When air temperatures drop below 32°F (0°C), water vapor in the atmosphere freezes into ice crystals that form snow. As snow falls and accumulates on tree branches, it sticks to the needles and branches of evergreen plants. Evergreen trees retain their leaves year-round (unlike deciduous trees that lose their leaves), so they provide more surface area for snow to collect and stick to. The weight of accumulated snow demonstrates gravity's effect on objects, while the persistence of snow on the ground shows that frozen water remains solid when temperatures stay cold.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **States of Matter & Phase Changes:** Water exists in three states—solid (ice/snow), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor). Snow is frozen water that forms in the atmosphere and falls to Earth when conditions are cold enough.\n\n2. **Seasonal Temperature Patterns:** Winter is the coldest season in temperate climates because the Northern Hemisphere (or Southern Hemisphere) is tilted away from the sun's direct rays, resulting in shorter days and colder temperatures that allow precipitation to fall as snow instead of rain.\n\n3. **Plant Adaptations:** Evergreen trees keep their needles year-round, which helps them retain moisture and survive cold winters. Their needle shape and waxy coating help reduce water loss and allow snow to accumulate on branches.\n\n4. **Weather & Climate Conditions:** Snow formation requires specific atmospheric conditions: cold temperatures, moisture in the air, and condensation nuclei (dust/particles) around which ice crystals form.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nHelp students make personal connections by asking them to observe their own local winter conditions. Even if your region doesn't get snow, students can investigate what happens to water in cold temperatures by freezing water in ice cube trays or observing frost formation. This bridges abstract concepts to observable phenomena in their own environment.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\n**Representation:** Provide images of the same landscape in multiple seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter) so students can compare and contrast. Use video clips or time-lapse photography showing snow accumulation in real-time, which helps visual learners understand the process better than static images alone.\n\n**Action & Expression:** Allow students to demonstrate understanding through multiple modalities—some might draw diagrams of the water cycle with snow, others might create physical models using cotton balls and branches, while others might write explanations or record video explanations.\n\n**Engagement:** Connect to student interests by discussing winter sports, holiday traditions, or animals that adapt to snow. Ask students to share personal winter experiences from their own families and communities.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Grade 5 Performance Expectation:**\n5-PS1-1: Develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen and that these particles are in constant motion.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-PS1.A]]: Structure and Properties of Matter\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-ESS1.B]]: Earth and the Solar System (seasonal changes due to Earth's tilt)\n- [[NGSS:DCI:5-LS1.A]]: Structure and Function (plant structures)\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] (seasonal patterns in weather and plant behavior)\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]] (water cycle as a system)\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Stability and Change]] (how matter changes state; how plants change seasonally)\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **Why do you think snow sticks to the evergreen tree's branches better than it might stick to a smooth piece of glass?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. **What would happen to the snow on these trees if the temperature suddenly increased to 50°F? Use what you know about states of matter to explain your thinking.** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n3. **How do you think evergreen trees are different from the bare trees you see in the background, and why might these differences help them survive winter?** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n4. **If you could design a plant that thrives in snowy winters, what features would you give it and why?** (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Snow:** Frozen water that falls from clouds as ice crystals when temperatures are below 32°F (0°C).\n\n* **Evergreen:** A plant or tree that keeps its leaves or needles all year long, even during winter.\n\n* **Phase Change:** When matter changes from one state to another, such as when water freezes into ice or ice melts into water.\n\n* **Accumulation:** The process of something building up or collecting in one place over time.\n\n* **Precipitation:** Water that falls from clouds to Earth, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n* **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is, usually measured in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seasonal Comparison Investigation:** Have students collect or draw pictures of the same outdoor location (near your school, a local park, or a tree in the schoolyard) in all four seasons. Create a class poster or digital presentation showing how the landscape, vegetation, and weather change throughout the year. Students can write observations about which season had the most precipitation, which had the coldest temperatures, and how plants responded to each season.\n\n2. **Snow vs. Rain Experiment:** Fill two clear containers with ice. Over one container, hold a strainer or cheesecloth and pour room-temperature water slowly (simulating snow falling and accumulating on branches). Over the second container, pour water directly without the strainer (simulating rain). Have students observe and measure which method resulted in more ice accumulation and discuss why. Connect this to how snow sticks to evergreen branches.\n\n3. **Plant Adaptation Design Challenge:** Give students pictures of various winter plants (evergreens, dormant deciduous trees, winter grasses) and have them identify and sketch specific adaptations they notice. Then challenge them to design their own plant that would survive harsh winter conditions. Students should label at least three adaptations and explain in writing how each one helps the plant survive cold weather, snow, and reduced sunlight.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *The Snowy Day* by Ezra Jack Keats (classic story about winter exploration and snow)\n- *Snow* by Manya Stojic (explores snow from different perspectives across landscapes)\n- *Come On, Rain!* by Karen Hesse (explores water cycle and precipitation, good for contrast with snow)\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"How Snow Forms\"** by Crash Course Kids (3:42 minutes) — Clear explanation of the water cycle and snow formation with engaging animations.
