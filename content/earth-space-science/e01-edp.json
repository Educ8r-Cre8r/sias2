The bridge must:\n- Span across a gap (use a shoe box or two blocks as the \"river\")\n- Hold the weight of toy cars driving over it\n- Use materials you can find (popsicle sticks, straws, string, paper)\n\nCan you make a bridge that doesn't break?\n\n---\n\n### 3–5 Version\n**\"Design a Tall City Building That Stands Strong\"**\n\nYou are a structural engineer designing a skyscraper for a busy city. Your building must:\n- Be at least 30 cm tall\n- Support a 500-gram weight (books, sand bag) placed on top without tipping or buckling\n- Use only paper, cardboard tubes, tape, and string\n- Have a stable base that keeps it standing even when someone gently pushes it sideways\n- Be designed to resist \"wind\" (you'll test it with a gentle fan or by blowing on it)\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- Building stands upright for 2 minutes with weight on top\n- Does not fall when pushed gently or exposed to wind\n- Uses the fewest materials possible (less waste = better design)\n\n---\n\n## EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis photo shows real infrastructure solving real problems (spanning water, supporting weight in a dense urban environment). Starting with \"Ask\" lets students observe the visible structures, wonder *why* they're designed this way, and identify the challenges engineers face (tall buildings sway in wind, bridges must not collapse under traffic, natural areas must be preserved). This authentic problem-identification phase motivates deeper engagement than jumping straight to building.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested Materials\n\n- **Paper tubes** (paper towel rolls, wrapping paper cores)\n- **Cardboard** (cereal boxes, shipping boxes, poster board)\n- **Tape** (masking tape, duct tape, or clear packing tape)\n- **String or yarn** (for bracing/support)\n- **Weights** (textbooks, sand bags, or stacked weights to represent building load)\n- **Optional**: wooden craft sticks (popsicle sticks) or plastic straws for bridge spans\n\n---\n\n## Estimated Time\n\n- **K–2 Bridge Challenge**: 45–60 minutes (including design sketch, building, and 2–3 test trials)\n- **3–5 Tall Building Challenge**: Two 40-minute sessions (Session 1: observe photo, sketch design, build; Session 2: test, refine, document results)\n\n---\n\n## Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS 3-5-ETS1-1** (*Define a problem that can be solved by designing a new object or tool*) and **K-2-ETS1-1** (*Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change*) by anchoring the design challenge in a real cityscape where students can see how engineers balance height, strength, and stability.",
