ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about how sunlight can be used as an energy source and activate prior knowledge about renewable resources.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of the solar structure (displayed via projector or printed)\n- Thermometer (1-2 for demonstration)\n- Two identical clear containers (glass or plastic)\n- Construction paper (black and white)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board without explanation. Ask students to observe silently for 15 seconds.\n\n2. **Pose opening questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe the materials and how they're arranged.\"\n   - \"Why do you think this structure has such a large window facing the sun?\"\n   - \"What do you think happens inside this building when the sun shines through that window?\"\n   - \"How could the sun's energy help power buildings or heat homes?\"\n\n3. **Quick Prediction Activity** (3 minutes):\n   - Show students the two identical containers—one wrapped in black paper, one in white.\n   - Place both in direct sunlight near a window.\n   - Ask: \"Which container do you predict will get hotter? Why?\"\n   - Record predictions on a chart labeled \"Before\" and \"After.\"\n   - Let containers sit in sunlight for 2-3 minutes.\n   - Measure temperature in each with a thermometer and discuss results.\n   - Connect: \"This is how the sun's energy can be captured and used!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate how communities use the sun's power to solve problems, just like the structure in this photo does.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how materials and design capture solar energy through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small cardboard boxes (6-8, one per pair/group)\n- Clear plastic wrap or plastic bags\n- Black construction paper or black cloth\n- Thermometers (6-8)\n- Tape (masking and clear)\n- Aluminum foil\n- Small containers of water\n- Window access or sunlight source\n- Data recording sheets (provided)\n- Rulers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Student Investigation Setup** (2 minutes):\n   - Organize students into pairs or small groups.\n   - Distribute one cardboard box, thermometer, black paper, plastic wrap, and other materials to each group.\n   - Explain: \"You're going to design a small solar collector, similar to the structure in the photograph. Your goal is to trap the sun's heat inside a box.\"\n\n2. **Design Phase** (8 minutes):\n   - **Student Directions:**\n     - Line the inside bottom of your box with black construction paper (black absorbs heat).\n     - Cover the top opening of the box with clear plastic wrap, sealing it tightly with tape.\n     - Optionally, line one side with aluminum foil to reflect sunlight into the box.\n     - Place your thermometer inside the box so it's visible through the plastic.\n     - Record the starting temperature on your data sheet.\n   \n3. **Investigation Phase** (10 minutes):\n   - Place all boxes in a sunny window or outdoor location.\n   - Students measure and record the temperature inside their boxes every 2 minutes for 10 minutes.\n   - Groups also observe: Does the plastic wrap get fogged? Does the black paper feel hot? What happens to the air inside?\n   - **Documentation:** Students create a simple line graph showing temperature change over time.\n\n4. **Observation Prompt:** \n   - \"Compare your design to the building in the photograph. What materials in the photo do similar jobs to your plastic wrap, black paper, and cardboard?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What is warming up first—the plastic or the air inside?\" \"Why do you think we used black paper?\" \"How is this like the building's design?\"\n- Do NOT give answers; encourage students to make observations and inferences.\n- Ensure all thermometers are read correctly and recorded accurately.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that temperature inside the box increases over time.\n- Students observe that clear plastic allows sunlight in but traps heat (the greenhouse effect).\n- Students identify that black materials absorb heat more effectively than light materials.\n- Students produce a graph showing their data and make a written or verbal comparison to the photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### 3.

How did your design work?\"\n   - Create a class data display: Post all group graphs on a bulletin board or digital display.\n   - Ask: \"What patterns do you notice in all the data? Did all boxes heat up? Why might some be warmer than others?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (8 minutes):\n   - Write each term on the board and discuss with students:\n\n   **Renewable Resource:** A natural material or energy source that can be replaced or will not run out (like sunlight). Unlike coal or oil, the sun will shine for billions of years, so solar energy is renewable.\n   \n   **Solar Energy:** Energy that comes from the sun. It travels to Earth as light and heat.\n   \n   **Greenhouse Effect (in this context):** What happens when clear materials (like plastic or glass) let light in but trap heat inside, warming the space. This is what happened in your boxes!\n   \n   **Sustainable:** A way of living or building that protects Earth's resources for the future. Using solar energy instead of fossil fuels is more sustainable.\n   \n   **Thermal Energy (or Heat Energy):** The movement of energy that makes things warmer. Your thermometer measured thermal energy.\n\n3. **Connect Back to Photograph** (3 minutes):\n   - Point to the structure: \"This building uses the same ideas as your solar boxes. The large windows let sunlight in (like your plastic wrap). The insulation inside (the gray material you see) keeps heat from escaping (like your box walls). This building might use the sun's heat to warm space or even create electricity.\"\n   - Ask: \"How is this building protecting Earth's resources? Why is using the sun's energy important for communities?\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding** (2 minutes):\n   - Ask students to turn and talk: \"In one sentence, explain why a building with big south-facing windows is a good idea.\"\n   - Listen for use of vocabulary and understanding of solar energy capture.\n\n**Vocabulary Summary:**\n- **Renewable Resource:** Energy or materials that can be replaced or won't run out\n- **Solar Energy:** Energy from the sun\n- **Greenhouse Effect:** Trapping of heat by clear materials\n- **Sustainable:** Protecting Earth's resources for the future\n- **Thermal Energy:** Heat energy that makes things warmer\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define renewable resources and identify solar energy as one.\n- Students explain how their solar box model works using correct vocabulary.\n- Students connect their model to the photograph and understand that buildings can be designed to capture solar energy.\n- Students recognize that renewable energy protects Earth's resources.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by designing a community building that uses solar energy and explaining its benefits.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper or cardboard sheets (8.5\" × 11\" or larger)\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Rulers\n- Building material scraps (optional: foam, popsicle sticks, craft paper)\n- Computer/tablet access (optional, for research)\n- \"Community Building Design Brief\" handout (provided below)\n- Research sheet: \"How Does Your Community Use Solar Energy?\"\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Design Challenge Introduction** (2 minutes):\n   - Explain: \"Imagine your town or school wants to build a new community center or greenhouse. You are the architect! Design a building that uses solar energy like the one in the photograph. Your design should explain how it will help the community and protect Earth's resources.\"\n\n2. **Design Phase** (12 minutes):\n   - **Student Directions:**\n     - Sketch a building design on paper (side view or front view).\n     - Label at least three features that capture or use solar energy (e.g., large south-facing windows, black-painted walls, transparent roof panels, water collection from roof).\n     - Write a short explanation (2-3 sentences) for each feature: \"Why did you choose this? What does it do?\"\n     - Consider: What is this building used for? Who in the community will use it? How does it help protect Earth?\n   \n3. **Optional Research Component** (if time allows):\n   - Provide students with 2-3 pre-selected websites or articles about solar buildings, solar schools, or community solar projects.\n   - Students find one real-world example of a building that uses solar energy and note: name, location, what it does, and one solar feature.\n\n4. **Gallery Walk or Peer Feedback** (4 minutes, optional):\n   - Display student designs around the room.\n   - Students do a silent gallery walk and use sticky notes to add one compliment or question to each design.\n   - Alternative: Small group presentations (if time allows).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate with guiding questions: \"Why did you put windows there?\" \"How does this feature protect Earth's resources?\" \"Could you add another way to capture solar energy?\"\n- Encourage students to think beyond just heating—solar can power lights, charge batteries, heat water, grow food, etc.\n- Validate creative and practical thinking.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce a labeled design of a solar-powered building.\n- Students write explanations connecting design features to solar energy capture.\n- Students identify at least one real-world example of renewable energy use in a community.\n- Student designs demonstrate understanding that solar design protects Earth's resources.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of solar energy, renewable resources, and community-based solutions to energy needs.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation of group discussions during Explore phase for understanding of heat absorption and insulation.\n- Review of temperature graphs and data recording for accuracy and interpretation.\n- Listen-in during \"turn and talk\" discussions in Explain phase.\n- Examine building design sketches and written explanations for vocabulary use and conceptual understanding.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket / Individual Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with the following prompt (written on a handout or displayed digitally):\n\n**Prompt:**\n\"You are writing a letter to your town council asking them to build solar-powered buildings. Answer these three questions to convince them this is a good idea:\n\n1. **What is a renewable resource? Give an example.** (Based on 5-ESS3-1)\n   \n2. **Describe one way a community can use the sun's energy to protect Earth's resources. Use vocabulary you learned today.** (Based on 5-ESS3-1)\n   \n3. **Draw a simple diagram or describe how your solar box model proved that the sun's energy can be captured. What did the thermometer show?** (Evidence of learning from Explore phase)\n\"\n\n**Alternative Quick Assessment:**\nIf time is limited, use these three questions as an oral exit ticket:\n- \"What is solar energy?\"\n- \"Name one material or design feature that captures solar energy (from the photo or your box).\"\n- \"Why is solar energy better for Earth than using coal or oil?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Proficient Understanding:**\n- Student correctly defines renewable resource and identifies solar energy as one.\n- Student explains at least one community-based application of solar energy.\n- Student uses at least 2-3 vocabulary terms correctly (renewable, solar, thermal energy, sustainable).\n- Student references data or observations from their model to support ideas.\n- Student recognizes the connection between renewable energy and environmental protection.\n\n✓ **Approaching Proficiency:**\n- Student defines renewable resource with minor inaccuracies.\n- Student describes solar energy use but with limited explanation of community benefit.\n- Student uses some vocabulary correctly.\n- Student references the model but with limited detail.\n\n✓ **Below Proficiency:**\n- Student struggles to define renewable resource or confuses it with other resources.\n- Student has minimal understanding of how communities use solar energy.\n- Student does not use vocabulary terms or uses them incorrectly.\n- Student does not connect model observations to broader concepts.\n\n**How to Determine If Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n- Review exit ticket responses for vocabulary accuracy and conceptual understanding (LO1, LO2).\n- Examine building designs and explanations for evidence of design thinking and resource protection awareness (LO3).\n- Assess whether students can support the claim that solar energy is sustainable through their explanations and arguments (LO4).\n- Gather data from formative observations throughout the lesson.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Sheet:** Provide a visual vocabulary guide with pictures and simple definitions of key terms (renewable, solar, thermal energy). Students can refer to this during discussions and when writing exit tickets.\n\n2. **Scaffolded Design Brief:** Instead of a blank sheet, provide a partially completed building design template with blanks to fill in. For example: \"This building has _____ [large windows / solar panels / black walls] because _____.\" Students complete sentences rather than generating designs from scratch.\n\n3. **Partner or Small Group Work:** Pair struggling readers/writers with strong peers during the design phase and exit ticket. Allow verbal responses to be scribed by a partner or teacher, or allow drawing with verbal explanation.\n\n4. **Temperature Data Simplified:** For groups struggling with graphing, provide a pre-made graph template with axes already labeled and only three time points to plot (start, middle, end) instead of recording every two minutes.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-Source Research Project:** Challenge advanced students to research multiple solar technologies (solar panels, solar water heaters, passive solar design) and compare their effectiveness. They might create a comparison chart or presentation on which technology works best in your geographic region.\n\n2. **Engineering Refinement:** Ask: \"How would you improve your solar box design to make it even more efficient? What materials would you change? Why?\" Students can test a second prototype or sketch advanced designs (e.g., reflective surfaces, double-layer plastic for better insulation, adjustable angle to track the sun).\n\n3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Provide information about the cost of installing solar energy in a building versus traditional heating/cooling. Challenge students to calculate how long it takes for a solar system to \"pay for itself\" through energy savings, and create a persuasive infographic or written argument about long-term savings.\n\n4. **Climate and Solar Potential:** Have students research how latitude, seasons, and cloud cover affect solar energy availability in different regions. They might create a map showing which parts of the world are best suited for solar energy and explain why.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **School Solar Audit:** Organize a tour of your school building with a focus on identifying potential places for solar energy use. Students can mark windows that get strong sunlight, south-facing walls, and flat roofs. They create a report with recommendations for where the school could install solar panels or passive solar features, complete with sketches and explanations.\n\n2. **Solar Energy Timeline:** Have students research the history of solar technology development (from ancient sun-drying techniques to modern photovoltaic cells). They create a timeline showing key discoveries and innovations, and write brief explanations of how each innovation helped communities use solar energy better.\n\n3. **Community Spotlight:** Students interview a local business owner, solar installer, or community leader about how their organization uses renewable energy. They prepare 3-4 interview questions in advance, conduct the interview (in person or via video call), and present findings to the class, highlighting what they learned about how communities protect Earth's resources through renewable energy.\n\n4. **Solar Cooker Project:** Students design and build a simple solar cooker using a pizza box, aluminum foil, plastic wrap, and black paper—similar to their original solar box but designed to cook or warm food. They test it with a thermometer or by attempting to warm water, and document results. This deepens understanding of real-world solar applications.\n\n5. **Shadow Length and Sun Position Study:** Connect to 5-ESS1-2 by having students measure and record the length and direction of shadows created by the sun at different times of day and different seasons. They graph this data and make predictions about how the sun's position changes throughout the year—relevant to understanding how to optimize solar panel angles for energy capture.\n\n---\n\n## Community Building Design Brief (Handout for Elaborate Phase)\n\n**Your Challenge:** Design a solar-powered community building that helps your town or school.\n\n**What to Do:**\n1. Decide what your building will be used for (greenhouse, community center, library, pool house, etc.).\n2. Sketch the building on paper. Show at least one side view.\n3. Label THREE features that capture or use solar energy.\n4. For each feature, write 1-2 sentences explaining:\n   - **What is this feature?** (e.g., large south-facing windows)\n   - **How does it use solar energy?** (e.g., lets sunlight in to warm the building)\n   - **How does this help the community or protect Earth?** (e.g., saves electricity and reduces pollution)\n\n**Remember:** Think about the solar box you built and the building in the photograph. What materials and designs worked best?\n\n**Optional:** Find a real example of a solar building online and note:\n- Name and location: _________________________\n- What it does: _________________________\n- One solar feature: _________________________\n\n---\n\nThis lesson plan integrates hands-on experimentation with authentic engineering design, grounding abstract concepts of renewable energy in observable, testable phenomena while building students' understanding of how communities can use science to protect Earth's resources.",
