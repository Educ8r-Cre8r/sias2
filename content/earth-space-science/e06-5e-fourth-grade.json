ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nCapture student curiosity by examining cracked earth and generating questions about why soil changes.\n\n#### Materials\n- Projected image or printed photographs of the cracked earth (e.g., on a smart board or tablet for each group)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Display and Introduce:**\nDisplay the photograph on a large screen or provide printed copies for small groups. Allow 30 seconds of silent observation. Say: *\"Look carefully at this ground. What do you notice? What seems different or unusual about it?\"*\n\n**Discussion Questions (pose one at a time, allow think-pair-share):**\n\n1. *\"What happened to the soil to make it crack into so many puzzle-like pieces?\"*\n2. *\"Do you see any small plants growing in the cracks? Why might they be struggling?\"*\n3. *\"If you touched this soil, what do you think it would feel like—wet, dry, hard, or crumbly?\"*\n4. *\"When was the last time rain fell on this ground? How can you tell from the picture?\"*\n\n**Wonder Prompt:**\n*\"I wonder: If we removed all the water from soil in a cup and let it dry out completely, would the same cracks appear? Let's investigate!\"*\n\n#### Transition\n*\"To answer our wonder, we're going to do an experiment where we compare wet soil to dry soil and watch what happens.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nStudents discover through hands-on investigation how water affects soil, connecting their observations to the photograph.\n\n#### Materials\n- 2 clear plastic cups or containers per student pair\n- Potting soil or garden soil (same amount in each cup)\n- Water\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring crack depth)\n- Paper towels\n- Label stickers or masking tape and markers\n- Shallow tray or newspaper to contain spills\n- Spray bottle with water (optional)\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Setup (2 minutes):**\nOrganize students into pairs. Distribute materials. Say: *\"We're going to set up an experiment to see what happens to soil when it has lots of water versus when it has no water.\"*\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Label your cups:** Write \"Wet Soil\" on one cup and \"Dry Soil\" on the other.\n2. **Fill both cups:** Fill each cup with soil to about 2 inches from the top. Pack it down gently and evenly.\n3. **Add water to Cup 1:** Slowly pour water into the \"Wet Soil\" cup until the soil is thoroughly wet and saturated (water should be visible on the surface). Let it sit for 1 minute, then pour off any excess water.\n4. **Leave Cup 2 alone:** Do not add water to the \"Dry Soil\" cup. Leave it as is.\n5. **Observe and predict:** Before you move forward, predict: *\"Which cup's soil will crack? Draw and label your prediction in your science notebook.\"*\n6. **Place in warm location:** Both cups should be placed in a warm, dry spot (near a window or under a lamp—teacher designates). **Important:** The teacher will place the cups in an incubator, under a heat lamp, or on a sunny windowsill to speed drying (approximately 2–3 hours or overnight, depending on setup).\n7. **Observe over time:** Students return to observe after 1–2 hours and again at the start of the next session. Encourage them to:\n   - Draw the soil surface in both cups daily (or hourly if time allows).\n   - Measure and count cracks if visible.\n   - Describe texture changes (smooth → rough, soft → hard).\n   - Note any plant-like growth (algae may appear in the wet soil).\n\n#### What Students Should Record\n- Initial prediction drawing\n- Daily observation sketches showing crack formation\n- Written descriptions: *\"The dry soil looks... The wet soil looks...\"*\n- Measurements of crack depth or width (if measurable)\n- A **Comparison Chart:**\n\n| Observation | Wet Soil Cup | Dry Soil Cup |\n|---|---|---|\n| Day 1 Surface | | |\n| Day 2 Surface | | |\n| Cracks? (Yes/No) | | |\n| Texture | | |\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions without revealing outcomes: *\"What do you predict will happen next?\" \"Which soil looks more like the cracked earth in the photograph?\"*\n- Ensure both cups are exposed to similar warm, dry conditions (but do not force drying—natural evaporation is ideal for understanding; use gentle heat only if time is limited).\n- Prompt students to touch the soil gently and describe texture changes daily.\n- Do **not** explain why cracking happens—let students observe and wonder.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students observe that the **dry soil cracks** as it shrinks, while wet soil remains intact.\n- Students recognize visible cracks after 3–6 hours of drying (depending on soil type and heat).\n- Students connect their observations to the photograph: *\"Our dry soil looks like the ground in the picture!\"*\n- Student observation sheets show clear before/after comparisons.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nIntroduce formal vocabulary and connect student discoveries to broader Earth science concepts of weathering and drought.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- The original cracked-earth photograph (printed or projected)\n- Optional: 1–2 additional photographs of real drought-affected areas (e.g., dried lake beds, cracked farmland)\n- Student science notebooks\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Share-Out (5 minutes):**\nInvite 2–3 student pairs to share their observations. Ask: *\"What was the biggest difference between your wet and dry soil cups?\" \"Which one reminds you of the photograph?\"* Record key observations on chart paper.\n\n**Teacher-Led Explanation (10 minutes):**\nUse the student observations to introduce concepts. Frame it around the question: *\"Why does soil crack, and what does this tell us about Earth?\"*\n\n**Key Points to Explain:**\n\n1. **Soil Contains Water:** Soil in the ground naturally holds water like a sponge. When there is plenty of rain, soil stays moist and flexible.\n\n2. **Drought = No Rain:** A **drought** is a long period with very little rain. Without water, soil begins to dry out.\n\n3. **Drying Causes Shrinking:** As water leaves the soil, the particles squeeze closer together and the soil shrinks. This squeezing creates cracks—we call this **physical weathering** (a process that breaks earth materials into smaller pieces without changing what they are made of).\n\n4. **This Affects Life:** Plants need water in soil to survive. When soil cracks from drought, it becomes hard and difficult for roots to grow through. You saw in our photograph that only a few struggling plants could grow in those cracks.\n\n**Vocabulary Introduction:**\n\nCreate a **Vocabulary Anchor Chart** on chart paper and leave it posted for reference:\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition | Example from Our Lesson |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Weathering** | The slow breaking down of rocks and soil into smaller pieces by natural forces like water, wind, and temperature changes. | Our dry soil broke and cracked as it dried. |\n| **Drought** | A long period of time with very little rain, causing the ground and water sources to dry out. | The cracked earth in the photograph happened because no rain fell for a long time. |\n| **Erosion** | The wearing away and moving of soil and rock by wind, water, or ice. | When soil cracks, wind can carry away the loose pieces. |\n| **Natural Resources** | Materials from Earth that people and plants need to survive, such as water, soil, and plants. | Soil is a natural resource; drought damages it. |\n| **Soil Shrinking** | The process where soil becomes smaller and tighter as the water in it evaporates (turns into water vapor and floats away). | We saw our soil shrink and crack as it dried out. |\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\nAsk these questions and listen for accurate responses:\n- *\"Why did the soil in our experiment crack?\"* (It dried out and shrank.)\n- *\"What is a drought?\"* (A long time with no rain.)\n- *\"Can plants grow easily in cracked, dry soil? Why or why not?\"* (No, their roots can't break through the hard cracks.)\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students can define **weathering** and **drought** in their own words.\n- Students understand the cause-and-effect relationship: *No water → soil shrinks → cracks form.*\n- Students can point to the photograph and explain why cracks appear and why plants struggle.\n- Students use new vocabulary when discussing their observations.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n#### Objective\nApply understanding to a real-world scenario by generating and comparing solutions to help people and plants survive drought.\n\n#### Materials\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Images of drought solutions (printed or projected): drip irrigation, mulch, rain barrels, drought-resistant plants, artificial watering systems\n- Student handout: **\"Solutions to Drought\" worksheet** (see template below)\n- Optional: small samples of mulch, drought-resistant plant seeds, or pictures of these\n\n#### Activity\n\n**Scenario Presentation (2 minutes):**\nShow students an image of a drought-affected farm, garden, or community. Say: *\"Imagine you're a farmer or gardener, and a long drought is coming. Your soil is already starting to crack, and your plants are struggling. You need to find solutions to help your soil and plants survive without much rain. What could you do?\"*\n\n**Solution Brainstorm & Research (8 minutes):**\nOrganize students into small groups of 3–4. Assign each group one of these solutions to investigate:\n1. **Mulch (wood chips, straw):** A layer of material on soil that keeps it moist and reduces cracking.\n2. **Drip Irrigation:** Slowly watering plants with tubes so water soaks deep into soil rather than running off.\n3. **Drought-Resistant Plants:** Plants that need very little water and can survive in dry conditions.\n4. **Rain Barrels:** Containers that collect and store rain to use during dry times.\n5. **Deep Watering:** Watering less often but deeply, so water reaches deep roots.\n\nProvide each group with a brief description or image. Ask: *\"How does your solution help soil and plants during a drought?\"*\n\n**Comparison & Presentation (5 minutes):**\nGroups share their solutions (30–60 seconds each). Create a class **Solutions Chart** on poster paper:\n\n| Solution | How It Helps Soil | How It Helps Plants | Pros | Cons |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Mulch** | Keeps soil moist; prevents cracking | Roots stay in wet soil | Easy to apply | Must be replaced |\n| **Drip Irrigation** | Water reaches deep roots; reduces surface evaporation | Deep watering strengthens roots | Very effective | Expensive to set up |\n| (etc.) | | | | |\n\n**Vote & Reflect (5 minutes):**\nAsk: *\"Which solution could YOU use at home or in a school garden to prepare for drought? Why?\" \"Could we use more than one solution at the same time?\"* (Yes!) Encourage students to think about combinations.\n\n#### Teacher Role\n- Facilitate small-group discussions; ensure all students contribute ideas.\n- Guide groups to explain **why** their solution works (connect to weathering and water concepts).\n- Validate all ideas; highlight trade-offs (cost, effort, effectiveness).\n- Encourage students to think like problem-solvers: *\"What would be the easiest solution? The cheapest? The most effective?\"*\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\n- Students can explain 2–3 drought solutions and how each one helps soil or plants.\n- Students make connections: *\"Mulch keeps soil wet, so it won't crack like in the photo.\"*\n- Students propose combining solutions for better results.\n- Students consider trade-offs and real-world constraints (cost, accessibility).\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n#### Objective\nAssess student understanding of weathering, drought, soil changes, and drought solutions.\n\n#### Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson)\n- **Observation Checklist:** During Explore and Elaborate phases, note whether students:\n  - Accurately describe changes in soil texture and appearance\n  - Use vocabulary (weathering, drought, shrinking) appropriately\n  - Make connections between their experiment and the photograph\n  - Contribute ideas during group discussions\n  \n- **Exit Ticket (End of Lesson):** Distribute a card or digital form with three prompts:\n\n  **Exit Ticket: \"Drought and Cracking Earth\"**\n  \n  1. *\"Draw or describe: Why does soil crack when there is no rain?\"*\n  2. *\"Fill in the blank: A _____ is a long time with very little rain.\"* (Answer: drought)\n  3. *\"Name one way you could help soil and plants survive a drought.\"*\n\n#### Summative Assessment\n\n**Option A: Written Response**\nStudents complete a **1-page \"Weathering and Drought\" worksheet:**\n\n> **Name:** _________________ **Date:** _________________\n>\n> **Weathering and Drought**\n>\n> 1. Look at the photograph of cracked earth. **Explain what caused the soil to crack. Use the word \"water\" in your answer.**\n>\n> 2. **Compare** the soil in your wet cup to the soil in your dry cup. How were they different?\n>\n> 3. **Define weathering** in your own words. Give an example from the lesson.\n>\n> 4. **Drought is a natural Earth process.** How does drought affect: \n>    - The soil? \n>    - The plants?\n>\n> 5. **Propose a solution:** If you were a farmer and a drought was coming, what would you do to protect your soil and crops? Why would that work?\n\n**Option B: Oral Assessment / Conference**\nTeacher meets one-on-one or in small groups and asks:\n- *\"Tell me about what happened in your soil cups. Why do you think that happened?\"*\n- *\"What is weathering?\"*\n- *\"Why is drought bad for farming and gardening?\"*\n- *\"How could we solve the problem of drought?\"*\n\nStudent responses should demonstrate understanding of:\n- Cause and effect (no water → soil shrinks → cracks)\n- Vocabulary (weathering, drought)\n- Real-world application (solutions to drought)\n\n#### Success Criteria\nStudents demonstrate mastery if they:\n\n- ✓ Correctly explain that **lack of water causes soil to shrink and crack** (physical weathering).\n- ✓ Define **drought** as a long period with little rain.\n- ✓ Describe how their experimental soil changes matched the photograph.\n- ✓ Propose at least **one realistic solution** to protect soil or plants during drought.\n- ✓ Use scientific vocabulary (weathering, drought, erosion, natural resources) appropriately in writing or speech.\n\n#### Expected Student Outcomes\nMost Fourth Grade students should:\n- Accurately connect their experiment to the photograph and explain cracking.\n- Understand the role of water in soil health and plant growth.\n- Propose 1–2 reasonable drought solutions with basic reasoning.\n- Use new vocabulary with 80% accuracy in speaking and writing.\n\nStudents exceeding expectations will:\n- Explain multiple contributing factors to weathering (temperature, wind, water).\n- Propose 3+ interconnected solutions and discuss trade-offs.\n- Make links to broader Earth systems (water cycle, erosion, conservation).\n\nStudents needing support may:\n- Focus on simpler cause-and-effect (no water = cracks) without full erosion vocabulary.\n- Require visuals or teacher models when proposing solutions.\n- Use sentence frames for written responses.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Chart:** Create a picture-based vocabulary chart with drawings of drought, cracked soil, and weathering. Pair each term with a simple, concrete sentence. Allow students to reference it during discussions and writing.\n   - Example: *\"**Drought** = No rain for a long time. **Weathering** = Soil breaks into pieces.\"*\n\n2. **Structured Observation Sheet:** Provide a pre-drawn chart for Explore phase so students only need to draw or write short labels instead of free-form note-taking.\n   - Template: *\"What I see today:\" [box to draw], *\"What changed:\" [sentence starter] \"The soil became...\"*\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Elaboration:** Provide sentence starters for group discussions and exit tickets:\n   - *\"The soil cracked because...\"*\n   - *\"We could help plants by...\"*\n   - *\"I think ___ would work because...\"*\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Weathering Rate Investigation:** Ask: *\"If we added different amounts of water to two dry soil samples, would one crack faster than the other? Design and carry out a mini-experiment.\"* Students predict, test, measure, and analyze data about the relationship between moisture level and crack formation rate.\n\n2. **Drought Cycle Research:** Provide access to maps showing current or historical droughts. Ask: *\"Where do droughts happen? Why? How long do they last? What happens to people and ecosystems?\"* Students research a real drought and present findings to the class, connecting to the 4-ESS3-2 standard about reducing impacts on humans.\n\n3. **Erosion Prevention Engineering:** Challenge: *\"Your cracked soil is now vulnerable to wind and water erosion. Design a structure or system (using classroom materials) that prevents loose soil from blowing or washing away while a solution grows new plants.\"* Students sketch plans, build prototypes, and test them with a hair dryer (wind) or spray bottle (water).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Water Cycle Connection:** Extend learning to precipitation and evaporation by creating a sealed water cycle in a plastic bag or bottle. Ask: *\"Where does the water in soil go when it evaporates? Can we trap and observe it?\"* Students observe condensation forming inside a sealed bag and connect it to the hydrologic cycle and drought.\n\n2. **Create a School Rain Garden:** As a class project, designate a garden bed or container and design a rain garden using drought-resistant plants, mulch, and a rain barrel (or bucket). Throughout the year, students monitor soil moisture, plant health, and water conservation. This applies solutions from the Elaborate phase to a real, ongoing context.\n\n3. **Drought Impact Interview or Letter:** Have students research how a recent drought affected a specific region (e.g., California's drought, Dust Bowl). Students either:\n   - Interview a farmer, gardener, or community member (video, phone, or email) about drought effects and solutions.\n   - Write a letter to a farmer offering drought solutions based on what they learned.\n   This extends understanding to human impacts and solutions (4-ESS3-2).\n\n4. **Soil Quality and Erosion Comparison:** Set up a follow-up experiment comparing how easily water carries away soil from cracked, dry earth versus soil with mulch and vegetation. Students build a simple erosion model on a slope and observe differences, strengthening understanding of weathering, erosion, and prevention strategies (4-ESS2-1).\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teacher Implementation\n\n- **Timing Flexibility:** The Explore phase requires **overnight or 2–3 hour drying time**. Plan accordingly by setting up cups mid-week so observations can be made the following day. Alternatively, use a heat lamp to accelerate drying if time is limited.\n- **Soil Type Matters:** Potting soil dries and cracks more dramatically than sandy soil; clay-heavy soil may crack more slowly. Mention this variation to students as an observation about **how different materials respond differently to weathering**.\n- **Real-World Connection:** Consider timing this lesson around local weather patterns. If your region is experiencing drought or has experienced it recently, connect the photograph to your own landscape and community discussions.\n- **Safety:** Ensure soil cups are placed on stable, flat surfaces away from edges. If using heat lamps, supervise and follow electrical safety protocols.\n- **Engagement Hook:** Show time-lapse video of soil drying (2–3 minutes) if available online to accelerate observation and maintain student interest.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson fulfills **4-ESS2-1** (weathering effects) through direct observation and measurement of soil changes, and **4-ESS3-2** (natural Earth processes and human solutions) by generating and comparing drought solutions. The 5E model ensures students discover concepts through exploration before formalizing vocabulary, building deep, lasting understanding appropriate for Fourth Grade.",
