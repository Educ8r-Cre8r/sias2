The feathery, fluffy seed heads are wet from morning dew, and each drop catches the light. The grasses have long, thin blades and soft, fuzzy flower clusters that spread out like tiny fireworks.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe **Anchoring Phenomenon** is dew formation on plant surfaces. This occurs when water vapor in the air condenses into liquid droplets on cool surfaces during nighttime hours. As temperatures drop after sunset, the air becomes saturated with water vapor and can no longer hold all the moisture. The grass surfaces act as condensation points where invisible water vapor transforms back into visible liquid water droplets, creating the beautiful dewdrops we observe in early morning.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Water Cycle Processes**: Dew formation demonstrates condensation, one of the key processes in Earth's water cycle where water vapor changes back to liquid form.\n\n2. **States of Matter**: The image shows water in its liquid state after transitioning from its gaseous state (water vapor) in the air.\n\n3. **Plant Adaptations**: The feathery structure of ornamental grass seed heads maximizes surface area for collecting moisture from the air.\n\n4. **Temperature and Weather Patterns**: Dew formation requires specific temperature and humidity conditions, typically occurring on clear, calm nights when surfaces cool rapidly.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use this image as a \"Notice and Wonder\" activity starter. Have students spend 2-3 minutes silently observing before sharing what they notice and what questions they have. This builds observation skills and generates authentic student-driven inquiry.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide magnifying glasses for students who need closer visual examination, and consider having students use their sense of touch (safely) to feel dewdrops on grass outside. Create vocabulary cards with both words and images to support diverse learners.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n**Zoom In:** At the molecular level, individual water molecules are slowing down as they cool and forming hydrogen bonds with each other, clustering together to create liquid droplets. The grass surface provides nucleation sites where these molecules can gather and form visible drops.\n\n**Zoom Out:** This dew formation is part of Earth's global water cycle, contributing to local ecosystem water availability. Plants can absorb some of this moisture through their leaves, and as the sun rises, these droplets will evaporate back into the atmosphere, continuing the endless circulation of water around our planet.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: Plants \"sweat\" out the water droplets like humans do.\n   **Clarification**: The water comes from the air around the plant, not from inside the plant. The plant surface just provides a cool place for water vapor to condense.\n\n2. **Misconception**: Dew only forms when it rains.\n   **Clarification**: Dew forms from water vapor already in the air, even on clear nights without any precipitation.\n\n3. **Misconception**: All the droplets are the same size because they formed at the same time.\n   **Clarification**: Droplet size varies based on surface texture, angle, and local air movement, even when forming simultaneously.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation**: 5-ESS2-1 - Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:5-ESS2.A]] - Earth's major systems interact through physical and chemical processes\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]] - A system can be described in terms of its components and their interactions\n- **Science and Engineering Practices**: Developing and using models to describe natural phenomena\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1.
