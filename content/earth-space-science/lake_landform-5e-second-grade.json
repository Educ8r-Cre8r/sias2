ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about how water changes land by examining the photograph closely.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected image of the lake with fallen tree\n- Anchor chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or screen. Ask students to sit in a circle where they can all see clearly.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause after each for student responses):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is the water? What is the land?\"\n   - \"Why do you think that big tree fell into the water? What might have pushed it or knocked it over?\"\n   - \"How do you think the tree got from standing on the land to being in the water?\"\n   - \"If we came back to see this lake one year from now, what might be different?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder if water can move things and change the shape of the land. Let's find out if that's true!\"\n\n4. **Record student ideas** on anchor chart: \"What we think water can do to land.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to do an experiment to see if water really can change and move things, just like it might have moved that tree into the lake.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how water erosion shapes land through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- Aluminum foil pans or shallow plastic trays\n- Dry sand (enough to fill pans halfway)\n- Small rocks, pebbles, or twigs\n- Spray bottles filled with water\n- Paper towels\n- Pencils or craft sticks\n- Small cups for pouring water\n- Clipboards and observation recording sheets (with pictures and lines for writing)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Set up stations** with materials at each table. Divide the class into groups.\n\n2. **Give clear directions:**\n   - \"You are going to build a pretend landscape using sand, rocks, and sticks. Make it look like a shore next to a lake.\"\n   - \"Arrange your sand to make hills or flat areas. Add rocks and sticks to your landscape.\"\n   - \"Draw or sketch your landscape before you add water.\"\n\n3. **Water exploration (the key phase):**\n   - \"Now, you're going to make water act on your landscape. You can use the spray bottle or pour water slowly onto your sand.\"\n   - \"Watch what happens to the sand, rocks, and sticks. Does the water move them? Does it change the shape of the land?\"\n   - \"Try pouring water in different places. Does more water cause bigger changes?\"\n\n4. **Student recording:**\n   - Students draw or write on observation sheets: \"What changed?\" \"What stayed the same?\" \"Where did the water go?\"\n   - Encourage drawings with labels or simple sentences.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice happening to the sand? Where is the water going? Is this a fast change or a slow change?\"\n- Avoid telling students what will happen; let them discover the movement and erosion.\n- Provide additional water or materials as needed.\n- Help students make connections: \"Remember the tree in the lake picture? Could water cause changes like this to real land too?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe sand moving, spreading, or washing away when water is applied.\n- Students recognize that water can move materials and change shapes.\n- Students record observations through drawings or simple written descriptions.\n- Students begin to see that more water = faster changes.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formalize understanding of water erosion and landform change.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart from Engage phase\n- Photograph of lake\n- Picture cards showing fast vs. slow Earth changes (optional: printable images of erosion, flooding, weathered rocks, slow rock breakdown)\n- Vocabulary chart or poster board\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share what they observed: \"What changed in your landscape? How did water make the change?\"\n   - Listen for student descriptions and repeat back with scientific language.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Write each term on chart as you define it using student-friendly language:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Erosion** | When water, wind, or ice wears away and moves land, rocks, or soil bit by bit. |\n| **Landform** | A natural shape of land, like a hill, mountain, valley, or shoreline. |\n| **Fast change** | Something that happens quickly, like water pouring down and moving sand right away. |\n| **Slow change** | Something that takes a very long time to happen, like rocks getting smoother over many, many years. |\n| **Water** | A liquid that flows and can change the shape of land. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the fallen tree: \"This tree might have fallen because of erosion—water and wind wearing away the land where the tree's roots were.\"\n   - Point to the shoreline: \"The sandy beach we see here might have formed over a long time as water slowly wore away rocks.\"\n   - Point to trees still standing: \"These trees are still standing now, but water is always slowly changing the land around them.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Can you point to a place in the picture where erosion might be happening?\" or \"Is erosion a fast change or a slow change? How do you know?\"\n   - Listen for students to connect erosion to water movement.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the word \"erosion\" correctly in a sentence.\n- Students can identify that water causes changes to land.\n- Students distinguish between fast changes (their experiment) and slow changes (the photograph).\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply erosion concepts to solve a real-world problem using materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Aluminum foil pans or trays\n- Sand\n- Water and spray bottles\n- Small barriers made from craft sticks, popsicle sticks, or plastic pieces\n- Small cardboard strips or foam pieces\n- Rocks\n- Clipboards and solution planning sheets\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the problem (3 minutes):**\n   - \"Imagine this is a beach next to a town. Heavy rain and water from storms are washing away the beach. The people in town want to keep their beach. They need OUR help!\"\n   - \"Can you design something that will slow down or stop water from washing away the sand?\"\n\n2. **Design and test (12 minutes):**\n   - Students work in pairs to:\n     - Build a new sand landscape in their pan with a \"beach\" area.\n     - Place barriers (sticks, rocks, cardboard) in the landscape to try to protect the sand.\n     - Pour or spray water onto the landscape to test their solution.\n     - Observe: \"Did your barrier slow down or stop the water? Did it protect the sand?\"\n     - Modify and test again if time allows.\n\n3. **Documentation:**\n   - Students sketch their barrier design and write or dictate: \"My barrier slowed the water because...\" or \"My barrier didn't work because...\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask: \"Why do you think that barrier might work?\" and \"What could you change to make it better?\"\n- Validate all attempts as learning (successful barriers and unsuccessful ones teach important lessons).\n- Encourage students to observe and adjust their designs.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students design and build a barrier to test.\n- Students observe whether their solution slows water movement.\n- Students begin to understand real-world applications of erosion control (dikes, seawalls, sand barriers).\n- Students articulate reasoning: \"Rocks slow water down because...\"\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of erosion, landforms, water changes, and solutions.\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lessons):**\n- **Observation during Explore:** Watch for students who understand that water moves sand/materials. Note which students need support with this core concept.\n- **Listen during Explain share-out:** Do students use the word \"erosion\" correctly? Can they connect the photo to their experiment?\n- **Observe during Elaborate:** Can students apply the concept to a new problem? Do they test and adjust their designs?\n\n**Summative Assessment—Exit Ticket (end of Lesson 2):**\n\nProvide students with a simple exit ticket with 1-2 questions (with pictures for support):\n\n1. **Picture prompt:** Show a picture of a hillside or shoreline with water nearby. Ask:\n   - \"What is water doing to this land? Draw or write your answer.\"\n   - **Success criteria:** Student identifies erosion, water movement, or land change. Accepts drawings with labels.\n\n2. **Application question:**\n   - \"If you wanted to keep sand from washing into a river, what would you build? Draw and label your idea.\"\n   - **Success criteria:** Student suggests a barrier, wall, or object that would slow water (e.g., rocks, sticks, fence).\n\n**Alternate Assessment (if preferred):**\n- **Quick oral check:** Ask individual students: \"Show me in the picture where water is changing the land. What is happening there?\"\n- **Rubric for observational drawings:** Student drawings show evidence of understanding water's effect (moving materials, changing shape) with or without labels.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that water erodes and changes landforms.\n- Students distinguish between the photograph (slow changes over time) and their experiment (faster observable changes).\n- Students apply erosion concepts to design a protective solution.\n- Students use domain vocabulary appropriately (water, erosion, fast change, slow change, landform).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for students who need help):**\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use only \"water changes the land\" instead of \"erosion\" if needed. Introduce \"erosion\" later when the concept is solid.\n\n2. **Guided exploration:** Work with a small group during Explore. Guide their predictions: \"Let's pour water on this sandy spot. What do you think will happen?\" Then observe together before independent recording.\n\n3. **Visual recording:** Allow students who struggle with writing to only draw their observations, or provide sentence frames:\n   - \"When water was added, the _____ moved.\"\n   - \"The water made a change to the _____.\"\n\n4. **Barrier design scaffold:** Provide pre-made barrier options (sticks, rocks, cardboard) and ask: \"Which one do you think will work best? Let's test it.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Fast vs. Slow changes deep dive:** Ask: \"Can you make a barrier that slows down water a LOT vs. a LITTLE? What's the difference?\" Push them to quantify or compare rates of erosion.\n\n2. **Real-world research:** Have students research and present one example of erosion prevention in their community (seawalls, levees, sand barriers) using pictures or a short video clip.\n\n3. **Predict and explain:** \"What would happen if we poured water from higher up?\" or \"What if we used more sand?\" Have them predict, test, and explain results.\n\n4. **Multi-step design challenge:** Challenge them to design a barrier that protects the sand AND allows some water through (like a beach has natural drainage). Test and refine.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Nature walk erosion hunt:** Take students on a short walk near the school to look for evidence of water erosion (worn paths, exposed tree roots, washed-out areas, water channels). Take photos and create a classroom poster: \"Erosion Near Our School.\"\n\n2. **Story or book creation:** Students create a simple picture book or comic strip titled \"How Water Shapes Our Land.\" Each page shows one way water changes or moves things (flowing downhill, wearing rocks smooth, moving sand, etc.). Encourage 3-4 pages with drawings and simple captions.\n\n3. **Seasonal change observation:** Take a class photo at the same location (like a schoolyard spot with a slope or drainage area) every two weeks for a month. Compare photos to show slow changes over time. Create a \"then and now\" display showing how water, weather, and seasons change the land.\n\n4. **Barrier design engineering challenge:** Provide a variety of craft materials (straws, popsicle sticks, foam, clay, stones) and challenge students to design the BEST barrier to stop erosion. Host a \"design fair\" where groups test barriers and present results to the class.\n\n---",
