You can see white snowflakes actively falling from the sky, covering the ground, roof, and trees in a winter weather event. This is a perfect example of **precipitation**—water falling from clouds to Earth's surface.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n**Anchoring Phenomenon:** Active snowfall (frozen precipitation occurring in real time)\n\n**Why It's Happening:**\nSnow forms when water vapor in clouds freezes into ice crystals because the air temperature is below 32°F (0°C). As these ice crystals grow larger and heavier, they fall to Earth as snowflakes. This is part of the **water cycle**—a continuous process where water evaporates, forms clouds, and returns to Earth as precipitation.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n* **The Water Cycle:** Water moves between Earth's surface and atmosphere through evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. Snow is one form of precipitation.\n\n* **States of Matter and Temperature:** Water can exist as a solid (ice/snow), liquid (rain), or gas (water vapor). Temperature determines which state water is in.\n\n* **Weather Patterns and Precipitation Types:** Different types of precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, hail) form under different atmospheric conditions. Snow occurs when it's cold enough for water droplets to freeze.\n\n* **Cloud Formation:** Clouds form when water vapor condenses around tiny particles in the air. Different cloud types produce different types of precipitation.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>\nFourth graders benefit from **concrete, observable examples**. Use this snowy image to anchor abstract water cycle concepts. Ask students to trace a water molecule's journey: \"If that snowflake melts, where does the water go?\" This helps them see the cycle as continuous and connected to their world.\n</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>\nTo support diverse learners: (1) Provide **visual water cycle diagrams** alongside the photo for students who need visual scaffolding; (2) Allow students to **draw or label** the water cycle stages rather than write; (3) Offer **tactile experiences** like handling ice cubes or observing water evaporation in sealed bags to engage kinesthetic learners; (4) Use **multiple representations**—photos, diagrams, and real objects—to make the concept accessible to all learners.\n</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:**\n4-ESS2-1: Make observations and measurements to provide evidence of the effects of weathering or the rate of erosion by water, ice, wind, or vegetation.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-ESS2.A]] Earth's materials are made from minerals and rocks. Different kinds of rocks form from different processes.\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-ESS3.B]] Natural hazards are processes or events in the physical environment that humans find inconvenient, damaging, or fatal.\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] Weather patterns repeat in predictable ways; snow is more common in winter.\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect]] Cold temperatures cause water vapor to condense and freeze into snow.\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]] The water cycle is a system where water continuously moves between Earth and atmosphere.\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. **\"What do you think happens to all this snow when spring arrives and the weather gets warmer?\"** (Bloom's: Understand | DOK: 1)\n\n2. **\"Why do you think snow falls in winter but rain falls in other seasons? What's different about the air?\"** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n3. **\"If you traced one snowflake from the moment it forms in a cloud until it melts in spring, what journey would it take?\"** (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. **\"How might this snowy weather affect the plants and animals shown in the picture over the next few months?\"** (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n## 📖 Vocabulary\n\n* **Precipitation:** Water that falls from clouds to Earth in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n* **Snowflake:** A single crystal of ice that forms when water vapor freezes in cold clouds.\n\n* **Condensation:** The process where water vapor (a gas) cools and turns into liquid water droplets or ice crystals.\n\n* **Evaporation:** The process where liquid water turns into water vapor and rises into the atmosphere.\n\n* **Freezing Point:** The temperature (32°F or 0°C) at which water turns from a liquid into a solid (ice).\n\n* **Weather:** The condition of the atmosphere at a specific place and time, including temperature, precipitation, and wind.\n\n## 🌡️ Extension Activities\n\n1. **Snowflake Study:** If snow is available, collect fresh snowflakes on dark paper or cloth and observe them with magnifying glasses. Compare different snowflakes and discuss why each one has a unique pattern. Connect to the idea that ice crystals form in different shapes based on temperature and humidity conditions.\n\n2. **Water Cycle in a Bag:** Create a mini water cycle experiment by placing water in a sealed plastic bag, taping it to a sunny window, and observing evaporation and condensation over several days. Have students draw and label what they observe, connecting it to the snowfall phenomenon in the photo.\n\n3. **Snow Measurement and Prediction:** If snow falls during the school year, have students measure snowfall daily using a ruler or snow gauge. Create a graph to track accumulation over time and make predictions about when snow might melt based on temperature forecasts. This connects to weather patterns and data collection.\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- *The Snowy Day* by Ezra Jack Keats — A classic picture book showing a child's winter adventure and how snow changes the landscape\n- *Snow* by Manya Stojic — A picture book that explores snow and winter from multiple perspectives\n- *Come On, Rain!* by Karen Hesse — While focused on rain, this book beautifully illustrates precipitation and the water cycle in poetic language\n\n**YouTube Videos:**\n- **\"The Water Cycle for Kids\"** by National Geographic Kids — A clear, animated explanation of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation (approximately 3 minutes).
