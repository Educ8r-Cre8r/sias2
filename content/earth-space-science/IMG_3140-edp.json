  "content": "# NGSS Engineering Design Challenge\n\n## Visible Elements in Photo\n- Sandy beach with shells, seaweed, and debris scattered across the shoreline\n- Ocean waves with active water movement and foam\n- Multiple people wading and swimming in the water\n- Seabirds (gulls) standing on the beach\n- Tall residential buildings visible in the hazy distance\n- Hazy air quality (reduced visibility of background structures)\n\n## Reasonable Inferences\n1. **From scattered debris and seaweed**: The beach receives regular water movement and sediment transport; shorelines naturally collect materials that could be organized or managed.\n2. **From active waves and people in water**: Ocean waves create dynamic forces and currents that pose both opportunities and challenges for beach safety and structures.\n3. **From seabirds on beach**: Wildlife relies on the beach environment for food and shelter, suggesting the shoreline is an ecosystem that human activity may impact.\n\n## Engineering Task\n\n### **K-2 Version**\n**\"Design a Safe Beach Spot\"**\n\nImagine you're helping people stay safe and comfortable at the beach. Build a small area using sand, pebbles, and sticks where visitors can rest without getting wet from the waves. Your design should:\n- Keep people dry from splashing water\n- Be strong enough so the waves don't wash it away\n- Have a space inside where people can sit\n\nTry different ways to arrange your materials. What works best?\n\n---\n\n### **3-5 Version**\n**\"Engineer a Coastal Protection Barrier\"**\n\nDesign and build a small-scale barrier structure that reduces wave energy and protects a designated \"visitor zone\" on a sandy beach or in a sand table. Your barrier must:\n- Be constructed from natural or recyclable materials (sand, clay, wood pieces, stones, or cardboard)\n- Reduce water flow or wave splash by at least 50% (measured by how far water travels past the barrier)\n- Remain stable when tested with moving water (simulate waves with a spray bottle or gentle water pour)\n- Be no taller than 15 cm and fit within a 30 cm × 30 cm footprint\n\nMeasure the distance water travels with and without your barrier. Which design shape works best—curved, straight, or angled?\n\n## EDP Phase Targeted\n\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis phase fits because the photo shows a natural coastal environment with visible human activity, debris management challenges, and wave dynamics. Students first need to *identify* what problem exists (How do we protect the beach? How do we manage erosion? How do we keep visitors safe?), then design solutions—rather than jumping straight to building from a given solution idea.\n\n## Suggested Materials\n\n1. **Sand** (play sand or beach sand in a sand table or bin)\n2. **Small rocks, pebbles, and shells** (from the beach or collected by students)\n3. **Sticks, twigs, or craft wood pieces** (for structural framing)\n4. **Water source** (spray bottle, watering can, or small pitcher for testing)\n5. **Cardboard tubes or plastic barriers** (optional, for reinforcement in K-2)\n6. **Measuring tape or ruler** (for 3-5 to document wave reduction)\n\n## Estimated Time\n\n- **K-2**: 30–45 minutes (design, build, test with water splash)\n- **3-5**: 45–60 minutes (design, build, measure baseline, test, iterate, document results)\n\n## Why This Works for Teachers\n\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.B** (*Develop a Simple Sketch, Drawing, or Physical Model*) and **ETS1.A** (*Asking questions, defining a problem*) by grounding the engineering challenge in a real-world coastal environment where students observe natural forces and design human solutions to protect or manage a shoreline.",
