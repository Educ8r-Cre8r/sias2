Identify what a fossil is and explain what information it tells us about Earth's past.\n2. Use evidence from fossils and rocks to describe how landscapes and organisms change over time.\n3. Observe and describe how rocks are weathered and broken down into different sizes and shapes.\n4. Communicate their observations about fossils using scientific vocabulary and detailed descriptions.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph of the fossil.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed photograph (fossil03.jpeg) or digital display (projector/screen)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Do not provide context yet.\n\n2. **Direct students to look silently for 30 seconds,** then ask them to turn to a partner and describe what they see without naming it.\n\n3. **Ask these discussion questions** (pause after each for 2-3 student responses):\n   - \"What do you see in the center of this rock? Can you describe its shape in detail.\"\n   - \"Why do you think this shape is preserved in the rock? How did it get there?\"\n   - \"If you found this rock, what questions would you want to ask about it?\"\n   - \"Do you think this object is still alive today, or do you think it lived a long time ago? Why?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today, we're going to discover what this rock is hiding and how it tells us a story about Earth's past. What do you wonder about how this got trapped in stone?\"\n\n5. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper to revisit at the end.\n\n**Transition:** Now let's become rock detectives and explore how fossils form and what they can teach us.\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how objects can be preserved in materials and observe evidence of weathering in rocks.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small basin or shallow container per group (4-5 students)\n- Plaster of Paris or air-dry clay (pre-mixed, enough for 2-3 cups per group)\n- Small objects to \"fossilize\": shells, leaves, pasta shapes, toy small bones, or imprints of hands\n- Water\n- Spoons for mixing\n- Paper plates or trays\n- Rock collection samples (various sizes, shapes, colors) — 10-15 rocks per group\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses\n- Paper towels\n- **Safety Note:** Apron or old t-shirt for each student\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Making a Fossil Model** (12 minutes)\n1. Distribute plaster of Paris mixture and a paper plate to each group.\n2. Instruct students: \"Press your chosen object gently into the plaster to create an imprint. Hold it for 10 seconds, then carefully remove it. You've created a fossil cast!\"\n3. **While plaster dries**, students observe the object they \"fossilized\" and predict what a scientist would learn about that organism if they only found the fossil, not the living thing.\n4. **Document:** Have students sketch or photograph their \"fossil\" on their observation sheet and write: \"This fossil tells us that ___________.\"\n\n**Part B: Investigating Weathered Rocks** (8 minutes)\n1. Display the rock collection. Give each group 5-6 different rocks.\n2. Instruct students: \"Examine each rock carefully. Look for cracks, rough edges, smooth surfaces, and different colors. Use your hand lens. What do you notice about how different rocks look?\"\n3. Ask: \"Which rocks look like they've been broken apart? Which look smooth? Why do you think rocks look different?\"\n4. **Document:** Students sort rocks into categories (smooth, rough, cracked, colorful) and draw pictures of 2-3 rocks with labels.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the texture of this rock?\" \"How might a rock like this have become so smooth?\"\n- Do NOT explain weathering yet—let students observe and wonder.\n- Ensure all students touch and examine rocks; use hand lenses to deepen observation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a simple fossil model and recognize that impressions can preserve information about objects.\n- Students observe that rocks have different textures, sizes, and colors due to weathering and natural processes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to fossil and weathering concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Printed photographs of various fossils (optional, for reference)\n- The original fossil photograph (fossil03.jpeg)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out** (5 minutes)\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share what their \"fossil\" imprints looked like and what they learned.\n   - Display some plaster fossils for the class to see.\n   - Ask: \"Even though we can't see the actual shell/leaf/bone in the plaster, what can we figure out about it?\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary** (7 minutes)\n   - Write each term on chart paper as you explain. Use the fossil photograph to point out examples.\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n\n   - **Fossil:** The hardened remains or impressions of a living thing that died long ago and was buried in rock. Fossils show us what life was like in Earth's past.\n   - **Preserved:** Kept or protected so it doesn't decay or disappear. Fossils are preserved in rock.\n   - **Weathering:** The slow breaking down and wearing away of rocks by water, wind, ice, and weather over a long time.\n   - **Evidence:** Clues or information that help us figure something out. Fossils are evidence about Earth's past.\n   - **Landscape:** The shape and features of the land, including hills, valleys, rocks, and soil.\n\n3. **Connect to Photograph** (5 minutes)\n   - Display the original fossil photograph.\n   - Point to the fan-like structure: \"This is a real fossil. Scientists believe this was a sea creature that lived millions of years ago. It was buried in mud and sand at the bottom of an ocean. Over time, the mud and sand turned into rock, and the creature's shape was preserved as an imprint—just like our plaster fossils!\"\n   - Show the surrounding rocks: \"Notice these rocks around it? They're all different sizes and colors. Some are smooth, some are rough. That's because of weathering. Wind, water, and ice have been breaking these rocks apart for a very long time.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding** (3 minutes)\n   - Ask: \"Turn to your neighbor and explain: What is a fossil, and how does it help us learn about the past?\"\n   - Circulate and listen to student explanations; correct misconceptions on the spot.\n   - Ask 2 students to share their explanations with the class.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that fossils are preserved remains that provide evidence of ancient life.\n- Students can explain that weathering breaks rocks into different shapes and sizes over time.\n- Students recognize the fan-like structure in the photograph as a fossil from an ancient organism.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply fossil and weathering concepts to a new context and explore how landscapes change over time.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large sheet of butcher paper or poster board (one per group)\n- Colored pencils, markers\n- Printed images or drawings of different landscapes (beach, desert, mountain, forest) — 2-3 per group\n- Sticky notes\n- Optional: tablets/computers for research (if available)\n\n**Activity: \"Earth's Changing Landscape\"**\n\n1. **Scenario Setup** (2 minutes)\n   - Explain: \"Imagine a beach from 100 million years ago. It looked very different from beaches today. Different plants and animals lived there. Fossils found in rocks near this ancient beach tell us what lived there long ago.\"\n\n2. **Landscape Comparison Task** (10 minutes)\n   - Assign each group a landscape type (modern beach, modern desert, modern mountain, modern forest).\n   - Distribute printed images of modern landscapes.\n   - Ask: \"What organisms live in your landscape today? Draw or write them on your poster.\"\n   - Then ask: \"What do you think this landscape might have looked like 50 million years ago? What different organisms might have lived there? Draw or write your predictions.\"\n   - Prompt: \"Use the fossils we learned about to imagine what might have been there.\"\n\n3. **Group Presentations** (5 minutes)\n   - Have 2-3 groups share their ancient landscape predictions.\n   - Ask other students: \"What evidence from fossils might prove your classmates' predictions?\"\n\n4. **Discussion Connection** (3 minutes)\n   - Ask: \"How do fossils and weathered rocks help scientists know how landscapes have changed?\"\n   - Guide students to understand that fossils + weathered rocks = evidence of Earth's changes.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Prompt thinking with questions: \"What types of animals need specific plants or water?\" \"If we find a fossil of a sea creature in a desert, what does that tell us?\"\n- Encourage creative but evidence-based reasoning.\n- Validate predictions, then gently introduce the real science: \"That's a great prediction! Scientists actually found fossils that suggest...\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply fossil evidence to infer how a landscape was different in the past.\n- Students recognize that changes in organisms (from fossils) reflect changes in the landscape and environment.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossils, weathering, and landscape change.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Did students accurately observe and describe rocks and their textures?\n- Listen-in during Explain: Could students explain what a fossil is and what it tells us?\n- Group work during Elaborate: Did students make reasonable inferences about past landscapes using evidence?\n\n**Summative Exit Ticket** (administer at end of session; 5 minutes)\n\n**Provide each student with a printed exit ticket with these questions:**\n\n1. **Look at this fossil photograph again** (show original image). \"Describe what you see. What do you think this fossil is? How did it get in the rock?\" *(Accept 2-3 sentences.)*\n\n2. **Explain in your own words:** What does a fossil tell a scientist about Earth a long time ago? *(Accept 1-2 sentences.)*\n\n3. **Circle the correct answer:**\n   - Weathering is the breaking down of rocks by (a) plants growing, (b) water, wind, and time, (c) fossils forming.\n   - A fossil proves that (a) rocks are hard, (b) a living thing lived in a place a long time ago, (c) landscapes never change.\n\n4. **Draw or write:** If you found a fossil of a fish in the middle of a desert, what would that tell you about the desert long ago?\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student identifies the fossil as evidence of an ancient organism.\n- ✓ Student explains that fossils show us what lived long ago.\n- ✓ Student understands weathering breaks down rocks.\n- ✓ Student makes a logical inference using fossil evidence (e.g., \"The desert used to be an ocean\").\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will correctly identify the fossil and explain its relevance to Earth's past.\n- Students will demonstrate understanding of weathering as a time-based process.\n- Students will make evidence-based inferences about landscape change.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Cards:** Provide visual reference cards with pictures and one-sentence definitions of \"fossil,\" \"weathering,\" and \"preserved.\" Allow students to refer to these during Explain and Evaluate phases.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Sheets:** During Explore, provide a worksheet with labeled sections (\"Smooth rocks,\" \"Rough rocks,\" \"Cracked rocks\") where students can paste or draw rocks instead of independent categorization. Include sentence starters: \"This rock is smooth because _______.\"\n\n3. **Partner Buddy System:** Pair struggling readers/writers with a stronger peer during group work. Assign the struggling learner the role of \"observer and illustrator\" while the buddy scribes their ideas.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Research Extension:** Ask advanced students to research a specific fossil (ammonite, trilobite, archaeopteryx) and present findings about what landscape and climate it reveals. Provide access to kid-friendly websites (USGS, National Geographic Kids).\n\n2. **Weathering Experiment Design:** Challenge students to design their own experiment to test which weathering process (water, salt, heat, freeze-thaw) breaks down rock fastest. Provide materials and guide them to make predictions and document results.\n\n3. **Timeline Creation:** Have advanced students create a timeline showing Earth 100 million years ago, 50 million years ago, and today, using fossil evidence to infer what organisms and landscapes existed at each point. Encourage them to cite their sources.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Fossil Dig Simulation:** Create a \"dig site\" by burying plastic toy fossils or shells in a sandbox or kinetic sand bin. Students use small brushes and spoons to excavate, sketch their findings, and present discoveries to the class—reinforcing evidence collection methods used by paleontologists.\n\n2. **Rock Weathering Time-Lapse:** Place chalk or soft limestone in a container with vinegar (acidic weathering agent). Photograph daily changes over a week. Students observe and record how the \"rock\" breaks down, providing evidence of weathering processes in action. Display photos on a bulletin board with captions.\n\n3. **Museum Exhibit Design:** Have students create a classroom \"fossil museum\" by displaying their plaster fossil models with museum-style labels that include: \"Name of organism,\" \"When it lived,\" \"What the fossil tells us,\" and \"What the landscape was like.\" Students become docents, explaining their exhibit to visitors (other classes, parents).\n\n4. **Fossil Field Guide Creation:** Students sketch and label common fossils (with images provided), write one-sentence descriptions of each, and compile a classroom \"Field Guide to Fossils.\" This resource becomes a reference for future lessons and reinforces vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- The photograph is ideal for Fourth Grade because it shows a real fossil with visible detail, surrounded by other weathered rocks—bringing together multiple ESS1 and ESS2 concepts visually.\n- If plaster of Paris is unavailable, use air-dry clay pressed into a tray to create imprints; it works equally well.\n- Encourage students to collect small rocks from outdoors to expand the rock observation activity—this makes weathering tangible and locally relevant.\n- Revisit the \"student wonderings\" chart at the end of the lesson to celebrate questions that were answered and pose new ones for future inquiry.",
