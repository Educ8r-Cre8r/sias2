Identify and describe what they observe about beaches, sand, and animals that live in sandy environments.\n2. Explain how water and wind can change the shape and appearance of sand over time.\n3. Compare materials and test simple solutions to slow down how wind and water move sand.\n4. Describe ways that animals like crabs are adapted to live on sandy beaches.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about beaches and what happens to sand using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed color photograph of the ghost crab on sand (or digital display)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: small handful of sand in a shallow container to pass around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it large. Do NOT explain what you're showing yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to \"look and wonder\"** for 1 minute in silence. Encourage them to study what they see carefully.\n\n3. **Facilitate whole-group discussion** with these specific questions (pause after each for thinking time):\n   - *\"What do you see in this picture? Tell me everything you notice.\"* (Look for: sand, animal, claws, holes, sunlight, brown/tan colors)\n   - *\"What do you think this animal is doing? Why might it be here?\"* (Accept predictions; don't correct yet)\n   - *\"Have you ever been to a beach? What did you notice about the sand? Was it hard or soft? Did it move?\"*\n   - *\"If I poured water on this sand or blew wind across it, what do you think would happen?\"*\n\n4. **Create a \"Wonder Wall\"** on chart paper. Write down student questions: *\"How does the crab dig?\" \"Does the sand stay in one place?\" \"Why is the sand this color?\"* Post this in the classroom for reference.\n\n5. **Invite students to touch a small sample of sand** (if available). Ask: *\"Does sand feel like rocks? How is it different?\"*\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today we're going to explore how sand moves and changes, and discover how animals like this crab live on beaches.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how wind and water move sand through direct experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per pair of students):**\n- 1 shallow aluminum baking pan or plastic cafeteria tray\n- ½ cup of sand (play sand or sandbox sand, not beach sand which may be wet)\n- 1 spray bottle filled with water\n- 1 straw or drinking stick per student\n- 1 small plastic cup of water for pouring\n- Paper towel for cleanup\n- Observation sheet (template provided below)\n\n**Setup Before Lesson:**\n- Arrange workspace so each pair has their own tray on a table (over a newspaper to catch spills)\n- Test the spray bottle beforehand to ensure it works smoothly\n- Have water available at a central location or pour it into small cups ahead of time\n\n**Activity — Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n**Part 1: Wind Moving Sand (8 minutes)**\n\n1. *\"Pour sand into your tray so the bottom is covered about one inch deep.\"*\n\n2. *\"Spread the sand flat using your fingers. Look at it carefully and draw what it looks like on your observation sheet in the 'Before' box.\"*\n\n3. *\"Now, use your straw like a wind maker. Blow gently through the straw across the sand. Blow for 5 seconds.\"*\n\n4. *\"Stop and look. What changed? Draw or write what you see in the 'After Wind' box on your sheet.\"*\n\n5. *\"Ask your partner: Where did the sand move to? Did some stay in one place?\"*\n\n**Part 2: Water Moving Sand (9 minutes)**\n\n1. *\"Use your finger to smooth out the sand again.\"*\n\n2. *\"Now, use the spray bottle. Spray the sand gently 3 times. What happens?\"* (Students spray and observe)\n\n3. *\"Draw what the sand looks like now in the 'After Water' box.\"*\n\n4. *\"Talk with your partner: How was water different from wind? Did the sand move the same way?\"*\n\n5. *\"Now spray the sand one more time, and try to scoop some sand with a spoon. Is it easier to move now? Why?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to each pair. Ask guiding questions instead of explaining:\n  - *\"What do you notice is different?\"*\n  - *\"Can you predict what will happen if you blow harder?\"*\n  - *\"Is the sand in the same place as before?\"*\n- Redirect students who are off-task with: *\"Let's focus on watching the sand, not playing with it.\"*\n- Do NOT tell students the \"correct\" answer about erosion—let them discover through observation.\n- Record student language and observations for the Explain phase.\n\n**What Students Record:**\n- Drawing or words on observation sheet showing sand before and after wind\n- Drawing or words showing sand before and after water\n- 1-2 sentence observation: *\"The wind made the sand move to _____\"* or *\"The water made the sand _____\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that blowing (wind) moves sand sideways across the tray.\n- Students notice that water makes sand pack down and become harder to move.\n- Students begin to understand that both wind and water can change how sand looks and where it is.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formal concepts to make sense of observations.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper\n- Markers\n- Photograph of the crab (displayed again)\n- Optional: Video clip (30-60 seconds) of waves moving sand on a real beach (search: \"waves moving beach sand\" on YouTube—use a kid-friendly, short clip)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Share Out from Explore (6 minutes)**\n- Ask 3-4 pairs to share what they observed. Write their discoveries on chart paper:\n  - *\"Wind made the sand move sideways\"*\n  - *\"Water made the sand wet and stuck together\"*\n  - *\"The sand kept moving\"*\n- Affirm all observations. Use student language in your explanations.\n\n**Step 2: Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes)**\n\nTeach these terms using simple definitions and point to real examples:\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** | **Connection to Photo/Activity** |\n|----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| **Sand** | Tiny pieces of rock and shells that break apart over time | The beach is made of sand; students felt it in the tray |\n| **Erosion** | When wind or water moves pieces of rock and soil from one place to another | Their experiment showed water and wind moving sand |\n| **Weathering** | When rocks break into smaller and smaller pieces | Sand is made of rocks that broke apart over a long, long time |\n| **Habitat** | The place where an animal lives and finds food | The sandy beach is where the crab lives (shown in photo) |\n| **Beach** | A landform where land meets water, often made of sand | The place in the photograph |\n\n**Say:** *\"The tiny sand in your tray is made of pieces of rock and shells that broke apart. Over a very, very long time, wind and water break big rocks into smaller and smaller pieces. That's called weathering. Then, wind and water move those pieces around. That's called erosion. Beaches are always changing!\"*\n\n**Step 3: Connect Back to the Photograph (4 minutes)**\n- Display the crab photo again.\n- *\"This animal is called a ghost crab. It digs in the sand to hide. The sand keeps changing because of wind and water, but the crab's strong claws help it dig new burrows. The crab is adapted to live in this sandy place where things are always moving.\"*\n- Point to the sand in the photo: *\"See how some parts look darker and some parts look lighter? That shows where water has touched it. The crab found a good spot to hide.\"*\n\n**Check for Understanding (strategic, not formal test):**\n- Ask random students: *\"If a big storm brings lots of wind and rain to a beach, what happens to the sand?\"* (Expected: It moves, changes, spreads out)\n- *\"Why do you think the crab digs a hole instead of staying on top of the sand?\"* (Expected: To hide, to be safe, to stay out of the wind and water)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can use the word \"erosion\" to describe wind or water moving sand.\n- Students understand that beaches are made of very small pieces of rock and shells.\n- Students can explain why a crab might dig instead of staying on the surface.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply concepts to design and test a solution to slow down erosion.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- 1 large baking tray with 1 cup of sand spread evenly\n- 1 cup of water mixed with a drop of blue food coloring (makes erosion visible)\n- Small objects to test as \"barriers\": pebbles, twigs, craft sticks, foam pieces, fabric scraps, small plastic blocks\n- 1 spray bottle with water\n- Newspaper underneath each tray\n- Chart for recording: \"What We Used / Did It Stop the Water? / How Long Did It Work?\"\n\n**Setup:**\n- Pre-dampen sand slightly so it holds together better (not muddy, just moist).\n- Arrange water-food coloring mixture in cups at a central station.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Introduction (2 minutes):**\n*\"Beaches sometimes wash away because of big storms and strong waves. Scientists try to find ways to stop or slow down erosion. You're going to be engineers! Your job is to test different things that might slow down water moving the sand. Which material works best?\"*\n\n**Investigation (12 minutes):**\n\n1. *\"Your group will choose one material to test first. Place it on top of the sand or stick it into the sand like a barrier.\"*\n\n2. *\"Now, pour the colored water down the side of your tray slowly, like a small stream.\"*\n\n3. *\"Watch carefully: Does your barrier stop the water? Does it slow it down? Does the sand wash away?\"*\n\n4. *\"On your chart, write or draw what material you used and mark 'Yes, it worked' or 'No, it didn't work.' Draw how long the barrier stopped the water.\"*\n\n5. *\"If you have time, try another material and test it the same way.\"*\n\n6. *\"Compare your results with another group: Whose material worked better? Why do you think?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Prompt thinking: *\"What happened to the sand? Did the water go around the barrier or through it?\"*\n- Ask comparison questions: *\"Which material was stronger? Which one did water go through faster?\"*\n- Don't give answers; ask students to explain their thinking.\n- Assist groups that finish early in testing a second or third material.\n\n**Facilitate a 2-minute group discussion:**\n- *\"If we used these barriers on a real beach, which would work best? Why?\"*\n- Students may realize that some materials are too expensive, too heavy, or don't last long.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students test at least one material and observe whether it slows erosion.\n- Students record observations (words, drawings, or checkmarks) on a chart.\n- Students can explain which materials worked better and make simple predictions about real beaches.\n- Students begin to understand that solutions to erosion involve barriers that slow water and wind movement.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess whether students met the learning objectives.\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout Lesson:**\n- Observe student behavior during Explore: Are they testing carefully? Recording observations?\n- Listen to student language during Explain: Do they use \"erosion,\" \"sand,\" \"wind,\" \"water\" correctly?\n- Watch student reasoning in Elaborate: Can they predict which barriers work best?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (Administer at end of Lesson 2):**\n\n**Option A: Drawing + Sentence (if class is primarily drawing-based)**\n\nProvide each student with a sheet showing three boxes labeled:\n1. *\"Draw what you learned about how sand moves\"*\n2. *\"Draw or write: What material did you use to stop erosion?\"*\n3. *\"Draw a beach. Show the crab, sand, and water.\"*\n\nStudents complete and return.\n\n**Option B: Oral/Visual Assessment (if you prefer observing understanding directly)**\n\nAsk each student individually or in pairs:\n- *\"Show me on this tray: Where would wind move the sand? Point and show me.\"*\n- *\"If we put a wall here, would it stop the water? Why or why not?\"*\n- *\"Why does the crab live on a beach where the sand is always moving?\"*\n\n**Option C: Written 3-Question Exit Ticket (for a more formal record)**\n\n1. *\"Wind and water move sand. This is called _________.\"* (Word bank: erosion, weathering, habitat, beach)\n2. *\"Which moved the sand faster in your experiment—blowing air or pouring water? Why?\"* (Open response; accept all reasonable answers with evidence from their testing)\n3. *\"Name one material you tested to stop water from moving sand: _________. Did it work? Yes / No\"*\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Students met the learning objectives if they:**\n- Identify and describe observations about beaches, sand, and animals (Objective 1)\n  - Can name what they see in the crab photo (sand, animal, burrow)\n  - Use words like \"wind,\" \"water,\" \"sand,\" \"move,\" \"change\"\n\n- Explain how water and wind change sand (Objective 2)\n  - Use the word \"erosion\" or \"moves\" to describe changes\n  - Describe what they observed in the Explore activity\n  - Can point to evidence in the photograph or their drawings\n\n- Compare materials and test solutions (Objective 3)\n  - Test at least one material and record observations\n  - Explain whether it slowed or stopped water movement\n  - Compare two different materials or approaches\n\n- Describe animal adaptations (Objective 4)\n  - Identify the crab and explain why it digs\n  - Understand that the crab is suited to a changing sandy environment\n  - Use the word \"adapted\" or \"lives here\" appropriately\n\n**How to Determine Success:**\n- Review exit tickets and drawings for evidence of conceptual understanding (not perfect spelling or artwork).\n- Look for use of targeted vocabulary (erosion, sand, wind, water, habitat, adapted, beach).\n- Listen for student explanations that refer back to their hands-on observations.\n- If fewer than 70% of students show understanding, re-teach the Explain phase with a different approach (e.g., video, demonstration, re-do part of Explore).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for students who need scaffolding):\n\n1. **Simplified Observation Sheet for Explore:**\n   - Provide a sheet with large boxes labeled \"Before,\" \"After Wind,\" \"After Water\" with outlines of sand to color in rather than free drawings.\n   - Accept one-word responses: \"moved,\" \"wet,\" \"spread,\" etc.\n   - Pair student with a strong partner for turn-taking and modeling.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:**\n   - Create a large, colorful poster with photos/drawings for each term (sand, wind, water, erosion, beach, crab, habitat).\n   - Leave it visible throughout the lesson and point to it during discussions.\n   - Allow students to reference the chart during Evaluate.\n\n3. **Guided Questions During Explore:**\n   - Instead of open-ended observation, ask yes/no first: *\"Did the sand move? Did it go left or right? Did it move more with wind or water?\"*\n   - Provide sentence starters: *\"The wind made the sand __________ (move/spread/fly).\"*\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Erosion Prevention Design Challenge:**\n   - Ask: *\"Design the BEST barrier to protect a beach from a big storm. You can use multiple materials. Sketch your design and explain why it would work.\"*\n   - Have students test multiple materials and rank them by effectiveness.\n   - Ask them to consider: cost, durability, impact on the environment, how long it lasts.\n\n2. **Real-World Research:**\n   - Provide pictures of real coastal protection strategies (sea walls, dunes, barriers). Ask: *\"Why do you think we use these on real beaches?\"*\n   - Have students predict what would happen if we removed them.\n\n3. **Extended Vocabulary:**\n   - Introduce terms like \"sediment\" (pieces of rock and soil), \"coastal erosion,\" \"conservation.\"\n   - Ask students to write a short explanation: *\"What is erosion? Why is it a problem for beaches and people who live near them?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Beach in a Bottle:**\n   - Students layer sand and shells in a clear plastic bottle or jar, add water, seal it, and tilt it to watch \"erosion\" in slow motion.\n   - Observe and record how long it takes for sand to settle and what patterns form.\n   - Take home to show families.\n\n2. **Beach Habitat Exploration (Virtual or Print):**\n   - Use nature websites or picture books to identify 3-4 animals that live on sandy beaches (ghost crab, sandpiper, sand hopper, sea turtle).\n   - Create a chart: *\"Animal | How It's Adapted to Sand | Where It Hides\"*\n   - Draw or write why each animal is suited to a sandy, changing environment.\n\n3. **Sand vs. Soil Investigation:**\n   - Compare a tray of sand, a tray of soil, and a tray of pebbles.\n   - Test how wind and water affect each differently.\n   - Discuss: *\"Which erodes fastest? Which holds together best? Why?\"*\n   - Connect to other landforms (forests, mountains, deserts).\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- **Time Management:** If your schedule is tight, condense the lesson to two 50-minute sessions by doing Engage + Explore in Session 1, and Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate in Session 2.\n- **Sand Source:** Play sand is preferable to beach sand (which is often wet and compacted). Avoid sand from hardware stores, which can be dusty.\n- **Cleanup:** Have paper towels and a small broom handy. Consider using cafeteria trays to contain mess.\n- **Photos for Bulletin Board:** Display student drawings, photographs of their experiments, and the crab photo together with captions about erosion and adaptation.",
