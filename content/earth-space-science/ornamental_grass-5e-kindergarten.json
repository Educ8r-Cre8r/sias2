ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout of the photograph (11x14\" or projected on screen)\n- Optional: a small sprig of grass in a vase (unfrosted) for tactile comparison\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project the image on a screen or pass around a large printed copy. Ask students to sit in a circle where everyone can see clearly.\n\n2. **Discovery Questions (Ask one at a time, allowing 20-30 seconds of thinking time):**\n   - \"What do you see covering the grass in this picture? What color is it?\"\n   - \"Have you ever touched something very cold? What did it feel like? Do you think this grass feels cold?\"\n   - \"Why do you think there are sparkly, shiny pieces on the grass? Where did they come from?\"\n   - \"What time of year do you think this picture was taken—summer or winter? How can you tell?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what this sparkly, frosty stuff is made of. Let's be detectives and find out!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore frost and ice just like the grass in this picture. We'll use ice and cold water to become Frosty Garden Detectives!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover frost/ice concepts through hands-on sensory exploration.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 4-5 students):**\n- 1 shallow plastic tray or bowl filled with ice cubes\n- 1 small bundle of fresh grass (or other plant stems)\n- 1 bundle of unfrosted grass for comparison\n- Paper towels\n- Sensory observation cards (pictures of warm sun, cold wind, ice crystals)\n- Safety goggles (optional but recommended)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1 (5 minutes):** Divide students into small groups. Give each group unfrosted grass.\n- Students touch, feel, and smell the grass.\n- Ask: \"How does this grass feel? Is it cold or warm?\"\n- Students hold it and describe it (soft, bendy, fresh-smelling, etc.).\n\n**Step 2 (10 minutes):** Introduce the ice tray.\n- Explain: \"This ice is made of frozen water, like frost in the picture!\"\n- Students carefully place the fresh grass bundle into the ice tray.\n- Students make **predictions**: \"What will happen to the grass when it touches the ice?\"\n- Students wait 2-3 minutes and observe.\n\n**Step 3 (5-7 minutes):** Students compare.\n- Students remove the frosty grass from the ice.\n- Students touch both grass bundles and compare (use sensory language: cold, crispy, sparkly, wet, hard, etc.).\n- Students observe ice crystals clinging to the frosted grass.\n- **Documentation:** Students draw or point to pictures showing \"before frost\" and \"after frost.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What changed? What do you feel? Is it the same as before?\"\n- Do **not** explain—let students discover through exploration\n- Model careful handling and safety with ice\n- Encourage descriptive language without correcting\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that cold makes plants wet and covered in ice crystals\n- Students notice texture changes (soft to crispy/cold)\n- Students begin connecting the photograph to their hands-on experience\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to real-world weather.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large photograph (still visible)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Picture cards showing seasons (spring/summer vs. fall/winter)\n- Three clear cups with water samples: liquid water, ice, and water droplets on cold surface (set up before lesson)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 4-5 students to share one thing they discovered: \"What did you notice about the grass after it touched the ice?\"\n   - Write student words on chart paper (e.g., \"cold,\" \"sparkly,\" \"wet,\" \"hard,\" \"slippery\")\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Point to the chart and photograph repeatedly as you teach each term:\n\n   | **Vocabulary Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n   |---|---|\n   | **Frost** | Tiny ice crystals that form on plants and grass when the weather is very, very cold (below freezing) |\n   | **Frozen** | When water gets so cold it turns into hard ice that you can touch |\n   | **Weather** | What it's like outside—hot, cold, sunny, rainy, windy, snowy |\n   | **Ice Crystals** | Tiny pieces of frozen water that sparkle and stick to plants |\n\n3. **Make Connections (4-5 minutes):**\n   - \"Look at the photograph again. The sparkly stuff we see? That's **frost**—frozen water from the cold night air.\"\n   - \"When weather gets very cold, water freezes. Just like our grass in the ice tray!\"\n   - Show seasonal picture cards: \"Frost happens in **fall** and **winter** when it's cold. It doesn't happen in summer when it's warm.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Frost is frozen _____ (water). Point to it in the picture.\"\n   - Ask: \"When does frost happen—hot days or cold days?\"\n   - Ask students to hold up their drawings and explain one thing they see.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name frost and ice\n- Students understand frost is frozen water\n- Students connect cold weather to frost formation\n- Students can point to frost in the photograph\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding by predicting frost patterns in real-world scenarios.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Frost Detective\" scenario cards with pictures (3-4 scenarios)\n- Chart paper labeled \"Where Will We Find Frost?\"\n- Student response cards (thumbs up/down or yes/no cards)\n- Optional: pictures of a garden, playground, sunny window, shady spot, etc.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Scenario Exploration (12-15 minutes):**\n   - Present 3-4 scenarios with pictures:\n     - **Scenario A:** \"It's a very cold morning. The sun is shining on the front of a house, but the back is in shadow. Where will we find more frost—the sunny side or the shady side?\"\n     - **Scenario B:** \"A plant sits in a warm house by the window. Will frost form on it?\"\n     - **Scenario C:** \"Grass in a garden on a warm fall day—will there be frost?\"\n   \n2. **Student Prediction and Reasoning (10-15 minutes):**\n   - Show each scenario picture\n   - Ask students to predict: \"Will there be frost? Show me thumbs up (yes) or thumbs down (no).\"\n   - Ask 2-3 students to explain their thinking: \"Why do you think that?\"\n   - Record predictions on chart: \"Where Will We Find Frost?\" (students point, draw, or verbally contribute)\n\n3. **Real-World Connection:**\n   - Explain: \"Frost helps us know the weather is getting colder. It tells us to wear warmer clothes!\"\n   - Ask: \"If you saw frost on the grass tomorrow morning, what would you wear outside?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide thinking with questions rather than answers\n- Affirm reasoning: \"You're thinking like a scientist!\"\n- Connect to students' own experiences: \"Have you seen frost on your way to school?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply frost knowledge to new situations\n- Students can predict where frost will and won't form based on temperature\n- Students explain their thinking using evidence from observations\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of frost, weather, and plant responses.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Listen to student responses during ENGAGE discussion questions\n- Observe student descriptions during EXPLORE (touch, feel, observations)\n- Use hand signals: \"Show me with your hands how small frost crystals are. Show me how cold frost makes plants feel.\"\n- Watch for use of new vocabulary naturally in student speech\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-10 minutes):**\n\n**Option A - Visual/Drawing Assessment (for all learners):**\n- Provide a worksheet with two pictures: one showing sunny grass, one showing frosty grass\n- Ask: \"Draw one thing that changes when frost forms on grass.\"\n- Ask: \"Draw what frost is made of.\" (Expect: water, ice, crystals, or sparkles)\n\n**Option B - Verbal Assessment (for students who struggle with writing):**\n- Show the original photograph\n- Ask individually or in small groups:\n  1. \"What do you see on the grass? What is it called?\" (Expect: frost, ice, sparkles, frozen water)\n  2. \"Is frost cold or warm?\" (Expect: cold)\n  3. \"Frost comes from cold _____.\" (Expect: weather, air, night, winter)\n  4. \"Show me how the grass feels before frost... and after frost.\" (Expect: soft to crispy/cold)\n\n**Option C - Performance Assessment (Kinesthetic):**\n- Ask students to act out: \"Show me what happens to a grass plant when frost forms on it.\" (Expect: stiffening, slowing down, bending under ice weight)\n- Ask: \"Pretend your body is a grass blade. Frost is forming on you. What changes?\"\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n✓ Students can identify frost in the photograph  \n✓ Students describe frost as frozen water or ice  \n✓ Students understand frost forms when weather is cold  \n✓ Students recognize changes in plants due to frost  \n✓ Students use observation vocabulary (cold, sparkly, crispy, frozen, wet)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can correctly name frost and identify it in the photograph\n- 75% of students can explain that frost is frozen water or ice\n- 70% of students can predict where frost will form based on temperature/shadow\n- All students engage in sensory exploration and vocabulary use\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Pre-teach Vocabulary:** Show picture cards of frost, ice, and frozen water the day before the lesson. Use these visuals repeatedly.\n\n2. **Simplified Explore Activity:** Pair students with a buddy or provide one-on-one guidance during ice exploration. Use sentence stems: \"The frost feels _____. The grass changed from _____ to _____.\"\n\n3. **Concrete Visual Aids:** Use actual samples (a small potted plant, fresh grass, a bowl of ice) rather than only pictures. Allow repeated sensory exploration. Accept pointing and one-word answers during discussions.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Extended Prediction:** Ask: \"What would happen if we left frosted grass in the warm house? What happens to the frost?\" Encourage students to predict melting and observe water droplets. Introduce the water cycle informally: \"Frozen water becomes liquid water again when it gets warm.\"\n\n2. **Frost Detective Experiment:** Provide a thermometer (digital, easy to read) and ask: \"How cold does it have to be for frost to form?\" Have advanced students check temperature outside (if available) or guess based on frost presence.\n\n3. **Seasonal Connection:** Ask students to create a \"Frost Calendar\"—draw pictures of when frost appears (fall and winter). Connect to other seasonal weather observations: \"What else changes in fall and winter besides frost?\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frosty Garden Walk:** (15-20 minutes) On a cold, frosty morning, take students on a guided nature walk to observe real frost on plants, grass, and surfaces. Ask students to identify frosty spots and point out differences between frosted and unfrosted areas. Take photos to compare with the lesson photograph.\n\n2. **Melting Frost Observation:** (10-15 minutes over multiple days) Place a frosted grass bundle in a warm location (sunny windowsill). Students observe and document how frost changes as it melts using drawings or photos. Discuss: \"Where does the frost go? Where does the water come from?\"\n\n3. **Frost Warning Poster:** (20-30 minutes) Students create a classroom poster titled \"Frost is Coming! What Should We Do?\" Students draw or dictate: \"Wear a jacket,\" \"Bring plants inside,\" \"Put on warm socks.\" Displays understanding of how frost affects our daily lives and plant care needs.\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Teachers\n\n- This lesson works best in fall or early winter, or can be taught any time using the prepared ice exploration (EXPLORE phase)\n- Kindergarteners are concrete learners—repeated sensory experience with ice/frost is more valuable than lengthy explanations\n- Photograph can be revisited in future weather lessons as an anchor chart example\n- This lesson pairs well with K-ESS3-1 (plant needs) if followed with a lesson on protecting plants from frost and cold weather",
