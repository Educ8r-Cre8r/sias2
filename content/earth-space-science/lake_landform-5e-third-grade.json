ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph (lake_landform.jpg)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or as a printed handout for student groups. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds without speaking.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** (one at a time, allowing 1-2 minutes for thinking and sharing):\n   - \"What season do you think this photograph was taken in? What clues help you know?\"\n   - \"Do you see any fallen trees or branches in the water? Why do you think they might be there?\"\n   - \"What do you notice about the colors of the leaves and plants? What does that tell us about what's happening on Earth right now?\"\n   - \"How do you think this same lakeshore might look in summer? In winter? What might be different?\"\n\n3. **Record student ideas** on chart paper using their exact words. This activates prior knowledge about seasons and begins building vocabulary.\n\n4. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what happens to a shoreline when water and weather keep changing it year after year. Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"We're going to become investigators and collect data about how seasons change a place, just like this lakeshore. First, let's explore how weather affects Earth's land and water.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how seasons and weather create changes in landforms.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (lake_landform.jpg) for each group or displayed\n- Chart paper (one per group of 2-3 students)\n- Markers (multiple colors)\n- \"Seasonal Observation Recording Sheet\" (template provided below)\n- Optional: pictures of the same location from different seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step 1: Set Up Small Group Investigation (5 minutes)**\nDivide students into groups of 2-3. Assign each group one season: spring, summer, fall, or winter.\n\n**Step 2: Guided Observation (10 minutes)**\nProvide each group with the observation sheet. Direct students to:\n- Look at the autumn photograph carefully.\n- Record on their sheet: \"What does this lakeshore look like in autumn?\"\n- Draw or write observations about:\n  - Weather (temperature, rain, wind)\n  - Colors of plants and leaves\n  - What you see on the ground and in the water\n  - How the land meets the water\n\n**Step 3: Comparative Thinking (5 minutes)**\nAsk students to predict and record: \"Based on what you know about your assigned season, how would this same lakeshore look different? What would the weather be like? What would change?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups and ask open-ended questions: \"Why do you think that would happen?\" \"What evidence helps you say that?\"\n- Provide sentence frames if needed: \"In [season], the lakeshore would look ___ because ___.\"\n- Do NOT provide answers; let students use their reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Groups create a visual/written comparison of how one season differs from autumn at this lakeshore.\n- Students identify specific seasonal patterns (leaf color, temperature, precipitation, shoreline changes).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to seasonal and weather concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper for anchor chart\n- Vocabulary cards or pictures\n- Photograph displayed\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Have 1-2 groups share their seasonal predictions. Ask the class: \"Do you agree? What would you add?\"\n   - Note: Winter groups might mention ice; spring groups might discuss new growth; summer groups might discuss green leaves and warm weather.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (5-7 minutes):**\n   Create an anchor chart with these terms and student-friendly definitions:\n   \n   - **Season:** A time of year with typical weather patterns and changes in nature (spring, summer, fall, winter)\n   - **Weather:** What the air outside is like right now (temperature, wind, rain, snow)\n   - **Landform:** A natural shape on Earth's surface (hills, valleys, shorelines, lakes)\n   - **Shoreline:** The edge where water meets land\n   - **Weathering:** How wind, water, and ice slowly break down rocks and soil and change the shape of the land\n\n3. **Reconnect to the Photograph (3-5 minutes):**\n   Point to features in the autumn photo and use new vocabulary:\n   - \"This is a **shoreline**—the place where the lake **landform** meets the forest.\"\n   - \"The fallen tree and exposed sand show **weathering**—the water and wind have changed this land.\"\n   - \"The brown and orange leaves are signs of **autumn**, which is one **season** with cool **weather**.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   Ask: \"Can you point to the shoreline in the photo? Can you show where weathering might have happened?\"\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Season:** A time of year with typical weather and nature changes (spring, summer, fall, winter)\n- **Weather:** The conditions outside—hot or cold, sunny or rainy, windy or calm\n- **Landform:** A natural feature on Earth like a lake, hill, or valley\n- **Shoreline:** The place where water and land meet\n- **Weathering:** Slow changes to land caused by wind, water, and temperature\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can name and define seasonal weather patterns.\n- Students understand that the same place changes with seasons.\n- Students recognize that water and weather shape Earth's surface.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding of seasonal patterns to represent data about typical weather.\n\n**Materials:**\n- \"Seasonal Weather Data Chart\" (template below)\n- Markers or colored pencils\n- Optional: pictures of local weather or seasonal examples\n- Ruler (optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Scenario:** \"Scientists want to know: What are the typical weather conditions for each season at a lakeshore like the one in our photo? You will use what you know to create a data chart.\"\n\n**Step 1: Small Group Data Collection (7 minutes)**\nAssign each group of 2-3 students one season again. Using their prior knowledge and exploration, students complete a \"Seasonal Weather Data Chart\" for their assigned season:\n\n| Season | Typical Temperature | Rain/Snow? | Leaf Colors | What We See on Shore |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|\n| Fall   | Cool              | Some rain | Orange/brown| Fallen leaves, bare branches |\n| Winter | Cold              | Snow      | No leaves   | Ice, frozen ground   |\n| Spring | Warm              | Rainy     | Green buds  | New growth, water rising |\n| Summer | Hot               | Less rain | Dark green  | Full, thick leaves   |\n\n**Step 2: Create a Group Poster (8 minutes)**\nEach group transfers their data into a visual format—either:\n- A simple bar graph showing temperature across seasons\n- A picture chart with drawings showing typical conditions\n- A labeled diagram of the shoreline in their season\n\n**Step 3: Gallery Walk (3-5 minutes)**\nPost all seasonal posters. Students walk around and observe how the same lakeshore changes across seasons. Ask: \"What pattern do you notice?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide sentence frames: \"In ___ [season], the lakeshore has ___ because ___.\"\n- Encourage students to use vocabulary from Explain phase.\n- Guide students to see that patterns repeat: fall leads to winter, winter to spring, etc.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation (graph, chart, or diagram) showing typical seasonal weather and conditions.\n- Students recognize that the same place experiences predictable weather patterns each season.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of seasonal patterns and landform changes.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Listen to student discussions during Engage and Explore phases.\n- Review observation sheets and posters for evidence of understanding.\n- Listen for use of vocabulary terms: season, weather, landform, shoreline, weathering.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\nAt the end of Session 2, give each student an exit ticket with these questions (read aloud and provide visually):\n\n1. **Look at the photograph again.** Is this lakeshore in fall, winter, spring, or summer? **How do you know?** (Students write or draw.)\n\n2. **What is one thing that water does to change a shoreline over time?** (Accept any reasonable answer: moves soil, breaks down rocks, carries fallen branches, creates new patterns.)\n\n3. **Draw or write: How would this same lakeshore look in winter?** (Look for seasonal weather understanding: snow, ice, bare trees, cold.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies the season in the photo and provides at least one piece of evidence.\n- ✓ Student describes a change caused by weather or water.\n- ✓ Student predicts seasonal differences using vocabulary (weather, season, landform, shoreline).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Most students will correctly identify autumn and note leaf colors or temperature clues.\n- Students will explain that water erodes or moves material on shorelines.\n- Students will show understanding that seasons create predictable patterns of weather and landscape change.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support:**\n\n1. **Vocabulary Word Bank:** Provide a visual word bank with pictures for season, weather, landform, shoreline, and weathering. Students can point to or copy words.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Sheet:** Create a simpler observation sheet with sentence frames:\n   - \"I see ___ colored leaves.\"\n   - \"The weather is probably ___.\"\n   - \"Water might change the land by ___.\"\n\n3. **Pair Struggling Learners:** Partner students with stronger language skills during Explore and Elaborate phases. Let them draw while a peer records words.\n\n**Challenge:**\n\n1. **Deeper Causation:** Ask: \"Why do leaves change color in fall? What is the science behind that?\" Introduce the idea that plants prepare for cold, shorter days. Students research and share one sentence.\n\n2. **Extended Data Analysis:** Challenge students to collect actual weather data for your location over 2-4 weeks. Create a real graph showing temperature or rainfall changes. Compare it to the \"typical\" seasonal data created in Elaborate.\n\n3. **Design a Shoreline Protection Solution:** Using 3-ESS3-1 (implicit connection), ask: \"If storms damage a shoreline, what could people build to protect it? Sketch your idea and explain how it reduces damage.\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Photo Comparison Over Time:** If available, obtain pictures of the same lakeshore from different seasons or the same season in different years. Have students compare and identify changes. Create a presentation showing \"then and now.\"\n\n2. **Local Lakeshore or Waterfront Walk:** Take students to a local pond, stream, or wetland. Have them record observations about current weather and season. Compare with the photograph. Discuss: \"What do we observe here that is the same or different?\"\n\n3. **Seasonal Prediction Journal:** Students keep a two-week journal predicting weather for the upcoming week, then checking if predictions were accurate. Record in a table and discuss: \"Do seasons have patterns we can rely on?\"\n\n4. **Create a \"Life at the Shoreline\" Life Cycle Diagram:** Students research and draw animals that live at lakeshores (fish, turtles, birds, insects). Show how each one's behavior changes across seasons (migration, hibernation, breeding). Discuss adaptation.\n\n---\n\n**Appendix: Templates**\n\n**SEASONAL OBSERVATION RECORDING SHEET**\n\nName: _________________ Season: _________________\n\n**What does this lakeshore look like in your season?**\n\nWeather: (circle or draw) Hot / Warm / Cool / Cold     Rainy / Snowy / Dry\n\nLeaves: (draw or color) Green / Yellow / Orange / Brown / No leaves\n\n**Draw or write what you see on the ground and in the water:**\n\n(Space for drawing/writing)\n\n**How is your season different from fall?**\n\n(Space for drawing/writing)\n\n---\n\n**SEASONAL WEATHER DATA CHART**\n\nSeason: ________________\n\n| Question | Your Answer |\n|----------|-------------|\n| Is it hot, warm, cool, or cold? | |\n| Does it rain or snow?
