  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Moss on Rock\n\n## Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n\n- **Weathering and Rock Breakdown:** The visible cracks, crevices, and texture changes on the rock surface demonstrate how rocks are broken down over time through physical and chemical weathering, creating spaces where organisms can grow.\n- **Interactions Between Earth Systems:** The photograph shows the geosphere (rock), hydrosphere (moisture needed for moss), atmosphere (water vapor and gases), and biosphere (moss growth) working together—moss thrives in moist, shaded conditions that indicate water availability and specific environmental interactions.\n- **Soil Formation:** Moss and lichen growth on rocks is an early stage of soil formation; as organisms break down rock, they contribute organic matter that eventually creates conditions for other plants and living things.\n- **Environmental Conditions and Organism Adaptation:** The location of moss growth (on the shaded, likely wetter side of the rock) shows how organisms are adapted to specific conditions like moisture, shade, and stable surfaces.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**Rock Breakdown and the Role of Tiny Living Things**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or one 75-90 minute block)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-ESS2-1 (Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact)\n  - 5-ESS3-1 (Obtain and combine information about ways individual communities use science ideas to protect the Earth's resources and environment)\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Identify and describe how moss and other organisms interact with rocks as part of the Earth system.**\n2. **Explain how weathering (breakdown of rock) happens through both physical processes and the action of living things.**\n3. **Model how water, rocks, plants, and organisms work together to begin forming soil.**\n4. **Predict where moss is most likely to grow on a rock based on environmental conditions like moisture and light.**\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph displayed on screen or printed and mounted on poster board (8.5\" × 11\" minimum)\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without explanation. Ask students to observe quietly for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice growing on this rock? What color is it?\"\n   - \"Why do you think something green is living on a hard rock? Rocks don't have soil like a garden!\"\n   - \"Where on the rock do you see the most green growth? Is it everywhere, or just in certain spots?\"\n   - \"How do you think this plant (moss) got its food and water if it's on a rock?\"\n\n3. **Launch the wonder prompt:**\n   - \"We're going to figure out: **How do rocks break down, and what does that have to do with tiny plants?** Your exploration will help us solve this mystery.\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions on chart paper.** Accept all ideas without correction; you'll revisit these at the end.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to do an investigation to see how rocks can break down and what role living things like moss play in that process.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 1 piece of chalk per pair (or small group)\n- 1-2 small pieces of soft rock (sandstone, pumice, or weathered brick) per pair *OR* continue using chalk\n- Hand lenses (magnifying glasses)\n- Water spray bottle or cup of water\n- Small bowl or tray (to catch debris)\n- Newspaper or paper towels\n- Data recording sheet (template provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Physical Weathering (First 10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute chalk and hand lenses.** Explain: \"Chalk is a soft rock. We're going to use it to model how rocks break down.\"\n\n2. **Student step-by-step directions:**\n   - Look at the chalk with the hand lens. Draw what you see (smooth? bumpy? any cracks?).\n   - Scratch the chalk with your fingernail or a pencil tip. What happens?\n   - Rub the chalk against a rough surface (concrete block, sandbox, or coarse paper). What do you see?\n   - Record: What happened? Did small pieces come off? How is this like what might happen to a real rock?\n\n3. **Teacher facilitation note:** Circulate and ask, \"What broke the chalk apart? Was it something living, or a physical force?\" *Do not answer;* let them think.\n\n**Part B: The Role of Water (Next 10 minutes)**\n\n4. **Collect chalk pieces.** Hand out small pieces of soft rock (or continue with chalk if rock unavailable).\n\n5. **New student directions:**\n   - Look at your rock with the hand lens. Notice any small cracks or pits?\n   - Spray water onto the rock (or drop water using a dropper). Let it sit for 30 seconds.\n   - Spray or drop more water. Repeat 5-10 times over 2 minutes.\n   - Observe: Does the rock feel softer? Can you crumble it more easily now?\n   - Record: How did water change the rock?\n\n6. **Teacher facilitation note:** Ask, \"Why do you think this happened? What does water do to certain rocks?\" Guide them to observe without explaining—they'll explain in the next phase.\n\n**What students should record on data sheet:**\n- Sketch of rock before and after\n- Observations: physical changes, size, texture, ease of crumbling\n- Answer: \"What broke down the rock in each part—was it something physical, water, or both?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe that physical force (scratching, rubbing) breaks chalk apart.\n- Students will observe that water softens certain rocks and makes them easier to break.\n- Students will begin connecting the photograph (moss on a rock that has visible cracks) to weathering processes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with student predictions from Engage phase\n- Vocabulary cards or poster (pre-made with definitions)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Facilitate share-out from Explore phase (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share one observation from their investigation.\n   - Record key words on chart paper: *broke, crumbled, water, soft, cracks, pieces.*\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n| **Term** | **Student-Friendly Definition** |\n|----------|--------------------------------|\n| **Weathering** | The slow breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by physical forces (like wind, water, freezing), chemical reactions, and living things. |\n| **Physical Weathering** | When rocks are broken apart by physical forces like rubbing, scratching, water flow, or freezing without changing what the rock is made of. |\n| **Moss** | A tiny, green plant that doesn't have roots like flowers do. Moss absorbs water and grows on moist surfaces like rocks, logs, and soil. |\n| **Geosphere** | All of Earth's rocks, soil, and landforms. |\n| **Biosphere** | All the living things on Earth—plants, animals, fungi, and tiny organisms. |\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the image again.\n   - \"See these cracks and soft spots? That's physical weathering—the rock is breaking apart.\n   - \"See the green moss? That's part of the biosphere living *on* the geosphere (the rock).\n   - \"The moss grows here because: (1) there are cracks for it to hold onto, (2) water stays here, and (3) it's in the shade.\"\n   - \"Moss doesn't cause the rock to break *now*, but over hundreds of years, moss and other organisms help break rocks into tinier pieces. That's how soil eventually forms!\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn to your partner and explain: What is weathering in your own words?\"\n   - \"Which picture from our investigation shows physical weathering better—the chalk being rubbed, or the chalk being wet?\"\n   - Have 2-3 students answer aloud.\n\n**Vocabulary:** See table above.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will use the term \"weathering\" to describe rock breakdown.\n- Students will explain that both physical forces and living things (like moss) play a role in breaking down rocks over time.\n- Students will understand that moss grows on rocks because of specific conditions (moisture, shade, stable surface).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large rock or concrete block (outdoor, if possible)\n- Photograph handouts (one per pair)\n- Pencil and observation sheet (see below)\n- Optional: moss sample in a small container (if available locally)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Rock Investigation Outdoors (or use a large rock in the classroom) — 10 minutes**\n\n1. **Take students outside to examine a local rock, large stone, or brick wall** (or bring a large rock indoors if outdoor access is limited).\n\n2. **Student task:**\n   - Find a spot on the rock where you see moss, lichen, or algae (green or grayish growth).\n   - Observe the surrounding area. Is this spot in shade or sunlight? Is it near water? Is the rock cracked?\n   - Record: Where is the growth? What conditions do you notice? (Wet? Dry? Shady? Sunny?)\n   - Make a prediction: Why did the organism choose to grow here?\n\n3. **Teacher role:** Ask probing questions:\n   - \"Is this side of the rock wet or dry? How do you know?\"\n   - \"Does this part get sunlight, or is it shaded?\"\n   - \"Are there cracks or pits here? Why might that matter?\"\n   - *Do not answer your own questions; encourage student thinking.*\n\n**Part B: Condition Prediction Task — 5-10 minutes**\n\n4. **Return to classroom.** Distribute printed photograph and prediction sheet.\n\n5. **Student prompt:**\n   - \"Look at this rock with moss on it. Based on what you learned:\n     - Which side of the rock do you think gets more rain or water?\n     - Which side gets more shade?\n     - Where do you predict moss is most likely to grow? Why?\"\n\n6. **Have students draw arrows or circles on the photograph showing predicted growth areas and explain their reasoning.**\n\n**Teacher role:** Circulate and ask, \"What evidence from your outdoor investigation helps you make this prediction?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will apply their understanding of weathering and organism needs to a real-world scenario.\n- Students will predict moss distribution based on environmental conditions (moisture, light).\n- Students will articulate the connection between weathering and the presence of living organisms.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of Earth system interactions and weathering.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment During Lesson:**\n- Observations during Explore phase: Can students identify physical weathering in their chalk investigation?\n- Circulate during Elaborate phase: Are students making reasonable predictions about moss location based on moisture and shade?\n- Listen to pair discussions: Are they using vocabulary accurately (weathering, geosphere, biosphere)?\n\n**Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes) — Provide each student with this prompt:**\n\n**Name:_________________ Date: _________**\n\n**Answer the questions below. Use a complete sentence.**\n\n1. **What is weathering? Give an example from our lesson.**\n\n2. **Look at this picture of a rock.** [Include a simple drawing or photograph of a rock with a crack and shade on one side.]  \n   **Which side is the moss most likely growing on—the sunny side or the shady side? Why?**\n\n3. **How do the geosphere (rocks) and biosphere (living things like moss) work together?**\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student defines weathering and provides an example (breaking chalk, water softening rock, moss helping break down rock over time).\n- ✓ Student predicts moss on the shady, wetter side and explains that moss needs moisture and shade.\n- ✓ Student explains that weathering (rock breakdown) and organisms (moss growth) interact—one helps the other over time.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify weathering in context.\n- 75% of students will predict moss location based on moisture/shade conditions.\n- 70% of students will describe geosphere-biosphere interaction using appropriate vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary cards:** Provide a visual word wall with pictures. For example, show a picture of a rock crumbling next to \"weathering,\" or a moss plant next to \"biosphere.\"\n\n2. **Hands-on investigation extension:** Allow students to repeat the water weathering activity with additional trial rocks, so they build confidence and reinforce the concept through repetition.\n\n3. **Sentence stems for exit ticket:** Provide sentence starters such as:\n   - \"Weathering is when rocks _______.\"\n   - \"Moss grows on the _______ side of the rock because _______.\"\n   - \"The rock and moss work together because _______.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Deep dive into soil formation:** Ask students, \"If weathering breaks rocks into tiny pieces, and moss grows on rocks, how do you think *soil* eventually forms? What other organisms might help?\" Have them research and create a labeled diagram showing the stages of soil formation over 100+ years.\n\n2. **Chemical weathering investigation:** Introduce the concept that some rocks dissolve in water (like limestone). Provide vinegar and a small limestone chip or seashell fragment (calcium carbonate). Ask students to predict what will happen and test it, then explain how rain (which is slightly acidic) might slowly dissolve certain rocks.\n\n3. **Ecosystem role extension:** \"Moss breaks down rocks and helps create soil. What other organisms might move into that soil? Create a food web showing how the rock-moss ecosystem grows and supports more and more living things.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Moss Growing Experiment (1-2 weeks, observational follow-up):**\n   - Collect a small moss sample (if available in your area).\n   - Place it in a shallow tray with a small piece of sandstone or soft rock.\n   - Keep the tray moist (spray daily) and in indirect light.\n   - Have students observe and record growth and rock changes every 2-3 days for 2 weeks.\n   - Document: Does the moss spread? Does the rock feel softer? Can you see tiny cracks forming?\n   - *Connection:* Demonstrates weathering in slow motion and moss's role in it.\n\n2. **Rock Diversity Hunt (outdoor or classroom-based):**\n   - Take students on a \"rock hunt\" outdoors or provide a variety of rocks collected beforehand.\n   - For each rock, students record: Where did they find it? Is moss/lichen growing on it? What condition is the rock in (intact, cracked, crumbling)?\n   - Compile data: Which rocks weather the fastest? Which are most likely to have moss?\n   - Graph and discuss patterns.\n   - *Connection:* Real-world application of weathering concepts; introduces data collection.\n\n3. **Community Connection — Rock Preservation (ESS3-1 connection):**\n   - Research: \"How do communities protect rocks and stone buildings from weathering?\"\n   - Examples: sealants on historic buildings, removal of moss from historical stones, limestone replacement in old structures.\n   - Invite a stonemason, architect, or historian to visit virtually or in person, OR have students research online and create an infographic about \"Protecting Rocks in Our Community.\"\n   - *Connection:* Explores how humans use science to protect Earth's resources (in this case, geological/cultural resources).\n\n---\n\n## Standards Alignment Summary\n\n| **NGSS PE** | **How This Lesson Addresses It** |\n|------------|--------------------------------|\n| **5-ESS2-1** (Geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere interactions) | Students model weathering and observe how rocks (geosphere), moss (biosphere), and water (hydrosphere) interact. They predict moss distribution based on moisture and shade. |\n| **5-ESS3-1** (Ways communities protect Earth's resources) | Extension Activity #3 explores how communities protect rocks and stone structures, connecting to real-world resource management. |\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure chalk and soft rocks are dust-free or wet to minimize dust inhalation. Hand lenses are safe for Fifth Grade use.\n- **Preparation:** Collect soft rocks (sandstone, pumice) or weathered bricks in advance. If outdoor rocks are unavailable, the chalk investigation is sufficient to teach the concept.\n- **Timing:** This lesson can be compressed to one 75-minute block (shorten Engage and Explain slightly) or spread across two 45-minute sessions (Engage + Explore on Day 1; Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate on Day 2).\n- **Vocabulary support:** Fifth graders are reading to learn; bold key terms on the board and reference them throughout the lesson to build academic language.",
