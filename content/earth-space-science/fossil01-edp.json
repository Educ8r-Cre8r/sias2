  "content": "# Engineering Design Challenge: Fossil Preservation & Mold-Making\n\n### Visible Elements in Photo\n- Multiple fossils embedded in light tan/beige sedimentary rock\n- One prominent fossil in sharp focus showing detailed surface features (spiral or coiled patterns, segmented body structure)\n- Fossils appear to be ammonites or similar shelled organisms\n- Varying sizes and orientations of specimens across the rock surface\n- Textured, layered rock matrix surrounding the fossils\n\n### Reasonable Inferences\n- **From detailed surface patterns**: These organisms had hard shells that could survive burial and preserve intricate details, suggesting the need to protect delicate structures during fossilization.\n- **From multiple fossils in one rock layer**: Organisms lived together in an ancient environment (likely ancient seafloor) before being buried and compressed over time.\n- **From the sedimentary matrix**: The rock formed from layers of sediment that hardened, meaning loose sediment can be compacted and cemented together under pressure.\n\n### Engineering Task\n\n**K-2: Make a Fossil Keeper**\nYour job: Design a small container or shelter from clay and sand that will protect a toy shell or spiral object so it doesn't get crushed or broken. You can use sand, clay, and water. Your fossil keeper must:\n- Hold your shell safely inside\n- Be made from natural materials\n- Keep the shell from rolling out when you gently shake it\n\n**3-5: Design a Fossil Preservation System**\nYour challenge: Using only plaster, sand, clay, and water, create a two-part mold that can make an accurate copy of a textured object (shell, leaf, or carved item). Your system must:\n- Capture all surface details (bumps, grooves, spirals) with at least 80% clarity\n- Separate into two pieces without breaking\n- Produce a replica that matches the original within 2 mm in key dimensions\n- Document which material (sand vs. clay) preserved details better and why\n\n### EDP Phase Targeted\n**Ask / Define Problem**\n\nThis phase fits best because the photo shows a real-world outcome (fossils preserved in rock) but students have not yet identified *how* to replicate it. The challenge asks them to first understand the problem (\"How do hard shells stay intact and detailed when buried?\") before jumping to solutions. This mirrors authentic paleontology: observing the result and working backward to the preservation process.\n\n### Suggested Materials\n- Plaster of Paris or air-dry clay\n- Fine sand and coarse sand\n- Water\n- Small shells, leaves, or polymer clay objects to mold\n- Shallow containers or ice-cube trays for mold frames\n- Measuring tools (ruler, calipers if available)\n- Spray bottle or sponge for moisture control\n\n### Estimated Time\n- **K-2**: 45–60 minutes (one session with drying time overnight optional)\n- **3-5**: Two 40-minute sessions (Session 1: create molds; Session 2: pour casts, compare results, analyze)\n\n### Why This Works for Teachers\nThis task directly addresses **NGSS ETS1.A** (defining problems and constraints) by having students reverse-engineer how nature preserves detail under pressure, then apply that understanding to design their own preservation system with measurable success criteria.",
