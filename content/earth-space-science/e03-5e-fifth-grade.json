Explain how water moves from Earth's surface into the atmosphere and forms clouds.\n2. Describe the relationship between cloud formation and weather patterns in Earth's atmosphere.\n3. Model the interaction between the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere using a physical or visual representation.\n4. Identify ways that understanding clouds helps communities prepare for and respond to weather events.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about clouds and the water cycle.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projector and screen (or printed large copy of the photograph)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the projector without any introduction. Allow 20-30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** in sequence (pause 15-20 seconds after each to allow thinking time):\n   - \"What do you notice in this photograph? What stands out to you?\"\n   - \"Where do you think all that water in the cloud came from? Could it have come from the ground below?\"\n   - \"Why do you think the cloud looks so big and white and fluffy instead of being invisible like the air?\"\n   - \"Do you think a cloud like this could bring rain to a community? How might people use information about this cloud to stay safe?\"\n\n3. **Record student responses** on chart paper without correcting them. This activates prior knowledge and reveals misconceptions to address later.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"Today we're going to become cloud scientists. We'll figure out exactly how water gets up into the sky, why it turns into clouds, and how clouds connect different parts of Earth—the water, the air, and the land.\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Before we can understand how this giant cloud formed, let's do an experiment to see the water cycle in action.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate condensation and the water cycle through hands-on experimentation.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4):**\n- Clear plastic cup or jar (8-12 oz)\n- Hot water (teacher-prepared, about 6-8 oz per cup)\n- Clear plastic wrap or a clear plate\n- Ice cubes in a small container (or ice pack)\n- Tape\n- Paper towels\n- Safety goggles (1 per student)\n- Thermometer (optional, for measuring temperature change)\n- Observation sheet (printed, see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Teacher Setup (5 minutes before activity):**\n- Fill cups 1/3 full with hot (not boiling) water. Use a kettle and pour in advance so temperature is safe (about 140°F / 60°C).\n- Place ice in containers so it's ready for students.\n- Arrange materials at each station.\n\n**Student Directions (written on board or provided as a handout):**\n\n1. **Put on your safety goggles.** Handle hot water carefully.\n\n2. **Observe the cup.** Look at the water inside. Record: Is there any visible water in the air above the water? (answer: no, you can't see it)\n\n3. **Cover the cup** with plastic wrap, securing it with tape around the edges so it's sealed but not too tight.\n\n4. **Place ice on top** of the plastic wrap directly over the center of the cup.\n\n5. **Wait 2-3 minutes.** Observe what happens to the underside of the plastic wrap.\n\n6. **Record your observations:** \n   - What do you see forming on the underside of the plastic wrap? \n   - Where did this water come from? \n   - What happened to make invisible water vapor become visible water droplets?\n\n7. **Draw a diagram** showing where the water came from (the hot water below) and where it went (the plastic wrap above).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"Where is the water going?\" \"Is the water disappearing or changing?\" \"What's happening when the ice cools the air?\"\n- Do NOT explain the answer; instead, prompt observation: \"Look closely at the plastic wrap. What's different from when we started?\"\n- Ensure safety with hot water; have paper towels nearby for spills.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents should observe that water droplets form on the underside of the plastic wrap (like dew on a window). They should make the connection that invisible water vapor rose from the hot water, and when it touched the cold surface, it turned into visible water droplets—similar to how clouds form in the atmosphere.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect the exploration to cloud formation in the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large poster with water cycle diagram (print or draw ahead of time)\n- The original photograph (projected again)\n- Vocabulary anchor chart paper\n- Markers (blue, white, brown)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share their observations and drawings.\n   - Record key observations: water vapor, condensation, water droplets, cold surface.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Display each term and definition on anchor chart as you explain:\n\n   **Evaporation:** Water from oceans, lakes, rivers, and soil gets heated by the sun and turns into an invisible gas called water vapor that rises into the air.\n   \n   **Condensation:** When water vapor rises high into the cold atmosphere, it cools down and turns back into tiny water droplets that we can see. This is what happened on your plastic wrap!\n   \n   **Cloud:** Billions and billions of tiny water droplets stuck together in the air. Clouds form when water vapor condenses high up in the atmosphere.\n   \n   **Atmosphere:** The layer of air that surrounds Earth. It's part of Earth's system and contains water vapor, clouds, and oxygen.\n   \n   **Water Cycle:** The continuous movement of water from Earth's surface (oceans, lakes, soil) into the atmosphere (as vapor and clouds) and back to the surface (as rain or snow).\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Redisplay the photograph.\n   - \"This enormous cloud formed through the exact same process you just saw in your cup. Invisible water vapor rose from oceans, lakes, and soil below. When it got high enough and cold enough, it condensed into water droplets. Billions of droplets together make a cloud like this.\"\n   - Point to the ground below the crane: \"That's the geosphere—Earth's land. The water vapor came from the hydrosphere—the water on Earth. The cloud is in the atmosphere—the air around Earth. All three are interacting right now to make this weather!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"Where does the water in a cloud come from originally?\" (oceans, lakes, rivers, soil)\n   - Ask: \"Why did the water turn into droplets in your cup?\" (it got cold)\n   - Ask: \"Why do clouds form up in the sky instead of down here?\" (the air gets colder as you go higher)\n\n**Vocabulary Anchor Chart to Create:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|--------------------------|\n| **Evaporation** | Water turns invisible and floats into the air because of heat from the sun |\n| **Condensation** | Invisible water vapor cools down and turns into visible water droplets |\n| **Cloud** | Trillions of tiny water droplets floating together in the sky |\n| **Atmosphere** | The air and gases that surround Earth |\n| **Water Cycle** | The continuous journey of water: evaporation → atmosphere → condensation → back to Earth |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents should understand that clouds form through evaporation and condensation, and that clouds represent the interaction between Earth's water (hydrosphere), air (atmosphere), and land (geosphere).\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to real-world weather prediction and community preparedness.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Cloud observation cards (printed images of 3-4 different cloud types: cumulus, stratus, cirrus)\n- \"Weather Detective\" worksheet (prepared ahead)\n- Optional: access to local weather forecast or weather radar image\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduction (2 minutes):**\n   \"Now that we understand how clouds form, let's think like meteorologists—scientists who study weather. Different clouds tell us different things about the weather. A cloud like the one in our photograph is a cumulus cloud, and it can mean thunderstorms are coming!\"\n\n2. **Cloud Detective Activity (10 minutes):**\n   - Show students 3-4 cloud type images (cumulus, stratus, cirrus).\n   - For each cloud, discuss:\n     - \"What does this cloud look like?\"\n     - \"What weather might this cloud bring? (rain, snow, sunny skies, thunderstorms)\"\n     - \"If you saw this cloud in the sky, what would you tell a community to help them prepare?\"\n\n3. **Real-World Application (5 minutes):**\n   - Display a local weather forecast or radar image from the current week.\n   - \"Meteorologists use satellites to watch clouds form and move, just like we watched water vapor condense in our cups. They use this information to warn communities about dangerous weather like heavy rain, hail, or tornadoes. Understanding clouds helps people stay safe!\"\n\n4. **Individual Application:**\n   - Provide each student a \"Weather Detective\" worksheet with this prompt:\n     - \"You're a meteorologist working for your town. A large cumulus cloud is forming over your community. Draw and label what's happening (evaporation, condensation, water cycle) and write one sentence explaining what weather might come and how people should prepare.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion by asking: \"What does this cloud tell us?\" and \"How is this helpful to communities?\"\n- Circulate while students work, asking: \"What process is happening in your drawing?\" and \"How does understanding the water cycle help predict weather?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nStudents should demonstrate understanding that clouds indicate specific weather patterns and that this knowledge helps communities prepare for severe weather events.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of cloud formation, the water cycle, and Earth systems interaction.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore phase: Can students identify where water came from and describe the condensation process?\n- Responses during Explain phase: Can students define evaporation, condensation, and cloud in their own words?\n- Group discussions: Do students make connections between the photograph and the water cycle?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (digital or printed) with these questions:\n\n1. **Draw and Label:** Draw a simple picture showing how a cloud forms. Label: sun, water (ocean/lake), water vapor, cold air, cloud, condensation.\n\n2. **Short Answer:** \"Explain how water gets from the ocean into the sky to make a cloud. Use the words evaporation and condensation.\"\n\n3. **Application:** \"Why is understanding how clouds form important for people who live in communities?\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- ✓ Student can identify evaporation as water rising from Earth's surface\n- ✓ Student can identify condensation as the process where water vapor turns into visible droplets\n- ✓ Student can explain that clouds form through the water cycle\n- ✓ Student can describe at least one way communities use cloud/weather information to stay safe\n- ✓ Student's drawing shows the three Earth systems (atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere) interacting\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\nMost Fifth Grade students should demonstrate understanding of basic evaporation and condensation, and make connections to real-world weather. Some may struggle with the invisible-to-visible transition of water vapor; these students benefit from the hands-on cup experiment as evidence.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary Anchor:** Create a reduced vocabulary list with only three terms (evaporation, condensation, cloud) with very simple definitions and visual icons. Repeat these terms consistently throughout the lesson.\n\n2. **Guided Observation Sheet:** Provide a partially completed diagram of the water cycle during the Explore phase, where students only need to label or color sections rather than draw from scratch. This reduces cognitive load while maintaining engagement.\n\n3. **Sentence Frames for Discussion:** Provide sentence starters for exit ticket responses:\n   - \"Water gets into the sky when the sun makes it... [evaporate]\"\n   - \"Clouds form when water vapor gets... [cold and turns into droplets]\"\n   - \"Communities use cloud information to... [predict storms and stay safe]\"\n\n### Challenge (Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Extended Water Cycle Research:** Ask advanced students to research and present on one additional stage of the water cycle not covered in the lesson: precipitation (rain/snow), collection (rivers flowing to oceans), or infiltration (water soaking into soil). Have them explain how this stage connects to cloud formation.\n\n2. **Multi-System Analysis:** Challenge students to create a more complex diagram showing how the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, AND biosphere (living things) all interact during the water cycle. For example: \"Plants release water through their leaves. Where does this water go? How does it connect to cloud formation?\"\n\n3. **Meteorology Career Connection:** Have advanced students research one job in meteorology or weather science and create a brief poster explaining what that person does and why understanding clouds is important for their work (e.g., storm chaser, weather forecaster, climate scientist).\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Cloud Journal (1-2 weeks):** Assign students to observe and sketch clouds visible from their home, school, or neighborhood each day for one week. Ask them to describe what they see, predict the weather, and record what actually happened. Bring journals back and create a class display showing the variety of clouds and weather predictions. This reinforces observation skills and connects to 5-ESS2-1 (system interactions).\n\n2. **Water Cycle Model Creation:** Have students build a 3D water cycle model using materials like blue felt or cellophane (water), cotton balls (clouds), painted boxes (oceans/mountains), and labels showing evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. This appeals to kinesthetic learners and deepens understanding of the cycle's continuous nature.\n\n3. **Local Community Weather Preparedness Project:** In connection with 5-ESS3-1, have students interview a local meteorologist, emergency manager, or community official about how their community uses weather information to protect residents. Students can create a poster or video presentation on \"How Our Community Stays Safe from Severe Weather\" and present to another class or at a school assembly.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Tip:** This lesson works beautifully in late spring when thunderstorms are common in many regions. If possible, time it so students can observe actual cumulus clouds forming during the day and discuss real-time weather prediction. This reinforces the relevance of the content to their immediate environment.",
