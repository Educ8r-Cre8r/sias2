ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about weather and measurement using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of rain gauge (displayed on whiteboard, projector, or printed for each student)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** of the rain gauge mounted on the wooden post. Ask students: \"What do you see in this picture? What do you think this tool is used for?\" Allow 1-2 minutes for students to turn and talk to a partner before sharing ideas aloud.\n\n2. **Ask guiding discussion questions:**\n   - \"Why do you think this tool has numbers on it?\"\n   - \"When would we use something like this, and why?\"\n   - \"What information could we learn by using this tool?\"\n   - \"Have you ever wondered how much rain falls during a rainstorm?\"\n\n3. **Launch a prediction prompt:** \"If we used a rain gauge every single day for a whole month, what patterns do you think we might notice? Would some days have more rain than others?\"\n\n4. **Record student wonderings** on chart paper to reference throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become weather scientists and learn how to use a rain gauge to measure rain, just like the one in the picture. We'll collect real data and discover patterns!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rainfall measurement and begin collecting weather data through hands-on observation and recording.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Rain gauge (or DIY rain gauge made from clear plastic containers with inch/centimeter markings)\n- Student data recording sheets (simple table with date, rainfall amount, observations)\n- Rulers and markers (if students help calibrate gauges)\n- Optional: Pictures or descriptions of rain gauges from different regions/countries\n- Outdoor access or classroom window with view of a measurement location\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Demonstrate rain gauge use:**\n   - Hold up or project an image of the rain gauge. Show students the graduated scale and explain that the numbers measure how much rain has collected.\n   - Demonstrate how to read the measurement by looking at the water level at eye level.\n   - Show students that after each reading, we write down the amount and then empty the gauge to start fresh.\n\n2. **Establish a classroom rain gauge location:**\n   - Walk students outside (or view from a window) and identify where the rain gauge will be placed—a location that catches rainfall without obstruction.\n   - Discuss why placement matters: \"Does it matter if we put it under a tree? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Student investigation task:**\n   - Divide class into small \"weather scientist teams\" (3-4 students per group).\n   - Assign each team a specific day this week when they will be responsible for reading and recording the rain gauge (or conduct daily as a whole class with student volunteers).\n   - Provide each student with a data recording sheet with columns for: Date, Time of Reading, Rainfall Amount (in inches or centimeters), and Observations (Was it raining? Cloudy? Sunny?).\n\n4. **Students begin collecting data:**\n   - If time allows, check the gauge once during this session and have students record their first measurement.\n   - Emphasize accuracy: \"We must read the number where the water level is, not where we think it should be.\"\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Students sketch or photograph the rain gauge in their science notebooks.\n   - Students write a prediction: \"Over the next week, I think we will collect about _____ inches of rain because...\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and observe how students read the gauge; provide immediate feedback if readings are inaccurate.\n- Ask probing questions: \"Why do you think that's the measurement?\" \"How are you reading the numbers?\"\n- Ensure safe handling of the gauge and that students understand the importance of consistent, accurate measurement.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully read and record their first rainfall measurement.\n- Students begin a data table with at least one entry.\n- Students demonstrate understanding of why rain gauges need careful placement and accurate reading.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts related to weather measurement and data representation after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Collected rainfall data from students (from Explore phase)\n- Pictures of rain gauges from different regions (optional)\n- Simple bar graph template (pre-drawn or blank)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out:**\n   - Ask 2-3 student teams to share their rainfall measurement and observation.\n   - Ask: \"Who measured more rain? Who measured less? What does that tell us?\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly explanations:\n\n   **Vocabulary:**\n   - **Precipitation:** Water that falls from clouds to Earth, including rain, snow, sleet, and hail. \"Precipitation is any form of water falling from the sky.\"\n   - **Rain Gauge:** A tool used to measure how much precipitation (especially rain) falls in a specific location. \"A rain gauge catches rain and has numbers so we can measure exactly how much fell.\"\n   - **Data:** Information collected from observations and measurements. \"Data is what we write down when we measure rainfall.\"\n   - **Pattern:** Something that happens in the same way repeatedly, which helps us predict what might happen next. \"If it rains a lot in spring, that's a pattern—it tells us what to expect.\"\n   - **Season:** One of four parts of the year (spring, summer, fall, winter) that have different typical weather. \"In some seasons, we expect more rain than others.\"\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph and Explore activity:**\n   - Return to the rain gauge photograph: \"This is exactly what we used to measure rainfall. The numbers help us read how much rain collected, just like we did today.\"\n   - Show how the data students collected is now being recorded: \"When we write down measurements in our table, we're creating data that scientists can use.\"\n\n4. **Introduce simple data representation:**\n   - Create a simple table on the whiteboard showing 2-3 days of sample rainfall data:\n     | Date | Rainfall (inches) |\n     |------|-------------------|\n     | Mon  | 0.5               |\n     | Tue  | 0.2               |\n     | Wed  | 0.8               |\n   \n   - Ask: \"Which day had the most rain? The least? How can we show this information in a picture so it's easy to understand?\"\n   - Introduce a simple vertical bar graph: Draw three bars on the board showing the height corresponding to rainfall amounts.\n   - Explain: \"A graph is a picture of data. When we make a graph, we can see patterns more easily than looking at numbers alone.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"What tool did we use to measure rain?\" (rain gauge)\n   - \"What is the information we collected called?\" (data)\n   - \"Why is it important to measure rain every day in the same place?\" (so we get accurate data and can see patterns)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand the purpose of rain gauges and can identify precipitation.\n- Students know that data is information we collect and can be organized in tables and graphs.\n- Students recognize that weather patterns help predict seasonal conditions.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by creating data displays and making predictions about seasonal patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Completed rainfall data from all observations so far\n- Graph paper or pre-drawn blank bar graph template\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Chart paper\n- Optional: Pictures or rainfall data from a different geographic region\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Create a class rainfall graph:**\n   - Collect all rainfall measurements from the week (or use compiled sample data if actual rainfall is still being gathered).\n   - As a class, create a large bar graph on chart paper or using a digital tool (Google Slides, etc.).\n   - Assign students to color in bars, label days/dates, and write the title: \"Our Classroom's Rainfall Data.\"\n   - Ask: \"What does our graph tell us about this week's weather? Was there a rainy day? A dry day?\"\n\n2. **Predict seasonal patterns:**\n   - Display the graph and ask: \"We collected data for one week. If we collected data for a whole month or a whole season, what pattern might we notice?\"\n   - Show students a picture or data sample from a different season (e.g., if it's fall, show spring rainfall data) or from a different geographic region with different typical precipitation.\n   - Compare: \"How is rainfall different in [Region A] compared to our community? Why do you think that might be?\"\n\n3. **Students make written predictions:**\n   - Provide a sentence frame: \"If we measure rainfall during [next season], I predict we will collect about _____ inches because _____.\"\n   - Students write or draw their prediction based on the data and patterns they've discussed.\n\n4. **Real-world connection:**\n   - Discuss: \"Why do farmers and gardeners care about rainfall? What happens if a place gets too much or too little rain?\"\n   - Explain: \"Weather scientists use rain gauges in many places to help predict what weather is coming so people can prepare.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students in reading the graph they created: \"Point to the tallest bar. What does it represent?\"\n- Facilitate comparison discussions: \"How is this data different from the picture of the other location?\"\n- Validate all predictions and encourage evidence-based reasoning: \"Why did you make that prediction?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students successfully create or contribute to a class bar graph showing rainfall data.\n- Students make reasonable predictions about seasonal rainfall patterns based on evidence.\n- Students articulate why measuring rainfall is important to understanding weather and climate.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of rainfall measurement, data collection, and pattern identification.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative assessment during lesson:**\n   - Observe student accuracy when reading and recording rainfall measurements.\n   - Listen to student responses during discussion questions to gauge understanding of precipitation and data.\n   - Review student data recording sheets for accurate entries and reasonable observations.\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (given at end of lesson):**\n\n   Provide each student with a half-sheet of paper with the following questions:\n\n   - **Question 1:** \"What does a rain gauge measure? Draw or write your answer.\"\n   - **Question 2:** \"Look at these two days of rainfall data: Monday = 1 inch, Tuesday = 0.5 inches. Which day had more rain? How do you know?\"\n   - **Question 3:** \"Why do scientists measure rain on the same day every week in the same place?\"\n\n3. **Success Criteria:**\n\n   Students demonstrate understanding if they:\n   - Correctly identify the purpose of a rain gauge (measures precipitation/rainfall).\n   - Accurately compare two data points and identify which is larger.\n   - Explain that consistent measurement in the same location creates reliable data for identifying patterns.\n   - Use vocabulary terms (precipitation, data, rain gauge) appropriately in their responses.\n\n4. **Data collection for ongoing assessment:**\n   - Collect exit tickets to review student understanding.\n   - Note which students can read and interpret simple data and which need additional support.\n   - Use responses to inform future lessons about weather and seasons.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate the ability to read a rain gauge and record data accurately.\n- Students show understanding that organized data can reveal patterns about weather.\n- Students can explain why measuring rainfall helps us understand and predict weather conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support:**\n\n- **Simplified data recording sheet:** For students who struggle with writing, provide a pre-made table where they only need to circle or point to the measurement and mark it with a checkmark, rather than writing the number.\n- **Buddy system for readings:** Pair struggling readers with proficient readers to read the rain gauge together; the partner reads the number aloud while the student points to it and confirms understanding.\n- **Verbal explanations:** Allow students who have difficulty writing or drawing to explain their understanding verbally to the teacher or a peer; record their explanation for them.\n\n**Challenge:**\n\n- **Extended data analysis:** Have advanced students track rainfall over several weeks and create multiple graphs (by week, by type of weather condition, comparing their data to another class or school). Ask them to identify trends: \"Is there more rain this week than last week? Why might that be?\"\n- **Regional climate comparison:** Provide advanced students with real rainfall data from different regions/biomes (desert, rainforest, temperate zone). Have them research and create comparison graphs showing how precipitation differs and hypothesize why based on geography and climate.\n- **Weather prediction project:** Challenge students to use their collected rainfall data to predict rainfall for the next week and then compare their prediction to actual data. Ask them to reflect: \"How accurate was my prediction? What did I learn that would help me predict better next time?\"\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Rainfall Across the Seasons:** Over the course of the school year, maintain a long-term rainfall data chart showing precipitation for each month. At the end of the year, create a large graph comparing all seasons and have students write a \"Weather Report\" describing which seasons had the most and least rain in your community and why that matters to plants and animals.\n\n2. **Design a Rain Gauge:** Provide students with clear containers, rulers, and markers. Challenge them to design and create their own rain gauge from scratch, thinking about why the opening needs to be a certain size and how to mark the measurements accurately. Test their gauges alongside the classroom gauge to see if they measure similarly.\n\n3. **Weather Reporter Presentation:** Have students become \"weather reporters\" for your community. Using their collected rainfall data and simple weather observations, students create a short presentation or poster showing \"typical weather for [season]\" and present it to another class or take it home to share with families, explaining how rain gauges help meteorologists predict weather.",
