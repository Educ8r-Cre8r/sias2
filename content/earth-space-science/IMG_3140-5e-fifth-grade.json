The presence of seaweed, rocks, and sediment on the shore demonstrates how water movement shapes coastal landscapes over time through erosion and deposition.\n\n- **Interaction of Earth Systems:** The image visibly displays three Earth systems interacting — the hydrosphere (ocean water and waves), the geosphere (sand and rock formations), and the atmosphere (hazy air suggesting dust or moisture). Students can see how these systems work together to create coastal environments.\n\n- **Human Impact on Natural Environments:** The presence of tall buildings and urban development in the background, combined with the hazy atmospheric conditions, illustrates how human communities exist within and interact with natural water and land systems, and how human activities may affect air quality and coastal areas.\n\n- **Water Distribution and Resources:** The photograph provides evidence of saltwater (ocean) as a major water reservoir on Earth, and raises questions about where fresh water comes from and why communities build near water sources.\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\n\n**Beach Detective: Uncovering How Water, Land, and Air Connect**\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 45-minute sessions (or one 90-minute block with a 10-minute break)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 5-ESS2-1 (Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact)\n  - 5-ESS2-2 (Describe and graph the amounts and percentages of water and fresh water in various reservoirs to provide evidence about the distribution of water on Earth)\n  - 5-ESS3-1 (Obtain and combine information about ways individual communities use science ideas to protect the Earth's resources and environment)\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to...\n\n1. **Identify at least three ways that water, land, air, and living things interact at a beach or coastal environment** using evidence from the photograph and their own investigations.\n\n2. **Explain how waves and water movement cause changes to sand and rock** through observation and hands-on modeling.\n\n3. **Compare saltwater and freshwater sources** and describe why coastal communities depend on water systems for survival and recreation.\n\n4. **Propose one way that people can help protect beaches and water systems from damage** based on information they research or discuss.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about coastal environments and activate prior knowledge about water systems.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph (large format if possible)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without any context or labels. Show it for 30 seconds in silence, allowing students to simply observe.\n\n2. **Ask students to \"Think-Pair-Share\":** \n   - Think silently (30 seconds): *What do you notice in this photograph? What is happening?*\n   - Turn to a partner (1 minute): Share your observations.\n   - Share out to the class (3-4 minutes): Record student observations on chart paper (expect answers like: \"There's a beach,\" \"People are swimming,\" \"Buildings,\" \"Foggy air,\" \"Birds,\" \"Waves,\" \"Sand\").\n\n3. **Pose these discussion questions to deepen thinking:**\n   - *\"Why do you think there are so many people at this beach? What are they using the water for?\"*\n   - *\"Look carefully at the sand and water. What do you see that might have come from the ocean? (seaweed, rocks, debris)\"*\n   - *\"Why is the air so hazy and hard to see the buildings clearly? Where might that haze come from?\"*\n   - *\"How do you think the beach looks different on a stormy day versus a calm day? What changes?\"*\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \n   - *\"Today you're going to become beach detectives. Your job is to figure out: How do water, land, and air all work together to create and change a beach? What do you predict we'll discover?\"*\n   - Write student predictions on chart paper.\n\n**Transition:** Now that you've made some predictions, let's do an experiment to see how water actually changes the beach.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how water movement erodes and shapes coastlines through hands-on modeling.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- One shallow rectangular baking pan or storage bin (9\" × 13\" or similar)\n- Sand (enough to fill pan 2-3 inches high) — beach sand is ideal; play sand works\n- Small pebbles or rocks\n- Water in a pitcher or spray bottle\n- Shells, seaweed, or plant material (optional, for realism)\n- Paper towels\n- Observation sheet (provided below) or science notebook\n- Rulers (optional, for measuring changes)\n\n**Activity — \"Wave Simulation Station\":**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Set up your model:**\n   - Fill your pan with sand to create a \"beach\" and \"ocean floor.\" Use your fingers to shape a sloping beach that rises up on one side (like the shore).\n   - Sprinkle rocks and shells across the sand to represent a rocky coastline.\n   - Place your pan where water won't drip onto other students' work.\n\n2. **Observe the starting conditions:**\n   - Draw a quick sketch of your beach model on your observation sheet. Label where the \"shore,\" \"shallow water,\" and \"deep water\" are.\n   - Write 3-4 observations: *What does your beach look like? Where are the rocks? How is the sand arranged?*\n\n3. **Create \"waves\" (Round 1: Gentle waves):**\n   - Slowly pour water from your pitcher onto the \"ocean\" side of your pan. Pour gently, as if creating calm waves. Do this for 30 seconds.\n   - **Observe and record:** What happened to the sand? Did the rocks move? Where did the sand go? Draw what you see now.\n\n4. **Create \"bigger waves\" (Round 2: Stronger wave action):**\n   - Now pour the water more forcefully onto the sloping beach. Tilt your pitcher slightly or pour from higher up. Do this for 45 seconds.\n   - **Observe and record:** What happened this time? Did more sand wash away? Which areas changed the most? Where did the rocks move? Did any small pieces break off the rocks? Draw what you see.\n\n5. **Create \"storm waves\" (Round 3: Heavy wave action):**\n   - Use your spray bottle or pitcher to create very forceful water movement on the beach for one minute. Really agitate the water.\n   - **Observe and record:** What is different now compared to Rounds 1 and 2? Is there more erosion? Has the shape of the beach changed dramatically? Can you see sand being transported away?\n\n6. **Make comparisons:**\n   - Look back at your three sketches. What pattern do you notice? Write: *\"As waves get stronger, the beach changes by...\"*\n\n**What to Record (Students document in science notebooks or on the observation sheet):**\n- Three labeled sketches (starting, after gentle waves, after strong waves, after storm waves)\n- Written observations at each stage (using sentence frames if needed: \"The sand _____,\" \"The rocks _____,\" \"The water _____\")\n- One comparison sentence: \"Stronger waves cause more _____ to happen.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups and listen to student observations without immediately correcting or explaining.\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"What do you notice changed from the first round to the second? Why do you think that happened? Can you point to where the sand moved?\"*\n- Encourage students to use descriptive language (eroded, transported, deposited, settled, washed away).\n- Do **not** introduce vocabulary yet; let students discover through observation.\n- If a group finishes early, ask them to predict what would happen if they repeated the experiment with a rockier beach or a beach with more vegetation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students should observe that stronger water movement causes more changes to the beach.\n- Students should notice sand being moved (transported) and rocks being affected.\n- Students should recognize that the shape of the coastline changes based on water action.\n- Students should be able to explain cause-and-effect: *stronger waves → more erosion and movement.*\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize observations into scientific vocabulary and connect to real-world coastal processes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with student observations from Explore phase\n- Vocabulary cards (printed or written on chart paper)\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Optional: short video clip of actual coastal erosion (2-3 minutes, if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Facilitate a group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to briefly describe what happened in their simulations.\n   - Ask the class: *\"What did all the groups notice? What was the same?\"*\n   - Record common findings on chart paper (e.g., \"Water moves sand,\" \"Rocks can break apart,\" \"The beach shape changes\").\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary (7 minutes):**\n   - Using the shared observations, introduce these five terms:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Erosion:** The wearing away and removal of rocks, soil, and sand by water, wind, or ice. *In your simulation, erosion happened when the waves washed the sand away from the beach.*\n\n- **Deposition:** The dropping and settling of eroded material (rocks, sand, soil) in a new location. *When water slowed down in your pan, sand settled on the bottom—that's deposition.*\n\n- **Weathering:** The breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by water, wind, temperature changes, or other forces. *Your rocks didn't disappear; water broke them into smaller pieces.*\n\n- **Hydrosphere:** All the water on Earth—oceans, lakes, rivers, ice, and water vapor in the air. *The ocean is a huge part of Earth's hydrosphere.*\n\n- **Geosphere:** The solid Earth—rocks, soil, mountains, and all the land. *Your sand and rocks represented the geosphere.*\n\n3. **Make connections to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Display the beach photograph again.\n   - Point out: *\"Look at the seaweed and broken shells on the real beach. That's deposition—the ocean deposited things that eroded from rocks and other places. The sand we see got there through erosion from rocks higher up the coast.\"*\n   - Ask: *\"What do you think happens to this real beach during storms? How is it like your model?\"*\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - Show a set of images or scenarios and ask: \"Is this erosion or deposition?\"\n   - Examples: \n     - A sand dune building up on a beach. (Deposition)\n     - Rocks breaking into smaller pieces in a river. (Weathering)\n     - Sand washing into the ocean during a storm. (Erosion)\n   - Use hand signals: Thumbs up = erosion, thumbs sideways = deposition, thumbs down = weathering.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that erosion, deposition, and weathering are processes that shape coastlines.\n- Students can use new vocabulary accurately in sentences related to their observations.\n- Students recognize that the hydrosphere (water) and geosphere (land) interact to create coastal changes.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply concepts to real-world coastal scenarios and systems interactions.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed image or short text about a real coastal community (e.g., a beach town, a coastal city, a place facing erosion)\n- Chart paper or digital presentation tool\n- Optional: Internet access for research\n\n**Activity — \"Coastal Community Investigation\":**\n\n**Scenario Setup:**\nExplain to students: *\"Coastal communities like the one in our photograph depend on beaches for recreation, fishing, and protection from storms. But erosion and water movement can damage beaches, homes, and infrastructure. Let's investigate how a real community protects its coastline.\"*\n\n**Choose one of these real scenarios (appropriate for Fifth Grade):**\n\n**Option A — Miami/Florida beaches:**\n- Beaches are eroding due to rising ocean levels and storm activity.\n- Communities build seawalls, groynes (rock structures), and use beach nourishment (adding sand).\n\n**Option B — California coastal cliffs:**\n- Waves and weathering cause cliffs to collapse.\n- Communities monitor erosion and restrict building in dangerous areas.\n\n**Option C — Pacific Northwest beaches (if your region is relevant):**\n- Sediment transport and storms reshape beaches seasonally.\n- Communities remove debris and restore native plants to stabilize beaches.\n\n**Student Task (small groups or pairs):**\n\n1. **Present the scenario** (or have groups research one):\n   - *\"This coastal community is dealing with [erosion / flooding / storm damage]. They are trying to protect their beach and the homes and businesses there. What science ideas could they use?\"*\n\n2. **Brainstorm solutions using what they've learned:**\n   - Can they use deposition (adding sand, building dunes)?\n   - Can they reduce erosion (building barriers, planting vegetation)?\n   - Can they work with the hydrosphere instead of against it (natural solutions)?\n\n3. **Create a simple plan on chart paper:**\n   - **Problem:** What is happening to the beach?\n   - **Earth Systems Involved:** Which systems (hydrosphere, geosphere, biosphere, atmosphere) are involved?\n   - **Our Solution:** What would we do? (Draw or describe)\n   - **Why it works:** Explain using erosion, deposition, or weathering concepts.\n\n4. **Share solutions with the class** (3-4 minutes for presentations).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide the scenario and any reference materials.\n- Circulate and ask questions: *\"How will that stop erosion? What happens to water flow when you do that? Will that solution last forever?\"*\n- Encourage students to think about trade-offs (a seawall stops erosion but might look ugly or block views).\n- Remind students to use their new vocabulary.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply erosion and deposition concepts to real-world problems.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that humans interact with Earth systems and must make decisions to protect environments.\n- Students recognize that protecting coasts requires understanding how water, land, and weather interact.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of Earth systems interactions, erosion, and coastal processes.\n\n**Formative Assessment (throughout lesson):**\n- **During Explore:** Observe student sketches and listen to explanations. Can they describe what happened to the beach?\n- **During Explain:** Use the \"thumbs up/sideways/down\" vocabulary check. Are students using erosion and deposition correctly?\n- **During Elaborate:** Assess student solutions. Do they show understanding of how water shapes land?\n\n**Summative Assessment — \"Beach Detective Exit Ticket\":**\n\nProvide each student with this assessment (read aloud for struggling readers):\n\n---\n\n**Name: _______________________ Date: _____________**\n\n**Beach Detective Challenge — Show What You Know**\n\n**1. Look at this photograph of a beach after a storm:**\n   [Provide a simple sketch or photo showing beach erosion/change]\n   \n   **Which Earth system caused the biggest change to this beach?**\n   - A) The atmosphere (air and weather)\n   - B) The hydrosphere (water in the ocean)\n   - C) The biosphere (plants and animals)\n   - D) The atmosphere and hydrosphere together\n\n   *Explain your answer in 1-2 sentences: Why did that system cause the change?*\n\n---\n\n**2. In our wave simulation, what happened to the sand when we poured water on the beach?**\n   - A) It compacted and got harder\n   - B) It washed away (eroded) and moved to a new place (deposition)\n   - C) It turned into rocks\n   - D) It stayed in the same place\n\n---\n\n**3. A coastal community wants to stop erosion on their beach. Which idea would BEST use what we learned about how water moves sand?**\n   - A) Build a tall wall to keep all water away from the beach\n   - B) Add more sand to the beach and plant grass to slow water movement\n   - C) Remove all the rocks from the beach\n   - D) Pour cement on the sand\n\n   *Why did you choose this answer?* (Use one of these words: **erosion, deposition, weathering**)\n\n---\n\n**4. Draw and label a simple diagram showing:**\n   - Where the hydrosphere is (circle it)\n   - Where the geosphere is (box it)\n   - An arrow showing how they interact (what does the hydrosphere DO to the geosphere?)\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| Criterion | Proficient | Developing | Beginning |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Identifies Earth systems in photos/scenarios** | Student correctly names 2+ systems and describes interaction | Student identifies systems but explains interaction vaguely | Student identifies 1 system or shows confusion |\n| **Uses vocabulary accurately** | Student uses erosion, deposition, or weathering correctly in 2+ sentences | Student uses 1 term correctly or uses terms with minor errors | Student does not use vocabulary or uses terms incorrectly |\n| **Explains cause-and-effect (water → land change)** | Student clearly explains how water causes sand/rock movement | Student shows partial understanding but explanation lacks detail | Student does not explain the relationship |\n| **Applies concepts to real problems** | Student proposes realistic solutions using understanding of water-land interaction | Student proposes solutions but reasoning is incomplete | Student's ideas show little connection to concepts |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students scoring proficient on 3-4 criteria demonstrate solid understanding of Earth systems and coastal processes.\n- Students scoring developing should be revisited with small-group review using the model.\n- Students scoring beginning need intensive review and re-modeling before moving to new concepts.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support for Struggling Learners:**\n\n1. **Provide sentence frames** for observations and explanations:\n   - *\"When the water was poured on the beach, the sand ___________.\"*\n   - *\"Erosion is when water ___________.\"*\n   - *\"The hydrosphere and geosphere interact when ___________.\"*\n\n2. **Pre-teach vocabulary** with images and manipulatives before the Explain phase. Use picture cards showing erosion, deposition, and weathering in familiar contexts (river bank, sandbox, sidewalk cracks).\n\n3. **Partner struggling readers/writers** with strong partners during Explore and Elaborate. Allow verbal explanations instead of written ones. Use video or images instead of text-heavy materials.\n\n4. **Simplify the Elaborate task** by providing a choice of 2 pre-developed coastal community scenarios with partially completed solution templates.\n\n**Challenge for Advanced Learners:**\n\n1. **Investigate water variables:** Have advanced students test how different water speeds, angles, or volumes affect erosion. Can they quantify erosion? (Measure sand displacement before/after.)\n\n2. **Research real erosion solutions:** Ask students to research and compare two real coastal protection methods (beach nourishment vs. seawalls). Create a comparison chart: *How do they work? What are pros/cons? How do they use Earth systems knowledge?* Have them present findings.\n\n3. **Model the water cycle:** Challenge students to extend their model to show where beach sand comes from (erosion of mountains/rivers), where it goes, and how it cycles. Create a multi-stage model showing upstream erosion → deposition on beach → ocean transport.\n\n4. **Predict long-term changes:** Show historical photographs of a coastline taken 20-50 years apart. Ask: *\"What does this tell us about erosion over time? If these trends continue, what will this beach look like in 100 years?\"*\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Coastal Erosion Timeline Project:**\n   - Provide students with 4-5 historical photographs of a famous eroding coastline (e.g., Cliffs of Dover, California coast, Great Lakes shoreline).\n   - Ask them to arrange photos chronologically and write captions explaining what erosion or deposition happened between each photo.\n   - Challenge: Calculate the rate of erosion if dates and distances are provided.\n\n2. **Fresh Water vs. Salt Water Investigation:**\n   - Connect to NGSS 5-ESS2-2 (water distribution).\n   - Have students create a pie chart showing the distribution of water on Earth (97% salt, 3% fresh; of fresh: 68% ice caps, 30% groundwater, 2% surface water).\n   - Discussion: *\"Why is this a problem for coastal communities? Where do they get drinking water?\"*\n   - Optional: Simple evaporation experiment showing how salt is left behind when seawater evaporates.\n\n3. **Virtual Beach Exploration:**\n   - Use Google Earth to virtually explore a real beach. Compare it to the photograph in your lesson.\n   - Have students document coastal features (seawalls, erosion patterns, human structures, wildlife).\n   - Write a report: *\"How are humans trying to live with or control water and land at this beach?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n**Timing Flexibility:**\n- If teaching in one 45-minute block, combine Engage + Explore in Day 1, and Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate in Day 2.\n- If using a single 90-minute session, proceed as planned with a 10-minute stretch break after Explore.\n\n**Safety Considerations:**\n- Ensure all water stations are away from electronics and walkways to prevent slipping.\n- Use lukewarm water (not cold or hot) in pans.\n- Provide paper towels for quick cleanup.\n- If students have sensitive skin, provide optional gloves.\n\n**Material Sourcing:**\n- Sand: Ask families to donate beach sand in recycled jars, or purchase from a hardware/garden store.\n- Shells and seaweed: Available at many beaches, or purchase from craft suppliers.\n- Pans: Use storage bins, baking pans, or shallow boxes — even aluminum foil roasting pans work.\n\n**Connection to Local Context:**\n- This lesson is most powerful if taught near a coast. If not, show photographs from your region's closest body of water (lake, river, or coast).\n- Invite a local geologist, environmental scientist, or beach restoration volunteer to share real-world erosion challenges.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson moves students from wonder to scientific understanding through direct observation and modeling, grounding abstract concepts in hands-on experience with coastal processes. The photograph serves as both anchor and inspiration for authentic Earth systems learning.",
