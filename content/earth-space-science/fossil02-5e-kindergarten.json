ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about fossils and what they tell us about Earth's past.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Displayed photograph (fossil02.jpeg) on interactive whiteboard, tablet, or printed large-format (at least 11\" × 14\")\n- Optional: real small fossil replica or fossil image card passed around\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board and say: \"Boys and girls, look at this special picture! These rocks have something hiding inside them. Can anyone guess what it might be?\"\n\n2. **Ask these discovery questions** (pause after each to allow responses):\n   - \"What do you see inside this rock? Does it look like anything you know?\"\n   - \"Do you think this is just a regular rock, or is it special? Why?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen a shape like this before? Where?\" (Guide toward: shells, spirals in nature)\n   - \"I wonder... could this be something from a long, long time ago?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"This is called a **fossil**. It shows us that a long time ago, there was a living creature right here in this spot. Can you imagine that? Let's become fossil detectives and learn more!\"\n\n4. **Wonder wall:** Write student responses on a chart: \"What we wonder about fossils...\" Save this for the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Now it's time to be real scientists and explore rocks just like these. We're going to search for fossils and discover what they tell us!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate rocks and fossil replicas through sensory exploration and observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small fossil replicas or molds (commercially available or 3D-printed; one per student or pair): trilobite, ammonite, shell, leaf\n- Variety of rocks (5-7 different types): smooth river rocks, textured sandstone, shiny rocks, light-colored rocks, dark rocks\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (1 per student or pair)\n- Small shallow trays or containers (1 per pair)\n- Paper and colored pencils for documenting\n- Touch mats or paper towels to organize materials\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. \"Sit with your partner. You are now fossil detectives!\"\n\n2. \"First, look at the fossil in your hand (or tray). Use your eyes and your fingers gently to explore it. What do you feel? Is it smooth, bumpy, hard? Tell your partner.\"\n\n3. \"Now look at it with the magnifying glass. Can you see any details you couldn't see before? Does it look like anything—a shell, a spiral, a leaf?\"\n\n4. \"Now pick a rock from the tray. Feel it. Look at it closely. Could a fossil be hiding inside? What makes you think so?\"\n\n5. \"Choose one fossil and one rock. Draw or color a picture of them. Write or tell me one thing you notice: Does the fossil look like it could have come from inside a rock like this?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions: \"What do you feel?\" \"Does this texture remind you of anything?\" \"Where do you think this fossil came from?\"\n- Avoid labeling—let students describe what they observe.\n- Encourage peer discussion: \"What does YOUR partner think?\"\n- Document photos or notes of student observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will handle fossils and rocks with care, noticing textures and shapes.\n- Pairs will discuss observations orally (primary mode for K).\n- Students will create a simple drawing or mark showing a fossil and a rock.\n- Students will begin to wonder about the connection between fossils and rocks.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and explain what fossils are and why they matter.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large photograph of fossil02.jpeg (for reference)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Fossil replicas used in Explore phase\n- Picture cards showing modern animals (snail, ammonite look-alike, leaf shapes)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 pairs to share what they drew and what they noticed.\n   - Point to specific features in the photo: \"Look at that spiral shape. [Student name] found that same shape in their fossil!\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Use simple, concrete language. Point to the photograph as you explain each term.\n\n   - **Fossil:** A print or copy of a plant or animal that lived a very, very long time ago. We find fossils inside rocks.\n   - **Rock:** A hard, natural material that makes up Earth. Fossils are found inside some rocks.\n   - **Long, long ago:** A time so far back that we can't count the years. Way, way before people and before most of the animals we know today.\n   - **Ancient:** Very, very old. These fossils are from ancient times.\n\n3. **Make connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Show fossil replica and modern animal picture side by side.\n   - \"This spiral is a fossil. It looks like a modern snail shell, doesn't it? That tells us an animal like this lived here long, long ago. The animal died, and its shell stayed in the rock for millions and millions of years.\"\n   - Point to the photograph: \"These rocks are like Earth's storybook. They tell us what lived here and what Earth was like long ago.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your hands: Can you make a fossil shape?\" (Students curl hand into spiral, show flat print, etc.)\n   - \"If I show you a picture of this rock, what's hiding inside?\" (Point to photo.)\n   - \"Who can tell me: Are fossils new or very, very old?\" (Thumbs up if old; wait for response.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n| Term | Kid-Friendly Definition |\n|------|------------------------|\n| **Fossil** | A picture or copy of an animal or plant from a very, very long time ago, found inside rocks. |\n| **Rock** | A hard material from the ground that makes up Earth. |\n| **Ancient** | Extremely, extremely old—way before today. |\n| **Long, long ago** | A time so far in the past we can't even count the years. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will understand that fossils are evidence of old living things.\n- Students will recognize that fossils are found in rocks.\n- Students will make a connection between fossils and modern animals/plants.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding to a new context and deepen their connection to fossils.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Modeling clay or playdough (1 small container per pair)\n- Small objects to press into clay: leaf, shell, feather, small toy animal, pine cone, button\n- Trays or containers to hold clay\n- Paper for labels or names\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**\"Making Our Own Fossil Prints\" (Simulation Activity):**\n\n1. **Set the scene:** \"Long, long ago, an animal died and its shell or body left a print in soft mud. Over millions of years, the mud became hard rock. We're going to make our own fossil prints—but we'll do it in minutes instead of millions of years!\"\n\n2. **Student steps:**\n   - \"Flatten your clay like soft mud.\"\n   - \"Choose an object—a leaf, shell, or feather. Press it gently into the clay.\"\n   - \"Take the object out. Look! You made a fossil print, just like real fossils.\"\n   - \"Tell your partner: What would be walking around on Earth when YOUR fossil was being made?\"\n\n3. **Extension prompt (for those finishing early or advanced learners):**\n   - \"If scientists found your fossil 100 years from now, what would they learn about what lived on Earth today?\"\n   - Students can press multiple objects or create a \"fossil scene.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate the clay work, ensuring objects are pressed gently (don't break clay).\n- Ask open-ended questions: \"What animal made this print?\" \"Where do you think this lived?\"\n- Record student explanations or take photos of their \"fossils.\"\n- Connect back: \"This is what scientists think happened in real life, but it took MUCH longer.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will create a clay fossil print and be able to identify what object made it.\n- Students will explain (orally) what animal or plant their fossil represents.\n- Students will show understanding that fossils are evidence of past life.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student learning through observation, discussion, and simple documentation.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation checklist** (teacher notes):\n  - [ ] Student handles fossils/rocks with curiosity and care.\n  - [ ] Student describes observations using sensory language (hard, bumpy, smooth).\n  - [ ] Student makes a connection between fossil and rock.\n  - [ ] Student uses word \"fossil\" or \"ancient\" appropriately.\n\n**Exit Assessment (end of Lesson 2, after Elaborate):**\n\n**\"Fossil Detective Challenge\" (Show-and-Tell Assessment):**\n\n1. Display the original photograph (fossil02.jpeg) again.\n\n2. Ask each student or pair:\n   - **Question 1:** \"Can you point to a fossil in this picture?\" (Success: Student points to shell or spiral structure.)\n   - **Question 2:** \"What does this fossil tell us?\" (Success: Student says something like \"An animal lived here a long time ago\" or \"This is very, very old.\")\n   - **Question 3:** \"Show me with your clay—make a fossil print of something that's alive today.\"\n\n3. **Optional written/drawn assessment:**\n   - Students draw or dictate (for recording): \"A long, long ago, I found a fossil. It was... [shape, what it looked like]\"\n   - Teacher scribes responses.\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Success Looks Like |\n|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Identify and describe fossils | Student points out fossil shapes and uses words like \"shell,\" \"spiral,\" or \"old.\" |\n| Observe and compare rocks | Student describes rocks using 2+ sensory words (hard, smooth, bumpy, light, dark). |\n| Explain fossils tell Earth's story | Student says fossils show plants/animals from long ago. |\n| Connect to changing Earth | Student understands through play that fossils are evidence of life that no longer exists in the same way. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students will correctly identify fossil in photograph.\n- 70% of students will say something indicating fossils are old or from the past.\n- All students will create a clay fossil print showing understanding of the concept.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Consistently use \"long, long ago\" and \"fossil\" with pictures. Avoid terms like \"ancient\" or \"geological time.\" Use hand motions (sweep hand far away) to show \"long ago.\"\n\n2. **Peer partnerships:** Pair with a stronger observer. The partner can describe while the struggling student listens and touches.\n\n3. **Sensory focus:** Emphasize touch and sight (not complex observations). Ask closed-ended questions: \"Is this hard or soft?\" \"Do you see a spiral?\" Rather than \"What do you notice?\"\n\n4. **Reduce choices:** Provide 2-3 objects for fossil pressing (not 10). Reduces decision fatigue.\n\n5. **Visual anchor chart:** Create a chart with pictures of a fossil, a rock, and a snail. Post it throughout the lesson for reference.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Compare and contrast:** \"How is this fossil different from a real snail? Where is it the same?\" Encourage detailed observation and discussion.\n\n2. **Storytelling extension:** \"Imagine YOU are the animal that made this fossil. Tell us: Where did you live? What did you eat? What happened to you?\" Record audio or video of their stories.\n\n3. **Fossil sequencing:** Provide images of 3 different fossils. Ask: \"Which one do you think is the OLDEST? Why?\" Introduce the idea that different fossils come from different times.\n\n4. **Create a fossil field guide:** Student creates a booklet with drawings of 3 fossils they explored, labels them, and writes (or dictates) one fact about each.\n\n5. **Paleontologist role-play:** Set up a \"dig site\" where students use small tools (plastic spoons) to carefully uncover fossil replicas buried in kinetic sand, acting as real scientists.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Fossil Hunt\" Scavenger Hunt (Classroom or Outdoor):**\n   - Hide fossil replicas or images around the classroom or playground.\n   - Students search with clipboards, finding and marking locations on a map.\n   - Debrief: \"Where did we find the most fossils? Why do scientists look for fossils in certain places?\"\n   - Connects to K-ESS3-1 (places where living things live).\n\n2. **Create a Classroom \"Museum of Fossils\":**\n   - Students display their clay fossil prints on a table with labels they create (with teacher support).\n   - Invite families for a \"museum opening.\"\n   - Students act as tour guides, explaining their fossils to visitors.\n   - Builds communication skills and deepens ownership of learning.\n\n3. **Book Extension: \"Fossils\" Picture Walk:**\n   - Read aloud a K-friendly picture book about fossils (e.g., *Fossils Tell of Long Ago* by Aliki or *National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Dinosaurs*).\n   - Pause to compare photos in the book to the original lesson photograph.\n   - Discuss: \"Did the animals in this book really live on Earth? How do we know?\" (Answer: We found their fossils!)\n   - Extends into Earth's history and biodiversity.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n\nThis lesson honors young learners' natural curiosity about \"old things\" and \"dinosaurs\" while building foundational understanding of fossils as evidence. The concrete, hands-on approach (holding real fossils, making clay prints) is critical for Kindergarten's developmental stage. The photograph serves as the anchor throughout, providing repeated reference points for explanation and deeper thinking. By the end of this lesson, students should walk away with the understanding that **Earth has a story written in rocks, and fossils are proof of that story.**",
