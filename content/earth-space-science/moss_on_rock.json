The moss appears soft and textured, with small, intricate details visible under magnification. It is growing on the surface of the rock, which has a rough texture and varies in color from light gray to reddish-brown. Some areas of the rock are exposed, while others are completely covered by the moss, creating a contrast between the green vegetation and the mineral surface.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThis image illustrates the process of **biological weathering** and **symbiosis**. The moss growing on the rock represents how living organisms can break down rocks over time through physical and chemical processes. Moss absorbs water and nutrients, which helps it grow and, in turn, weakens the rock by expanding its roots and releasing acids that dissolve minerals. This phenomenon is an example of how plants contribute to the weathering of rocks, shaping landscapes over long periods.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Weathering**: The breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by natural processes like wind, water, or living organisms.  \n2. **Symbiosis**: A close relationship between two different species where at least one benefits.  \n3. **Ecosystems**: Communities of living organisms interacting with their non-living environment.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>  \nIntroduce a \"Rock Erosion Experiment\" where students place small rocks in containers with water and moss (or sphagnum moss as a substitute).
