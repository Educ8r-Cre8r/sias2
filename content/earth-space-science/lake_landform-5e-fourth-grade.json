ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Activate curiosity about landscape change by examining the photograph closely.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital display of the photograph (lake_landform.jpg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: binoculars or magnifying glasses for students to examine details\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. Display the photograph large enough for all students to see clearly. Do NOT explain it yet.\n2. Ask students to look silently for 30 seconds, then turn to a partner and describe what they notice.\n3. Facilitate a whole-group \"notice and wonder\" discussion using these specific prompts:\n   - **\"What do you notice about the trees in this photograph? Why might some trees be standing and others be lying down in the water?\"**\n   - **\"Look at the shoreline—what do you see? What might have caused the beach/bank to look this way?\"**\n   - **\"If you could visit this lake one hundred years ago, what do you think it might have looked like different? What might change it?\"**\n   - **\"What do you wonder about how this lake and its shore got to look like this?\"**\n\n4. Record student observations and wonderings on chart paper without correcting misconceptions. Leave this visible throughout the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become landscape detectives. We'll investigate what we see here and discover how water is always busy changing the land around us.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students conduct hands-on investigations to discover how water causes erosion.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Shallow rectangular plastic trays or aluminum pans (1 per pair/group)\n- Sand and soil mixture (enough to fill trays halfway)\n- Water in containers with spouts or measuring cups\n- Ruler or measuring tape (metric)\n- Small sticks or twigs\n- Clipboard and observation sheets (see below)\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Optional: small rocks, leaves, grass clippings\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Water Erosion Investigation**\n\n1. Divide students into pairs or small groups. Assign each group a tray with sand/soil mixture.\n\n2. Have students **predict first:** \"If water flows over the sand like a stream, what do you think will happen? Draw what you predict on your observation sheet.\"\n\n3. Direct student actions (read aloud or display on board):\n   - \"Tilt your tray slightly so one end is higher than the other.\"\n   - \"Pour water slowly at the highest end. Watch carefully.\"\n   - \"Observe what happens to the sand and soil. How does it move?\"\n   - \"Use your ruler to measure how far the water moved the material.\"\n   - \"Draw or write what you observe.\"\n\n4. Students repeat with variations (faster water flow, adding \"vegetation\" like grass, adding small stones as \"barriers\").\n\n5. Each group records observations on an **Observation Sheet** with prompts:\n   - \"What happened when water flowed over the soil?\"\n   - \"How far did the material move?\"\n   - \"Did anything slow down the erosion? What?\"\n   - \"How is this like what we see in the photograph?\"\n\n**Part B: Connecting to the Photograph**\n\n6. Have students return to examining the photograph. Ask: **\"Where do you see erosion happening here? Point it out and explain what water might have done.\"** (Guide them to the fallen tree, the exposed shoreline, bare patches of soil.)\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate to ask probing questions without giving answers: *\"What do you notice happening? Why might the water do that? How is your model like the real lake?\"* Help students make the connection between their sand tray and the actual landscape.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe that water moves soil and sand.\n- Students measure and document erosion evidence.\n- Students begin to recognize that vegetation can slow erosion.\n- Students connect their model to the photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and connect exploration to scientific concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Images or diagram showing erosion process (teacher-created or from textbook)\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):** Call on 2-3 groups to share one observation from their erosion investigation. Ask the class: *\"Did everyone see something similar? What patterns do we notice?\"* Record key findings.\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):** Display and define each term with student-friendly language. Draw simple diagrams to illustrate:\n\n   - **Erosion:** The wearing away and movement of rocks and soil by water, wind, or ice over time.\n   - **Weathering:** The breaking down of rock and soil in one place (not moved).\n   - **Deposition:** When water or wind drops material it has been carrying, creating new landforms.\n   - **Landform:** A natural shape or feature of Earth's land surface, like a lake, mountain, or valley.\n\n3. **Connect to Evidence (3 minutes):** Point back to the photograph and explain:\n   - \"The fallen tree is evidence of erosion. Water at the base of the tree weakened the soil, so it fell.\"\n   - \"The exposed sand and soil on the shoreline show erosion happening right now.\"\n   - \"The lake itself is a landform created by water over a very long time.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:** Ask students to turn to a partner and complete this sentence: *\"Erosion is when water...\"* Listen for students to explain movement of material.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Erosion** | The wearing away and moving of rocks and soil by water, wind, ice, or living things. |\n| **Weathering** | The breaking down of rock and soil into smaller pieces in one place. |\n| **Deposition** | When water, wind, or ice drops or leaves behind the material it was carrying. |\n| **Landform** | A natural shape or feature on Earth's surface, such as a lake, mountain, hill, or valley. |\n| **Evidence** | Observable clues that show something happened. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary to describe what they observed.\n- Students connect the photograph to the terms \"erosion,\" \"weathering,\" and \"landform.\"\n- Students explain that water causes landscape change over time.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply erosion concepts to solve a real-world problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- New sand/soil trays (or refilled from Part A)\n- Water containers\n- \"Solution\" materials: small rocks, pebbles, grass, sticks, cloth, plastic netting, sand bags (provide variety)\n- Observation sheets for Part B\n- Ruler for measurement\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**\"Slow Down the Erosion\" Engineering Challenge**\n\n1. **Present the Problem (2 minutes):** \n   *\"Imagine you live next to a lake like the one in our photograph. Heavy rains are coming, and you're worried water will wash away your yard and damage your house. Engineers use their knowledge of erosion to solve this problem. Today, you'll test solutions to slow down erosion.\"*\n\n2. **Test and Compare Solutions (12 minutes):**\n   - Each group or pair receives a fresh tray of sand/soil.\n   - Groups choose 2–3 \"erosion-stopping materials\" to test (rocks, grass clippings, cloth, etc.).\n   - Groups repeat the water-flow experiment from Explore, but this time **with their chosen material** placed in the path of the water.\n   - Students measure and record: *\"How much soil moved? How far did the water carry it? Did the material slow erosion?\"*\n   - Have groups test one material at a time so they can compare.\n\n3. **Share Findings (4 minutes):** Groups report back:\n   - *\"Which material worked best? Why do you think that helped?\"*\n   - Record results on chart paper for all to see.\n\n4. **Real-World Connection (optional, 2 minutes):** Show students pictures of real erosion-control solutions if available (riprap, vegetation barriers, seawalls). Ask: *\"How are these like the solutions you tested?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:** Guide students to test fairly (same amount of water, same tilting of tray) and to think critically about *why* certain materials work. Ask: *\"What do plants do that rocks don't?\"* (They hold soil with roots.)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students test multiple solutions and gather evidence.\n- Students explain which solutions slowed erosion and why.\n- Students apply learning to real-world scenarios.\n- Students recognize that different materials have different effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess understanding of erosion, landscape change, and evidence-based explanation.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing):**\n- Observation during Explore and Elaborate: Are students making predictions, recording measurements, and explaining their reasoning?\n- Partner discussions: Can students use vocabulary appropriately and connect observations to erosion?\n- Questioning: Ask individuals, *\"Why did the tree fall in the photograph? What evidence shows us water changed this landscape?\"* Listen for use of vocabulary and logical explanations.\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (provide one of the following):**\n\n**Option 1 - Drawing with Explanation:**\nStudents draw a simple picture showing how water erodes a shoreline and label at least three things they observe. Write a sentence: \"This picture shows erosion because...\"\n\n**Option 2 - Written Response:**\nAnswer the following prompt: *\"Look at the photograph again. Write two things that show you water is changing this landscape. Explain how each one happened.\"*\n\n**Option 3 - Short Constructed Response:**\n*\"A family wants to build a house near a lake. Use what you learned about erosion to explain why they should be careful about where they build. What would you suggest they do to protect their house?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n- ✓ Student identifies at least two pieces of evidence of erosion or weathering from the photograph.\n- ✓ Student explains how water causes landscape change using appropriate vocabulary (erosion, weathering, landform, or evidence).\n- ✓ Student describes or tests a solution to reduce erosion with supporting reasoning.\n- ✓ Student uses observations or measurements to support their explanation.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that water is a powerful force that reshapes landscapes.\n- Students provide specific evidence from the photograph linked to erosion concepts.\n- Students propose reasonable solutions based on their investigation results.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Sentence Frames for Explanation:** Provide written sentence starters for exit tickets or discussions:\n   - *\"I see erosion happening because...\"*\n   - *\"The water moved the soil by...\"*\n   - *\"This material slowed erosion because...\"*\n\n2. **Partner with Observation Checklist:** Give students a simple checklist to complete during the Explore phase instead of open-ended recording:\n   - ☐ Water moved the soil\n   - ☐ Material traveled far / not far\n   - ☐ Sand/soil changed shape\n   - ☐ Something stopped the water\n\n3. **Simplified Measurement:** Allow students to use informal measurement (e.g., \"the water moved the soil 3 pencil lengths\") instead of metric rulers if they struggle with precision tools.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Investigate Multiple Variables:** Instead of testing one solution at a time, challenge advanced students to design a **controlled experiment** testing two materials simultaneously or investigating how the **slope angle** or **water speed** affects erosion rate. Have them create a data table and graph results.\n\n2. **Research Real Erosion Solutions:** Assign a mini-research project: *\"Find out how engineers protect real lakes, rivers, or coastlines from erosion. What materials do they use? Why?\"* Students present findings to the class.\n\n3. **Scale and Time Discussion:** Ask: *\"The fallen tree in the photograph might have taken 10–20 years to fall. How many thousands of years do you think it took to create this entire lake? What evidence helps you estimate?\"* Encourage students to think about rates of change and deep time.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Field Investigation (if accessible):** Take students to a nearby stream, pond, or erosion area. Have them photograph, sketch, and measure evidence of erosion. Compare their real-world observations to the photograph and their models. Create a class poster of findings.\n\n2. **Erosion Throughout Seasons:** Take a photograph of the same lakeside location in different seasons (or use archival photos from a local area). Have students compare and explain how seasonal weather (heavy rain, ice, wind) might cause different amounts of erosion. Create a timeline showing landscape change.\n\n3. **Design a Shoreline Protection Plan:** Students work in small groups as \"environmental engineers.\" Provide them with a map of a fictional lake and information about a community living along its shore. Students design a plan to reduce erosion damage, including materials they would use, where they'd place them, and why. They present their plans to the class for peer review.\n\n---",
