The garden itself is a cultivated natural resource humans use for food.\n- **Soil as a Natural Resource:** The soil visible in the photograph is the foundation for growing plants and supporting animal life. Soil quality and composition directly affect what can grow and what animals can thrive.\n- **Biodiversity and Habitat:** The garden environment—with plants, soil, and animals—represents an interconnected ecosystem where multiple organisms coexist and depend on each other and their physical environment.\n- **Water Distribution and Soil Systems:** Plants require water that moves through soil systems; the hydrosphere and geosphere interact to support life through nutrient cycles and water retention in soil.\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Title\n\n**Digging Into Soil: How Earth's Underground Treasure Supports Life**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Fifth Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** 80-90 minutes (two sessions: Session 1: Engage + Explore, 40 minutes; Session 2: Explain + Elaborate + Evaluate, 40-50 minutes)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - **5-ESS2-1:** Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.\n  - **5-ESS3-1:** Obtain and combine information about ways individual communities use science ideas to protect the Earth's resources and environment.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Describe** how soil, water, plants, and animals interact in an ecosystem (geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere connection).\n2. **Identify** soil as a natural resource that supports plant growth and animal life.\n3. **Explain** why soil quality matters for growing food that humans and animals depend on.\n4. **Design** a simple plan to protect soil and plant resources in a community garden or school setting.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about soil, gardens, and animal needs using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Projected or printed photograph of the squirrel in the garden\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or projector. Do not provide context immediately. Ask students to look carefully for 30 seconds in silence.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions in sequence:**\n   - *\"What is this animal doing? What do you notice it's holding?\"*\n   - *\"Where is the squirrel? What plants and materials do you see around it?\"*\n   - *\"Why do you think this food is growing in the soil? What does the plant need to grow?\"*\n   - *\"How do you think the squirrel found this food? What does the soil have to do with it?\"*\n\n3. **Record student responses** on chart paper without correcting them. Use phrases like \"I hear you thinking about...\" to validate all ideas.\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I'm wondering: What's inside the soil that makes it possible for gardens to grow food that animals like this squirrel can eat? Let's investigate!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore soil—the brown stuff beneath our feet—and discover how it connects to plants, animals, water, and food. Let's dig in!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate soil composition and its role in supporting plant growth through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Materials:** (per small group of 3-4 students)\n- 1 clear plastic cup or jar\n- 1 cup of soil collected from school grounds or premixed potting soil\n- Water (in a small pitcher)\n- Magnifying glass or hand lens\n- White paper plate or coffee filter\n- Small wooden stick or spoon for stirring\n- Paper towels\n- **Optional:** Small rocks, sand, leaves, or plant matter to add to investigation\n- Data collection sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity: Soil Layer Investigation**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Observe dry soil:** Place a handful of dry soil on the white paper plate. Use the magnifying glass to examine it closely.\n   - *\"What do you see? Are there different sizes of particles? Any rocks? Any bits of plant or leaves?\"*\n   - Record observations on the data sheet by drawing or writing.\n\n2. **Create soil layers in water:** Fill the clear cup halfway with water. Slowly pour soil into the water while stirring gently.\n   - *\"What happens? Can you see the soil separating into layers?\"*\n   - Let the mixture settle for 3-5 minutes and observe what happens.\n\n3. **Observe the layers:** After settling, students should see distinct layers (sand at bottom, silt in middle, clay and organic material at top).\n   - *\"Which layer is heaviest? Which is lightest? What do you think each layer does for plants?\"*\n   - Sketch the layers on the data collection sheet.\n\n4. **Test water absorption:** Pour water onto a small sample of soil on the paper towel.\n   - *\"How fast does water soak in? Where do you think this water goes? Why would plants need water in soil?\"*\n   - Record observations.\n\n**Data Collection Sheet Prompts:**\n- Draw what dry soil looks like under magnification.\n- Draw the layers you see after water is added.\n- Write or draw: What did you find in the soil? (rocks, sand, bits of plants, etc.)\n- Write: Why do you think squirrels and other animals depend on soil?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between groups and ask guiding questions:\n  - *\"Why do you think that layer settled first?\"*\n  - *\"What does a plant need from soil to grow?\"*\n  - *\"How is soil like a home or a pantry for animals and plants?\"*\n- Do not explain layers or function yet—let students wonder and hypothesize.\n- Ensure all students handle materials and record observations.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover soil is not a single material but a mixture of particles and organic matter.\n- Students observe that water moves through soil.\n- Students make connections between soil composition and plant/animal survival (e.g., \"Plants need water from soil so they grow big, and then animals eat the plants\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and Earth systems concepts; formalize student discoveries.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with labeled soil composition diagram\n- Photograph from Engage phase (displayed again)\n- Simple Earth systems diagram (geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere labels)\n- Markers/colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share what they observed during exploration.\n   - Display their data collection sheets side by side.\n   - Ask the class: *\"What did most groups notice? What was similar? What was different?\"*\n   - Affirm observations: \"Great noticing! Soil really is a mix of things, and water does move through it!\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n\n   Present each term with a visual and definition written for Fifth Grade level:\n\n   - **Soil:** A natural material made up of tiny broken rocks, minerals, and dead plant and animal material (called organic matter). It's like a recipe with many ingredients!\n   \n   - **Geosphere:** All the solid parts of Earth—rocks, soil, minerals, and the ground beneath us.\n   \n   - **Hydrosphere:** All the water on Earth—oceans, lakes, rivers, groundwater, and water in soil.\n   \n   - **Biosphere:** All the living things on Earth—plants, animals, and tiny creatures we can't see.\n   \n   - **Natural Resource:** Something from nature that people, plants, and animals need to survive (like soil, water, and plants).\n\n3. **Make Connections to the Photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Redisplay the squirrel photo.\n   - Point to each Earth system:\n     - *\"The soil (geosphere) holds water (hydrosphere) that helps these plants grow (biosphere).\"*\n     - *\"The squirrel (biosphere) eats the carrot from the soil (geosphere). All these parts work together!\"*\n   - Draw a simple flow diagram on the board: **Soil → Water → Plant Growth → Food for Animals**\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (2 minutes):**\n   - Ask: *\"Soil is one of Earth's _____ _____ (natural resources) because plants and animals need it to _____.\"*\n   - Have students respond with thumbs up/middle/down: \"Do you understand how soil helps plants and animals?\"\n\n**Vocabulary Reference Chart:**\nPost this in the classroom for the rest of the unit:\n- **Soil** = Geosphere ingredient that holds water and nutrients for plants\n- **Hydrosphere** = Water that moves through soil\n- **Biosphere** = Living things (plants, animals) that depend on soil and water\n- **Interaction** = When two or more things affect each other (soil feeds plants; plants feed animals)\n- **Natural Resource** = Something nature provides that living things need\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use vocabulary to describe the photograph and their soil observations.\n- Students can articulate how geosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere interact in a simple garden system.\n- Students recognize soil as a natural resource.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply understanding of soil and Earth systems to a real-world scenario about protecting garden resources.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Image or description of a community garden (or actual photos from your town/school garden)\n- \"Soil Protection Plan\" worksheet (see template below)\n- Colored pencils or markers\n- Optional: Video clip (2-3 min) showing a community garden project\n\n**Activity: Design a Soil Protection Plan**\n\n1. **Present a Real-World Context (3 minutes):**\n   - Show students an image of a community garden or describe one in your school/neighborhood.\n   - Explain: *\"In many communities, people work together to grow food in gardens. But soil can get damaged if we don't care for it. Your job is to think like a community scientist and create a plan to protect the soil and plants.\"*\n\n2. **Guided Planning (10 minutes):**\n   - Provide the **Soil Protection Plan worksheet** with these prompts:\n\n     **Soil Protection Plan**\n     \n     *Name the garden:* ___________________\n     \n     *What plants would you grow?* Draw or list them.\n     \n     *What does soil need to stay healthy?* (Hint: Think about water, nutrients, and what you learned.)\n     - [ ] Water\n     - [ ] Protection from erosion (soil washing away)\n     - [ ] Organic matter (plant scraps, leaves)\n     - [ ] No toxic chemicals\n     \n     *How would you protect the soil in your garden? Draw or write your plan.*\n     \n     *How does protecting soil help animals like the squirrel?*\n\n3. **Student Work (5-7 minutes):**\n   - Students work individually or in pairs to complete their Soil Protection Plan.\n   - Teacher circulates, asking prompts:\n     - *\"Where would water come from in your garden? How does it help the soil?\"*\n     - *\"What happens if soil doesn't get water?\"*\n     - *\"How does a healthy soil make healthy plants for animals to eat?\"*\n\n4. **Optional Share (if time):** Invite 1-2 students to share their plans aloud.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Validate all responses; there are multiple correct approaches.\n- Guide students who struggle to connect soil health to plant/animal survival by pointing back to the photograph and Explore activity.\n- Ask extension questions: *\"What would happen if we didn't protect the soil? Could the squirrel find food?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that soil protection is essential for plant growth and animal survival.\n- Students identify 2-3 specific ways to maintain soil health (watering, preventing erosion, adding organic matter).\n- Students articulate the relationship: *Healthy soil → Healthy plants → Food for animals.*\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of soil as a natural resource and its role in ecosystem interactions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observe during Explore: Do students ask questions about soil layers and water movement?\n- Listen during group share-outs: Can they use vocabulary (soil, geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere) to describe observations?\n- Review data collection sheets: Do sketches and notes show understanding of soil composition?\n- Circulate during Elaborate: Do students' plans show understanding of soil's needs?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5-7 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with this **Exit Ticket** (on paper or digital):\n\n---\n\n**Soil & Life Exit Ticket**\n\n**Name:** _________________ **Date:** _________________\n\n**Answer these questions:**\n\n1. **Draw and label:** Show how a plant, soil, water, and a squirrel are connected. (You can use words and arrows.)\n\n2. **True or False:** \n   - Soil is a natural resource that plants and animals need. _____\n   - Water doesn't move through soil. _____\n   - Soil is made of only one type of material. _____\n\n3. **Short Answer:** Why is healthy soil important for the squirrel in the photograph?\n   ___________________________________________________________________\n   ___________________________________________________________________\n\n4. **Reflect:** What surprised you most about soil during this lesson?\n   ___________________________________________________________________\n\n---\n\n**Success Criteria for Meeting Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Objective | Evidence of Understanding |\n|-----------|---------------------------|\n| **Describe geosphere-hydrosphere-biosphere interactions** | Exit ticket Q1 shows at least three Earth systems connected with arrows/lines; student labels are accurate. |\n| **Identify soil as a natural resource** | Exit ticket Q2: Both \"True\" answers correct; student can explain why. |\n| **Explain soil quality's importance for food** | Exit ticket Q3: Student response mentions plants needing soil/water to grow, and animals eating plants. |\n| **Design a protection plan** | Elaborate worksheet shows 2+ specific soil-protection strategies that connect to plant/animal health. |\n\n**How to Determine Success:**\n- **Mastery (90-100%):** Student demonstrates all four criteria; uses vocabulary correctly; makes clear connections between systems.\n- **Proficient (80-89%):** Student meets 3-4 criteria; uses vocabulary with occasional prompts; understands key relationships.\n- **Developing (70-79%):** Student meets 2-3 criteria; vocabulary use inconsistent; understands some relationships with scaffolding.\n- **Needs Support (<70%):** Student meets 1-2 criteria; requires vocabulary support; lacks clear understanding of connections.\n\n**Collect and review exit tickets before Session 2 to identify students needing reteaching during differentiation time.**\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Guided Observation During Explore:**\n   - Pair with a strong science partner.\n   - Provide a **simplified data sheet with pictures and check-boxes** instead of open-ended drawing/writing:\n     - ☐ I saw rocks in the soil.\n     - ☐ I saw bits of plants in the soil.\n     - ☐ Water soaked into the soil.\n     - ☐ The soil separated into layers.\n   - Use hand-over-hand guidance during water layering activity to ensure success.\n\n2. **Sentence Stems for Discussion:**\n   - Provide sentence frames for Explain and Elaborate phases:\n     - *\"Soil helps plants because _____________.\"*\n     - *\"The squirrel needs the carrot because _____________.\"*\n     - *\"To protect soil, we should _____________.\"*\n\n3. **Vocabulary Support:**\n   - Create an **illustrated vocabulary card set** with photos/drawings and simple definitions.\n   - Reference these cards during all discussions.\n   - Allow student to use cards during exit ticket if needed.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Soil Testing:**\n   - Ask advanced students to test **multiple soil samples** (potting soil, garden soil, sand, clay) and compare properties:\n     - Which soil holds water longest?\n     - Which soil would be best for growing specific plants?\n   - Have them create a **comparison chart** and hypothesize why different plants need different soils.\n\n2. **Ecosystem Connection Research:**\n   - Provide 1-2 age-appropriate articles or videos about **soil organisms** (earthworms, beetles, fungi) that help soil stay healthy.\n   - Ask: *\"How do these tiny creatures help the squirrel in the photograph?\"*\n   - Students create a **\"Soil Food Web\" diagram** showing how decomposers, plants, and animals interact.\n\n3. **Design a More Complex Protection Plan:**\n   - Ask advanced students to include in their Soil Protection Plan:\n     - A **water conservation strategy** (e.g., mulching to retain moisture)\n     - A **composting plan** to add nutrients back to soil\n     - A way to test if their plan is working (e.g., measure plant growth over time)\n     - Cost estimate or timeline for implementation\n   - Encourage them to present as a \"pitch\" to community leaders.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n### Extension 1: Bring Soil to Life – Soil Sample Jar (Homework or Take-Home)\n\n**Objective:** Observe soil composition and organisms over time.\n\n**Instructions for Students:**\n1. Fill a clear jar 3/4 full with soil from home, a park, or the school yard.\n2. Add water until the jar is 7/8 full; seal with a lid.\n3. Shake vigorously for 1 minute.\n4. Set on a shelf at home and **observe daily for 5 days.**\n5. Sketch what you see each day:\n   - Day 1: Layers forming?\n   - Day 3: Clear separation?\n   - Day 5: Any organisms visible? (tiny bugs, worms?)\n6. Bring observations back to class and compare with classmates' jars.\n7. Discuss: *\"Why did layers form at different speeds? What does this tell us about soil?\"*\n\n---\n\n### Extension 2: Visit a Real Garden or Create a Classroom Micro-Garden\n\n**Objective:** Apply learning by observing or growing plants in actual soil.\n\n**Option A – Field Visit (if available):**\n- Visit a school garden, community garden, or park.\n- Use **observation sheets** to note:\n  - What plants are growing?\n  - What animals do you see near the plants?\n  - How are people protecting the soil? (mulch, fencing, etc.)\n  - How is water being managed?\n\n**Option B – Classroom Micro-Garden:**\n- Plant fast-growing seeds (radish, lettuce, or bean) in clear cups with soil layers.\n- Students observe over 2-3 weeks:\n  - How do roots grow into soil?\n  - Does the plant need water? How often?\n  - Can the class \"harvest\" and donate food to a local food bank?\n- Journal weekly growth observations.\n\n---\n\n### Extension 3: Community Resource Interview or Documentary\n\n**Objective:** Investigate how communities protect soil and food resources.\n\n**Activity:**\n1. **Interview a gardener, farmer, or park manager** (in person, via video call, or pre-recorded video):\n   - *\"How do you keep your soil healthy?\"*\n   - *\"What challenges do you face protecting soil?\"*\n   - *\"How does your work help animals?\"*\n\n2. **Create a simple poster, podcast, or video** summarizing what you learned.\n\n3. **Share findings** with the class and discuss:\n   - *\"How is protecting soil a community responsibility?\"* (Connects to 5-ESS3-1)\n\n---\n\n## Additional Notes for Teachers\n\n**Safety Reminders:**\n- Ensure students wash hands thoroughly after handling soil.\n- Use non-toxic, classroom-safe soil (potting soil is safer than outdoor soil, which may contain bacteria).\n- Supervise water use to prevent spills.\n\n**Accessibility:**\n- Provide alternative ways to record observations (verbal, dictation, drawing) for students with fine motor challenges.\n- Use large magnifying glasses or document cameras to project soil samples for students with visual needs.\n\n**Connection to Prior/Future Learning:**\n- **Prior:** Students should understand basic plant needs (water, sunlight, soil) from K-2 life science.\n- **Future:** This lesson scaffolds toward Grade 5-6 investigations of erosion, weathering, and complete water cycles; Grade 6-8 ecosystem dynamics and food chains.\n\n**Real-World Relevance:**\n- Emphasize that soil is a **finite, slow-to-replace resource**—it takes 100+ years for one inch to form naturally.\n- Highlight how soil protection connects to food security, climate action, and environmental justice (not all communities have equal access to healthy soil and gardens).\n\n---\n\nThis lesson positions soil not as inert dirt, but as a dynamic, living resource that sustains all life—a concept Fifth Graders can grasp concretely through observation and can apply meaningfully to their own communities.",
