Describe what fog and mist are and explain how water changes from a liquid to a gas and back again.\n2. Observe and record weather conditions (temperature, moisture, time of day) and predict when fog might appear.\n3. Represent weather data in a simple table or drawing to show how weather changes throughout the day.\n4. Explain how understanding weather patterns helps people prepare for different seasonal conditions.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph (high quality, large display)\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed poster at the front of the room. Do not explain it yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to \"Look and Wonder\"** for 1-2 minutes in silent observation. They may turn to a partner and whisper what they notice, but do not explain.\n\n3. **Facilitate a discussion with these specific questions:**\n   - \"What do you see covering the fields in this picture? What does it look like?\" (Guide toward: fog, mist, cloud, haze)\n   - \"Where do you think this white, cloudy stuff comes from?\" (Accept all ideas—write them on chart paper)\n   - \"Have you ever seen fog or mist like this? When did you see it?\" (Connect to their own experiences: near a lake, early morning, after rain, etc.)\n   - \"Why do you think the mist is here in the morning and not in the afternoon? What might make it go away?\" (Plant the seed that heat/sun causes changes)\n\n4. **Prediction Prompt:** \"I'm going to show you how water can hide in the air and become mist. What do you predict will happen if I breathe on a cold mirror?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's do some exploring to discover what's really happening when we see mist like this in the photograph.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per student or pair):**\n- Small hand mirrors (or smartphone screens, or aluminum foil wrapped around cardboard)\n- Warm water in a cup\n- Paper towels\n- Observation recording sheet (provided by teacher, with space for drawings/words)\n- Thermometer (optional, for teacher demonstration)\n- Clear plastic bags (1 per pair)\n- Rubber bands\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Mirror/Breath Investigation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Distribute mirrors to students.** Explain: \"You're going to be scientists discovering what happens when water disappears into the air.\"\n\n2. **Direct students:** \"Look at your mirror. It's clear and dry, right? Now, cup the mirror in your hand and breathe on it slowly and steadily for 3-4 seconds. What happens to the mirror?\"\n\n3. **Students should observe:** The mirror becomes foggy/cloudy from their warm breath.\n\n4. **Ask follow-up questions:**\n   - \"Where did this foggy stuff come from?\" (From inside your body—the air you breathe out has water in it)\n   - \"Why did it appear on the cold mirror?\" (Your warm breath cooled down when it hit the cold mirror, and the water changed from invisible air into tiny droplets you can see)\n   - \"How is this like the mist in the picture?\" (Water that you can't see becomes water you can see)\n\n5. **Students record observations** on their sheet by drawing the mirror before and after, or writing \"fogged up\" and \"clear.\"\n\n**Part B: Water Cycle in a Bag (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Pour about 2 tablespoons of warm water into a clear plastic bag per pair.** Add a small piece of food coloring if available (optional, for visibility).\n\n2. **Instruct students:** \"Seal this bag and place it on a sunny windowsill. You're going to watch water change states over the next few days—just like what happens in the big world!\"\n\n3. **Explain the prediction:** \"Water will evaporate (disappear into the air as an invisible gas). You'll see droplets form on the bag (condensation). This is what happens in the field—the sun heats water, it goes up into the air, and when it gets cold, it turns back into droplets we call mist.\"\n\n4. **Students label their bags with their names and date.**\n\n5. **Record observations on the sheet:** Draw or write what they see happening in the bag.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask probing questions: \"What's happening to the water?\" \"Where do you think the water is going?\" \"Why are those droplets forming on the top of the bag?\"\n- Do NOT say \"evaporation\" or \"condensation\" yet—let students use their own words.\n- Emphasize that water is moving but it's invisible most of the time.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and describe fog forming on mirrors from breath.\n- Students create a mini water cycle in a bag and make predictions about changes.\n- Students use observation sheets to record what they see (drawings or words).\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Printed vocabulary cards with pictures\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student observation sheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students in a circle** where they can see the displayed photograph and chart paper.\n\n2. **Facilitate a group share-out:**\n   - \"Who can tell us what happened when you breathed on the mirror?\" (Call on 2-3 students)\n   - \"What did you notice in your water bag?\" (Call on 2-3 students)\n   - \"How was your mirror fog like the mist in the big picture?\" (Guide the connection)\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** using student-friendly language and visual aids:\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n- **Fog/Mist:** Tiny water droplets floating in the air that are cold enough to see. It's like clouds that touch the ground.\n- **Evaporation:** When water turns from a liquid (wet) into an invisible gas that floats in the air. The sun's heat makes this happen.\n- **Condensation:** When invisible water vapor in the air cools down and turns back into tiny water droplets you can see. This is what makes fog and the droplets on your mirror.\n- **Water Cycle:** The way water moves around Earth—it evaporates from water and soil, floats in the air, and condenses back into rain, fog, or dew.\n- **Weather:** What the air is like outside at any particular time (hot/cold, dry/wet, sunny/cloudy).\n\n4. **Make explicit connections back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to the mist in the image: \"This is condensation happening in nature. The water from the river and wet soil evaporated during the day. When the temperature dropped at dawn, the water vapor condensed, and we can see it as fog.\"\n   - Point to the field: \"Farmers care about fog and dew because it affects their plants and when they can work in the fields.\"\n   - Point to the sky colors: \"This photo was taken at sunrise. The sun is just coming up. Soon, the sun will warm the air, the fog will evaporate, and it will disappear.\"\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Show me thumbs up if you can explain where the mist came from.\" (Observe responses)\n   - \"Turn to your partner and whisper: If the sun gets hotter, what will happen to this fog?\"\n   - Ask 2-3 students to answer the partner question aloud.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use correct vocabulary (fog, evaporation, condensation) to describe what they observed.\n- Students connect the photograph to the water cycle concepts.\n- Students understand that water changes states and that temperature causes these changes.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Weather observation chart (teacher-created, see below)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Optional: Real thermometer for classroom display\n- Chart paper\n- Drawing paper for each student\n\n**Activity: Weather Detective Challenge**\n\n1. **Introduce the task:** \"Scientists who study weather are called meteorologists. They keep track of how weather changes throughout the day and the seasons. We're going to be meteorologists and predict when fog happens.\"\n\n2. **Show students a simple weather observation chart** with these columns:\n   - Time of Day (early morning, midday, late afternoon)\n   - Temperature (cold, warm, hot)\n   - What We See (fog/mist, clear sky, clouds)\n   - Sun's Position (low/rising, high, low/setting)\n\n3. **Use the photograph to fill in the chart together:**\n   - Early morning + Cold air + Lots of water in the soil + Sun is low = FOG appears\n   - Midday + Warm air + Sun is high = Fog evaporates, disappears\n   - Late afternoon + Starting to cool + Sun is lower = Conditions becoming right for fog later\n\n4. **Extend the thinking:** \"When is fog most likely to happen? Why do you think farmers care about knowing when fog appears? Could fog ever be a problem?\"\n\n5. **Independent application:** Students complete a simple prediction activity:\n   - \"Draw or write: When is fog most likely to happen in our area? (Morning/afternoon/evening) Why?\"\n   - Provide sentence frames: \"Fog happens in the morning because ________.\" \"Fog disappears when the ________ gets warm.\"\n\n6. **Real-world connection:** \"Farmers use weather predictions to plan when to harvest, spray crops, or move animals. Drivers need to know about fog because it makes it hard to see the road. Understanding the water cycle helps people stay safe!\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide students to see patterns (cool temperature + moisture = fog).\n- Ask: \"What time of year do you think has the most fog? Why?\"\n- Accept all reasonable predictions; emphasize that scientists make predictions based on patterns.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students fill out a weather observation chart showing understanding of when and why fog forms.\n- Students make reasonable predictions about fog formation based on temperature and time of day.\n- Students articulate one real-world reason why understanding fog/weather matters.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding.\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- Observation of student responses during Engage discussion\n- Quality of drawings and descriptions on observation sheets during Explore\n- Accuracy of vocabulary use during group Explain discussion\n- Responses during \"Check for Understanding\" (thumbs up, turn-and-talk)\n\n**Summative Assessment: Exit Ticket (5-10 minutes)**\n\nAdminister this at the end of Session 2 (after Elaborate). Students may draw, write, or dictate answers.\n\n**Exit Ticket Questions:**\n\n1. **\"Where does the fog in the picture come from?\"**\n   - Success Criteria: Student mentions water from soil/water body, evaporation, or air becoming visible. Accept answers like: \"Water goes into the air and comes back down\" or \"Water that we can't see becomes water we can see.\"\n\n2. **\"Why do you see fog in the morning but not in the afternoon?\"**\n   - Success Criteria: Student mentions sun warming the air, heat, or that the fog \"disappears\" or \"goes away\" when it's warmer. Answers like \"The sun heats it up\" or \"It evaporates\" show understanding.\n\n3. **\"What would you tell a farmer about fog?\"**\n   - Success Criteria: Student explains that fog is related to water, happens at certain times, or affects what farmers can do. (This directly addresses NGSS 3-ESS3-1 by having students think about practical implications of weather.)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Student accurately describes the source of fog (water evaporating and condensing).\n- Student explains the role of temperature/sun in fog formation.\n- Student applies understanding to a real-world scenario (farming, safety, etc.).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify that fog is water from soil/water that has become visible.\n- 75% of students explain that sun/heat causes fog to disappear.\n- 70% of students make a meaningful connection to a real-world application.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Sentence Frames:** Provide pre-written sentence starters for all writing tasks:\n   - \"The fog comes from _________.\"\n   - \"When the sun gets warm, the fog will _________.\"\n   - \"A farmer needs to know about fog because _________.\"\n\n2. **Simplified Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a visual chart with ONE sentence per term (fog, evaporation, condensation) with pictures. Keep this posted and reference it frequently. Use simpler synonyms: \"Evaporation = Water Disappears into Air,\" \"Condensation = Water Becomes Visible Droplets.\"\n\n3. **Partner Work:** Assign struggling learners a strong science partner for the mirror activity and bag observation so they can talk through observations and receive peer support.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Data Recording:** Have advanced students create a multi-day observation journal of the water bag, recording observations every day for 5-7 days and looking for patterns in when condensation appears most.\n\n2. **Extended Research:** \"In some places, fog is so thick you can't see the road. Research: What do you call very thick fog? Why might it be dangerous? How might people solve this problem?\" (This connects to NGSS 3-ESS3-1 about design solutions for weather hazards.)\n\n3. **Seasonal Connections:** \"Fog happens more in some seasons than others. Make a prediction: When in the year is fog most common? Create a bar graph showing your prediction for each month.\" (Addresses NGSS 3-ESS2-1 about representing weather data by season.)\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Dew Collection Experiment (Homework or Follow-Up):** Send home instructions for students to place a white paper towel on grass overnight and check it in the morning for dew droplets (water that condensed from air). Have them sketch and label what they find, then bring it back to share. This reinforces that condensation happens naturally outdoors.\n\n2. **Weather Tracking Chart (One Week):** Provide a simple chart where students record weather observations each morning before school or during morning work (sunny/cloudy, foggy/not foggy, temperature estimate). At the end of the week, look for patterns: \"On which days was it foggy? What was the temperature?\" Create a class bar graph.\n\n3. **Fog Safety Poster Project:** Students work in small groups to create a poster about \"Fog Safety\" for drivers, walkers, or cyclists. Include: Why fog is hard to see through (condensation = tiny water droplets block light), what to do when there's fog, why understanding weather helps keep us safe. Display in hallways or classrooms.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Tips\n\n- **Timing Note:** The water bag observation activity will yield the best results if started in Session 1 but observed over 2-3 days. Plan follow-up time in Session 2 or later for students to revisit their bags and see dramatic changes.\n- **Photograph Revisiting:** Display the photograph throughout both days. Reference it often. It's the anchor for all learning.\n- **Real-World Connection:** If possible, take students outside on a foggy morning or near a body of water on a cool day to observe natural fog formation. Even 5 minutes connects the lesson to genuine experience.\n- **Vocabulary Repetition:** Use key terms (evaporation, condensation, fog) consistently across all phases. Repetition with different contexts (mirror, bag, photo, outdoor) deepens retention.",
