      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student explains that green helps the chrysalis hide or blend in with leaves and plants (camouflage), protecting it from predators or danger.",
        "meets": "Student identifies that the green color helps the chrysalis hide or stay safe by blending in with its surroundings.",
        "approaching": "Student attempts to explain a connection between the green color and safety or hiding but reasoning is incomplete or unclear.",
        "beginning": "Student offers a simple color preference ('it looks pretty') or no logical explanation for the green color."

      "dokLevel": 2,
      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student identifies multiple similarities (both protect what's inside, both are stages before something grows) and differences (eggs hatch into babies, chrysalis has a caterpillar inside that transforms, different shapes/materials).",
        "meets": "Student identifies at least one clear similarity and one clear difference, such as both protect life inside but eggs are different shapes, or both are stages but a chrysalis comes from a caterpillar.",
        "approaching": "Student identifies either a similarity or difference but not both, or provides incomplete comparisons with some accurate details.",
        "beginning": "Student attempts comparison but offers vague, inaccurate, or unclear statements with minimal understanding of either eggs or chrysalises."

      "bloomsLevel": "Analyze",
      "dokLevel": 2,
      "rubric": {
        "exceeds": "Student explains that opening the chrysalis would hurt or kill the butterfly-to-be and prevent it from finishing its transformation, and recognizes this is why we should not disturb it.",
        "meets": "Student correctly predicts that opening the chrysalis would harm or stop the butterfly from developing into its final form.",
        "approaching": "Student recognizes that opening it would be harmful but provides unclear or incomplete reasoning about why or how the butterfly would be affected.",
        "beginning": "Student guesses a consequence without logical reasoning or demonstrates minimal understanding of why opening it matters."
