Observe and describe evidence of water erosion in the photograph and explain how moving water changes the shape of land.\n2. Conduct a hands-on investigation to demonstrate how the speed and amount of flowing water affect the rate of erosion.\n3. Use precise vocabulary (erosion, sediment, weathering) to communicate their findings about how water reshapes Earth's surface.\n4. Propose and compare at least two practical solutions that people can use to protect land or structures from water erosion.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph (p23.jpg)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Sticky notes (3 colors, optional)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a screen or as a large printout so all students can see it clearly. Say: *\"Look carefully at this image. Something has happened here. What do you notice?\"* Allow 1–2 minutes of silent observation.\n\n2. **Launch discussion with these guided questions:**\n   - What do you see happening in this picture? (Accept all observations: water, dirt, rocks, a cut in the ground, etc.)\n   - Where do you think that muddy water is going? Why is the water brown or tan-colored?\n   - What do you think made this channel or path in the ground? (Students may say: water, rain, a stream, etc.)\n   - If this process keeps happening over and over, what do you predict will happen to this landscape in one year? In ten years?\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** Distribute 3 sticky notes to each student. Ask them to write or draw one thing they wonder about the water and the land in this photo. Collect these and display them on a \"Wonder Wall\" to revisit at the end of the lesson.\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to become scientists and test how water actually changes the shape of land. You'll create your own erosion experiment to see the power of flowing water.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover erosion concepts through hands-on activity.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2–3 students):**\n- One aluminum baking pan or large shallow tray (9\" × 13\" or similar)\n- Soil or sand (mixed, or layered: soil on bottom, sand on top) — about 3–4 cups per group\n- Water in a pitcher or spray bottle\n- Small pebbles or gravel mixed into the soil\n- Ruler\n- Paper towels\n- Clipboard and paper for recording observations\n- Optional: food coloring (1–2 drops in water) to make sediment transport more visible\n\n**Activity — \"The Erosion Simulator\" (Student-Directed Investigation):**\n\n1. **Setup (2 minutes):** Each group receives a pan filled with soil/sand. Have students use a ruler to measure and record the height of the soil in the pan. Ask: *\"How deep is your soil right now?\"*\n\n2. **Round 1 — Slow Water (5 minutes):**\n   - Direct students: *\"Pour water slowly onto one corner of your pan. Observe for 2 minutes. What happens?\"*\n   - Students record: Does water move? Does soil move? What does the water look like? (Clarity, color, where it flows.)\n   - Ask: *\"How much soil, if any, left your pan?\"* (Observe sediment in the water or running off into a collection tray.)\n\n3. **Round 2 — Faster Water (5 minutes):**\n   - Instruct: *\"Now pour water much faster, from the same corner. What changes?\"*\n   - Students record: How is this different from slow water? Is more soil being carried away? Does the water move faster? What shape is forming in your soil?\n   - Check: *\"Can you see a small channel or cut forming?\"*\n\n4. **Round 3 — Observe Over Time (5 minutes):**\n   - Have students pour water continuously for 1–2 minutes at medium speed.\n   - Prompt: *\"Watch the channel grow deeper. Measure the depth of the soil again. Has it changed?\"*\n   - Document: Sketch or describe the new channel. Is it deeper? Wider? Where is the deepest part?\n\n5. **Collection:** Ask each group to save their \"before and after\" pan and be ready to share observations.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate and ask guiding questions without revealing answers: *\"What do you notice about the speed of water and how much soil moves?\"* and *\"Where is the deepest cut in your soil? Why do you think that is?\"*\n- Ensure groups record observations in words, numbers, and sketches.\n- Redirect groups to focus on what is visible rather than why it happens (explanation comes in the next phase).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that faster water removes more soil and creates visible channels.\n- They observe that sediment (soil particles) is transported away by water.\n- They recognize that water can carve or reshape the land surface.\n- Recorded data includes depth measurements, sketches of channels, and descriptions of water speed and sediment movement.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and concepts after exploration.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Anchor chart (pre-made or co-created) titled: \"How Water Changes Earth\"\n- Student notebooks or handout with vocabulary\n- The photograph again (for reference)\n- Chart showing a scale of erosion rates (optional visual)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 2–3 groups to briefly describe what they observed: *\"Tell us what happened when you poured water. What surprised you?\"*\n   - Chart student language on the board, using their words as a starting point.\n\n2. **Teacher-Led Explanation (7 minutes):**\n   - Connect to the photograph: *\"What you just saw in your pans is exactly what's happening in this real photograph. A stream or rainwater is flowing here, and it's carrying away soil and rocks, just like your water did.\"*\n   - Explain in student-friendly language: *\"When moving water hits land, it picks up bits of soil and rock and carries them away. Over time — days, weeks, months, years — this can create deep channels or valleys. This is one of the most powerful ways Earth's surface changes.\"*\n   - Reference the visible channel in the photo: *\"See this cut in the middle? That was made by water moving through, again and again, picking up smaller pieces each time.\"*\n\n3. **Vocabulary Introduction (5 minutes):**\n   Each term should be taught with a connection to the photo or the student experiment.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Erosion** | When water, wind, ice, or other forces pick up pieces of rock and soil and move them to a different place. |\n| **Sediment** | Tiny pieces of rock and soil that are picked up and moved by water, wind, or ice. |\n| **Weathering** | When rocks and soil are broken down into smaller pieces by water, wind, temperature changes, or plant roots. |\n| **Channel** | A path or groove made in the ground by flowing water. |\n| **Landscape** | All the natural features of an area, like hills, valleys, rivers, and plains. |\n\n**Check for Understanding:**\n- Ask: *\"Point to the sediment in the photograph. Where do you think it came from?\"*\n- Ask: *\"Can you show me a channel in your pan experiment? What caused it?\"*\n- Ask: *\"If erosion keeps happening in the same place, what will happen to the landscape over a very long time?\"*\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define erosion and sediment in their own words.\n- They connect the vocabulary to their observations and the photograph.\n- They understand that erosion is a natural process that reshapes Earth over time.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by solving a real-world problem.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pans from the Explore activity (or new pans with soil)\n- Variety of \"protective materials\": sticks, leaves, plastic sheeting, fabric, pebbles, mulch, cardboard, wire mesh\n- Water pitchers\n- Handout or chart: \"Erosion Solutions\"\n- Clipboards and paper\n\n**Activity — \"Protect the Land: Design a Solution\":**\n\n1. **Problem Introduction (2 minutes):**\n   - Show the photograph again: *\"Imagine this area is next to someone's house or a road (like the railroad track we see). The water erosion is washing away the land and could damage the structure. Your job is to find a way to slow down erosion and protect the land.\"*\n\n2. **Design Challenge (8 minutes):**\n   - Give each group 2–3 materials from the protective options.\n   - Instruct: *\"Arrange your materials on your soil pan to try to stop or slow erosion. Predict: Will this help? Why or why not?\"*\n   - Students sketch their design and write their prediction.\n\n3. **Test the Solution (5 minutes):**\n   - Groups pour water onto their protected pan at a consistent speed.\n   - They observe and record: Does erosion still happen? Is it slower? Did the material wash away?\n   - Ask: *\"Did your solution work? Why or why not?\"*\n\n4. **Compare Solutions (3 minutes):**\n   - Quickly tour other groups' designs.\n   - Ask: *\"Which solution seemed to work best? Why? What would happen if you combined two materials?\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate group design without telling them \"the right answer.\"\n- Ask: *\"What happens to the water when it hits your material?\"* and *\"Does it slow down or stop?\"*\n- Encourage students to explain the \"why\" behind their results.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students propose practical solutions (vegetation, barriers, mulch) that reduce erosion.\n- They test ideas and gather evidence about what works.\n- They begin to understand real-world applications: people use these methods to protect land, roads, and structures.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of erosion, water's role, and protective solutions.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment Throughout the Lesson:**\n- **Observation:** Circulate during Explore and Elaborate; note whether students can observe and describe erosion accurately.\n- **Recording sheets:** Review sketches, measurements, and vocabulary use from the Explore phase.\n- **Discussion questions:** Assess depth of understanding through student responses during Explain and Elaborate.\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment — administered at the end of Session 2):**\n\nProvide each student with a short response form. Students may draw, write, or use a combination:\n\n1. **Look at this photograph again** (show the original photo). **Draw an arrow showing where water is moving and label one place where you see erosion happening.**\n\n2. **Complete this sentence in your own words:**\n   - *\"Erosion is when...\"*\n\n3. **If rain falls heavily on a hillside near a house, what is one way people could protect the house from erosion?** (Accept any reasonable answer: plant trees, build a wall, add gravel, put down fabric, etc.)\n\n4. **Bonus reflection:** *\"What was the most surprising thing you learned about water and erosion today?\"*\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- ✓ Student can identify erosion in the photograph (water moving, sediment being carried, channel visible).\n- ✓ Student defines erosion using appropriate vocabulary (water, soil, rocks, moved, changed).\n- ✓ Student proposes at least one realistic protective solution.\n- ✓ Student connects their hands-on experiment to real-world examples.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students correctly identify erosion and its effects in the photograph.\n- Students demonstrate understanding that water movement is the cause of erosion.\n- Students propose at least one feasible solution to reduce erosion's impact.\n- Exit tickets show application of vocabulary and transfer of learning to new scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary Anchor Chart:** Create a large, illustrated chart with pictures for erosion, sediment, weathering, and channel. Keep it posted and reference it frequently. Allow students to use the chart when completing the exit ticket.\n\n2. **Sentence Frames for Explanation:** Provide sentence starters during discussions:\n   - *\"I notice that the water is...\"*\n   - *\"The sediment is being...\"*\n   - *\"Erosion happens when...\"*\n\n3. **Paired Investigation:** Pair struggling students with a peer mentor during the Explore phase. Assign the mentor specific roles (measuring, recording, observing) so both are actively engaged and the struggling student hears verbal explanations.\n\n4. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Allow students to draw and label only, or answer yes/no/why questions instead of open-ended ones.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners)\n\n1. **Erosion Rate Investigation:** Ask advanced students: *\"Does the slope of the land affect how fast erosion happens?\"* Have them tilt their pan at different angles and measure/compare erosion rates with a ruler. Record and graph the results.\n\n2. **Multi-Material Testing:** Challenge students to test 4–5 different protective materials systematically, collect quantitative data (e.g., measuring soil depth before and after), and create a comparison chart ranking effectiveness.\n\n3. **Real-World Research:** Provide pictures or brief case studies of erosion problems in your region (riverbank erosion, coastal erosion, construction site runoff). Ask: *\"What solution would work best here? Why?\"* Encourage them to justify their answer using evidence from their experiments.\n\n4. **Geology Connection:** Have students research different types of rocks and soil. Ask: *\"Do you think all soils erode at the same rate? Why or why not?\"* Let them test clay, sand, and soil side-by-side to explore this question.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Erosion Timeline Comic:** Students create a 4-panel comic showing how a landscape changes over time due to water erosion (Day 1, Year 1, Year 10, Year 100). Include labels for erosion, sediment, and channels. This reinforces the concept of long-term landscape change.\n\n2. **Walking Field Study:** If safe and feasible, take students on a neighborhood or schoolyard walk to identify evidence of erosion: worn paths, gullies, areas where water runs off during rain, visible sediment in storm drains. Students document findings with sketches and measurements. Upon return, discuss: *\"How is this real erosion like our experiment?\"*\n\n3. **Water Cycle Extension Connection:** Expand into the water cycle by asking: *\"Where does the sediment-filled water from erosion go? Does it end up in rivers? Oceans? How does that change those ecosystems?\"* Create a diagram showing how erosion fits into the water cycle and Earth systems.\n\n4. **Persuasive Writing:** Ask students to write a short letter to a property owner explaining why they should plant trees or install erosion barriers on their land. Students must use evidence from their investigations to support their recommendation. (Aligns with literacy integration.)\n\n5. **Build a Better Channel:** Challenge students to design a concrete drainage system (using clay, plastic tubing, or aluminum) that safely directs water away from structures while minimizing erosion. Test prototypes with water. Discuss: *\"What properties make a good drainage system?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n\n- **Safety:** Ensure students have towels and designated water disposal areas. Wet soil can be slippery; keep work areas organized.\n- **Timing:** The two-session structure allows time for reflection between phases. If you teach in one 90-minute block, Engage and Explore can occur in the first 40 minutes; break; then Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate in the second 50 minutes.\n- **Photo Reference:** Keep the original photograph visible throughout the lesson so students continuously connect their discoveries to the real-world example.\n- **Vocabulary Persistence:** Use the vocabulary repeatedly in follow-up discussions so it becomes internalized.",
