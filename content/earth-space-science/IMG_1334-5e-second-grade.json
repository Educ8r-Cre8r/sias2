Exploring Garden Habitats**\n\n---\n\n## Lesson Overview\n\n- **Grade Level:** Second Grade\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 40-minute sessions (or one 80-minute block with a 5-minute break)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - 2-ESS2-2: Develop a model to represent the shapes and kinds of land and bodies of water in an area\n  - 2-ESS2-3: Obtain information to identify where water is found on Earth and that it can be solid or liquid\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Identify plants and soil as important parts of a habitat where animals find food and shelter\n2. Explain how a garden's shape and features help animals live there\n3. Describe what resources (food, water, shelter) animals need from their environment\n4. Create a simple model or drawing of a habitat showing where animals and plants live\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10–15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about what animals need to survive by examining the photograph of the squirrel in the garden.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital display of the photograph\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the board or project it. Point to the squirrel and say, \"Look at this animal! What do you notice about where it is?\"\n\n2. **Facilitate a brief picture walk** using these discussion questions:\n   - \"What is the squirrel holding in its mouth? What color is it?\" *(Allow students to name the orange food item)*\n   - \"Why do you think the squirrel is in this garden? What does it need here?\" *(Listen for: food, plants, dirt, a safe place)*\n   - \"What else do you see around the squirrel?\" *(Plants, flowers, soil, green leaves)*\n   - \"If you were a squirrel, what would you need to live in a garden like this?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"Today, we're going to discover what animals need to live in a place. We call that place a **habitat**. A habitat is like an animal's home that gives it everything it needs. Let's explore what makes a good habitat!\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Let's go outside (or use our materials) to investigate what we might find in a real garden habitat and why squirrels—and other animals—like to live there.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20–25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate the components of a habitat through sensory exploration and data collection.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small containers or trays (one per student pair)\n- Soil sample in containers\n- Real plants or plant cuttings (grass, small shrubs, or flowers)\n- Small rocks\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Hand lenses (optional but helpful)\n- Paper and crayons or colored pencils for recording\n- A printed or projected image of the photograph to reference\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs.** Assign each pair a small tray or container.\n\n2. **Distribute materials.** Give each pair a small amount of soil, one or two plant samples, a few rocks, and access to a spray bottle of water.\n\n3. **Student directions** (read aloud while modeling):\n   - \"Look at your soil. How does it feel? Is it wet or dry? Rub a tiny bit between your fingers. Draw what soil looks like up close.\"\n   - \"Look at the plants. What color are they? Do they have leaves? Gently touch them. Do they feel soft or stiff? Draw the plant.\"\n   - \"Now look at the rocks in your tray. What colors do you see? Are they smooth or bumpy? What do you think rocks do in a habitat?\"\n   - \"Spray a little water on the soil. What happens? Where does water go? Why might animals need water in their habitat?\"\n   - \"Now imagine you're a small animal like the squirrel in our photo. Where would you find food? Where would you find water? Where would you make a home? Point to the things in your tray.\"\n\n4. **Recording:** Have students draw or label their tray contents on paper, labeling soil, plants, rocks, and water. Encourage them to write or dictate: \"This habitat has _____ because animals need _____.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between pairs, asking open-ended questions: *\"What did you notice when you touched the soil?\" \"Where would a squirrel find food here?\" \"Why is water important?\"*\n- Do not tell students the answers; instead, guide them to observe and think.\n- Model careful handling of plants and materials.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students observe and compare the properties of soil, plants, rocks, and water\n- Students make connections between materials in the tray and what the squirrel in the photo needs\n- Students document observations through drawings and simple labels\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and consolidate understanding of habitats and their components.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Photograph (displayed again)\n- Optional: picture cards of habitat components (soil, water, plants, shelter)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students for group share-out.** Ask 3–4 pairs to briefly share one thing they discovered:\n   - *\"What did your soil feel like?\"*\n   - *\"What happened when you added water?\"*\n   - *\"Where would an animal find food in your habitat?\"*\n\n2. **Create a habitat anchor chart** on chart paper:\n   - Title: \"What Makes a Good Habitat?\"\n   - As students share, write or draw their ideas in four categories:\n     - **Food** (plants, seeds, fruits)\n     - **Water** (soil holds water, plants need water)\n     - **Shelter** (soil, plants, rocks to hide under)\n     - **Space** (enough room to live)\n\n3. **Introduce vocabulary** using student-friendly language, pointing back to the photograph and their tray:\n\n   | Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n   |------|---------------------------|\n   | **Habitat** | A place where an animal lives that gives it food, water, shelter, and space |\n   | **Soil** | The brown stuff under our feet made of tiny rocks, old plants, and water |\n   | **Shelter** | A safe place where an animal can hide and stay warm |\n   | **Resource** | Something from nature that animals need to live (food, water, air) |\n   | **Environment** | Everything around us—plants, animals, soil, water, air, rocks |\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Display the photograph again. Ask: \"What resources do you see in this garden habitat?\" (Soil, plants, water, rocks)\n   - Ask: \"Why did we see the squirrel here? What does it need?\"\n   - Invite students to point to parts of the photo: \"Show me where you see shelter. Show me where you see food.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use the vocabulary words correctly in context\n- Students understand that habitats have specific features that help animals survive\n- Students can name at least two resources found in the photograph's habitat\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15–20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Deepen understanding by applying habitat knowledge to a new context and beginning to model habitats.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large paper plates or paper (one per student)\n- Crayons, markers, or colored pencils\n- Small craft materials: tissue paper, yarn, dried leaves, small sticks (optional)\n- Images of different habitats (forest, desert, water, garden—provide 1–2 simple examples)\n- Reference to the original photograph\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce a scenario:** \"Now that we know what habitats need, let's design our own! We're going to create a **model**—a simple drawing or picture—of a habitat that would be perfect for the squirrel in our photo.\"\n\n2. **Show simple examples** of different habitat types (e.g., \"A forest has tall trees, wet ground, and rocks. A desert has sand and dry plants. A garden has flowers and soil\").\n\n3. **Student task:**\n   - \"On your plate or paper, draw a habitat for a squirrel (or another animal you choose).\"\n   - \"Include four things we learned about: **food, water, shelter, and space.**\"\n   - \"Label or color each part. You can draw it, or you can use materials to make it look real.\"\n   - \"Be ready to tell us: What animal lives here? What resources does it have?\"\n\n4. **Optional extension:** Students can create a 3D model using craft materials pressed onto a paper base.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Remind students of the anchor chart and the Explore activity\n- Ask guiding questions: *\"Where is the food in your habitat?\" \"How will your animal get water?\" \"Where will it sleep?\"*\n- Encourage students to look back at the photograph for ideas\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual model of a habitat with labeled or identified components\n- Students can explain why their habitat would work for an animal\n- Students demonstrate understanding of the connection between animal needs and habitat features\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess students' understanding of habitats and their components.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment** (ongoing during the lesson):\n- Observe student participation during Engage discussions\n- Collect sketches and labels from Explore phase—check for accurate observations of soil, plants, water, and rocks\n- Listen to student responses during the Explain share-out and check-for-understanding questions\n- Circulate during Elaborate and note which students accurately include habitat resources in their models\n\n**Summative Exit Ticket (choose one format):**\n\n**Option A—Drawing + Sentence (best for emerging writers):**\nDisplay the photograph one final time. Give each student a half-page with this prompt:\n- \"Draw one thing the squirrel needs to live in this habitat.\"\n- \"Write or say: 'The squirrel needs _____ because _____.\"\n- Success: Student names a resource (food, water, shelter, soil) and gives a simple reason\n\n**Option B—Quick Quiz (verbal or written, depending on writing level):**\nAsk 2–3 of these questions individually or to the whole group:\n1. \"What is a habitat?\" (Listen for: a home for an animal; a place with food, water, shelter)\n2. \"Name one thing a squirrel finds in a garden habitat.\" (Possible answers: food, water, plants, shelter, soil)\n3. \"Why do animals need water?\" (Listen for: to drink, to stay alive, to help plants grow)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Students correctly identify at least 2 habitat resources\n- Students understand that habitats provide what animals need to survive\n- Students can name the four main components of a habitat (food, water, shelter, space)\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- 80% of students can name at least one resource an animal needs\n- 70% of students can explain why a habitat is important for an animal\n- All students attempt to model a habitat with at least two components\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for struggling learners):\n\n1. **Simplify vocabulary:** Use only three words: **food, water, shelter.** Introduce \"habitat\" as \"animal home.\"\n\n2. **Provide sentence frames during Explore and Elaborate:**\n   - \"I see _____.\"\n   - \"The animal needs _____.\"\n   - \"This habitat has _____ so the animal can _____.\"\n\n3. **Pair students strategically** during Explore—pair a struggling learner with a more verbal peer, and assign the quieter student the role of \"observer\" who points while the partner describes.\n\n4. **Reduce the Elaborate task:** Instead of creating a model, have students sort habitat picture cards into categories: \"Food,\" \"Water,\" \"Shelter,\" \"Space.\"\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Introduce food chains:** Explain that plants need soil and water to grow, squirrels eat plants, and larger animals eat squirrels. Ask: \"What would happen if there was no soil?\"\n\n2. **Compare habitats:** Provide images of a garden, forest, and desert. Ask: \"Which habitat would be best for a squirrel? Why? What's different about each one?\"\n\n3. **Design a new habitat:** Challenge students to create a habitat for a *different* animal (bird, rabbit, bee) and explain why their design would work for that specific animal.\n\n4. **Predict and test:** \"If we took away the water from the habitat, what would happen? Let's predict, then observe what happens to our plants over a few days.\"\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Habitat Hunt (Outdoor Exploration):** Take students outside to find a small habitat—under a leaf, in a bush, near a flower bed. Have them draw or photograph what they find and identify the food, water, shelter, and space available for small creatures.\n\n2. **Animal Needs Match Game:** Create a matching activity where students pair animals (squirrel, bird, bee, butterfly) with habitat resources they need. Include a \"wild card\" discussion: \"Could a squirrel live in the ocean? Why or why not?\"\n\n3. **Habitat Changes Over Time:** Visit the same small area of the school garden (or a potted plant habitat) weekly for one month. Have students document changes: Do plants grow? Does water appear after rain? Do insects visit? Connect observations to how habitats change slowly or quickly (ties to 2-ESS1-1 if time allows).\n\n4. **Build a Terrarium Habitat:** Create a simple sealed ecosystem in a jar with soil, a small plant, and a few pebbles. Let students predict what will happen and observe for two weeks. Discuss: \"How do plants and animals depend on each other?\"\n\n5. **Read-Aloud Connection:** Pair with picture books like *The Busy Garden* or *What Do Animals Need?* and have students compare illustrated habitats to the photograph.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Safety reminder:** If exploring outdoors, check for allergens (pollen, insect nests) and ensure students don't handle unknown insects or plants.\n- **Timing flexibility:** Expand Explore and Elaborate across two days if needed—observation-based learning benefits from longer engagement.\n- **Real-world connection:** Reference your school garden, playground, or nearby park to make learning tangible.\n- **Photography opportunity:** Have students photograph the squirrel photo and their habitats side-by-side to create a visual comparison poster.\n- **Family connection:** Send a take-home sheet asking families to identify one habitat near their home and list what lives there.\n\nThis lesson anchors abstract concepts (habitats, resources) to a concrete, engaging image and allows students to discover relationships between living things and their environment through hands-on exploration.",
