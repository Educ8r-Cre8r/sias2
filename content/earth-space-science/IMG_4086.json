The rocks are piled up in different shapes and sizes to create a waterfall or fountain. Plants are growing around the rocks, and you can see how water has changed the color and texture of some stones.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe anchoring phenomenon here is **weathering and erosion in action**. The stacked stones show how water moves over and through rock materials, gradually changing their appearance through physical and chemical weathering processes. Water flowing over these rocks carries away tiny particles, smooths rough edges, and creates the moss-covered, aged appearance we observe. This demonstrates how Earth's surface is constantly being shaped by the movement of water.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Weathering:** Water, wind, and living things slowly break down rocks into smaller pieces over time\n2. **Erosion:** Moving water carries away small rock particles and soil from one place to another\n3. **Deposition:** The carried materials eventually settle in new locations, creating new landforms\n4. **Water Cycle Connections:** This garden feature mimics natural processes where water flows downhill due to gravity\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use the \"Think-Pair-Share\" strategy when introducing weathering concepts. Have students first think individually about how rocks might change over time, then discuss with a partner before sharing with the class. This builds confidence and allows processing time.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to demonstrate understanding: allow them to draw, act out, or build models of weathering processes rather than only using written responses. This supports diverse learners and makes abstract concepts more concrete.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n**Zoom In:** At the microscopic level, water molecules are breaking chemical bonds in the rock minerals and carrying away individual ions and tiny particles. Freeze-thaw cycles cause water to expand in rock cracks, creating physical pressure that splits rocks apart.\n\n**Zoom Out:** This small garden feature connects to massive Earth systems - the same weathering and erosion processes shape entire mountain ranges, create river valleys, form beaches, and build deltas where rivers meet oceans. These processes have been reshaping Earth's surface for billions of years.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"Rocks never change because they're so hard and strong.\"\n   **Reality:** All rocks change over time through weathering, even the hardest ones, just very slowly.\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"Only big events like earthquakes change the land.\"\n   **Reality:** Slow, everyday processes like flowing water cause most land changes over long periods of time.\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"Erosion only happens during storms or floods.\"\n   **Reality:** Erosion happens continuously, even with gentle water flow, though it's faster during heavy rain.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n**Performance Expectation:** 2-ESS1-1 - Use information from several sources to provide evidence that Earth events can occur quickly or slowly.\n\n**Disciplinary Core Ideas:**\n- [[NGSS:DCI:2-ESS1.C]] - Some events happen very quickly; others occur very slowly, over a time period much longer than one can observe\n- [[NGSS:DCI:4-ESS1.C]] - Local, regional, and global patterns of rock formations reveal changes over time due to Earth forces\n\n**Crosscutting Concepts:**\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns in the natural world can be observed and used as evidence\n- [[NGSS:CCC:Scale, Proportion, and Quantity]] - Natural objects and observable phenomena exist from very small to very large scales\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What evidence do you see that water has been flowing over these rocks for a long time? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. How do you think this rock garden might look different after 100 years of water flowing over it? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n3. Where do you think the tiny rock pieces go when water washes them away from this garden? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n4. What would happen to these rocks if no water ever flowed over them? (Bloom's: Synthesize | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Weathering:** The slow breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by water, wind, or plants\n* **Erosion:** When water, wind, or ice carries away small pieces of rock and soil\n* **Deposition:** When flowing water slows down and drops the rock pieces it was carrying\n* **Sediment:** Tiny pieces of rock, sand, and soil that have been worn away and moved by water\n* **Runoff:** Water that flows over the ground surface, carrying materials with it\n\n## 🔗 Cross-Curricular Ideas\n\n1. **Math - Measurement & Data:** Have students measure the height of the rock stack using non-standard units (blocks, pencils) or standard units (inches/centimeters). Create a bar graph showing measurements of different rocks in the garden. This connects to 3.MD.B.3 (represent and interpret data).\n\n2. **ELA - Descriptive Writing:** Ask students to write a detailed description of how the rocks look, feel, and sound as water flows over them. Use sensory words (rough, smooth, wet, splashing) to make their writing vivid. This supports W.3.2 (write informative texts with descriptive details).\n\n3. **Social Studies - Community Helpers:** Connect to local professionals who work with Earth materials - landscapers, construction workers, geologists, and environmental engineers. Invite a guest speaker or take a virtual field trip to see how professionals use knowledge of rocks and water in their work.\n\n4. **Art - Land Art & Sculpture:** Have students create their own small rock arrangements or \"stone sculptures\" outdoors using natural materials. Photograph them and discuss how their creations are similar to and different from the water fountain feature. This connects art to environmental design and problem-solving.\n\n## 🚀 STEM Career Connection\n\n1. **Geologist** - A scientist who studies rocks, soil, and how Earth changes over time.

    "kindergarten": "## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis picture shows a house with big rocks stacked up in front of it. The rocks are different sizes and colors. Some rocks are flat and some are round. There are plants growing around the rocks.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe anchoring phenomenon here is **natural weathering and erosion processes** that created these diverse rock formations over long periods of time. The rocks show different compositions, textures, and weathering patterns because they formed under different conditions and have been exposed to various environmental forces like water, wind, and temperature changes. This rock garden demonstrates how Earth materials vary in their properties and how humans can arrange natural materials in organized ways.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Rock Properties and Characteristics** - Rocks come in different sizes, shapes, colors, and textures based on how they formed and what they're made of.\n\n2. **Natural vs. Human-Made Arrangements** - While rocks form naturally in the Earth, humans can collect and arrange them in patterns for decoration or construction.\n\n3. **Earth Materials in Our Environment** - Rocks are natural materials that come from the Earth and can be found everywhere around us.\n\n4. **Observable Properties** - We can use our senses to describe and compare different rocks by looking at their color, size, shape, and texture.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use a \"rock hunt\" approach where students collect and sort rocks by observable properties before introducing scientific vocabulary. This hands-on exploration builds concrete understanding before abstract concepts.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to express their observations - drawing, verbal descriptions, physical sorting, or using simple comparison charts with pictures to accommodate different learning styles and abilities.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** At the microscopic level, rocks are made up of tiny mineral crystals and grains that fit together like puzzle pieces. These tiny parts determine the rock's color, hardness, and texture.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** These rocks are part of the larger rock cycle system where rocks form deep in the Earth, get pushed to the surface, break down into smaller pieces through weathering, and eventually form new rocks over millions of years.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** All rocks are the same, just different sizes.\n   **Clarification:** Rocks are made of different materials (minerals) and formed in different ways, which makes them have different properties like color, weight, and hardness.\n\n2. **Misconception:** Rocks don't change - they stay the same forever.\n   **Clarification:** Rocks slowly change over very long periods of time due to weather, water, and other natural forces breaking them down into smaller pieces.\n\n3. **Misconception:** Only big rocks are \"real rocks.\"\n   **Clarification:** Sand, pebbles, and tiny rock pieces are all rocks too - just smaller versions that have been broken down over time.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** K-2-ETS1-1 - Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change to define a simple problem that can be solved through the development of a new or improved object or tool.\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas:** [[NGSS:DCI:K-ESS2.E]] - Plants and animals can change their environment\n- **Crosscutting Concepts:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]] - Patterns in the natural and human designed world can be observed and used as evidence\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you notice that is the same about these rocks? What is different? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. How do you think these rocks got to be different shapes and sizes? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n3. If you were going to sort these rocks into groups, what groups would you make? (Bloom's: Create | DOK: 3)\n\n4. Why do you think someone arranged these rocks this way instead of leaving them scattered around? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Rock:** A hard, natural material that comes from the Earth\n* **Property:** Something you can observe about an object, like its color or size\n* **Natural:** Something that comes from nature, not made by people\n* **Texture:** How something feels when you touch it - smooth, rough, bumpy\n* **Arrange:** To put things in a certain order or pattern\n* **Material:** What something is made of\n\n## 🔗 Cross-Curricular Ideas\n\n1. **Math - Sorting and Patterns:** Students can sort rocks by size (big, medium, small) or color and create simple patterns with them. They can also count rocks and compare quantities (\"Which pile has more rocks?\"). This builds early number sense and classification skills.\n\n2. **ELA - Descriptive Language and Storytelling:** Students can use sensory words to describe rocks in their writing or drawings (smooth, rough, round, flat). They can also create simple stories about rocks, such as \"Where did this rock come from?\" or \"What adventure did this rock have?\" This develops vocabulary and narrative thinking.\n\n3. **Art - Rock Painting and Sculpture:** Students can paint rocks with designs, faces, or patterns, or create their own rock stacks and arrangements like in the photo. This allows creative expression while exploring how materials can be arranged and transformed.\n\n4. **Social Studies - Community Builders:** Discuss how people in our community use rocks and stones to build homes, pathways, and gardens. Students can learn that different jobs (gardeners, builders, landscapers) use rocks in their work and help create our neighborhoods.\n\n## 🚀 STEM Career Connection\n\n1. **Geologist** - A scientist who studies rocks and stones to learn about how the Earth works and what it's made of. Geologists explore caves, mountains, and dig in the ground to find different types of rocks and learn their stories.

Many green plants grow around the rock piles, and trees hang over the house with their leafy branches.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe anchoring phenomenon here is **weathering and erosion** creating the flat, layered rocks we see stacked in this garden. Over millions of years, natural forces like wind, water, ice, and temperature changes broke down larger rock formations into these smaller, flat pieces. The layered appearance suggests these rocks were formed through sedimentary processes, where materials settled in layers over time and were compressed into rock. Humans then collected and arranged these naturally-shaped stones to create this decorative garden feature.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Weathering Processes**: Physical and chemical weathering break down rocks over long periods of time through forces like freezing water, plant roots, and chemical reactions.\n\n2. **Rock Formation**: These flat stones likely formed as sedimentary rocks, created when layers of sediment were pressed together over millions of years.\n\n3. **Erosion and Transport**: Moving water, wind, and ice carried rock fragments from their original locations to new places where humans could collect them.\n\n4. **Human Impact on Landscapes**: People modify natural environments by moving rocks and planting gardens, showing how humans interact with Earth's materials.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Have students bring in small rocks from home or the schoolyard to examine with magnifying glasses.

    "grade5": "## 📸 Photo Description\n\nThis image shows a house with a beautiful stone water fountain made from stacked flat rocks in the front yard. Water flows down through the different levels of stones, creating a small waterfall. The fountain is surrounded by plants and sits in a garden with mulch covering the ground.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe anchoring phenomenon is **water cycling through a human-made system that mimics natural processes**. Water is pumped from a reservoir at the bottom through hidden tubes back to the top of the stone stack, where gravity pulls it down through the gaps between rocks. This demonstrates how water moves in continuous cycles, just like in nature where water evaporates, condenses, and flows downhill due to gravitational force. The fountain shows properties of water including flow, adhesion to rock surfaces, and the water cycle in action.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **Water Cycle Components**: The fountain demonstrates evaporation (water turning to vapor), condensation (if you observe early morning), and precipitation (water flowing down like rain).\n\n2. **Gravity and Water Flow**: Water always flows downhill due to gravitational pull, following the path of least resistance through gaps in the rocks.\n\n3. **Properties of Matter**: Water maintains its liquid state while demonstrating properties like adhesion (sticking to rocks) and cohesion (water molecules sticking together).\n\n4. **Human Impact on Water Systems**: This artificial system shows how humans can create water features that support local ecosystems and provide habitats for wildlife.\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Have students trace the water's journey with their finger in the air while explaining each step. This kinesthetic movement helps cement the concept of cyclical processes in their minds.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to represent their understanding: drawing the water cycle, acting it out with body movements, or building a model with clay and small rocks to accommodate different learning preferences.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In**: At the molecular level, water molecules are constantly moving and forming hydrogen bonds with each other and with the rock surfaces. This molecular attraction causes water to stick to rocks (adhesion) and flow in streams rather than individual droplets.\n\n2. **Zoom Out**: This fountain connects to the larger watershed system. The water that evaporates joins the atmospheric water cycle, potentially becoming clouds and precipitation that feeds rivers, lakes, and groundwater systems across the region.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception**: \"The water disappears and new water appears at the top.\"\n   **Reality**: The same water is recycled continuously through a pump system, just like nature recycles water through evaporation and precipitation.\n\n2. **Misconception**: \"Water flows uphill naturally in fountains.\"\n   **Reality**: A mechanical pump uses energy to move water uphill against gravity, similar to how the sun's energy drives evaporation in the natural water cycle.\n\n3. **Misconception**: \"Only rain and rivers are part of the water cycle.\"\n   **Reality**: All water on Earth is part of one continuous cycle, including water in fountains, puddles, plants, and even our bodies.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation**: 5-ESS2-1 - Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:5-ESS2.A]] - Earth's major systems interact through physical and chemical processes\n- **Disciplinary Core Ideas**: [[NGSS:DCI:5-ESS2.C]] - Human activities affect Earth's systems\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Systems and System Models]] - A system is a group of related parts that make up a whole\n- **Crosscutting Concepts**: [[NGSS:CCC:Energy and Matter]] - Matter and energy can be transferred between systems\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. How does this fountain model the natural water cycle happening in our local environment? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 3)\n\n2. What would happen to the fountain if the pump stopped working, and how does this compare to what drives the natural water cycle? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n3. What evidence can you observe that shows water is interacting with the rock materials in this fountain? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n4. How might this fountain affect the plants and animals in the surrounding garden ecosystem? (Bloom's: Synthesize | DOK: 3)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Evaporation:** The process when liquid water changes into invisible water vapor and rises into the air.\n* **Gravity:** The force that pulls objects toward Earth, causing water to flow downhill.\n* **Adhesion:** When water molecules stick to other materials like rocks or glass.\n* **Reservoir:** A place where water is collected and stored for later use.\n* **Cycle:** A series of events that repeat over and over in the same order.\n* **Precipitation:** Water that falls from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.\n\n## 🔗 Cross-Curricular Ideas\n\n1. **Math - Measurement & Volume**: Have students measure the height of the fountain and calculate how much water might flow through it per minute. They could estimate the volume of the reservoir and predict how long the water would last if the pump stopped. This connects to measurement, estimation, and real-world math applications.\n\n2. **ELA - Descriptive Writing & Poetry**: Ask students to write descriptive paragraphs or poems about the fountain using sensory language (what they see, hear, and feel when observing water features). They could also research and write about famous fountains around the world, combining research skills with creative writing.\n\n3. **Social Studies - Human Geography & Community Design**: Explore how fountains and water features are used in different cultures and communities. Discuss why people design gardens and water features, and how they reflect human needs and values. Students could research water management in their own community and how it affects residents.\n\n4. **Art - Design & Sculpture**: Have students sketch their own fountain designs using natural and recycled materials, or create 3D models using clay, stones, and found objects. This allows them to apply artistic thinking while understanding the engineering and science principles that make fountains work.\n\n## 🚀 STEM Career Connection\n\n1. **Hydrologist**: A hydrologist is a scientist who studies water on Earth, including how it moves, where it comes from, and how it affects our environment. Hydrologists help communities manage water resources, predict floods, and protect water supplies. They might study rivers, groundwater, and water cycles like the one shown in this fountain. **Average Annual Salary: $84,000**\n\n2. **Landscape Architect**: A landscape architect designs outdoor spaces like gardens, parks, and yards. They plan where to place plants, water features like fountains, and other elements to create beautiful and functional spaces.
