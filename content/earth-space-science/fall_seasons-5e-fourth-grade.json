Observe and describe how leaves change over time as they decompose and weather.\n2. Identify evidence that vegetation (like fallen leaves) affects how Earth's surface changes through weathering and erosion processes.\n3. Explain how the decomposition of plant material contributes to soil formation and landscape change over time.\n4. Predict and record the stages of leaf decomposition and connect these observations to broader Earth science processes.\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest by exploring the phenomenon of seasonal leaf fall and activate prior knowledge about how Earth changes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed large photograph (8.5\" × 11\" or larger) or digital projection of fall_seasons.jpg\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the Photograph:** Project or display the photograph large enough for all students to see clearly. Allow 30 seconds of silent viewing time.\n\n2. **Discussion Questions:**\n   - \"What do you notice on the ground in this picture? What colors do you see?\"\n   - \"Where do you think all these leaves came from? What season is this?\"\n   - \"Do you think these leaves will stay on the ground forever, or will something happen to them?\"\n   - \"What do you think the grass and ground will look like in a few months?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** Ask students to turn and talk to a partner: *\"I wonder what happens to all these fallen leaves over time...\"* Invite 3-4 students to share their wonderings aloud. Record these on chart paper without judgment.\n\n4. **Prediction Chart:** Create a two-column chart on the board labeled \"What We Think Happens\" and \"What We Want to Find Out.\" Fill in student predictions from their wonder responses.\n\n**Transition:** \"Scientists study how Earth changes by observing things like leaves and soil. Today, we're going to investigate what happens to leaves and how they help change our Earth.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate leaf decomposition stages and gather observational evidence about how organic material weathers over time.\n\n**Materials (per group of 2-3 students):**\n- Collected leaves in various stages of decomposition (10-15 leaves per group, ranging from fresh/recently fallen to partially brown/brittle to heavily decomposed/dark brown)\n- Hand lenses (1 per student)\n- White paper or paper plates (1 per group)\n- Colored pencils or crayons\n- Observation worksheet (template provided below)\n- Small plastic bags or containers for storing leaves between sessions\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Spread your leaves on the white paper in front of you. You are going to sort them into groups based on how they look.\"\n\n2. \"Look at each leaf carefully with your hand lens. Notice the color, texture, and how it feels when you gently touch it. Does it feel stiff or do the edges crumble?\"\n\n3. \"Arrange the leaves from the ones that look newest and brightest to the ones that look oldest and most broken down. This is your leaf timeline.\"\n\n4. \"Draw or sketch each group of leaves on your observation worksheet. Label them: Fresh Leaf, Changing Leaf, and Decomposing Leaf. Write 2-3 words to describe what each stage looks like.\"\n\n5. \"Talk with your partner: What do you think is happening to the leaves? What might be breaking them apart?\"\n\n6. \"Gently tap one of the decomposing leaves over a piece of dark paper. What falls off? Why do you think that happens?\"\n\n**Connection to Photograph:** Explain that all the leaves on the ground in the photograph are in different stages of this same process they're observing.\n\n**What Students Should Record:**\n- Labeled drawings or sketches of leaf stages\n- Descriptive words for each stage (color, texture, condition)\n- Observations about what falls from decomposing leaves\n- One sentence prediction about what might be breaking down the leaves\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate to groups and ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice about the color?\" \"How is this leaf different from that one?\" \"What do you think caused that change?\"\n- Avoid providing answers; instead, encourage students to look more carefully or compare leaves directly\n- Prompt students to use hand lenses if they're making only surface observations\n- Note which students are thinking about time (\"getting older\") and which need that concept reinforced\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students organize leaves into a sequence representing decomposition stages\n- Students use observational vocabulary (brown, crumbly, thin, etc.) to describe changes\n- Students record at least one hypothesis about what causes leaves to break down\n- Students notice that decomposing leaves become fragments or powder\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student observations to Earth science concepts about weathering, decomposition, and landscape change.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Vocabulary word cards (printed or written)\n- Photograph displayed again\n- Student observation worksheets from Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Invite 2-3 groups to share their leaf arrangements and describe what they observed\n   - Ask other students: \"Do you see the same pattern in your leaves?\"\n   - Acknowledge and validate observations: \"You noticed the colors change and the leaves become more fragile—that's exactly what scientists observe too.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   Create a visual anchor chart with these terms, using simple definitions and connecting each to what students observed:\n\n   **Weathering:** The breaking down of rocks and materials on Earth's surface by wind, water, ice, or living things. (*In our activity: leaves are being broken down by time and touch, just like rocks are broken down on mountaintops.*)\n\n   **Decomposition:** The natural process where dead plants and animals break down into smaller pieces and become part of the soil. (*The leaves you looked at are decomposing—falling apart and turning into material that will become part of the earth.*)\n\n   **Erosion:** The wearing away and moving of rock or soil by water, wind, ice, or living things. (*When leaves decompose and crumble, tiny pieces get moved by wind and water—that's erosion.*)\n\n   **Soil Formation:** The slow process where weathered rock, decomposed plants, water, and air mix together to create soil that plants need to grow. (*All the leaves falling creates a layer that will become soil.*)\n\n   **Vegetation:** All the plants in an area. (*The grass in the photo and the trees that lost leaves are vegetation.*)\n\n3. **Make Connections (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the photograph again: \"Look at all these leaves on the ground. Each one is going through the stages you just observed. Over days and weeks and months, they will decompose.\"\n   - Ask: \"Why is this important to Earth?\" Guide students toward the idea that decomposition creates soil and changes the landscape over time.\n   - Emphasize: \"When we see leaves in different stages, that's evidence that Earth is always changing, even in small ways.\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   Ask students to complete quick sentence stems aloud or on paper:\n   - \"Weathering happens when _____.\"\n   - \"Leaves decompose by _____.\"\n   - \"When leaves break down, they help make _____.\"\n\n**Vocabulary Summary Chart:**\nDisplay this visually in the classroom for reference:\n\n| Term | What It Means | What We Saw |\n|------|---------------|------------|\n| **Weathering** | Breaking down of materials by nature | Leaves losing color and falling apart |\n| **Decomposition** | Dead things breaking into soil | Old leaves becoming dark and crumbly |\n| **Erosion** | Movement of broken pieces | Leaf fragments scattered by wind/water |\n| **Soil Formation** | Creation of earth where plants grow | Decomposed leaves becoming part of ground |\n| **Vegetation** | All the plants in an area | Grass, leaves, trees in the photo |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can explain that leaves break down naturally over time through weathering and decomposition\n- Students understand that this process is connected to how Earth changes\n- Students use vocabulary terms with general accuracy (not perfect application, but clear understanding)\n- Students recognize that vegetation plays a role in creating soil and shaping landscapes\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply decomposition and weathering concepts to predict landscape change over time and understand vegetation's role in erosion prevention.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper or large poster board (1 per group)\n- Markers, colored pencils\n- Leaf samples (fresh ones if available, or drawn representations)\n- Small pebbles or gravel (optional, for demonstration)\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Two aluminum pans or trays\n- Soil samples\n\n**Activity Option A: Timeline Creation (Recommended for most classrooms)**\n\n1. **Task:** In groups, students create a visual timeline showing the ground in autumn at different time intervals.\n\n2. **Timeline Frames:**\n   - Week 1: Leaves freshly fallen (students draw or glue fresh leaves)\n   - Month 1: Leaves partially decomposed (students draw browning, curling leaves)\n   - Month 3: Mostly decomposed into dark material (students draw or color with browns/blacks)\n   - Month 6: Integrated into soil (students show layer of rich earth with some leaf pieces visible)\n\n3. **Teacher Prompt:** \"Use what you learned about decomposition stages. What changes each month? What role does the vegetation play in changing Earth?\"\n\n4. **Student Task:** For each frame, students write 1-2 sentences explaining what's happening to the leaves and why this matters to the ground below.\n\n5. **Connection Question:** \"How does this slow change in the ground connect to bigger changes on Earth over years and years?\"\n\n**Activity Option B: Erosion Prevention Demonstration (If time and resources allow)**\n\nThis demonstrates vegetation's role in slowing erosion (4-ESS2-1):\n\n1. **Setup:** Divide class in half. One group observes a bare soil sample in a tray; the other observes soil covered with leaves/vegetation.\n\n2. **Simulation:** Gently spray water on both samples at the same rate. Ask students to observe and record what happens to the soil in each case.\n\n3. **Discussion:** \"Which soil stayed in place better? Why? How does vegetation (like leaves) help protect Earth?\" Guide students to see that the leaf layer slows water movement and erosion.\n\n4. **Real-World Connection:** \"In the photo, the leaves on the ground are like a protective blanket. They help keep the soil from washing away when it rains.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- For Timeline: Circulate with guiding questions: \"What color were the leaves at the beginning?\" \"What do you think happens next?\" \"Why do you think the leaves change?\"\n- For Erosion Demo: Facilitate careful observation. Ask: \"What's different between the two samples?\" Let students discover the protective effect rather than stating it.\n- Ensure groups are thinking about time scales and connecting to the vocabulary from Explain phase\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation showing at least 3 stages of leaf decomposition\n- Students write statements showing understanding that decomposition changes Earth's surface over time\n- Students recognize that vegetation affects erosion and landscape protection\n- Students use terms like \"weathering,\" \"decomposition,\" and \"soil\" in their explanations\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of decomposition, weathering, and how vegetation affects Earth's landscapes using multiple strategies.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout the lesson):**\n- **Observation Notes:** Track which students used vocabulary accurately during group discussions and wrote complete observations during Explore\n- **Worksheet Review:** Check observation worksheets from Explore phase for evidence of sequential thinking and descriptive language\n- **Discussion Participation:** Note students who ask follow-up questions and make connections between phases\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (15 minutes):**\n\nAdminister one of these options based on your class needs:\n\n**Option 1: Written Exit Ticket (Recommended)**\n\nStudents complete on a half-sheet of paper or digital form:\n\n1. \"Draw or describe what happens to a leaf after it falls on the ground. Show at least two stages.\"\n\n2. \"What is decomposition? Use your own words and give an example from what you saw today.\"\n\n3. \"How does vegetation (trees, grass, leaves) help change Earth over time? Complete this sentence: Vegetation helps Earth change by _____.\"\n\n4. \"True or False: Weathering and erosion are the same thing. Explain your answer in one sentence.\"\n\n**Option 2: Quick Oral Assessment (If writing is a barrier)**\n\nAsk each student 1-2 of these questions in a brief one-on-one check or small group:\n- \"What stage of decomposition did you see in our leaves today?\"\n- \"Can you use the word 'weathering' in a sentence about what you observed?\"\n- \"Why do you think it's important that leaves decompose?\"\n\n**Option 3: Sketch with Labels (For visual learners)**\n\nStudents draw the timeline they created during Elaborate with labels showing:\n- The stages of decomposition\n- Where weathering is happening\n- Evidence that Earth is changing\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\nStudents demonstrate understanding if they:\n- ✓ Describe at least 2 stages of leaf decomposition accurately\n- ✓ Use at least 2 science vocabulary terms (weathering, decomposition, erosion, soil, vegetation) with general accuracy\n- ✓ Make a connection between fallen leaves and how Earth changes over time\n- ✓ Recognize that vegetation plays a role in landscape change (through decomposition, erosion prevention, or soil formation)\n\n**How to Determine if Learning Objectives Were Met:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Evidence to Look For |\n|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Observe and describe leaf changes over time | Exit ticket shows 2+ stages; observation worksheet is detailed |\n| Identify evidence of weathering/erosion effects | Student can explain how leaves break down; mentions wind, water, or natural breakdown |\n| Explain decomposition's role in soil formation | Written or oral response connects decomposed leaves to soil/earth |\n| Predict decomposition stages | Timeline or drawings show logical progression; predictions align with observations |\n\n**If Students Don't Demonstrate Understanding:**\n- Reteach vocabulary using the photograph and leaf samples as reference materials\n- Repeat a simplified version of the Explore activity focusing on observable color/texture changes\n- Pair struggling students with stronger partners to review the vocabulary anchor chart\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Simplified Leaf Sorting:** Provide only 3-4 leaves in clearly different stages instead of 10-15. Pre-sort some leaves and ask students to continue the pattern. Use a picture-based sorting guide showing \"fresh,\" \"changing,\" and \"decomposed\" with visual examples.\n\n2. **Vocabulary Anchoring:** Create a laminated vocabulary reference card with pictures for each student to keep at their desk during Explain and Elaborate phases. Include visual examples (photo of fresh leaf, brown leaf, crumbly leaf) alongside each word.\n\n3. **Graphic Organizer for Timeline:** Provide a pre-drawn timeline with blanks for students to fill in (word bank included). Give sentence starters: \"At Week 1, the leaves are _____. At Month 1, the leaves are becoming _____.\"\n\n4. **Partner-Supported Exit Ticket:** Allow students to respond to exit questions verbally to an aide or peer, who records answers. Or provide multiple-choice options for true/false questions.\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Decomposition Investigation:** Ask advanced students to research and report on \"What breaks down leaves?\" (bacteria, fungi, insects, temperature, moisture). Have them create a detailed explanation of the *cause* of decomposition, not just the stages. Challenge: \"Are there things that decompose faster or slower? Why might that be?\"\n\n2. **Scaled Time Thinking:** Ask students to predict how long complete decomposition takes (weeks? months? years?) and research local conditions that speed up or slow down the process. Create a \"Time to Decompose\" chart for different items (leaves, wood, soil organisms, rocks) showing relative timescales.\n\n3. **Cross-System Connections:** Challenge students to trace what happens to leaves in three different ecosystems (forest, desert, aquatic) and how decomposition varies. Create a comparison poster: \"How Does Decomposition Change in Different Places?\"\n\n4. **Erosion Experimentation:** Let students design their own erosion prevention experiment. Provide materials (soil, water, leaves, mulch, grass clippings) and ask: \"What material best prevents erosion? Why?\" Have them predict, test, and explain using scientific reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Seasonal Observation Journal (Ongoing, 1-2 weeks)**\n   \n   Have students select a small outdoor area (corner of the playground, garden bed) and observe it every 2-3 days. They sketch or photograph the same spot and record: \"How do the leaves look today? Are they more decomposed? What animals or insects have moved them?\" This reinforces that decomposition and weathering happen continuously and connects to long-term change. Students can present findings showing evidence of Earth's constant change.\n\n2. **Soil Composition Investigation (30-40 minutes, separate session)**\n   \n   Bring in soil samples from school grounds and compare them to the prepared soil used in earlier activities. Ask: \"Where did this soil come from? What do you think is in it?\" Help students identify decomposed material, small rocks (weathered), and organic matter. Discuss: \"Could decomposed leaves be part of our school's soil?\" This extends understanding of soil formation and how vegetation literally becomes part of Earth.\n\n3. **Leaf Decomposition Time-Lapse Documentation (2-3 weeks)**\n   \n   Place fresh leaves in clear containers and photograph them every 3-4 days. Create a time-lapse presentation or photo series showing decomposition stages in your specific classroom environment. Compare decomposition rates (wet vs. dry leaves, covered vs. exposed, indoors vs. outdoors). Present findings to another class explaining: \"We have evidence that these factors speed up or slow down weathering and decomposition!\"\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Photograph Connection:** Reference the fall_seasons.jpg throughout all five phases. Repeatedly point to details (the basketball court in the background showing a familiar space covered in leaves, the variety of colors, the density of leaf coverage) to help students ground abstract concepts in the visible, concrete image.\n\n- **Safety Reminder:** If collecting leaves outdoors, ensure no contact with diseased, moldy, or insect-infested leaves. Have students wash hands after handling natural materials.\n\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** The five vocabulary terms introduced in Explain are ambitious for one lesson. Prioritize **weathering** and **decomposition** as the core terms; other terms can be revisited in future lessons about erosion or soil science.\n\n- **NGSS Alignment Check:** This lesson directly addresses 4-ESS2-1 (observations of weathering/erosion by vegetation) through the leaf investigation. It supports 4-ESS1-1 (evidence of change over time) through the timeline and decomposition stages students observe. The photograph itself is evidence of a landscape in seasonal transition—a visible representation of change over time.\n\n- **Cross-Curricular Connection:** This lesson pairs well with language arts (journaling observations, descriptive writing about changes) and can introduce literacy standards around sequencing and non-fiction writing.",
