ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about fossils and activate prior knowledge about rocks and ancient life.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of ammonite fossils (displayed via projector or printed copies, 1 per student pair)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: Real fossil replicas or images of different fossil types (ammonites, trilobites, shells)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on the projector in a large, clear format. Do NOT explain what it is. Simply show it for 10 seconds in silence and ask students to observe carefully.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** (write on chart paper as you ask):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What shapes do you notice?\"\n   - \"Do you think these objects are alive or not alive? Why do you think that?\"\n   - \"These rocks have patterns that look like spirals and bumps. What could have made these patterns?\"\n   - \"If I told you these spirals are over 100 million years old, what questions would you have?\"\n\n3. **Elicit predictions:** \"Turn to a partner and predict: What do you think these rocks are? Where do you think they came from?\" Allow 2-3 volunteers to share predictions. Write these on chart paper without confirming or correcting.\n\n4. **Build mystery and intrigue:** \"Today, we're going to be detectives. We're going to explore what these rocks are and discover how we can read Earth's ancient history from rocks. Ready to investigate?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Before we solve this mystery, let's build our own fossils and see if we can figure out how nature creates these amazing rocks.\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover how fossils form through hands-on modeling of the fossilization process.\n\n**Materials (per student group of 2-3):**\n- Small container or shallow plastic dish (yogurt cup, paper bowl)\n- Playdough or air-dry clay (enough to fill container halfway)\n- Small shells, plastic toy dinosaurs, leaves, or plaster \"fossil imprints\" (gather safe, clean items beforehand)\n- Water in a small cup\n- Sand or crushed crackers (to simulate sediment layers)\n- Spoon or craft stick for pressing\n- Paper towel\n- Student recording sheet (see below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. \"Press your playdough firmly into the bottom of your container. Make it flat and about 1 inch thick. This is like the bottom layer of Earth.\"\n\n2. \"Choose an object from your fossil kit (shell, leaf, or toy). Press it firmly into the playdough. Press hard so it makes a clear imprint! Imagine this object lived millions of years ago and got buried in mud.\"\n\n3. \"Now, sprinkle sand (or crushed crackers) over your object. Use your spoon to gently layer it on. This sand represents more Earth material settling on top—just like what happens in real life over thousands of years.\"\n\n4. \"Add another thin layer of playdough on top of the sand. Press it down gently. Now your 'fossil' is buried under layers of rock and sediment!\"\n\n5. \"Let your model sit for 2-3 minutes so the playdough can set slightly. Then, carefully peel back the top layer of playdough to reveal the imprint underneath. That imprint is like a fossil!\"\n\n6. \"Observe your fossil imprint closely. Sketch it on your recording sheet and answer: 'What object made this fossil imprint? What do you think scientists could learn from finding this in real rocks?'\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups asking guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the imprint? Is it a copy of the real object or a space where the object was? How is this like what might happen in nature?\"\n- Resist giving direct answers; encourage observation and prediction.\n- Manage materials and timing to keep groups on task.\n- Remind students that real fossils take millions of years, but our model shows the *idea* of how they form.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create clear imprints in their playdough models.\n- Students sketch their fossil imprints.\n- Students make initial observations about what the imprint shows.\n- Students generate questions about how this process works in nature over very long time periods.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce fossil vocabulary and connect classroom models to real fossils and Earth processes.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Original photograph (displayed again)\n- Chart paper with vocabulary and definitions\n- Student-friendly reference sheet (one per student, printed)\n- Real fossil images or replica fossils (if available)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations from Explore:** Ask 3-4 groups to show their fossil models to the class and explain what they discovered. Record their ideas on chart paper.\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** while pointing to the original photograph:\n\n**Vocabulary (with Third Grade-friendly definitions):**\n\n- **Fossil:** The preserved remains or imprints of a plant or animal that lived long, long ago. Fossils are found in rocks and tell us about Earth's past.\n  \n- **Imprint:** A shape or pattern left behind when an object presses into soft material (like mud or clay). In nature, an imprint can become a fossil.\n  \n- **Sediment:** Tiny pieces of rock, sand, and shells that settle and build up in layers over time. Sediment can harden into rock.\n  \n- **Preserved:** Kept in the same condition; protected from breaking down or disappearing.\n  \n- **Ancient:** Very, very old—from a long time ago.\n\n3. **Make explicit connections:**\n   - \"These spirals you see in the photograph? They're called **ammonites**. They were sea creatures that lived in oceans over 100 million years ago—much longer ago than dinosaurs! They're all gone now, but they left behind these fossil imprints, just like your playdough models.\"\n   - \"When these creatures died, they got buried in mud and sand—**sediment**. Over millions of years, the sediment got pressed down harder and harder until it turned into rock. But the imprint of the creature stayed there, **preserved** in the rock.\"\n   - \"Now, when we find these rocks, we're like detectives. We can read the fossils and learn what Earth looked like long, long ago!\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding:**\n   - \"Show me with your hands: If I'm an ancient creature and I sink into mud, what shape will my imprint be?\"\n   - \"Why do you think ammonites are no longer alive? Can you think of other creatures that don't live on Earth anymore?\"\n   - Ask students to turn and explain to a partner: \"What's the difference between a fossil and a regular rock?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define and use the terms: fossil, imprint, sediment, preserved, ancient.\n- Students understand that fossils are evidence of ancient life.\n- Students can explain that sediment becomes rock over long periods of time.\n- Students connect their model experience to real fossil formation.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply fossil understanding to new contexts and explore real-world fossil evidence.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Images of different types of fossils (ammonites, trilobites, leaf fossils, dinosaur bones) printed or displayed\n- \"Fossil Detective Checklist\" (worksheet provided below)\n- Optional: Access to a simple online fossil database or fossil field guide book\n- Chart paper and markers\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Fossil Detective Investigation (Recommended for most students)**\n\n1. Show students 4-5 images of different real fossils (ammonites, trilobites, shells, leaves, bones).\n\n2. Provide each student or pair with a \"Fossil Detective Checklist\":\n   - \"Look at each fossil image carefully.\"\n   - \"Draw or describe what you see.\"\n   - \"Check the box: Was this a plant or animal?\"\n   - \"Write: What clues help you decide?\"\n   - \"Predict: What was Earth like when this creature or plant was alive?\"\n\n3. Students complete the checklist for 2-3 fossils of their choice.\n\n4. **Group discussion:** Share observations. Ask: \"If we find ammonite fossils in rocks near our town, what does that tell us about our town millions of years ago? (Hint: It might have been under water!)\"\n\n**Option B: Fossil Timeline Activity (For students ready for deeper sequence)**\n\n1. Create a simple timeline on chart paper showing: \"200 million years ago → 100 million years ago → Present day\"\n\n2. Provide students with fossil images and labels. Students place fossils on the timeline (with teacher guidance) and predict what Earth looked like at each time period.\n\n3. Discuss: \"How has Earth changed? What animals are gone now? Are there new animals now?\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discovery by asking, \"What clues in the fossil help you decide if it was a plant or animal?\"\n- Guide students to notice details: shells imply ocean environments; leaf fossils imply forests, etc.\n- Help students make the leap: \"If we find ocean fossils on land, that tells us something important—this land used to be underwater!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students identify characteristics of different fossils.\n- Students make inferences about ancient environments based on fossil evidence.\n- Students understand that Earth's surface and life have changed over deep time.\n- Students can articulate: \"Fossils are clues to Earth's past.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of fossil formation, evidence, and Earth's changes.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation of student model-building in Explore phase (Do students create clear imprints and layer materials?)\n- Questioning during Explain phase (Can students define fossil and explain layering?)\n- Checklist completion in Elaborate phase (Do students identify fossil types and make reasonable inferences?)\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket. Students draw or write responses to these prompts:\n\n1. **\"What is a fossil? Draw or write your answer.\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student mentions \"old remains\" or \"preserved\" or \"imprint\" of a plant/animal.\n\n2. **\"How do fossils form? Put these steps in order: (A) Creature dies and gets buried in mud, (B) Mud turns into rock, (C) Scientists find the fossil today.\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student orders steps as: A → B → C.\n\n3. **\"Look at this fossil imprint [show image of ammonite or other spiral shell]. What can we learn about Earth from this fossil? What do you think was here millions of years ago?\"**\n   - *Success Criteria:* Student infers something about ancient environment (e.g., \"There was an ocean here\" or \"Sea creatures lived here\").\n\n**Alternative Summative Option: Fossil Poster**\n\nStudents create a one-page poster labeled \"My Fossil Discovery\" that includes:\n- A drawing or photo of a fossil\n- Labels pointing to interesting features\n- 2-3 sentences explaining: What was it? How did it form? What does it tell us about Earth?\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- At least 75% of students correctly define fossil and explain basic formation.\n- At least 80% of students sequence fossil formation steps correctly.\n- At least 70% of students make a reasonable inference about ancient environment from fossil evidence.\n- Student work shows use of vocabulary: fossil, imprint, sediment, ancient.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners):\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary:** Provide a vocabulary picture card set before the lesson. Show images paired with simple words (fossil + picture of spiral, sediment + picture of sand layers, ancient + picture of dinosaur). Review 2-3 times during Explain phase.\n\n2. **Simplify the model:** Provide students with pre-made fossil imprints (use playdough pressed with objects ahead of time). Students simply observe and describe rather than create their own. Focus their learning on recognizing fossils and understanding they are old.\n\n3. **Guided questioning:** During Exit Ticket, allow students to circle or point to answers rather than write. Offer sentence stems: \"This fossil is _____ years old. It shows that Earth had _____ (water/land).\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners):\n\n1. **Introduce radiometric dating concept (simple version):** \"Scientists have ways to figure out how old fossils are, called dating. Some fossils are 65 million years old! Others are only 1 million. How could scientists tell which is older?\" Students research and discuss.\n\n2. **Compare evolution through fossils:** Show a series of fossil images showing change over time (e.g., horse evolution or shell size changes). \"How do you think organisms changed over millions of years? What might cause these changes?\" Connect to adaptation concept (not required but enriching).\n\n3. **Design a museum exhibit:** Students choose a fossil type and create a detailed placard for a museum that includes: fossil name, age, habitat, how it formed, and interesting facts. Peer shares.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Fossil Hunt\" Class Project:**\n   - Take students on a walk around the schoolyard or field to search for rocks that *might* contain fossils or show interesting textures/layering (sedimentary rock examples).\n   - Collect 5-6 interesting rocks. Back in class, students use magnifying glasses to examine them.\n   - Create a chart: \"Rocks We Found\" with sketches and observations. Discuss: \"Even if we didn't find fossils, what does this rock tell us?\" (texture, color, composition as clues to Earth materials).\n\n2. **Fossil Mold Casting (Take-Home Activity):**\n   - Send home small plaster or air-dry clay kits with instructions for parents and students to create a fossil imprint cast together.\n   - Students bring back their home-made fossil and add it to a classroom \"Fossil Collection Display.\"\n   - Write brief labels: student name, date, \"imprint of a ___.\"\n\n3. **Digital Exploration—Virtual Fossil Museum:**\n   - Many institutions offer online fossil databases and virtual tours (e.g., Smithsonian, National Geographic Kids, state geological surveys).\n   - Allow students to explore age-appropriate virtual fossil collections in pairs.\n   - Students select one fossil to \"adopt\" and create an information card: name, age, where it was found, fun fact.\n   - Display in classroom or present to class.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Timing:** If you're short on time, the fossil model activity (Explore) can be done as a teacher demonstration instead of fully student-led, though hands-on engagement is more powerful.\n- **Materials sourcing:** For actual fossils or replicas, check your school's science supply closet or request from your district. Many geology museums offer inexpensive replica fossils. Alternatively, high-quality images work well for this grade level.\n- **Connection to standards:** While this lesson emphasizes Earth materials and natural resources (implicit in ESS), the explicit NGSS connections are stronger when you discuss how we use fossil data to understand Earth's systems and changes over time.\n- **Safety:** Ensure all shells, toys, and materials used in the fossil model are clean and safe (no sharp edges). Playdough and air-dry clay are non-toxic, but supervise use.\n\n---\n\nThis lesson brings Third Grade students into the wonder of deep time, making abstract concepts (millions of years, Earth's history, extinct organisms) tangible through modeling and direct observation. Students leave with an understanding that rocks tell stories and that Earth is constantly changing.",
