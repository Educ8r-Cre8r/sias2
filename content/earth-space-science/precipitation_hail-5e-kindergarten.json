  "content": "# 5E Lesson Plan: Hail—Ice Balls from the Sky\n\n### Core Science Concepts from Image Analysis\n- **Precipitation:** Water falling from clouds in different forms (rain, snow, sleet, hail)\n- **Weather patterns:** Observable changes in atmospheric conditions that occur over time\n- **Properties of ice:** Hard, round, and frozen water that falls during severe weather\n- **Weather observation:** Using observations of natural phenomena to describe and predict weather patterns\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Title\nBouncing Ice Balls: Exploring Hail and Severe Weather\n\n---\n\n### Lesson Overview\n- **Grade Level:** Kindergarten\n- **Subject:** Science (Earth and Space Science)\n- **Time Allotment:** Two 30-minute sessions (or one 60-minute block with a break)\n- **NGSS Standards:** \n  - K-ESS2-1: Use and share observations of local weather conditions to describe patterns over time\n  - K-ESS3-2: Ask questions to obtain information about the purpose of weather forecasting to prepare for, and respond to, severe weather\n\n---\n\n### Learning Objectives\nStudents will be able to:\n1. Observe and describe the appearance and properties of hail using their senses (sight, touch)\n2. Identify hail as a type of weather that happens in the sky and falls to the ground\n3. Explain that hail is frozen water and feels very cold and hard\n4. Ask questions about what to do when hail or severe weather happens\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest by introducing the photograph of hail and activating prior knowledge about weather.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Printed or projected photograph of hail (precipitation_hail.jpg)\n  - Chart paper or whiteboard\n  - Markers\n\n- **Activity:**\n  Display the photograph large and clear on the board or print it for small group viewing. Ask students to gather around and look carefully.\n  \n  **Discussion Questions:**\n  - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe what's on the ground.\"\n  - \"Have you ever felt or seen balls of ice fall from the sky? What was it like?\"\n  - \"Do these ice balls look like the rain we usually see? How are they different?\"\n  - \"Why do you think these ice balls landed all over the ground like that?\"\n  \n  **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder what happens in the clouds to make ice balls instead of regular rain. Let's find out together!\"\n  \n  Record student observations and questions on chart paper to revisit later.\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today we're going to explore hail by making our own ice and learning what happens when it rains ice instead of water.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students investigate the properties of ice and compare it to water through sensory exploration.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Ice cubes (several for each pair of students, or use frozen grapes as an alternative)\n  - Small bowls or cups (one per pair)\n  - Warm water in a basin (teacher-controlled)\n  - Paper towels\n  - Optional: cotton balls or small objects to observe how ice affects them\n  - Sensory exploration chart (pre-made or drawn on paper with columns: \"Looks Like,\" \"Feels Like,\" \"Sounds Like\")\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Step 1:** Distribute ice cubes to pairs of students in small bowls. Instruct students:\n  - \"Hold the ice in your hand. What does it feel like? Is it hot or cold?\"\n  - \"Look closely at the ice. What color is it? Is it smooth or bumpy?\"\n  - \"Listen carefully—does the ice make any sounds?\"\n  \n  **Step 2:** Students describe their observations aloud while the teacher records responses on the sensory chart.\n  \n  **Step 3:** Ask: \"What happens if we wait? Does the ice stay the same?\" Place one ice cube on a paper towel and observe for 2-3 minutes. Watch and record what happens.\n  \n  **Step 4:** Optional: Show students warm water from the basin (teacher-controlled). Ask: \"What do you think will happen if we put ice in warm water?\" Demonstrate and observe together.\n  \n  **Connection to Photograph:** \"The ice we're holding is like the hail in the picture—both are frozen water that falls from clouds. Hail is much bigger and colder because it comes from very high in the sky!\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Facilitate safe exploration (monitor cold exposure)\n  - Ask open-ended questions: \"What's changing?\" \"Why do you think that's happening?\"\n  - Record observations without offering answers\n  - Guide students to notice that ice melts when it warms up\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students describe ice as cold, hard, clear/white, and smooth or bumpy\n  - Students observe that ice melts into water when it warms up\n  - Students make connections between ice and hail\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Introduce vocabulary and formally explain hail and precipitation using sensory observations and the photograph.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n  - Photograph of hail (displayed again)\n  - Picture cards of different weather types (rain, snow, hail, sleet—optional)\n  - Visual model or globe showing clouds\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Group Share-Out:** Ask students to share what they discovered about ice. Record key words and phrases on chart paper.\n  \n  **Introduce Key Vocabulary:**\n  \n  1. **Hail** – Balls of ice that fall from clouds during thunderstorms and severe weather\n  2. **Ice** – Frozen water that is hard and very cold\n  3. **Precipitation** – Water falling from clouds (can be rain, snow, sleet, or hail)\n  4. **Weather** – What it's like outside—sunny, rainy, cold, hot, windy, stormy\n  5. **Severe weather** – Dangerous weather like thunderstorms with hail or heavy rain\n  \n  **Direct Instruction:**\n  \"When it gets very cold high up in the clouds, water freezes into ice. These ice balls are called hail. Hail falls really fast from the sky, just like the rain we know. But hail is frozen, so it's very hard and cold. Hail is a type of precipitation—that's the word we use for water falling from the sky in any form.\"\n  \n  Point back to the photograph: \"See all these ice balls? That's hail that fell to the ground.\"\n  \n  **Check for Understanding:**\n  - \"Is hail frozen or wet?\"\n  - \"Does hail feel warm or cold?\"\n  - \"Is hail a type of weather? What is the other type we know about?\" (rain)\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Hail:** Frozen balls of ice that fall from storm clouds\n  - **Ice:** Water that is frozen and very hard and cold\n  - **Precipitation:** Any water falling from clouds (rain, snow, hail, sleet)\n  - **Weather:** What it's like outside (hot, cold, rainy, sunny, snowy, stormy)\n  - **Severe weather:** Dangerous or extreme weather, like big storms with hail\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students use the word \"hail\" to describe frozen precipitation\n  - Students explain that hail is cold, hard ice\n  - Students understand hail is a type of weather that falls from clouds\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n- **Objective:** Students apply their understanding of hail and weather to think about safety and preparation for severe weather.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Picture cards showing safe places during a hailstorm (inside a building, in a car, under a roof)\n  - Blank paper or coloring paper\n  - Crayons or markers\n  - Optional: photograph of hail damage (optional, if age-appropriate) or video clip of hail (< 30 seconds)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Scenario Discussion:**\n  \"Imagine it's a sunny day and you're playing outside. Suddenly, dark clouds come and hail starts falling. What should you do to stay safe? Where would you go?\"\n  \n  Show picture cards of safe places (indoors, car, building with a roof). Discuss why these places protect us from hail.\n  \n  **Creative Application:**\n  Students draw a picture showing themselves in a safe place during a hailstorm, OR create a simple \"Safety Plan\" with teacher scribing:\n  - \"If hail falls, I will go to...\"\n  - Students complete the sentence with a safe location\n  \n  **Real-World Connection:**\n  \"People who work outside, like farmers, watch weather forecasts to know when hail might come. Weather reporters help us stay safe by telling us when severe weather is coming. If we know hail is coming, we can prepare and stay inside!\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Facilitate discussion without inducing fear; keep tone matter-of-fact\n  - Ask guiding questions: \"Why would a roof keep you safe?\" \"Why should we go inside?\"\n  - Scribe responses for students who need support\n  - Validate all reasonable safety ideas\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students identify safe places to go during severe weather\n  - Students demonstrate understanding that weather forecasts help people prepare\n  - Students show their learning through drawing or oral explanation\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of hail, precipitation, and weather observation.\n\n- **Activity:**\n  \n  **Formative Assessment (Throughout the Lesson):**\n  - Listen for vocabulary use during discussions (hail, ice, precipitation, weather)\n  - Observe student behavior during ice exploration (do they notice melting, temperature, texture?)\n  - Ask targeted questions: \"What is hail made of?\" \"Why do we need to know about severe weather?\"\n  \n  **Exit Ticket/Summative Assessment (Choose one):**\n  \n  **Option 1 – Verbal Check-Out:**\n  As students line up or prepare to leave, ask each student individually:\n  - \"Tell me one thing you learned about hail today.\"\n  - \"What does hail feel like?\"\n  - \"Where would you go if hail started falling?\"\n  \n  **Option 2 – Quick Drawing:**\n  Students draw hail or a safe place to be during hail. Teacher asks them to explain their picture.\n  \n  **Option 3 – Picture Sort:**\n  Show images of rain, snow, hail, and sun. Ask students to point to the picture of hail and explain why it's different from rain.\n  \n  **Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n  - ✓ Student correctly identifies hail as frozen water or ice\n  - ✓ Student describes at least one property of hail (cold, hard, small, round, etc.)\n  - ✓ Student names a safe place to go during severe weather\n  - ✓ Student uses the word \"hail\" or \"precipitation\" appropriately in context\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Most students will identify hail as \"ice that falls\" or \"frozen rain\"\n  - Students will describe hail as cold or hard\n  - Students will name at least one safe location (inside, building, car, house)\n  - Students will demonstrate curiosity about weather and ask follow-up questions\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n1. **Simplified vocabulary:** Use \"ice balls\" and \"frozen water\" instead of \"hail\" and \"precipitation\" initially; introduce official terms gradually through repetition\n2. **Hand-over-hand guidance:** Pair students with a peer or adult during ice exploration to model observation and questioning\n3. **Visual supports:** Use picture cards and real photographs consistently; point to the image when introducing new concepts so students make visual-verbal connections\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n1. **Deeper questioning:** \"Why does ice form in clouds instead of rain? What has to happen for water to freeze?\" Introduce the concept of temperature and freezing point in simple terms\n2. **Extended investigation:** Ask: \"What happens if we put the ice in the freezer? In the sun? In cold vs. warm water?\" Have students make predictions and test them\n3. **Weather tracking:** Ask students to keep a simple weather observation journal for one week, drawing or pointing to pictures of each day's weather, then identify patterns (\"It rained three days. It was sunny two days.\")\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Hail Story Dramatization (15-20 minutes):**\n   Students act out the journey of a water droplet from the ocean → evaporation → cloud formation → freezing into hail → falling to Earth. Use scarves, movements, and sound effects. This reinforces the water cycle concept and makes the process memorable and engaging.\n\n2. **Weather Forecast Role-Play (15-20 minutes):**\n   Set up a weather reporter station with a globe or weather map. Students take turns being the \"weather reporter,\" pointing to a picture of hail or another weather type and announcing: \"Watch out for hail today! Stay inside and stay safe!\" This develops communication skills and reinforces severe weather awareness.\n\n3. **Sensory Ice Exploration Station (ongoing):**\n   Create a classroom sensory station with ice, water, towels, and observation tools (magnifying glasses, thermometers if appropriate). Add objects like small toys or cotton balls and ask: \"Does hail move things when it falls?\" Students explore independently during choice time or while other activities are happening.\n\n4. **Take-Home Weather Observer Chart (homework):**\n   Send home a simple checklist for families: draw or point to what the weather is like each day for one week. Families record rain, sun, clouds, snow, or hail. Bring charts back to class and create a class graph showing \"What was the weather like this week?\"\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\n- Kindergarteners are concrete thinkers, so the hands-on ice exploration is essential—they learn through sensory experience\n- Keep safety messages about severe weather calm and factual; the goal is preparedness, not fear\n- The photograph provides a powerful anchor for understanding—reference it frequently throughout all five phases\n- Consider timing: if hail or thunderstorms are in the forecast, this is the perfect time to teach this lesson\n- Some students may have experienced hail and can share their personal stories—this validates their experience and deepens classroom discussion",
