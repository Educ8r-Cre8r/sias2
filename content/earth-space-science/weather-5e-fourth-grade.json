ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about severe weather by examining the photograph and connecting it to their own experiences with storms.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or projected photograph of the severe weather scene\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: short video clip (30 seconds) of approaching storm clouds\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently on screen or as a printed poster. Give students 30 seconds of silent observation time, asking them to simply look and notice details without speaking.\n\n2. **Ask these specific discussion questions** (pause for student responses after each):\n   - \"What do you notice about the sky in this photograph? What color is it, and what does that tell you?\"\n   - \"Look at the clouds. Do they look like regular clouds you see on a nice day? What is different about them?\"\n   - \"If you were standing on this street, what might you feel or hear? What might you be thinking?\"\n   - \"What do you think is about to happen in this place?\"\n\n3. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder what people living or working here should do to stay safe. What would you do if you saw a sky that looked like this?\"\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper using a two-column chart:\n   - Column 1: \"What the sky tells us\" (student observations)\n   - Column 2: \"What might happen\" (student predictions)\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become weather observers and learn how to read what the sky is telling us about dangerous storms. Then we'll figure out how we can help people stay safe when severe weather strikes.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate observable characteristics of severe weather and develop their own observations using multiple sources.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Observation worksheet (see template below)\n- Chart of cloud types (cumulus, stratus, cumulonimbus)\n- Access to 3-4 different weather photographs showing varying storm conditions (can be printed or projected)\n- Markers, colored pencils, or crayons\n- Optional: real-time weather radar image or weather station data printout\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Organize students into pairs.** Distribute the observation worksheet (provided below) and explain that they are becoming \"storm spotters.\"\n\n2. **Present 3-4 weather images** in sequence (including the original lesson photograph). For each image, student pairs complete their worksheet by:\n   - Drawing what they see (sky, clouds, visibility)\n   - Recording observations about cloud color, cloud shape, and wind indicators (power lines, trees, debris)\n   - Identifying whether this looks like a calm day, windy day, or severe weather day\n   - Rating the \"danger level\" on a 1-5 scale (1 = safe, 5 = very dangerous)\n\n3. **Circulation prompts:** As students work, circulate and ask guiding questions WITHOUT providing answers:\n   - \"What do you notice about how dark the clouds are in this picture?\"\n   - \"What clues tell you the wind might be strong?\"\n   - \"Compare this sky to the first one we saw. What's different?\"\n\n4. **Teacher facilitates student thinking** by asking students to compare their observations across the different images. Encourage them to look for patterns (darker clouds = more danger; greenish sky = specific threat; horizontal formations = wind).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Completed observation worksheets showing detailed descriptions of weather characteristics\n- Drawings and notes showing increasing ability to identify severe weather signs\n- Student pairs able to rank storm images by severity level\n\n**Sample Observation Worksheet Template:**\n\n```\nSTORM SPOTTER OBSERVATION SHEET\n\nImage #: ___\n\nWhat I see in the sky:\n_________________________________\n\nCloud colors: □ White  □ Dark Gray  □ Black/Green\n             □ Other: ______________\n\nCloud shapes: □ Puffy & tall  □ Flat layers  □ Twisted/spinning\n             □ Other: ______________\n\nWind clues (check all you see):\n□ Power lines swaying     □ Trees bending\n□ Dust or debris blowing  □ Flags flying\n□ Calm (no wind)         □ Other: ______________\n\nDanger Level: 1 ☐  2 ☐  3 ☐  4 ☐  5 ☐\n(1 = Safe, 5 = Very Dangerous)\n\nWhy did you pick that danger level?\n_________________________________\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Build formal understanding of severe weather characteristics and connect observations to scientific vocabulary.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Cloud type poster or anchor chart\n- Weather terminology reference sheet\n- Completed student worksheets from Explore phase\n- Chart paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Facilitate a group share-out:** Gather students and review their observation worksheets. Ask 2-3 pairs to share one observation from their work. As they share, record their observations on chart paper and group them into categories:\n   - **What the clouds looked like**\n   - **What the sky looked like**\n   - **What the wind was doing**\n   - **How dark/bright it was**\n\n2. **Introduce vocabulary with student-friendly definitions** (write each term and definition on chart paper and leave it displayed):\n\n   - **Severe Weather:** Dangerous weather that can hurt people and damage buildings or property. Examples: strong thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail storms.\n   \n   - **Cumulonimbus Clouds:** Very tall, dark clouds that produce thunderstorms and severe weather. They can grow up to 50,000 feet tall! These clouds look like mountains or towers in the sky.\n   \n   - **Wind Shear:** When wind at different heights in the sky blows in different directions or at different speeds. This can make storms very dangerous and spin.\n   \n   - **Atmospheric Pressure:** How much the air is pushing down on Earth. When pressure drops quickly, severe weather is often coming.\n   \n   - **Weather Observation:** Carefully watching and describing what you see happening in the sky and weather.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph:** Point to the original lesson image and ask: \"Now that we know about these weather terms, what do we see in THIS photograph? What tells us this is severe weather? Can you spot a cumulonimbus cloud?\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding strategy:** Use a \"thumbs up/sideways/down\" gesture poll:\n   - \"Do you feel confident you could describe what makes a storm look dangerous?\" (students show thumbs)\n   - \"Could you explain to someone why those dark clouds are a warning sign?\" (students show thumbs)\n\n**Vocabulary Summary:**\n- **Severe Weather:** Dangerous weather with strong winds, heavy rain, hail, or lightning\n- **Cumulonimbus Cloud:** A tall, dark storm cloud that brings thunderstorms\n- **Wind Shear:** Changes in wind speed or direction at different heights in the air\n- **Atmospheric Pressure:** The weight of air pushing down on Earth\n- **Weather Observation:** Watching and describing weather patterns and conditions\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students accurately use 3-5 weather vocabulary terms in sentences\n- Students can identify cumulonimbus clouds and explain why they are dangerous\n- Students understand that observable sky changes signal severe weather\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by generating real-world solutions for severe weather safety.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large chart paper (3 sheets)\n- Markers\n- Pictures or diagrams of severe weather safety strategies (tornado safe room, storm cellar, safe building zones, early warning systems)\n- Optional: video clip of emergency alert system (30-60 seconds)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Present a scenario:** \"Imagine you are a city planner in a town that gets severe storms. You need to help people stay safe. What can we build, plan, or do to help people when a dangerous storm arrives?\"\n\n2. **Organize students into three groups.** Assign each group one mitigation strategy to research and present:\n   - **Group 1: Community Preparation** — What should people do BEFORE a storm arrives to get ready?\n   - **Group 2: Warning Systems** — How do we tell people a severe storm is coming?\n   - **Group 3: Safe Shelters** — Where and how should buildings be designed so people can stay safe during storms?\n\n3. **Each group receives:**\n   - A large sheet of chart paper\n   - Reference materials (pictures, simple diagrams, or descriptions)\n   - Marker set\n\n4. **Group task (12 minutes):**\n   - Draw or write at least 2-3 solutions for their assigned category\n   - Include a simple explanation of how each solution helps\n   - Show how their solution connects to what they learned about severe weather (e.g., \"Basements are safe because tornadoes don't reach as far below ground\")\n\n5. **Group presentations (8 minutes):** Each group presents their solutions (1-2 minutes per group). Other students listen and think about which solutions are most important.\n\n6. **Teacher facilitation:** As groups work, ask questions that deepen thinking:\n   - \"Why would that solution work, based on what we know about storms?\"\n   - \"How does knowing about cumulonimbus clouds help us protect people?\"\n   - \"What would happen if we didn't have this solution?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Each group produces a visual plan with 2-3 severe weather safety solutions\n- Students explain the connection between observable weather signs and their chosen solutions\n- Students recognize that multiple strategies work together to protect communities\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of severe weather observation and mitigation strategies.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (during lesson):**\n- Observe student observation worksheets for accuracy and detail\n- Listen to group discussions for use of vocabulary and logical reasoning\n- Note which students confidently identify severe weather characteristics vs. those needing additional support\n\n**Summative Assessment — Exit Ticket (5 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet or digital form with these three questions:\n\n```\nSEVERE WEATHER EXIT TICKET\n\nName: _________________________\n\n1. Look at this cloud picture. Is this severe weather or fair weather?\n   (Show a cumulonimbus cloud image)\n   \n   Circle one:    SEVERE WEATHER     FAIR WEATHER\n   \n   Explain why you chose that answer:\n   _________________________________\n\n2. Name two observable signs that tell you a severe storm is coming:\n   Sign 1: _______________________\n   Sign 2: _______________________\n\n3. Describe one way people can reduce the danger from severe storms:\n   _________________________________\n   _________________________________\n```\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n✓ **Proficient:** Student correctly identifies severe weather, names 2+ observable signs, describes a realistic mitigation strategy, uses vocabulary (clouds, storm, wind, danger, etc.)\n\n✓ **Developing:** Student identifies severe weather with partial explanation, names 1-2 signs with some detail, describes a general safety idea\n\n✓ **Emerging:** Student struggles to distinguish severe weather from fair weather, names vague weather signs, describes safety idea unclearly\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Exit tickets reveal whether students can observe and describe severe weather\n- Student responses demonstrate understanding that weather can be predicted and prepared for\n- Group presentations show students can generate practical community solutions\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Simplified observation worksheet:** Provide a pre-drawn sky template where students only need to check boxes for cloud color, wind, and danger level rather than creating original drawings. Include a word bank of weather words (dark, windy, dangerous, clouds, rain).\n\n2. **Peer partnership during Explore:** Pair students who struggle with observation skills with confident peers. Assign the struggling student the role of \"recorder\" (checking boxes, circling answers) while the partner \"describes\" what they see, building vocabulary through listening.\n\n3. **Visual cue cards during Explain:** Create large picture cards showing cumulonimbus clouds, light cumulus clouds, and fair weather conditions. Keep these visible during Elaborate activities so students can reference them while generating solutions.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Weather data analysis extension:** Provide real weather radar data or atmospheric pressure readings from a severe weather event. Challenge students to plot the data on a simple graph and predict where the storm will move next, explaining their reasoning.\n\n2. **Research and present:** Ask advanced students to research a real severe weather event (using approved sources), create a timeline of warning signs that were observed, and present how different communities responded. Include discussion of what additional safety measures could have been taken.\n\n3. **Design a community warning system:** Challenge students to design their own severe weather alert system (using technology, sirens, apps, door-to-door notifications, etc.). Have them explain why their system would be effective and how it connects to early observation of severe weather signs.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Weather Journal — Two-Week Observation:** Send home a simple weather observation sheet. Over two weeks, students record daily cloud observations, sky conditions, and wind. They bring observations back to class and create a class weather chart, looking for patterns. Discussion: \"Did any severe weather come? Did we see cumulonimbus clouds beforehand?\"\n\n2. **Invite a Community Expert:** Contact a local meteorologist, emergency management official, or storm chaser to visit your class (virtually or in-person). Students prepare questions about how severe weather is predicted and how communities prepare. This deepens understanding of real-world applications.\n\n3. **Build a Storm-Proof Structure Challenge:** Provide students with building materials (straws, clay, cardboard, tape, popsicle sticks). Challenge them to design and build a structure that can withstand simulated severe weather (fan on high speed = wind test). Students document their design choices and explain how their choices relate to severe weather forces.\n\n4. **Family Safety Plan Project:** Students create a illustrated family emergency plan for severe weather (where to go, what to bring, how to communicate). They share with their family and return it signed. This extends learning to home and community.\n\n5. **Severe Weather in Different Climates:** Provide information about severe weather in different regions (hurricanes in coastal areas, tornadoes in the Great Plains, winter storms in northern states). Students research and compare, answering: \"What types of severe weather happen where? How do communities prepare differently?\"\n\n---",
