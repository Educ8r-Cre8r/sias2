Identify water in different forms (solid and liquid) in their environment and explain what temperature does to change water's form.\n2. Observe and record evidence that water appears in many places in nature, including on plants, in the air, and on the ground.\n3. Describe how temperature changes cause water to freeze and melt, and recognize this as a change that can happen quickly or slowly.\n4. Explain how plants and animals experience water in different forms during different seasons.\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about water and temperature using the photograph of frost-covered plants and the early spring flower.\n\n- **Materials:** \n  - Printed photograph of the frost-covered daffodil and plant leaves (one per pair of students, or display on screen)\n  - Chart paper and markers\n  - Optional: Ice cubes and a small cup of water in the classroom\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. Display the photograph on a screen or pass out printed copies to student pairs. Ask students to look carefully for 1-2 minutes without talking.\n  2. Pose these discussion questions one at a time, allowing think-pair-share time before whole-group responses:\n     - **\"What do you see covering the leaves and flowers in this picture? What is it?\"** (Students will likely say \"snow,\" \"frost,\" or \"ice.\" Affirm all observations.)\n     - **\"Where do you think this white stuff came from? Was it always hard and solid like this?\"** (Guide thinking toward water changing form.)\n     - **\"Look at the yellow flower in the middle. Why do you think it's blooming when there's snow all around it?\"** (Introduce the idea that seasons change and weather changes.)\n     - **\"Have you ever seen water change from a liquid to something hard and solid? When did that happen?\"** (Connect to student experiences with freezing.)\n  3. Record student predictions on chart paper: \"We think the white stuff is _____ and it got there because _____.\"\n  4. Show students an ice cube and ask: \"Is this water? How do you know?\" Discuss how water can be solid (ice) and liquid (the cup of water).\n\n- **Transition:** \"Today, we're going to investigate where water goes and how it changes when it gets very cold, just like in this picture. You'll become water detectives!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students investigate and discover where water is found and how temperature changes its form through hands-on observation and experimentation.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Small cups or containers (one per pair)\n  - Ice cubes (several per pair)\n  - Water (liquid, in cups or spray bottles)\n  - Thermometers (classroom set, optional but helpful)\n  - Observation sheets (printed or on whiteboards)\n  - Warm water in a basin (about 100°F, supervised by teacher)\n  - Paper towels\n  - Images or samples of plants with frost/snow (if possible, bring in outdoor samples in a bag)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Station Setup:** Set up two stations in the classroom (or rotate through them):\n     - **Station A—Observing Ice (Cold Temperature):** Pairs receive an ice cube in a cup. Students use the observation sheet to draw the ice and describe its properties: Is it hard or soft? What color is it? Can you break a piece off? Where did the ice come from? Students make predictions: \"What will happen to this ice if we leave it in a warm room?\"\n     - **Station B—Finding Water Everywhere:** Pairs receive the photograph (printed or digital) and a checklist:\n       - [ ] I found water as a solid (ice/frost/snow) in the picture. Where? _____\n       - [ ] I found water that might be liquid (water droplets) in the picture. Where? _____\n       - [ ] I found living things (plants) that have water on them. Which ones? _____\n\n  2. **Transition Activity (if time allows):** Teacher shows what happens when ice is placed in warm water. Students predict first, then observe. \"The ice is melting! The solid is becoming liquid again!\" Record the time it takes and have students observe at 2-minute intervals.\n\n  3. **Documentation:** Students should draw or write simple sentences about what they observe: \"The ice is hard and cold.\" \"The ice is melting into water.\" \"The leaves are covered in frozen water.\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Circulate between stations and ask guiding questions without giving answers: \"What do you notice about the ice? How does it feel? What do you predict will happen?\"\n  - Help students notice that water takes different forms (solid ice vs. liquid water).\n  - Remind students that the white stuff on the plants in the photograph is frozen water, just like the ice they're observing.\n  - Manage the warm water station safely; do not allow students to touch hot water.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students discover that ice is frozen water and will melt into liquid water when warm.\n  - Students identify multiple locations where water appears in the photograph and classroom.\n  - Students make observations that temperature affects whether water is solid or liquid.\n  - Students complete observation drawings or written records.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect student observations to the water cycle concept and states of matter.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n  - The original photograph (displayed again)\n  - Simple diagram showing water changing from liquid to solid and back (teacher-made or printed)\n  - Temperature pictures (hot sun, cold winter)\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Group Share-Out:** Invite pairs to share one observation from Explore. Record key findings on a chart: \"Water can be solid (ice).\" \"Water can be liquid (water).\" \"Water is on plants.\" \"Cold makes water freeze.\"\n\n  2. **Introduce Vocabulary:** Using the photograph as reference, teach these terms with student-friendly definitions and visuals:\n     - **Solid:** Something hard that keeps its shape (like ice). *Show the ice cube or point to the frost in the picture.*\n     - **Liquid:** Something wet that flows and takes the shape of its container (like water). *Show the cup of water.*\n     - **Freeze:** When liquid water becomes solid ice because it's very cold. *Point to the frost on the leaves.*\n     - **Melt:** When solid ice becomes liquid water because it's warm. *Reference the ice melting in warm water.*\n     - **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is. *Show a thermometer and discuss cold vs. warm.*\n\n  3. **Connect to the Photograph:**\n     - \"Look at the yellow daffodil. It's blooming even though there's frozen water (snow and frost) all around it. Do you know why? The daffodil still needs water to grow, even in spring when it's still cold some days. The water on and around it is frozen right now, but it will melt when the sun warms things up.\"\n     - Point to different parts of the image: \"This water is solid (frost). This plant is liquid (you can see the green leaves under the frost). This flower is getting water from the ground and the melting ice.\"\n\n  4. **Check for Understanding:**\n     - Show an image of a melting icicle and ask: \"Is this water solid or liquid? How do you know? What made it change?\"\n     - Hold up an ice cube: \"What state is this? What will happen if I put it in warm water? Why?\"\n     - Ask students to point to the solid water in the original photograph.\n\n- **Vocabulary:**\n  - **Solid:** Hard matter that keeps its shape, like ice, rock, or a toy.\n  - **Liquid:** Matter that flows and takes the shape of its container, like water or juice.\n  - **Freeze:** When a liquid becomes solid because of cold temperature.\n  - **Melt:** When a solid becomes liquid because of warm temperature.\n  - **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is (measured with a thermometer).\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students use correct vocabulary to describe water in different forms.\n  - Students can explain that cold causes water to freeze and warm causes ice to melt.\n  - Students understand that the same substance (water) can be solid or liquid depending on temperature.\n  - Students recognize this as an example of Earth events (freezing and melting) that can happen.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n- **Objective:** Students apply and deepen their understanding by predicting and testing how water changes in different temperature conditions and connecting this to real-world seasonal changes.\n\n- **Materials:**\n  - Ice cubes\n  - Paper cups (labeled with locations: Sunny Windowsill, Shaded Spot, Refrigerator)\n  - Thermometers or temperature indicators (if available)\n  - Observation chart (printed or whiteboard)\n  - Images of spring, fall, and winter scenes\n  - Optional: Real plant samples with frost, if available in winter/early spring\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Prediction Investigation:** \n     - Show students three ice cubes in identical cups. Place one in a sunny windowsill, one in a shaded indoor spot, and one in the refrigerator. \n     - Ask: \"All three cups have ice. Which one will melt first? Which one will stay frozen longest? Why do you think that?\" \n     - Have students record or draw their predictions on the observation chart.\n     - Over the next 10-15 minutes (or check periodically during the session), observe and record which ice melts fastest. Discuss: \"The sunny ice melted first because the sun made it warm. The refrigerator ice stayed frozen because it's very cold.\"\n     - Connect to the real world: \"In springtime, the sun gets stronger and warmer. The frost and snow on plants melt, just like our ice cubes. The plants can then use the water to grow.\"\n\n  2. **Seasonal Connections:**\n     - Show images of spring, summer, fall, and winter scenes.\n     - Ask: \"In which season would you see frost and snow like in our photograph? What season comes after winter?\" \n     - Discuss: \"In spring, it can still be cold some mornings, but the days are getting warmer. That's why we see frost on plants one day and melted water the next day.\"\n     - Invite students to think about their own neighborhood: \"Have you seen ice and frost in early spring? What happened to it?\"\n\n  3. **Plant and Water Connection:**\n     - Return to the photograph of the blooming daffodil with frost.\n     - Ask: \"How does this flower get water if there's ice and frost all around? What happens when the ice melts?\" \n     - Explain: \"The roots of the plant are in the soil. When the frost and snow melt, the water soaks into the ground, and the roots drink it up. This water helps the flower grow and bloom.\"\n\n- **Teacher Role:**\n  - Ask open-ended questions: \"What do you notice? Is the ice changing? Why do you think that's happening?\"\n  - Validate student thinking even if predictions are incorrect; use observations to guide learning.\n  - Help students make connections between the ice cubes, the frost in the photograph, and seasonal changes they've experienced.\n  - Facilitate discussion about why some places are warmer (sunny windowsill) and some are colder (refrigerator).\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students predict that ice melts faster in warm places and slower in cold places.\n  - Students observe evidence that temperature affects the speed at which ice melts (connecting to 2-ESS1-1: events can occur quickly or slowly).\n  - Students articulate that plants use water to grow, even if the water is frozen and must melt first.\n  - Students draw connections between the photograph and their own seasonal experiences.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n- **Objective:** Assess student understanding of water states, temperature effects, and seasonal changes through formative and summative strategies.\n\n- **Activity:**\n  1. **Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n     - Observe students during Explore: Can they identify solid and liquid water? Do they make reasonable predictions about what will happen to ice?\n     - Listen to group discussions during Explain: Do students use vocabulary correctly? Can they connect the photograph to the concept of freezing?\n     - Monitor Elaborate: Do predictions show understanding of temperature effects? Can students explain why ice melts in sunlight?\n\n  2. **Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment** (Administer at the end of the lesson or next session):\n     \n     **Option A—Drawing-Based (for emerging writers):**\n     - Provide the prompt: \"Draw or write about what you learned about ice and water today.\"\n     - Students draw a picture of an ice cube and an arrow showing what happens to it when it gets warm, OR draw the frost-covered flower and label the frozen water.\n     - Assess for: Can they show water in two different states? Do they indicate temperature change?\n\n     **Option B—Short Answer (for developing writers):**\n     - Ask: \n       1. \"What is ice? What is it made of?\" (Accept: frozen water, solid water)\n       2. \"What happens to ice when it gets warm?\" (Accept: it melts, it becomes liquid water, it turns into water)\n       3. \"Look at the photograph. Where do you see frozen water?\" (Accept: on the leaves, on the flower, on the plant)\n       4. \"Why does the yellow flower need water?\" (Accept: to grow, to stay alive, plants need water)\n\n     **Option C—Verbal (for students who need oral assessment):**\n     - Ask the same four questions above in a one-on-one conversation, recording their responses.\n\n  3. **Success Criteria:**\n     - **Proficient:** Student can identify water in solid form (ice/frost) and liquid form, explain that temperature changes water from one state to another, and connect this to the photograph and/or seasonal experience.\n     - **Developing:** Student can identify solid and liquid water with prompting and understand that cold and warm affect ice, but may struggle to explain the mechanism or make real-world connections.\n     - **Beginning:** Student recognizes ice and water but needs significant support to understand state changes or real-world applications.\n\n- **Expected Student Outcomes:**\n  - Students demonstrate understanding that water can be solid (ice, frost, snow) or liquid, depending on temperature.\n  - Students explain that freezing (cold) and melting (warmth) are changes that happen to water.\n  - Students make connections between the photograph and seasonal or personal experiences.\n  - Students articulate why water matters to plants and the environment.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n#### Support (for struggling learners):\n1. **Simplified Vocabulary:** Use just two terms: \"solid\" and \"liquid.\" Avoid or define \"freeze\" and \"melt\" with simple action words: \"the ice breaks apart and becomes water\" or \"the water gets hard and cold.\"\n2. **Concrete Manipulatives:** Provide ice cubes and liquid water for every student to touch and observe directly (with safety precautions). Avoid abstract discussions; keep focus on what they can see and feel.\n3. **Sentence Frames:** Provide sentence starters for observations and exit tickets: \"I see _____ that is solid.\" \"The ice is _____.\" \"In the picture, the frost is _____.\" Students fill in the blanks.\n4. **Pairing Strategy:** Pair struggling learners with patient peers or a classroom aide during Explore station work so they have ongoing support and modeling.\n\n#### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n1. **Deeper Questioning:** Ask: \"What would happen to the flower and the frost if the temperature went down even colder? What if it stayed warm for a whole week?\" Encourage students to make detailed predictions and test them over several days.\n2. **Water Cycle Extension:** Introduce the idea that melted ice and water eventually evaporate and come back as rain or snow. Show a simple diagram of the water cycle and discuss where the frost \"came from\" (condensation from water vapor in the air).\n3. **Rate of Change Investigation:** Have advanced students track ice melting over time using a ruler or graduated marking system. Create a simple graph of ice height vs. time to show that melting accelerates in warm places. Discuss why (heat energy).\n4. **Real-World Research:** Ask students to research or discuss why frost can harm plants in spring (freezing damages new growth) and how gardeners protect plants from late-season frost. This connects state changes to consequences for living things.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Frost Observation Journal (Multi-Day Activity):**\n   - If your school year includes late winter or early spring when frost can still occur, send home an observation sheet for families to complete over one week.\n   - Students draw or photograph frost or ice in their neighborhood and record when they see it (morning? after a warm day?). \n   - Students note the temperature outside each morning and predict if they'll see frost.\n   - Return observations to school and create a class chart: \"When did we see frost? What was the temperature? What happened to the frost?\"\n   - This extends 2-ESS1-1 by having students gather information over time and notice patterns.\n\n2. **The Great Ice Race:**\n   - Set up a competitive hands-on investigation: Students place ice cubes in various \"habitats\" (sunny windowsill, under a lamp, in a fan's breeze, on a cold tile floor, wrapped in cloth, in water, etc.).\n   - Students predict which will melt first and time how long each takes.\n   - Create a bar graph showing melt times and discuss why some locations melted ice faster.\n   - Connect to real-world: \"In spring, snow melts faster on dark roads than in shaded forests. Why?\"\n   - This deepens understanding of temperature variables and introduces the idea of environmental factors affecting Earth processes.\n\n3. **Seasonal Stories:**\n   - Read aloud a picture book about spring or seasonal changes (e.g., \"When Spring Comes,\" \"Bear Snores On\").\n   - As you read, have students listen for mentions of ice, snow, water, or weather changes.\n   - After reading, discuss: \"What happened to the snow/ice/frost in the story? Why did it change? How did the animals or plants respond?\"\n   - Have students draw or write their own short story: \"The Adventures of a Frost Flake\" (following a frost particle from solid to liquid to plant root).\n   - This integrates literacy and extends understanding of seasonal cycles and how living things interact with water in different forms.\n\n---\n\n**End of Lesson Plan**",
