ENGAGE (12 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about wind and wind turbines using the photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large printed photograph of wind turbines (or projected on screen)\n- Lightweight objects to demonstrate wind (tissue paper, feathers, cotton balls)\n- A handheld fan\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently. Ask students to gather in a circle where they can all see it clearly.\n\n2. **Ask these specific questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? What is that big tall thing with the arms?\"\n   - \"Look at those long arms sticking out. Why do you think they look like that? What could make them move?\"\n   - \"Can you see anything in the air that might be pushing those arms around?\"\n   - \"What happens on a windy day when you go outside? What does the wind do?\"\n\n3. **Prediction prompt:** \"I wonder what makes those big arms spin around. Let's think together—what do you think makes them move so fast?\"\n\n4. **Demonstration:** Turn on a handheld fan and place a tissue, feather, or cotton ball in front of it. Ask: \"The wind from this fan is pushing that [object]. Do you think real wind outside could push something much bigger, like those giant arms?\"\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to explore what wind is and discover how we can use the wind to make things spin, just like in this picture!\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (22 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students discover how wind moves objects and can cause rotation through hands-on investigation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Paper pinwheels (pre-made or students will make them during exploration)\n- Straws or wooden sticks (one per student or pair)\n- Tape\n- Colored paper (pre-cut into squares and circles)\n- Scissors (safety scissors)\n- Access to outdoor space or a location with controlled air (fan or open window)\n- Observation journals or paper for recording\n- Pencils and crayons\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Making a Simple Pinwheel (10 minutes)**\n\n1. **Provide each student (or pair) with:** a pre-cut square of colored paper, a straw, and tape.\n\n2. **Demonstrate step-by-step:**\n   - Fold the paper in half one way, then unfold it.\n   - Fold it in half the other way, then unfold it (you now have a cross crease).\n   - Cut from each corner toward the center, but stop before reaching the center.\n   - Fold each corner point toward the center and secure with a small piece of tape.\n   - Poke a hole through all layers gently with a pencil.\n   - Slide the straw through the hole and tape it so the pinwheel can spin freely.\n\n3. **Students follow along,** with the teacher circulating to assist. Use patient, clear language and model each step.\n\n**Part B: Testing Wind with Pinwheels (12 minutes)**\n\n4. **Take students outside** (or position them near an open window with a fan).\n\n5. **Give students these exploration instructions:**\n   - Hold your pinwheel out in front of you. What happens?\n   - Gently blow on it. What do you see?\n   - Can you make it spin fast? Spin slowly?\n   - Turn around. Does it spin the same way from different directions?\n   - When does it spin the most? When does it spin the least?\n\n6. **Have students observe and try:**\n   - Blowing gently vs. blowing hard (comparing wind strength)\n   - Facing different directions (comparing wind direction)\n   - Recording observations with drawings or simple words in journals\n\n**Teacher Role:** Circulate among students, asking follow-up questions: \"What made it spin fast just then?\" \"Is the wind strong or weak right now?\" \"Can you feel the wind? Where?\" Encourage observation without leading to answers.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students will observe that moving air (wind) makes the pinwheel spin.\n- Students will notice that stronger wind makes it spin faster.\n- Students will make connections between the wind they feel and the movement they see in the pinwheel.\n- Students will record observations through drawings or verbal descriptions.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (16 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to the wind turbine photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- The wind turbine photograph\n- Chart paper or whiteboard\n- Markers\n- Picture cards showing wind (leaves blowing, flags, clouds moving, hair blowing)\n- Simple diagram showing a wind turbine with labeled parts (blades, pole, ground)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students on carpet** and bring out the wind turbine photograph again.\n\n2. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Tell me what you noticed about the pinwheel when wind moved it.\"\n   - \"What did it feel like when you blew on it? When the real wind pushed it?\"\n   - Create a shared list on chart paper: \"What we know about wind\" (e.g., you can feel it, it moves things, it's stronger some times and weaker other times).\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary (6 minutes):**\n   - **Wind:** Moving air that we can feel and see by watching what it moves\n   - **Energy:** The power to make things move or work\n   - **Turbine blades:** The long arms on the wind machine that spin around\n   - **Natural resource:** Something in nature that people can use\n   - **Rotate/Spin:** Turn around and around\n\n   *Use simple, relatable definitions:*\n   - \"Wind is air that moves, kind of like when you blow out birthday candles.\"\n   - \"Energy is like a superpower that makes things move. Wind has energy.\"\n   - \"Those big arms are called blades—they're like the blades on a fan.\"\n   - \"Natural resources are wonderful things nature gives us, like wind, sun, and water.\"\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the wind turbine blades. \"These blades are just like your pinwheel! The wind pushes them and makes them spin.\"\n   - \"When these giant blades spin, they have energy. People use that energy to make electricity, which powers lights and machines in homes.\"\n   - Show picture cards of wind in nature and ask: \"What does wind do in each picture?\" (Move leaves, blow flags, push clouds, blow hair)\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask: \"How is the wind turbine like your pinwheel?\"\n   - Ask: \"Why do you think the turbine blades are so big?\"\n   - Have students mime wind blowing and a turbine spinning.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Wind:** Moving air that you can feel and see\n- **Energy:** Power that makes things move or work\n- **Turbine blade:** A long arm on a wind machine that spins\n- **Natural resource:** Something from nature that people use\n- **Rotate:** To spin or turn around and around\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Students will understand that wind is moving air.\n- Students will know that wind has energy and can make things move.\n- Students will connect the spinning pinwheel to the spinning turbine blades.\n- Students will begin to understand that wind is a natural resource people can use.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (18 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by creating a design challenge and exploring how turbines help people.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Images of wind turbines in different locations (windy hilltops, prairies, coastal areas)\n- Picture books or short video (2-3 minutes) showing wind turbines and wind farms\n- Straws, cups, small toys/figures\n- Tape and paper\n- Optional: simple wind turbine model kit for demonstration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Where Does Wind Blow? (7 minutes)**\n\n1. **Show images** of wind turbines in different locations (hilltops, open fields, near coasts).\n\n2. **Ask:** \"Why do you think people put these wind turbines in these places? What's the same about all these places?\"\n\n3. **Guide students to notice:** These places are open and windy. Wind blows more in some places than others.\n\n4. **Real-world connection:** \"Wind turbines help people because they use wind to make electricity. Electricity powers your lights, your refrigerator, and your TV at home.\"\n\n**Part B: Design a Wind Helper (11 minutes)**\n\n1. **Present a design challenge:**\n   - \"Imagine you need to help blow sand off a beach (or leaves off a path). You have straws and cups. Can you design something that would use wind to help you?\"\n\n2. **Students work in pairs** to:\n   - Use a straw or cup to imagine catching wind\n   - Create a simple \"wind catcher\" using materials provided\n   - Test it in a breeze or with a fan\n   - Draw or describe how it works\n\n3. **Share designs:** Have 3-4 pairs show their creations and explain their thinking.\n\n**Teacher Role:** \n- Facilitate by asking questions: \"How is your design using wind like the turbine uses wind?\" \n- Encourage experimentation without judgment.\n- Connect designs back to the turbine: \"Just like your wind catcher, the turbine catches wind energy!\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will recognize that wind is stronger in some places than others.\n- Students will understand that people use wind turbines to get energy from wind.\n- Students will apply their understanding by designing their own wind-powered device.\n- Students will make connections between their designs and real wind turbines.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of wind, energy, and wind turbines.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing throughout lesson):**\n- **Observation:** Watch students during Explore phase—can they describe what wind does to the pinwheel?\n- **Questioning:** During Explain, ask: \"What is wind?\" and \"How does the turbine work?\" Listen for understanding.\n- **Student drawings:** Review observation journals to see if students recorded movement and spinning.\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment (5 minutes at end of lesson):**\n\nChoose one or combine:\n\n1. **Drawing and labeling:**\n   - Students draw a wind turbine and label the blades.\n   - They draw an arrow showing which way the wind blows the blades.\n\n2. **Three-question check:**\n   - \"What is wind?\" (Accept: moving air, something you can feel, something that moves things)\n   - \"How did the wind make your pinwheel move?\" (Accept: blew it, pushed it, made it spin)\n   - \"Why do people build wind turbines?\" (Accept: to catch wind, to make electricity, because wind is strong)\n\n3. **Show and tell:**\n   - Have students stand, hold their pinwheels, and say one sentence: \"Wind made my pinwheel spin because...\"\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n- ✓ Student can describe wind as moving air\n- ✓ Student can observe and explain that wind makes things move/spin\n- ✓ Student can connect their pinwheel to the wind turbine photograph\n- ✓ Student can say one way people use wind\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:** \n- Most first graders will understand that wind is moving air that can make things spin.\n- Students will make visible connections between their exploration and the photograph.\n- Students will begin to understand that natural resources like wind can be useful to people.\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Provide a pre-made pinwheel** so students who struggle with fine motor skills can still participate in testing wind without frustration. Focus them on the observation and prediction phases.\n\n2. **Use gesture and mime** instead of complex words. Model blowing, spinning, and wind movements so students understand through visual demonstration rather than language alone.\n\n3. **Pair students strategically** during Explore and Elaborate phases with a peer who can support language development. Assign roles: one student holds, one student observes and describes.\n\n4. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Use and repeat only 2-3 key words (wind, spin, energy) consistently. Skip less essential terms like \"natural resource\" and focus on \"wind helps people.\"\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Ask predictive questions:** \"If we made the pinwheel blades bigger, would wind spin it faster or slower? Why?\" Have students hypothesize and test.\n\n2. **Introduce wind directions:** Ask students to observe and predict: \"If wind comes from the north, which way will the turbine blades turn?\" Have them use a compass direction or landmarks (toward the door, toward the window).\n\n3. **Design extension:** \"Can you design a wind turbine that catches wind from any direction?\" Provide materials and have them modify their design to test directional challenges.\n\n4. **Real-world research:** Have advanced students look at images or a video of a real wind farm and count how many turbines they see, or describe what a community might be like near wind turbines.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **Weather observation journal:** Over two weeks, have students observe and draw wind patterns each day (windy, calm, breezy). Create a class chart showing \"Windy Days\" vs. \"Calm Days.\" Connect to seasonal patterns (1-ESS1-2).\n\n2. **Build a classroom wind vane:** Create a simple wind direction indicator using a straw, paper, and a pencil. Place it near a window. Have students predict and record which direction wind blows each day, discovering wind patterns over time.\n\n3. **Explore other natural resources:** Extend to water wheels or solar panels by showing pictures and discussing: \"What other things from nature can people use to make energy? How is a water wheel like a wind turbine?\" This sets groundwork for future lessons on natural resources and energy.\n\n4. **Community walk:** If possible, take students on a neighborhood walk to observe where wind is strongest (open fields vs. between buildings). Discuss why and connect to why wind turbines are placed in certain locations.\n\n5. **Story and art integration:** Read a simple picture book about wind (e.g., *The Wind Blew* by Pat Hutchins) and have students illustrate \"wind at work\" in their community or at home.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Notes:**\nThis lesson is designed to meet first-grade developmental levels by using concrete, observable phenomena (wind moving a pinwheel) before introducing abstract concepts (energy, natural resources). The photograph serves as a visual anchor throughout, helping students connect their small-scale experience to real-world applications. Consider timing the Explore phase for a naturally windy day outdoors, or use fans as a backup. The lesson flows naturally into future observations of seasonal wind patterns, aligning with 1-ESS1-2 expectations.",
