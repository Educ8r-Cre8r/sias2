ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Spark curiosity about tree rings and activate prior knowledge about natural resources and time.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large, high-quality printed photograph of the log cross-sections (at least 8.5\" × 11\", preferably displayed on a screen or projected)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: A real cross-section of a log or branch (if available) passed around for tactile exploration\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** without any labels or explanation. Ask students to observe silently for 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Pose these discussion questions** to spark curiosity:\n   - *\"What do you notice about the lines or rings in the middle of these logs?\"*\n   - *\"Why do you think some logs are different colors—some lighter, some darker?\"*\n   - *\"If these logs came from a tree, how old do you think the tree was? How could you figure that out?\"*\n   - *\"What might have happened to these trees to make them into logs like this?\"*\n\n3. **Prediction Prompt:** Show the photograph again and say: *\"I'm going to tell you that these lines inside the logs tell a story about the tree's life. Look carefully at one log—do the lines look the same distance apart all the way from the center to the edge, or are some lines closer together and some farther apart? What do you think that might mean?\"*\n\n4. **Record student predictions** on chart paper under \"What We Think We Know About Tree Rings.\"\n\n**Transition:** *\"Today, we're going to become wood detectives and figure out what tree rings can tell us about a tree's past!\"*\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate tree ring patterns through a hands-on investigation using a model or real cross-section.\n\n**Materials (per group of 3-4 students):**\n- One paper or foam plate with concentric circles drawn and labeled (rings 1-20, from center outward) to simulate a tree cross-section\n- Ruler (12-inch)\n- Colored pencils or markers (at least 2 colors: one for thick rings, one for thin rings)\n- Magnifying glass (optional but recommended)\n- \"Ring Recording Sheet\" (provided below)\n- One real tree cross-section, slice of branch, or high-quality printout of a cross-section if available\n\n**Ring Recording Sheet (reproducible):**\n\n| Ring Number | Measurement (mm) | Thick or Thin? | Color | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1-2 | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n| 3-5 | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n| 6-10 | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n| 11-15 | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n| 16-20 | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |\n\n**Activity - Step-by-Step Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Observe your tree ring model** (or real sample). Look at the rings from the very center (the pith) moving outward.\n\n2. **Measure the width of rings** in different sections:\n   - Measure from the center to ring 2 (first two years)\n   - Measure from ring 3 to ring 5 (years 3-5)\n   - Measure from ring 6 to ring 10 (years 6-10)\n   - Continue to ring 20\n   - Record measurements on your sheet in millimeters\n\n3. **Record whether each group of rings is thick or thin** and describe any color changes you notice (some may appear darker/more brown due to weathering).\n\n4. **Draw or sketch** one section of your rings on the back of your sheet, showing thick and thin rings.\n\n5. **Discuss with your group:** Where are the thickest rings? Where are the thinnest? What could cause a tree to grow more in one year than another?\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions WITHOUT providing answers:\n  - *\"What pattern do you notice in your measurements?\"*\n  - *\"Are all the rings the same size? Why do you think that is?\"*\n  - *\"If thin rings mean a hard year for the tree, what could make a year difficult?\"* (Hint: weather, drought, competition)\n- Use a magnifying glass with students to examine real samples closely if available.\n- Listen for reasoning about environmental conditions; record interesting student hypotheses.\n- Ensure students are recording data carefully on their sheets.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students identify and measure tree rings.\n- Students notice that rings vary in width across the cross-section.\n- Students begin to hypothesize that thicker rings = better growing years; thinner rings = harder years.\n- Students produce a measurement sheet and sketch showing evidence of varying ring widths.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to Earth science concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase (predictions)\n- Large labeled diagram of a tree cross-section (prepared in advance or drawn live)\n- Original photograph of logs\n- Vocabulary cards (optional but helpful for visual learners)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Gather students for a group share-out.** Ask 2-3 groups to present their measurements and observations. Display their Ring Recording Sheets where all can see.\n\n2. **Reveal the pattern:** Point to the data and say: *\"What do you notice? Are the rings more consistent, or do they change? Yes! Tree rings change in width. That's because trees don't always grow at the same rate.\"*\n\n3. **Introduce key vocabulary** with Fourth Grade-friendly definitions and visuals:\n\n   - **Tree Ring (or Annual Ring):** One layer of wood that a tree grows in one year. The ring includes both light-colored wood grown in spring (wider) and darker wood grown in fall (narrower). Together, they make one ring = one year.\n   \n   - **Weathering:** The slow breaking down of rock and other materials (like wood) by air, water, wind, and living things. When you see the logs are cracked and discolored, that's weathering happening.\n   \n   - **Natural Resource:** Materials from nature that people use, such as trees, water, soil, and rocks. Wood from trees is a natural resource we use for building and paper.\n   \n   - **Growth Rate:** How fast something grows. A tree with thick rings was growing fast (good conditions). A tree with thin rings was growing slowly (hard conditions).\n   \n   - **Environmental Conditions:** The weather and surroundings a living thing experiences (sun, rain, temperature, soil quality).\n\n4. **Connect back to the photograph:**\n   - Point to specific logs in the original image. *\"Look at this log. Do you see the rings? Some rings look far apart, and some are close together. What do you think that tells us about the years when those rings formed?\"*\n   - Point to the color changes (oxidation/weathering). *\"These logs are showing weathering. The air is breaking down the wood and changing its color. This is what happens to natural resources when they're left outside.\"*\n\n5. **Address the concept of natural resources and impact:**\n   - *\"These logs were once part of living trees. Humans cut down trees to use the wood for houses, furniture, and paper. Trees are a natural resource that we depend on, but when we cut down too many trees, it affects animals and the environment. That's why some people plant new trees to replace the ones we use.\"*\n\n6. **Check for understanding** with these questions:\n   - *\"If I showed you a log with very thick rings in the early years and thin rings at the end, what could that tell us about the tree's life?\"*\n   - *\"Why do you think this log is now cracked and darker than when it was a fresh, living tree?\"*\n   - *\"Is wood a natural resource? How do we use it?\"*\n\n**Vocabulary Summary (Display on a poster for reference):**\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|---|---|\n| **Tree Ring** | One layer of wood that grows in one year; shows how fast a tree grew that year |\n| **Weathering** | The slow breakdown of materials by air, water, wind, and living things |\n| **Natural Resource** | Materials from nature that people use, like trees, water, and rocks |\n| **Growth Rate** | How fast something grows; thick rings = fast growth; thin rings = slow growth |\n| **Environmental Conditions** | The weather and surroundings a living thing experiences |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students can define tree ring, weathering, natural resource, and growth rate in their own words.\n- Students can explain that tree rings represent one year of growth each.\n- Students can interpret ring patterns as evidence of past growing conditions.\n- Students understand that harvesting trees is a human use of natural resources with environmental impacts.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply understanding to a new scenario and deepen reasoning about climate, resources, and decision-making.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Scenario cards (see below)\n- Large diagram of three sample tree cross-sections with different ring patterns (provided or drawn)\n- Optional: Video clip (2-3 min) showing tree core sampling or tree ring dating (many available free on YouTube)\n- Chart paper for group conclusions\n\n**Activity - \"Tree Detective Case Studies\":**\n\n1. **Display three different tree cross-section diagrams** (or provide printed images):\n   - **Tree A:** Consistent, evenly-spaced rings throughout\n   - **Tree B:** Very thick rings for the first 10 years, then progressively thinner rings for years 11-25\n   - **Tree C:** Extremely thin rings throughout, very crowded together\n\n2. **Divide class into three groups.** Assign each group one tree cross-section.\n\n3. **Present the scenario:** *\"You are environmental scientists studying trees from three different locations. Tree A grew in a stable forest with consistent rainfall. Tree B grew in an area where a forest fire happened 10 years into its life. Tree C grew in a desert where water is scarce. Looking at your assigned tree's rings, tell me: What might these ring patterns tell us about the conditions where each tree lived?\"*\n\n4. **Each group:**\n   - Studies their tree diagram\n   - Measures and records ring widths\n   - Creates a hypothesis about what environmental conditions caused the ring pattern they see\n   - Prepares a 1-2 minute explanation to share\n\n5. **Groups present** their tree and their hypothesis. Other students ask clarifying questions.\n\n6. **Conclude with a discussion:**\n   - *\"Tree rings are like a journal written by the tree. Each ring tells us about that year. Scientists use tree rings to learn about climate from hundreds of years ago, even before we had thermometers!\"*\n   - *\"Because trees record environmental information, scientists study old logs, dead trees, and even ancient wood from archaeological sites to understand past climates. This helps us predict future climate changes.\"*\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n\n- Listen to group reasoning and ask probing questions:\n  - *\"Why do you think that condition would make thick rings (or thin rings)?\"*\n  - *\"What do trees need to grow fast? If one of those things is missing, what happens?\"*\n- Guide groups toward scientifically accurate explanations without giving away the answer.\n- Celebrate inferences and evidence-based reasoning.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students apply ring-width patterns to hypothesize about past environmental conditions.\n- Students explain the relationship between weather/resources and tree growth rates.\n- Students begin to understand that natural materials preserve records of Earth's history.\n- Students see connections between tree rings and climate science.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of tree rings, weathering, natural resources, and evidence of past conditions.\n\n**Formative Assessment (During Lesson):**\n\n- Observation of student participation during Engage discussion\n- Review of Ring Recording Sheets for accuracy and reasoning\n- Listen to group explanations during Elaborate phase; note use of vocabulary and evidence-based thinking\n- Check-for-understanding questions asked during Explain phase\n\n**Summative Assessment - Exit Ticket (5-7 minutes):**\n\nProvide each student with a half-sheet of paper. Students may draw or write answers:\n\n1. **\"Look at this picture of a log cross-section. How old is this tree? How do you know?\"** (Show a simple diagram with 15-20 rings)\n\n2. **\"Draw and label a thick ring and a thin ring. Write one sentence about what each might tell us about that year in the tree's life.\"**\n\n3. **\"Name one way that people use wood, and one way that cutting down trees affects the environment.\"**\n\n**Exit Ticket Rubric - Success Criteria:**\n\n| Criteria | Advanced (3) | Proficient (2) | Developing (1) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Age of Tree** | Correctly counts rings and provides accurate age with clear reasoning | Counts rings and gives age with minor errors or vague reasoning | Attempts to count rings but has significant errors |\n| **Ring Interpretation** | Accurately explains that thick rings = good year and thin rings = hard year with clear evidence | Explains ring differences but reasoning is incomplete or partially clear | Identifies thick/thin rings but cannot explain what they mean |\n| **Natural Resource Impact** | Names a use of wood AND describes an environmental impact with specific details | Names a use and mentions environment but lacks detail | Names only a use OR mentions environment, but not both clearly |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n\n- Students demonstrate understanding that tree rings = years of growth.\n- Students can count rings and estimate tree age.\n- Students explain that ring width variation reflects past environmental conditions.\n- Students can name wood as a natural resource and articulate at least one environmental impact of harvesting trees.\n- Students use vocabulary accurately (tree ring, weathering, natural resource, growth rate).\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Pre-teach vocabulary** before the lesson with real objects or pictures. Use a word wall with images showing what each term means. Pair vocabulary with the actual photograph so students see the real example as they learn the word.\n\n2. **Scaffold the measurement activity** by providing pre-marked measurement guides on the Ring Recording Sheet. Instead of measuring freely, students can mark \"thick\" or \"thin\" by comparing each ring section to a simple reference (e.g., \"This section is thicker than this pencil lead? Yes/No\").\n\n3. **Provide a partially completed Ring Recording Sheet** for the first group to fill in together with teacher support, then use that as a model for independent work. Reduce the number of ring groups to measure (e.g., measure only rings 1-10 instead of 1-20).\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Introduce dendrochronology (tree-ring dating).** Explain that scientists match overlapping ring patterns from trees of different ages to extend climate records backward in time. Ask: *\"If we had wood from a very old building, a slightly younger log, and a living tree, how could we connect their ring patterns to learn about climate from 500 years ago?\"* Have advanced students sketch how this might work.\n\n2. **Compare ring patterns from trees grown in different climates.** Provide diagrams or pictures of tree cross-sections from a rainforest (consistent, narrow rings) and a temperate forest (varied ring widths). Ask students to hypothesize why a rainforest tree would look different and support their explanation with evidence.\n\n3. **Calculate tree growth rate.** Provide a tree cross-section with measured ring widths. Ask: *\"If this tree grew 0.5 inches per year on average, and the rings show it's 50 years old, how wide is the entire tree from center to edge?\"* Extend to environmental questions: *\"If a drought year shows a 0.1-inch ring, what does that tell us about moisture that year compared to a 0.8-inch ring year?\"*\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Predict the Future Using the Past\"** \n   - Give students a graph showing tree ring widths from the past 50 years (a simple downward trend representing narrowing rings due to drought conditions in recent decades).\n   - Ask: *\"Based on this pattern from tree rings, what do you predict about the climate and environment for the next 10 years? Should we be concerned? Why?\"*\n   - This connects past evidence (tree rings) to predictions about Earth's future, integrating climate literacy.\n\n2. **Interview a Forester or Logger (Virtual or In-Person)**\n   - Arrange a visit or video call with a local forester, arborist, or timber worker. Students prepare questions:\n     - *\"How do you decide which trees to cut down?\"*\n     - *\"How do you replant trees to replace the ones harvested?\"*\n     - *\"Have you ever seen tree rings? What did they tell you?\"*\n   - Students take notes and report back to the class. This emphasizes that tree ring science has real-world careers and applications.\n\n3. **Design a \"Sustainable Logging Plan\"**\n   - Provide students with a scenario: *\"Your town needs wood for a new school building. Design a plan that allows us to harvest trees AND protect the environment for future generations. What rules would you make about logging? When would you replant? How would you make sure forests stay healthy?\"*\n   - Students draw and label their plan, using reasoning based on what they learned about tree growth, resources, and environmental impact. Share plans and discuss trade-offs between human needs and environmental protection.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Real samples are powerful:** If you can obtain one cross-section of a log or tree branch from a local tree service, lumber yard, or park district, passing it around during Engage and Explore dramatically increases engagement and makes the abstract concept concrete.\n- **Timing flexibility:** If students are deeply engaged, the Elaborate phase can extend into a second day. This lesson can also be split into two full 45-minute periods: Day 1 (Engage, Explore, Explain) and Day 2 (Explain review, Elaborate, Evaluate).\n- **Connection to other disciplines:** Tree rings connect beautifully to history (cross-referencing tree rings with historical events) and math (measuring, graphing ring widths). Consider interdisciplinary planning with classroom teacher if you co-teach.\n- **Safety note:** If using real sawed logs, ensure edges are smooth and there are no splinters. If logs are fresh (wet), they may have mold or fungi growth—discourage students from touching cut surfaces and always wash hands after handling.",
