ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest and activate prior knowledge about rocks and change.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed or digital copy of the photograph (large enough for whole class to see)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student notebooks\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display and Introduce:** Project the photograph on the board or display it on a document camera. Allow students 30 seconds of silent observation.\n\n2. **Launching Questions (Ask one at a time, allow 30 seconds of think-pair-share for each):**\n   - \"What do you notice on the surface of this rock? What colors and textures do you see?\"\n   - \"Why do you think parts of the rock look white, green, and gray in different places?\"\n   - \"Do you think this rock always looked like this? Why or why not?\"\n   - \"What might have made these patterns on the rock?\"\n\n3. **Wonder Prompt:** \"I wonder if this rock could be slowly disappearing? Let's investigate what's happening to this rock's surface.\"\n\n4. **Record Observations:** Have students sketch what they see in their notebooks and label different areas (light-colored patches, green areas, bare rock).\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to become rock detectives and discover what's actually changing this rock!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate and discover how rocks are broken down through hands-on observation and experimentation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- 4-5 rock samples per group (various sizes, preferably collected locally or from a supply; smooth rocks, porous rocks, rocks with visible lichen/moss if available)\n- Hand lenses or magnifying glasses (one per student)\n- Chart paper labeled with four quadrants: \"Smooth Rocks,\" \"Rough Rocks,\" \"Rocks with Green Stuff,\" \"Rocks with Light-Colored Stuff\"\n- Colored pencils\n- Paper towels\n- Small water spray bottles (filled with water)\n- Ruler (optional, for measuring growth patterns)\n- Student recording sheets (template provided below)\n\n**Student Directions:**\n\n1. **Station 1 – Close Observation (5 minutes):**\n   - Use your hand lens to examine each rock sample carefully.\n   - Look for small cracks, rough spots, and any living things (lichen, moss, algae).\n   - Draw one rock in your notebook. Label the areas you see: cracks, smooth parts, colored growth, and bare rock.\n\n2. **Station 2 – Grouping Activity (5 minutes):**\n   - Sort your rocks into the four categories on the class chart paper.\n   - Count how many rocks belong in each group and record the number.\n   - Discuss with your partner: Which rocks have the most \"stuff\" growing on them? Which look the newest or least changed?\n\n3. **Station 3 – Testing Water's Effect (8 minutes):**\n   - **Hypothesis:** Write a prediction: \"I think water will make the rock because ________________.\"\n   - Spray one rock sample lightly with water. Observe it under the hand lens.\n   - Observe a dry rock sample at the same time.\n   - After 2 minutes, compare: Does the wet rock look different from the dry rock? Is the growth more visible? Are any tiny pieces coming off?\n   - Record: Draw both rocks (wet and dry) and describe what changed.\n\n4. **Station 4 – Examining \"Growth\" Closely (7 minutes):**\n   - Use your hand lens to study rocks with green or light-colored patches.\n   - Feel the textured areas gently. Is the rock surface rough where the growth is? Smooth where it's bare?\n   - Scratch gently with a fingernail or soft brush over a lichen patch and over bare rock. Record: Which surface gives up particles more easily?\n   - Hypothesis for next lesson: \"I think this green stuff might be _____________ and it might help break down the rock because _____________.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate between groups; ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice? How is this rock different from that one? What could have caused these changes?\"\n- Do NOT explain lichen or moss; let students observe and wonder.\n- Use think-aloud: \"I'm noticing that the wetter rocks seem to have more of this green growth. I wonder why...\"\n- Encourage students to use hand lenses and make detailed observations.\n- Prompt students to compare rocks: \"Which rock looks oldest to you? What details make you think that?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students will observe and record variations in rock surfaces.\n- Students will notice that some rocks have more visible growth/change than others.\n- Students will recognize that water and moisture seem to be present where green growth and cracks appear.\n- Students will discover that rocks are not permanent—they change over time.\n- Students will develop questions about what the colored stuff is and how it affects rocks.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to weathering and erosion concepts.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large photograph displayed on board\n- Vocabulary poster board (prepared in advance or created during lesson)\n- Chart paper for class concept map\n- Photo or real sample of lichen/moss (if available, or printed images)\n- Student vocabulary sheet (one per student)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask volunteers: \"What did you discover about the rocks? Which group looked the most changed?\"\n   - \"What do you think caused those changes?\"\n   - Record key student observations on chart paper without correcting them yet.\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary with Visuals (8 minutes):**\n\n   Display the photograph again. Point to specific features as you explain:\n\n   - **Weathering:** The breaking down and wearing away of rocks by wind, water, ice, and living things. (Point to cracks and rough areas.) \"See how this rock is slowly being broken apart? That's weathering.\"\n   \n   - **Lichen:** A living thing made of algae and fungi together that grows on rocks and surfaces. It looks like crusty patches (light-colored or green). (Point to white and light-colored patches.) \"These are lichens. They're alive!\"\n   \n   - **Moss:** Tiny green plants that grow in moist places and can break rocks apart by growing into cracks. (Point to green areas.) \"This green stuff is moss. It likes wet, shady spots.\"\n   \n   - **Erosion:** The wearing away and movement of rock and soil by water, wind, or ice. \"Weathering breaks rocks down; erosion carries those pieces away.\"\n   \n   - **Pioneer Organisms:** Living things that are first to grow on bare rocks and help break them down. \"Lichen and moss are pioneers—they're brave explorers that start the rock-breaking process!\"\n\n3. **Connect Back to Observations (4 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember when you found rocks that were rough and cracked? Those rocks were being weathered.\"\n   - \"The green and white patches you saw? Those are lichen and moss doing the weathering!\"\n   - \"The rocks in wet, shady spots had more growth. Why? Because lichen and moss need moisture to survive.\"\n   - Create a quick cause-and-effect chart on the board:\n     ```\n     CAUSE → EFFECT\n     Moisture on rocks → Lichen and moss grow\n     Lichen and moss grow → Rock cracks and breaks apart\n     Rocks break down → New soil forms over time\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (3 minutes):**\n   - Ask: \"Can someone point to the lichen in the photograph and tell me what it does?\"\n   - \"Why do you think moss is growing on top of this rock instead of on the bare ground?\"\n   - Provide a quick true/false check: \"Weathering means the rock is disappearing instantly. True or false?\" (False—it's very slow.)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Weathering** | The slow breaking down of rocks by wind, water, ice, and living things. |\n| **Lichen** | A crusty, colorful living thing that grows on rocks and helps break them down. |\n| **Moss** | Tiny green plants that grow in moist places and can crack rocks apart. |\n| **Erosion** | The carrying away of weathered rock and soil by water, wind, or ice. |\n| **Pioneer Organisms** | Living things like lichen and moss that are first to grow on bare rocks and start breaking them down. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students can define weathering and erosion and explain the difference.\n- Students understand that lichen and moss are living organisms that contribute to rock weathering.\n- Students recognize that weathering is a slow process.\n- Students can identify weathering in the photograph using new vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by designing a real-world investigation and making predictions about weathering in different environments.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Rock samples (4-6 different ones)\n- Chart paper divided into 4 columns labeled: \"Sunny Spot,\" \"Shady Spot,\" \"Wet Spot,\" \"Dry Spot\"\n- Ruler\n- Binoculars or hand lenses\n- Outdoor access (or high-quality photos of different outdoor environments)\n- \"Weathering Prediction Sheet\" (template below)\n- Colored pencils\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Real-World Investigation – Schoolyard Rock Hunt (10 minutes):**\n   - Take students outside (or view photos if outdoor access is limited).\n   - Show them 4-6 rocks in different microhabitats: under a tree (shady and moist), in direct sun, near a water fountain, in dry mulch, etc.\n   - Have students observe rocks in each location using hand lenses.\n   - Ask: \"Which rocks have the most lichen and moss? Which have the fewest? Why?\"\n   - Students complete a \"Weathering Hunt Data Sheet\":\n     ```\n     Location: ___________\n     Does it get sun? (yes/no)\n     Is it wet or dry? _____\n     Amount of lichen/moss: (little/some/lots)\n     Visible cracks? (yes/no)\n     Prediction: This rock will weather (slowly/quickly) because ___\n     ```\n\n2. **Prediction and Reasoning (5 minutes):**\n   - Back in the classroom, review findings.\n   - Pose: \"If we looked at these same rocks in 10 years, which ones would have changed the most?\"\n   - Have students complete: \"The rocks in the __________ location will weather fastest because __________.\"\n   - Encourage reasoning: moisture, living organisms, temperature changes.\n\n3. **Extension Thinking (optional, 5 minutes):**\n   - \"What happens after rocks are weathered and broken into tiny pieces? Where do those pieces go?\"\n   - \"Could weathered rock pieces become soil? Let's think about that...\"\n   - Connect to landform changes over time (preview of 4-ESS1-1).\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Guide observations with questions, not answers.\n- Challenge students: \"Why would a shady spot have more moss than a sunny spot?\"\n- Facilitate discussion about variables affecting weathering rate (moisture, temperature, sunlight, protection from wind).\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students apply weathering concepts to real outdoor environments.\n- Students make evidence-based predictions about weathering rates.\n- Students understand that environment affects how fast rocks break down.\n- Students recognize patterns: shaded and moist areas support more lichen/moss and show more weathering.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of weathering, erosion, and the role of organisms in rock breakdown.\n\n**Formative Assessment (Throughout Lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Can students identify and describe evidence of weathering?\n- Observation during Elaborate: Can students predict weathering rates based on environmental factors?\n- Participation in discussions: Do students use vocabulary correctly?\n\n**Exit Ticket / Summative Assessment:**\n\nProvide each student with an exit ticket (can be digital or paper). Students complete all three items:\n\n**Item 1 – Vocabulary Application:**\n\"Look at this picture of a rock. Circle the lichen. Box the moss. Draw an arrow pointing to where weathering is happening.\"\n(Provide a simple diagram or photo of a lichen/moss-covered rock.)\n\n**Item 2 – Explanation (Write or draw):**\n\"Explain: How can tiny living things like lichen slowly change a big rock? Use the word 'weathering' in your answer.\"\n\n**Item 3 – Real-World Connection:**\n\"If a rock stays in a wet, shady forest for 50 years, what will probably happen to it? Why?\"\n\n**Acceptable Responses (Success Criteria):**\n\n- ✓ Student correctly identifies lichen and moss in the image.\n- ✓ Student explains that weathering is the slow breakdown of rock, mentioning lichen/moss or moisture.\n- ✓ Student predicts that a rock in a wet, shady place will weather faster because of moisture and organisms.\n- ✓ Student uses at least 2 of the 5 vocabulary terms correctly (weathering, lichen, moss, erosion, or erosion).\n\n**How to Determine if Students Met Learning Objectives:**\n\n| Learning Objective | Evidence to Look For |\n|---|---|\n| Observe and describe weathering evidence | Students accurately sketch/identify cracks, lichen, moss, color patterns in Explore phase |\n| Explain living things' role in weathering | Exit ticket Item 2 shows understanding that organisms break down rocks |\n| Predict weathering in different environments | Elaborate phase outdoor observations show reasoning based on moisture/light |\n| Design and test weathering factors | Explore phase Station 3 shows hypothesis and water test results |\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (For Struggling Learners)\n\n1. **Vocabulary Anchors:** Provide illustrated vocabulary cards with pictures of lichen and moss. Allow students to reference these during all activities. Use a word wall with images.\n\n2. **Guided Observation:** Pair struggling students with a stronger reader/observer. Provide a structured observation sheet with sentence starters:\n   - \"I see __________ on the rock.\"\n   - \"The smooth part is __________ because __________.\"\n   - \"This rock looks old because __________.\"\n\n3. **Simplified Exit Ticket:** Offer a modified version with image matching instead of written explanation:\n   - \"Which picture shows weathering?\" (Multiple choice with images)\n   - \"Point to the lichen\" (Identification only)\n   - \"Does lichen help break down rocks? Circle YES or NO\"\n\n### Challenge (For Advanced Learners)\n\n1. **Deeper Investigation – Predicting Timescales:** Have advanced students research or hypothesize: \"How long does it take for lichen to break a rock into soil?\" Have them design an experiment that could track this over weeks or months (photograph rocks weekly, measure growth with ruler, etc.).\n\n2. **Connection to Landforms:** Challenge students to connect weathering to landscape formation: \"If weathering happens everywhere in a forest, how might mountains or hillsides change over millions of years? Sketch and explain.\" (Bridges to 4-ESS1-1.)\n\n3. **Variable Testing:** Advanced students design their own experiment to test whether weathering happens faster in cold vs. warm conditions, or acidic vs. neutral environments. Provide materials and guide the scientific method.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Weathering Over Time – Time-Lapse Photography Project:**\n   Students place chalk (a rock-like material) or plaster of paris molds in different outdoor locations (sunny, shady, wet, dry). Take photographs weekly for 6-8 weeks. Create a time-lapse video or photo series showing weathering and lichen/moss growth. Display as a class gallery walk with written explanations of weathering rates in each location.\n\n2. **Soil Formation Investigation:**\n   Explore the idea that weathered rocks become soil. Collect weathered rock pieces and compare them to soil samples under hand lenses. Discuss: \"Could this broken-down rock become part of the soil in our schoolyard? What would it need to become complete soil?\" Research what else is in soil (organic matter, decomposers, etc.).\n\n3. **Local Geology Walk and Mapping:**\n   Take students on a neighborhood walk (with parent chaperones if needed) to identify rocks showing weathering patterns. Mark locations on a school map or create a weathering \"hotspot\" map of the playground or nearby park. Document with photos and written descriptions. Present findings to another class or create a poster exhibit.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\n- **Advance Prep:** Collect rock samples 1-2 weeks before the lesson. Look for rocks with visible lichen and moss, and rocks from different habitats. If fresh samples are unavailable, high-quality photographs of lichen-covered and moss-covered rocks work well.\n- **Safety:** Ensure students handle rocks carefully and don't throw them. Spray bottles should be used only over designated areas. Supervise hand lens use near eyes.\n- **Vocabulary Reinforcement:** Repeat key terms throughout the lesson and create an anchor chart students reference repeatedly. Use the photograph as a reference point: \"See? This is weathering happening right now.\"\n- **Cultural Connection:** Discuss how Indigenous peoples used rocks in tools and buildings, and how weathering shapes landscapes over generations. This connects to deep-time thinking.\n- **Assessment Flexibility:** Exit tickets can be illustrated by students who struggle with writing. Accept drawings and brief verbal explanations recorded by the teacher or an aide.",
