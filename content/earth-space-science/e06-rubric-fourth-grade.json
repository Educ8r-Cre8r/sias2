        "exceeds": "Student explains that soil contracts unevenly as it dries, or that cracks follow paths of least resistance, and may note that the irregular pattern distributes stress, showing understanding of soil behavior during drying.",
        "meets": "Student explains that uneven drying or uneven soil composition causes cracks to form in different directions, creating the puzzle-like pattern rather than straight lines.",
