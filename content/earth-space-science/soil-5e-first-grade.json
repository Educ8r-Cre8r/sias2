This lesson adapts the soil photograph to build foundational Earth and Space Science understanding about Earth's materials and how they support life—essential scaffolding for future grade-level standards on weathering, erosion, and natural resources.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to:\n\n1. **Observe and describe what soil contains** (rocks, bits of plants, pieces of leaves)\n2. **Explain that plants need soil to grow** and that soil is found on Earth\n3. **Sort and classify materials found in soil** by size and type\n4. **Communicate findings about soil** using pictures, words, and simple sentences\n\n---\n\n## 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about soil by exploring the photograph and activating prior knowledge about what grows in dirt.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Large color printout of the soil photograph (or digital display via projector/smartboard)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student journals or paper\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** large enough for all students to see. Ask them to sit in a circle or gathering area where everyone has a clear view.\n\n2. **Pose an opening wonder:**\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Look very carefully at all the different things!\"\n   - Allow 30-45 seconds of silent looking before taking responses.\n\n3. **Ask discovery questions (one at a time, allowing think-time):**\n   - \"What color is the soil? Why do you think it has different shades of brown and black?\"\n   - \"What is growing on top of the dirt? What do you think is under the dirt that we can't see?\"\n   - \"Do you think dirt is just one thing, or is it made of lots of different pieces? What might be mixed together in there?\"\n   - \"Why do you think plants need this dirt to grow? What does the plant get from soil?\"\n\n4. **Prediction prompt:**\n   - \"If we could look very, very closely at a handful of soil—like using a magnifying glass—what do you think we might find? Let's make some guesses!\"\n   - Record student predictions on chart paper. Don't correct; validate all ideas.\n\n**Transition:**\n\"Great questions and ideas! Today, we're going to become soil scientists and investigate what's really in dirt to see if your guesses were right!\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate soil directly through sensory exploration and sorting, discovering the multiple materials that compose soil.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 3-4 students):**\n- Small cups or containers with real soil collected from a garden or outdoor area (about ½ cup per group)\n- Hand magnifying glasses (at least 1 per group; 2 is ideal)\n- White paper plates or shallow trays (for spreading soil)\n- Plastic tweezers or popsicle sticks\n- Small containers or cups for sorting (3-4 per group, labeled with pictures: \"Rocks,\" \"Plant Pieces,\" \"Tiny Bits\")\n- Paper towels for cleanup\n- Student observation sheets (with simple line drawings of soil components to circle or check)\n- Hand sanitizer or access to hand washing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Distribute soil and materials to each group.** Explain that soil is Earth's dirt—it's natural and okay to touch.\n\n2. **Guided exploration (10 minutes):**\n   - Direct: \"Spread your soil out on the white plate. Look at it carefully. Do you see different colors? Different sizes of pieces?\"\n   - Provide time for sensory exploration: \"Use your fingers to feel the soil. Is it wet or dry? Does it feel bumpy or smooth?\"\n   - Demonstrate: \"Use the magnifying glass to look very closely. What tiny things can you see?\"\n   - Teacher circulates, asking: \"What do you notice?\" and \"Can you find a piece of rock?\" \"Do you see any plant pieces?\"\n\n3. **Sorting investigation (10 minutes):**\n   - Introduce the sorting task: \"Let's separate our soil into groups. Use tweezers to pick out the big rocks and put them here. Find pieces of leaves, sticks, or dead plants—put those here. Leave the tiniest pieces in this pile.\"\n   - Students work in groups to sort materials into labeled containers.\n   - Teacher role: Facilitate without answering directly. Ask prompts: \"Where do you think this piece goes? Why?\"\n\n4. **Documentation:**\n   - Students draw or circle pictures on observation sheets showing what they found (rocks, plant pieces, tiny bits, roots).\n   - Teacher or aide scribe simple student observations: \"We found rocks.\" \"There were dead leaves.\" \"The soil felt wet.\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students discover that soil contains multiple materials (rocks, plant pieces, small particles).\n- Students observe that soil is not uniform; it has layers and variety.\n- Students recognize that plants (visible roots in the photo) are connected to soil.\n\n---\n\n### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Formalize learning with vocabulary and connect observations back to the photograph and Earth's materials.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper with vocabulary words and pictures\n- The soil photograph (displayed again)\n- Real soil samples in a clear container or on a demonstrator tray\n- Picture cards showing soil components (rocks, decomposed leaves, roots, worms, etc.)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group share-out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask each group: \"What did you find in your soil? Show us one discovery.\"\n   - Record findings on a class chart: \"What We Found in Soil.\"\n   - Celebrate observations: \"Great detectives!\"\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary (8 minutes):**\n   - Display vocabulary on chart paper with simple illustrations:\n\n     - **Soil:** The dark, crumbly mixture of rocks, minerals, and dead plants that covers much of Earth's land. Plants grow in soil.\n     - **Rocks:** Hard, solid pieces of Earth found in soil.\n     - **Roots:** The parts of plants that grow underground in soil and help the plant drink water and stay strong.\n     - **Decomposed:** When dead plants and leaves break down into tiny pieces and become part of soil.\n     - **Minerals:** Tiny, hard natural pieces that come from rocks and are found in soil.\n\n3. **Connect back to the photograph (5 minutes):**\n   - Point to the soil layers in the photograph: \"See all these different colors? That's because soil has rocks, and bits of plants that have broken down, and other materials mixed together.\"\n   - Point to the green plants at the top: \"These plants are growing in soil. Their roots go down into the soil to get water and nutrients they need to grow.\"\n   - Compare: \"Just like what we found in our soil cups, this photograph shows us rocks, plant pieces, and all the materials together.\"\n\n4. **Check for understanding:**\n   - Ask students individually or as a group:\n     - \"What is soil made of?\" (Accept: rocks, bits of plants, small pieces, minerals)\n     - \"Why do plants need soil?\" (Accept: to grow, to get water, to stay in the ground)\n     - \"Where does soil come from?\" (Accept: Earth, the ground, made from broken rocks and dead plants)\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n- **Soil:** Dark, crumbly mixture of rocks, minerals, and dead plants that plants grow in.\n- **Rocks:** Hard, solid pieces found in soil.\n- **Roots:** Underground parts of plants that drink water from soil.\n- **Decomposed:** Broken down into tiny pieces (dead plants).\n- **Minerals:** Tiny hard pieces from rocks in soil.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students use new vocabulary to describe soil.\n- Students can explain that soil is made of rocks, minerals, and decomposed plant material.\n- Students understand that plants need soil to grow.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Apply soil concepts to a new context—planting seeds—and observe the relationship between soil and plant growth.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Small pots or clear cups (1 per student or pair)\n- Potting soil or garden soil\n- Bean seeds or fast-growing seeds (sunflower, marigold, or pinto beans)\n- Water in spray bottles\n- Labels and markers\n- Optional: Clear plastic cups so students can observe roots growing\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Introduce the planting investigation:**\n   - \"We learned that plants need soil to grow. Let's test this! We're going to plant seeds in soil and watch what happens.\"\n\n2. **Guided planting (10 minutes):**\n   - Students fill their pots 3/4 full with potting soil.\n   - Make a small hole (about 1 inch deep) with a finger or stick.\n   - Plant a bean seed in the hole.\n   - Cover gently with soil.\n   - Spray lightly with water.\n   - Label with their name and the date.\n\n3. **Observation prompt:**\n   - \"The roots of your plant will grow down into the soil. The shoots will grow up toward the sun. In the coming weeks, we'll watch and see what happens. What do you think will grow?\"\n\n4. **Optional extension (for clear cups):**\n   - If using clear cups, students can see roots growing in the soil over time.\n   - Take photos to document growth week by week.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Provide clear, simple directions.\n- Help students handle seeds gently.\n- Ask: \"What does the seed need to grow?\" (water, soil, light).\n- Establish watering schedule and assign student \"soil scientists\" to care for plants.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students plant seeds in soil and predict growth.\n- Students understand that soil provides a place for plants to grow and get nutrients.\n- Over time (next 2-3 weeks), students observe roots and shoots emerging, confirming soil's role in plant growth.\n\n---\n\n### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of soil composition, soil's role in plant growth, and vocabulary.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n   - **Observation during Explore:** Circulate and listen to student language. Do they identify multiple materials in soil? Do they notice variety?\n   - **Questioning during Explain:** Listen to responses to: \"What is soil made of?\" and \"Why do plants need soil?\" Record answers (correct, partially correct, or not yet correct).\n   - **Drawings during Explore:** Review student observation sheets. Can they identify rocks, plant pieces, and soil components?\n\n2. **Exit Ticket (end of Session 1 or 2, 5 minutes):**\n   - Students answer 2-3 questions (verbally or with picture responses):\n     - **Question 1:** \"Show me two things you found in soil. What were they?\" (Picture circle or drawing + 1-2 words)\n     - **Question 2:** \"Why do plants need soil?\" (Offer sentence frame: \"Plants need soil because ___.\")\n     - **Question 3:** \"What is soil made of?\" (Students list or draw: rocks, plant pieces, minerals)\n\n3. **Success Criteria for Understanding:**\n   - ✓ Students identify at least 2 materials found in soil (rocks, plant pieces, minerals, water, air).\n   - ✓ Students can explain that plants grow in soil and need it to survive.\n   - ✓ Students use vocabulary: soil, rocks, roots, decomposed, minerals (using words correctly in sentences or responses).\n   - ✓ Students observe and document findings from hands-on investigation.\n\n4. **Summative Assessment Option (end of unit, after planting observation):**\n   - **Performance task:** \"Draw the life cycle of a plant growing in soil. Label: seed, soil, roots, plant, sun. Write or tell me why soil is important.\"\n   - **Success criteria:** Students show seed in soil, roots growing down, plant growing up; identify soil as necessary for growth.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that soil contains multiple materials.\n- Students explain soil's role in supporting plant growth.\n- Students use grade-appropriate vocabulary to describe observations.\n\n---\n\n## Differentiation\n\n### Support (for students who need scaffolding):\n\n1. **Simplified sorting:** Instead of three categories, use two: \"Big Pieces\" and \"Tiny Pieces.\" Reduce cognitive load and focus on texture/size differences.\n\n2. **Magnified observation:** Pair students with a buddy or provide 1:1 teacher support during the Explore phase. Use picture cards to label observations rather than requiring students to write or draw independently.\n\n3. **Vocabulary support:** Pre-teach key words with picture cards during a mini-lesson before the main activity. Use consistent visual supports (photographs, real objects) alongside oral language.\n\n4. **Sensory-friendly option:** Some students may be hesitant about touching soil. Offer gloves, or allow them to observe and sort using tweezers/tools rather than hands. Validate all participation styles.\n\n### Challenge (for advanced learners):\n\n1. **Hypothesis and prediction:** Ask: \"Do you think different soils have different things in them? Why? How could we find out?\" Students can compare potting soil, garden soil, and sand or clay, predicting differences and testing.\n\n2. **Decomposition investigation:** Introduce the concept that soil comes from broken-down rocks and dead plants. Ask: \"How does a leaf become part of soil?\" Facilitate a decomposition observation over weeks (leaf in water, leaf in soil, leaf in air) to build understanding of weathering and decomposition.\n\n3. **Ecosystem connections:** Extend to soil organisms: \"What animals live in soil?\" Show pictures of earthworms, beetles, and microbes. Discuss their roles: \"Worms and bugs help break down dead plants. That's how soil is made!\" Connect to food chains and habitats.\n\n---\n\n## Extension Activities\n\n1. **Soil Profile in a Jar:**\n   - Students layer different soil materials (rocks, sand, soil, decomposed leaves) in a clear jar to create a model of soil layers. Observe and discuss why different materials are in different places. (Connects to soil composition and weathering.)\n\n2. **Earthworm Habitat (Vermicomposting Introduction):**\n   - Create a transparent container with layers of soil, sand, and leaves. Add earthworms (if available through a supplier or local garden). Observe over 2-4 weeks as worms tunnel and create pathways, breaking down materials. Discuss: \"How do worms help make soil?\"\n\n3. **Rock Breakdown Investigation:**\n   - Challenge: \"Do you think rocks ever change?\" Provide rocks, water, sand, and cups. Have students shake a rock in water with sand for 1 minute, then observe for cracks or sand creation. Discuss: \"Rocks break into smaller pieces. That's how soil is made!\" (Introduces weathering concept for future lessons.)\n\n4. **Community Soil Survey:**\n   - Take the class on a soil hunt around the school grounds. Collect different soil samples from the playground, garden, under trees, and near buildings. Compare colors, textures, and contents. Discuss: \"Why is soil different in different places?\" (Connects to local Earth materials.)\n\n5. **Life in Soil Poster:**\n   - Create a classroom poster showing soil organisms (earthworms, beetles, ants, plant roots, fungi) and their roles. Students draw and label \"Who Lives in Soil\" and present one organism's job.\n\n---\n\n## Teacher Notes & Tips\n\n- **Soil sourcing:** Collect clean garden soil 1-2 days before the lesson. Avoid soils with potential contaminants. If outdoor collection isn't possible, purchase potting soil from a garden center.\n- **Hygiene:** Have hand sanitizer available. Emphasize hand washing after the activity, especially before eating.\n- **Safety:** Ensure students don't put soil in mouths. Supervise magnifying glass use to prevent eye damage.\n- **Photo documentation:** Take photos of student work and plant growth over time to create a visual record of learning.\n- **Connection to daily life:** Frequently reference the lesson in outdoor play (\"Look—we're playing in soil!\") and meal times (\"Plants grow in soil and become the food we eat!\").\n\n---\n\nThis lesson makes soil—visible, tangible, and found underfoot—a real subject of scientific inquiry for First Graders, building the foundation for deeper Earth and Space Science learning in future grades.",
