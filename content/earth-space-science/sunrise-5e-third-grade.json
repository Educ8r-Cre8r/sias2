ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student interest in weather observation and activate prior knowledge about seasonal changes by exploring the sunrise photograph.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Printed copy or digital display of the sunrise photograph\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Student journals or observation sheets\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** on a large screen or printed format where all students can see clearly. Do not explain what it shows yet.\n\n2. **Ask students to turn and talk** to a partner about what they notice:\n   - \"What colors do you see in the sky? Where are they located?\"\n   - \"What time of day do you think this is? How do you know?\"\n   - \"What do you see in the land below—is it green, brown, or something else?\"\n   - \"If you could feel this air right now, would it be hot, cold, or somewhere in between?\"\n\n3. **Facilitate group discussion** by having 4-5 pairs share their observations. Chart their ideas on the board without correcting them.\n\n4. **Present the wonder prompt:** \"This is a real sunrise taken during early spring. I wonder what the sunrise would look like in summer, fall, or winter? How might the sky colors, clouds, and land look different? What would that tell us about the weather in those seasons?\"\n\n5. **Transition:** \"Today we're going to become weather detectives. We'll learn how to observe and record what we see in the sky, just like real scientists do, so we can figure out patterns about weather in different seasons.\"\n\n**Transition:** Now let's explore how we can observe and collect weather information over time, just like real meteorologists.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate weather observation methods and begin collecting their own data through structured observation.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Weather Observation Data Table (teacher-prepared template with columns for: Date, Time, Temperature (if available), Cloud Type, Sky Color(s), Precipitation, and Other Observations)\n- Colored pencils or markers (red, orange, yellow, blue, gray, white)\n- Drawing paper or pre-made sky templates (8.5\" x 11\" paper with horizon line drawn)\n- Thermometer (optional, for temperature recording)\n- Student observation journals\n- Real or projected images of different cloud types (cumulus, stratus, cirrus—labeled simply as \"puffy,\" \"flat/layered,\" \"wispy\")\n- Window or outdoor access for observation\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Part A: Model Weather Observation (10 minutes)**\n\n1. Show students the cloud type chart. Explain: \"Real weather scientists watch clouds and describe them. Today we'll use simple names: **puffy clouds** (look like cotton), **flat clouds** (like a blanket across the sky), and **wispy clouds** (thin and feathery).\"\n\n2. Using the sunrise photograph, model how to observe and record:\n   - \"First, I look at the colors. I see orange, pink, and gray. I'll write or draw that.\"\n   - \"Next, I look at the clouds. I see mostly puffy and flat clouds mixed together. I'll write that.\"\n   - \"Then I think: What does this tell me? There are lots of clouds, so it might be cloudy today. There's a colorful sunrise, which sometimes means weather is changing.\"\n\n3. Fill in the Weather Observation Data Table as a class using the sunrise photo as the example.\n\n**Part B: Student Observation (10-15 minutes)**\n\n1. **Take students outside or to a window** to observe the current sky (or show them a different photograph of today's weather if outdoor access is limited).\n\n2. **Distribute the data table and observation sheets.** Each student or pair completes:\n   - Date and time\n   - Draw or describe the colors they see\n   - Identify cloud types using the simple names (\"puffy,\" \"flat,\" \"wispy\")\n   - Record temperature if available\n   - Note any precipitation or wind\n   - Write one prediction: \"Based on what I see, what do you think the weather will be like in a few hours?\"\n\n3. **Teacher circulates** and asks probing questions:\n   - \"Tell me what you're seeing. What colors are most common?\"\n   - \"Do you see puffy clouds or flat clouds today?\"\n   - \"How is this different from the sunrise photo?\"\n   - Avoid telling students what they should see; guide observation with questions.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students complete a weather observation data table with at least 4 observations recorded.\n- Students create a simple colored drawing or written description of the sky.\n- Students practice using descriptive vocabulary for weather and clouds.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect observations to seasonal weather patterns using data organization.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Weather data table filled in from Explore phase (enlarged or projected)\n- Chart paper with pre-drawn table for the seasonal weather pattern graph\n- Markers\n- Optional: 2-3 brief weather observation records from the same location during different seasons (provided by teacher as \"example data\" from a weather station website)\n- Student journals\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Group Share-Out (5 minutes):**\n   - Ask 3-4 students/pairs to share their observations: \"What did you see in the sky? What colors? What clouds?\"\n   - Record their data points on a master data table projected for all to see.\n   - Highlight patterns: \"I notice many of you saw puffy clouds. Several of you saw orange and pink colors.\"\n\n2. **Introduce Key Vocabulary with definitions (5 minutes):**\n\n   - **Weather:** The conditions of the air outside on a specific day, including temperature, clouds, wind, and precipitation.\n   - **Season:** A time of year that has typical weather patterns. The four seasons are spring, summer, fall, and winter.\n   - **Cloud:** Water droplets in the air that form visible white or gray shapes in the sky.\n   - **Pattern:** Something that happens in the same way over and over again.\n   - **Data:** Information we collect by observing and measuring.\n\n3. **Connect to the Photograph and Explore Activity (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Remember the sunrise photo at the beginning? That shows springtime weather. You can see puffy and flat clouds, and orange and pink colors at sunrise. That's typical for spring in many places.\"\n   - \"Today, we observed our own sky and collected data—just like the photo shows. We wrote down what we saw, and now we're collecting **data**.\"\n   - \"If we watch the sky every day for a month and write down what we see, we can look for **patterns**. We might notice: 'In spring, we usually see more clouds than in summer' or 'The sunrises are more colorful in fall.'\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding (5 minutes):**\n   - \"Turn to your neighbor and tell them: What is weather? Can you give me an example of weather you observed today?\"\n   - \"Show me with your hand: puffy clouds (make a bumpy motion), or flat clouds (make a flat motion). Which did you see today?\"\n   - Listen to a few student explanations; clarify misconceptions on the spot.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Weather** | What the air and sky are like on a certain day—like if it's sunny, rainy, hot, or cold. |\n| **Season** | A time of year, like spring, summer, fall, or winter, when the weather is usually a certain way. |\n| **Cloud** | Tiny water droplets floating in the air that we can see as white or gray shapes in the sky. |\n| **Pattern** | Something that happens the same way over and over again that we can predict. |\n| **Data** | Information we collect by watching and measuring things carefully. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that weather can be described and recorded systematically.\n- Students recognize that weather changes in predictable ways related to seasons.\n- Students can identify and use the vocabulary terms in context.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply and deepen understanding by organizing real data and beginning to recognize seasonal patterns.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Pre-filled weather data from the same location during four different seasons (provided by teacher; can be simplified data from a weather website or almanac—e.g., typical highs, lows, and cloud cover for March, June, September, December)\n- Large grid paper or pre-drawn bar graph template\n- Colored pencils, markers, or crayons\n- Chart paper\n- Student data tables from the Explore phase\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Option A: Seasonal Comparison Graph (for whole class or small groups)**\n\n1. **Display sample weather data** from the same place during four different times of year:\n\n   | Season | Typical Daytime Temperature | Typical Cloud Cover | Typical Precipitation |\n   |--------|---------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n   | Spring (March) | 50°F | Moderate (puffy & flat clouds) | Some rain |\n   | Summer (June) | 78°F | Light (mostly clear or wispy clouds) | Little |\n   | Fall (September) | 65°F | Moderate (puffy clouds) | Some rain |\n   | Winter (December) | 35°F | Heavy (flat, layered clouds) | Snow or rain |\n\n2. **Facilitate a discussion:**\n   - \"Look at this data from one place over a whole year. What do you notice?\"\n   - \"Which season is warmest? Which is coldest?\"\n   - \"When are there the most clouds? The fewest?\"\n   - \"When does it rain the most?\"\n\n3. **Guide students to create a simple bar graph or visual display:**\n   - Assign each season a color (spring = green, summer = yellow, fall = orange, winter = blue).\n   - Students draw bars or use colored paper strips to show temperature, cloud cover, or precipitation for each season.\n   - Label the graph: \"Weather Patterns Across the Seasons in [Location Name]\"\n\n4. **Reflection questions:**\n   - \"Why do you think summer has less cloud cover? What does that mean for sunlight?\"\n   - \"Winter has lots of clouds. How does that connect to snow and rain?\"\n   - \"If a sunrise looks like the photo we saw (colorful, moderate clouds), which season might it be?\"\n\n**Option B: Student Weather Predictions (alternative/additional activity)**\n\n1. Give students the data table they completed during Explore.\n2. Ask: \"Based on the weather we observed today and what you're learning about seasons, predict: What will the weather be like tomorrow? Next week? What season do you think it is right now?\"\n3. Students write or draw their prediction and explain their reasoning.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Facilitate discussion without providing all answers; ask guiding questions.\n- Help students organize data into a readable graph format.\n- Encourage students to look for patterns: \"What do you notice happens most often in spring? What about in winter?\"\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students create a visual representation (graph, chart, or drawing) showing how weather changes across seasons.\n- Students make logical predictions or conclusions based on data.\n- Students articulate that different seasons have typical weather patterns.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. EVALUATE\n\n**Objective:** Assess student understanding of weather observation, data recording, and seasonal patterns.\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Formative Assessment (ongoing during lesson):**\n- Observation during Explore: Can students accurately describe sky colors, cloud types, and weather conditions?\n- Questioning during Explain: Can students define \"weather,\" \"season,\" \"pattern,\" and \"data\" in their own words?\n- Graph creation during Elaborate: Do students' visual representations correctly show data and communicate seasonal differences?\n\n**Exit Ticket (Summative Assessment):**\n\nProvide each student with an index card or exit ticket form with the following prompts:\n\n1. **Look at the sunrise photo again.** Draw or write: What season do you think this photo was taken in? What clues helped you decide? (Accept spring or fall with reasonable observations like \"puffy clouds,\" \"colorful sky,\" \"green trees,\" or \"moderate temperature.\")\n\n2. **Describe the weather today** in 2-3 sentences. Use at least two of these words: weather, clouds, temperature, observation, data.\n\n3. **True or False:** All places on Earth have the same weather and seasons. Explain your answer in 1-2 sentences.\n\n**Success Criteria for Student Understanding:**\n\n- ✓ **Proficient:** Student accurately describes weather observations using vocabulary; recognizes that weather varies by season; can identify elements in the photograph that indicate a specific season; understands that data can be organized to show patterns.\n\n- ✓ **Developing:** Student describes some weather observations; begins to connect observations to seasons; needs support in recognizing patterns in data.\n\n- ✓ **Beginning:** Student names weather elements but may lack precise observations; does not yet connect weather to seasons; needs significant support in data organization and pattern recognition.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students demonstrate understanding that weather can be systematically observed and recorded.\n- Students show emerging understanding that weather patterns vary across seasons.\n- Students begin to recognize that different regions may have different weather patterns (foundational for 3-ESS2-2).\n\n---\n\n### Differentiation\n\n**Support (for struggling learners):**\n\n1. **Reduce vocabulary load:** Provide a visual anchor chart with labeled pictures (puffy clouds, flat clouds, wispy clouds, rain, snow, sun) that students can point to or attach to their data table instead of writing labels. Use only 2-3 weather descriptors instead of five.\n\n2. **Pair observation with a peer:** Assign students to work with a stronger observer during the Explore phase. The support student does the drawing while the buddy narrates observations; roles can reverse for confidence-building.\n\n3. **Simplified data table:** Provide a table with only three columns (Date, Colors I See, Clouds I See) and allow drawings instead of words. Pre-fill some information to reduce cognitive load.\n\n**Challenge (for advanced learners):**\n\n1. **Multi-week data collection:** Have students maintain a personal weather journal for 4 weeks, recording observations daily and creating a line graph or chart showing changes over time. Challenge them to predict the next day's weather based on observed patterns and check their predictions.\n\n2. **Regional climate comparison:** Provide students with weather data from two different regions (e.g., desert and forest, or northern and southern states) and ask them to compare seasonal weather patterns. Guide them to hypothesize why climates are different (latitude, geography, water bodies).\n\n3. **Sunrise/sunset observation project:** Challenge students to observe and photograph or draw sunrise or sunset skies over one week and identify the colors, cloud types, and patterns. Have them present findings to the class and explain what the observations tell us about weather and seasons.\n\n---\n\n### Extension Activities\n\n1. **\"Weather Around the World\" Research Poster:** Students research typical weather and seasonal patterns in a different region or country (e.g., tropical rainforest, desert, arctic). They create a poster or presentation comparing that region's climate to their local area, using data tables, pictures, and written descriptions. Connects to 3-ESS2-2.\n\n2. **Sunrise/Sunset Time Log:** Have students track the time of sunrise and sunset over one month using a calendar or chart. They graph how these times change and discuss what that tells us about seasons and Earth's movement. Connects to seasonal patterns and provides cross-curricular connection to time.\n\n3. **Design a \"Weather Station\" for Your Classroom:** Challenge students to design a simple weather observation station using classroom materials (homemade wind socks from plastic bags, rain gauges from cups, thermometers). They establish a routine to record data daily and display results on a large classroom graph. Encourages ongoing data collection and pattern recognition.",
