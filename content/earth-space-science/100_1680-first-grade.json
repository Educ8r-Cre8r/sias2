Everything looks white and cold because it is winter.\n\n## 🔬 Scientific Phenomena\n\nThe anchoring phenomenon here is **precipitation in the form of snow and its accumulation on surfaces**. Snow forms when water vapor in clouds freezes into ice crystals at temperatures below 32°F (0°C). These crystals fall to Earth and accumulate on objects like the wagon, trees, and ground. The snow creates insulation, which is why it builds up in thick layers on surfaces rather than immediately melting.\n\n## 📚 Core Science Concepts\n\n1. **States of Matter**: Water exists in three forms - liquid (rain), solid (snow/ice), and gas (water vapor in clouds)\n\n2. **Weather Patterns**: Snow is a type of precipitation that occurs when air temperature is below freezing\n\n3. **Seasonal Changes**: Winter brings colder temperatures that allow snow to form and stay on the ground\n\n4. **Insulation Properties**: Snow acts as a blanket that can protect plants and objects underneath from even colder air temperatures\n\n<pedagogical-tip>Use concrete objects in your classroom (ice cubes, water, steam from hot water) to help first graders physically observe the three states of matter before discussing snow formation.</pedagogical-tip>\n\n<udl-suggestions>Provide multiple ways for students to express their understanding by having them draw, act out, or use body movements to show how water changes from liquid to solid when it gets cold enough.</udl-suggestions>\n\n## 🔍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts\n\n1. **Zoom In:** Each snowflake is made of tiny ice crystals that form unique patterns. Under a magnifying glass, students could see that no two snowflakes look exactly the same because they form under slightly different conditions in the clouds.\n\n2. **Zoom Out:** This snowy scene is part of the larger water cycle where water evaporates from oceans and lakes, forms clouds, and falls back down as precipitation (rain or snow) depending on temperature.\n\n## 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions\n\n1. **Misconception:** \"Snow is not made of water\"\n   **Clarification:** Snow is frozen water that forms when water vapor in clouds gets cold enough to freeze into ice crystals.\n\n2. **Misconception:** \"It has to be very, very cold for snow\"\n   **Clarification:** Snow can fall when air temperature is at or below 32°F (0°C), which is the same temperature where water freezes.\n\n3. **Misconception:** \"Snow and ice are different things\"\n   **Clarification:** Snow is made of ice crystals, so snow IS a form of ice, just in smaller crystal pieces.\n\n## 🎓 NGSS Connections\n\n- **Performance Expectation:** K-ESS2-1: Use and share observations of local weather conditions to describe patterns over time\n- **Disciplinary Core Idea:** [[NGSS:DCI:K-ESS2.D]] - Weather and Climate\n- **Crosscutting Concept:** [[NGSS:CCC:Patterns]]\n\n## 💬 Discussion Questions\n\n1. What do you think happened to make everything in this picture white? (Bloom's: Analyze | DOK: 2)\n\n2. How do you think the snow got on top of the wagon? (Bloom's: Apply | DOK: 2)\n\n3. What would happen to this snow if the temperature got warmer? (Bloom's: Evaluate | DOK: 3)\n\n4. What other things have you seen that are covered with snow? (Bloom's: Remember | DOK: 1)\n\n## 📖 Science Vocabulary\n\n* **Snow:** Frozen water that falls from clouds as white flakes\n* **Temperature:** How hot or cold something is\n* **Freezing:** When water gets cold enough to turn into ice\n* **Precipitation:** Water that falls from the sky as rain, snow, or hail\n* **Winter:** The coldest season of the year when snow often falls\n* **Accumulation:** When snow piles up and gets deeper over time\n\n## 📚 External Resources\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- The Snowy Day by Ezra Jack Keats\n- Snow is Falling by Franklyn M.
