Explain how wind turbines convert wind energy into electrical energy that communities can use\n2. Describe at least two advantages of using wind energy compared to other energy sources\n3. Identify and communicate ways that wind energy helps protect Earth's resources and environment\n4. Develop a working model that demonstrates how wind can be used to generate motion and energy\n\n---\n\n### 5E Lesson Sequence\n\n#### 1. ENGAGE (10-15 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Capture student curiosity about wind turbines and activate prior knowledge about energy and wind.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Photograph of wind turbines (displayed on projector or printed large-scale)\n- Chart paper and markers\n- Optional: short video clip (30 seconds) of wind turbines spinning (search \"wind turbine spinning\")\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Display the photograph** prominently where all students can see it clearly. Ask students to observe silently for 10 seconds, noticing details.\n\n2. **Ask these discussion questions** (allow 1-2 minutes for each):\n   - \"What do you see in this picture? Describe the machines and their parts.\"\n   - \"What do you think these giant structures do? Why would someone build something this tall?\"\n   - \"Where do you think the energy comes from to make these structures move?\"\n   - \"Have you ever seen something like this before? Where?\"\n\n3. **Activate prior knowledge:**\n   - \"Raise your hand if you've felt wind blow. What does wind feel like? What can wind do?\"\n   - \"Our homes and schools need energy to work. Where do you think that energy comes from right now?\"\n\n4. **Wonder prompt:** \"I wonder... could we use wind to power our school or home instead of using coal or gas? What would that look like?\"\n\n5. **Chart student ideas** on large paper under two columns: \"What we think wind turbines do\" and \"Questions we have.\" Save this for the Explain phase.\n\n**Transition:** \"Today, we're going to build our own mini wind turbines and discover how wind can be transformed into energy that helps protect our planet.\"\n\n---\n\n#### 2. EXPLORE (20-25 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students investigate how wind can cause motion and generate energy through hands-on model building.\n\n**Materials (per small group of 2-3 students):**\n- 1 plastic cup (8-12 oz)\n- 4-6 small paper or foam cups (3-4 oz, cut in half to create blade shapes)\n- 1 sharpened pencil or wooden dowel rod (6-8 inches)\n- Small paper clip or metal washer\n- Tape (masking or electrical)\n- Scissors\n- 1 ruler\n- 1 handheld fan or access to a location with natural wind\n- Optional: lightweight string and a small weight (washer) to measure lifting capability\n- Recording sheet (provided below)\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Step-by-step student directions:**\n\n1. **Build the turbine base:**\n   - Tape the pencil/dowel vertically into the center of the upright plastic cup so it stands tall and stable. The pencil should extend 4-5 inches above the cup rim.\n\n2. **Create the blades:**\n   - Take your 4 small cup halves. Tape them to the top of the pencil so they radiate outward like a propeller, angling each one slightly (about 30-45 degrees) so wind will catch them.\n   - Make sure the blades are balanced—they should be evenly spaced around the pencil.\n\n3. **Test your design:**\n   - Hold your turbine near a handheld fan set to low speed, or take it to an open window or outdoor location with wind.\n   - Observe: Do the blades spin? How fast? Can you feel wind resistance?\n   - Adjust blade angles if the turbine doesn't spin smoothly.\n\n4. **Challenge activity (optional):**\n   - Attach a small string with a washer to the pencil shaft below the blades.\n   - Run the fan and observe: Can your turbine lift the weight as it spins?\n   - Record how high the weight lifts: ____ inches.\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Record observations on your sheet:\n     * \"My turbine started spinning when ___________\"\n     * \"The faster the wind, the _____________ the blades spun\"\n     * \"When my turbine spun, I could see it had energy to ___________\"\n     * \"Draw a picture of your turbine and label the parts\"\n\n**How the activity connects to the photograph:**\nStudents see that the large turbine blades in the photo work the same way their model does—wind pushes the blades, making them spin. Real turbines have motors attached to capture that spinning motion and convert it to electricity.\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Circulate among groups, asking guiding questions: \"What happens when you angle the blades differently?\" \"How could you make it spin faster?\" \"What do you think happens to all that spinning energy?\"\n- Do NOT tell students how turbines work; let them discover through experimentation.\n- If a group's turbine isn't spinning, guide them to think about blade angle and position, not design failure.\n- Provide positive feedback on observations, not just results.\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students produce a functioning spinning model\n- Students observe that wind creates motion\n- Students record that faster wind = faster spinning\n- Students begin to wonder about what happens to that motion in real turbines\n\n---\n\n#### 3. EXPLAIN (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Introduce formal vocabulary and connect exploration to real-world wind energy systems and environmental protection.\n\n**Materials:**\n- Chart paper from Engage phase\n- Large photograph of wind turbines (displayed again)\n- Picture cards or diagrams showing: wind turbines, fossil fuel power plants, power lines, homes\n- Whiteboard or chart paper for vocabulary\n- Optional: short animation clip (1-2 minutes) showing how a turbine converts wind to electricity\n\n**Activity:**\n\n1. **Share observations from Explore:**\n   - Ask 2-3 groups to share what they discovered: \"What made your turbine spin?\" \"How did you know it had energy?\"\n   - Chart key findings on paper (visible wind → spinning motion → potential for energy)\n\n2. **Introduce key vocabulary** with student-friendly definitions:\n\n   - **Wind energy:** Energy that comes from moving air in the atmosphere. Wind is caused by the sun unevenly heating Earth's surface (connecting to atmosphere interaction). We can use machines to catch this energy.\n   \n   - **Renewable energy:** Energy that comes from sources that don't run out and can be used over and over again—like wind, sun, and water. Unlike coal or oil, we can use wind forever.\n   \n   - **Turbine:** A machine with blades that spin when wind pushes them. The spinning motion can be used to create electricity.\n   \n   - **Generator:** A machine (inside the turbine tower) that changes the spinning motion into electrical energy that powers homes and businesses.\n   \n   - **Sustainable:** Using resources in a way that doesn't harm the environment or use them up, so future people can use them too.\n\n3. **Connect to real-world impact:**\n   - Display the photograph again. Ask: \"In this picture, there are several turbines. Why would a community build many of them together?\"\n   - Explain: \"One turbine can make electricity for hundreds of homes. Wind farms (groups of turbines) can power entire communities. Unlike power plants that burn coal and create pollution, wind turbines make clean energy.\"\n   \n4. **Show the energy comparison:**\n   - Draw or display a simple T-chart:\n     - **Fossil Fuel Power Plants:** Use coal/gas → create pollution → energy runs out → costs money\n     - **Wind Turbines:** Use wind → no pollution → renewable → helps communities be sustainable\n\n5. **Check for understanding:**\n   - \"Turn and talk to a partner: If you were building a new power source for your city, why might you choose wind turbines instead of a coal plant?\"\n   - Call on 2-3 pairs to share. Listen for concepts: clean, renewable, doesn't pollute, helps the environment.\n\n**Vocabulary:**\n\n| Term | Student-Friendly Definition |\n|------|---------------------------|\n| **Wind energy** | Energy that comes from moving air. The sun heats Earth unevenly, which causes wind to form. |\n| **Renewable energy** | Energy from sources that never run out and can be used again and again (like wind, sun, and water). |\n| **Turbine** | A machine with blades that spin when wind pushes them. |\n| **Generator** | A machine inside the turbine that turns the spinning motion into electricity. |\n| **Sustainable** | Using resources in a way that protects Earth and doesn't use them up, so we have them for the future. |\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students understand that turbines convert wind motion into electrical energy\n- Students can explain at least one reason why wind energy is better for the environment than fossil fuels\n- Students recognize wind turbines as an example of how communities protect Earth's resources\n- Students use new vocabulary appropriately in sentences\n\n---\n\n#### 4. ELABORATE (15-20 minutes)\n\n**Objective:** Students apply their understanding by investigating factors that affect wind turbine efficiency and designing improvements.\n\n**Materials (per small group):**\n- Each group's turbine from Explore phase\n- Handheld fan or access to wind location\n- Ruler or measuring tape\n- Protractor (or angle template for marking blade angles)\n- Recording sheet: \"Improving Our Turbine Design\"\n- Optional: different blade materials (paper, foam, plastic bags, cloth) to test\n- Chart paper for results\n\n**Activity:**\n\n**Challenge: Optimize Your Turbine**\n\n1. **Pose the design question:**\n   - \"Real wind turbines are designed to spin as fast as possible in different wind speeds. Your challenge is to improve your turbine design to spin faster or more efficiently.\"\n\n2. **Students investigate one of these variables:**\n   - **Option A (Blade design):** Test different blade angles. Make three versions with blades at 25°, 40°, and 55° angles. Which angle creates the fastest spin in the same wind speed?\n   - **Option B (Number of blades):** Build turbines with 3, 4, and 5 blades. Does more blades = faster spinning? Better lifting power?\n   - **Option C (Blade material):** Test blades made from different materials (paper, foam, plastic). Which material works best?\n\n3. **Fair testing:**\n   - Keep wind speed constant (same fan setting for all tests)\n   - Change only ONE variable at a time\n   - Test each design 3 times and record results\n\n4. **Data collection:**\n   - Record observations in a table:\n     - **Design variable tested:** (blade angle/number/material)\n     - **Test 1 result:** (speed, lifting height, or observations)\n     - **Test 2 result:** \n     - **Test 3 result:** \n     - **Average result:** \n     - **Which design worked best? Why do you think that is?**\n\n5. **Real-world connection:**\n   - \"Engineers who design real wind turbines test many designs to find the most efficient. Your improvements show how engineers use science to solve problems and protect the environment by making clean energy more powerful and useful.\"\n\n**Teacher Role:**\n- Ask guiding questions: \"What do you notice about the results?\" \"Why might that blade angle work better?\" \"How could you make this even better?\"\n- Ensure fair testing by checking that only one variable changes\n- Encourage students to make predictions before testing\n- Facilitate group discussion about why some designs outperformed others\n\n**Expected Student Outcomes:**\n- Students recognize that design changes affect turbine performance\n- Students collect and organize data systematically\n- Students can explain their results (e.g., \"Steeper angles caught more wind\")\n- Students understand that engineers use testing to improve renewable energy technology\n\n---\n\n#### 5.
