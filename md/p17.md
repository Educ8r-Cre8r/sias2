\# 📸 Photo Description

This image shows a modern building with a glass facade reflecting the sky and surrounding structures. The glass panels are arranged in a grid pattern, creating a mirrored effect that distorts the view of the buildings behind it. The reflection captures the blue sky and clouds, adding depth to the composition. The building's design includes vertical lines and geometric shapes, contributing to its contemporary aesthetic.

\# 🔬 Scientific Phenomena

This image demonstrates light reflection and refraction. The glass panels reflect the surrounding environment, creating a mirrored effect due to the smooth surface of the glass. Light bounces off the glass at the same angle it hits, which is why we see clear reflections. Additionally, the thickness and material of the glass can slightly refract (bend) light, but this effect is minimal in this image.

\# 📚 Core Concepts

1\. \*\*Light Reflection\*\*: When light bounces off a surface, such as glass or a mirror.  
2\. \*\*Refraction\*\*: The bending of light as it passes through different materials, like glass.  
3\. \*\*Transparency and Opacity\*\*: How materials allow light to pass through (transparent) or block it (opaque).

\<pedagogical-tip\>  
Engage students in a hands-on activity using mirrors or reflective surfaces. Ask them to observe how their reflection changes when they move closer or farther from the surface. This helps them understand the concept of reflection and how light behaves.

\<udl-suggestions\>  
\- Use interactive simulations to show how light reflects off different surfaces.  
\- Provide tactile materials, such as polished metal or plastic, for students to explore reflections.  
\- Incorporate real-world examples, like windows or mirrors, to connect the lesson to everyday experiences.

2\. How does the glass in windows allow us to see outside while also reflecting our surroundings? (Bloom's: Evaluate) (DOK: 3\)  
3\. Why do some surfaces, like mirrors, reflect light better than others? (Bloom's: Analyze) (DOK: 2\)

\# 📖 Vocabulary

\- \*\*Reflection\*\*: The bouncing of light off a surface.  
\- \*\*Refraction\*\*: The bending of light as it passes through different materials.  
\- \*\*Transparent\*\*: Allowing light to pass through easily, like glass or water.

\# 🌡️ Extension Activities

\- Experiment with different reflective surfaces (mirrors, polished metal, etc.) and observe how they reflect light.  
\- Investigate how refraction works using a glass prism or a water tank to bend light.  
\- Explore the concept of transparency by testing different materials under light.
