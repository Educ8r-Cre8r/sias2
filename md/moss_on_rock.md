\# Third Grade Science Lesson: Weathering and Symbiosis

\#\# 📸 Photo Description

This image shows a close-up view of a rock covered in green moss. The moss appears soft and textured, with small, intricate details visible under magnification. It is growing on the surface of the rock, which has a rough texture and varies in color from light gray to reddish-brown. Some areas of the rock are exposed, while others are completely covered by the moss, creating a contrast between the green vegetation and the mineral surface.

\#\# 🔬 Scientific Phenomena

This image illustrates the process of \*\*biological weathering\*\* and \*\*symbiosis\*\*. The moss growing on the rock represents how living organisms can break down rocks over time through physical and chemical processes. Moss absorbs water and nutrients, which helps it grow and, in turn, weakens the rock by expanding its roots and releasing acids that dissolve minerals. This phenomenon is an example of how plants contribute to the weathering of rocks, shaping landscapes over long periods.

\#\# 📚 Core Science Concepts

1\. \*\*Weathering\*\*: The breaking down of rocks into smaller pieces by natural processes like wind, water, or living organisms.  
2\. \*\*Symbiosis\*\*: A close relationship between two different species where at least one benefits.  
3\. \*\*Ecosystems\*\*: Communities of living organisms interacting with their non-living environment.

\<pedagogical-tip\>  
Introduce a "Rock Erosion Experiment" where students place small rocks in containers with water and moss (or sphagnum moss as a substitute). Observe the rocks over several weeks to see how the moss affects their surface. Discuss how this process is similar to what happens in nature, but much slower.

\<udl-suggestions\>  
\- \*\*Visual Representation\*\*: Use diagrams or videos to show the process of weathering and symbiosis.  
\- \*\*Hands-on Exploration\*\*: Provide tactile experiences like examining different types of rocks and moss under a magnifying glass.  
\- \*\*Real-world Connections\*\*: Relate the concept to local landscapes or famous landmarks affected by weathering, such as the Grand Canyon.

\#\# 🎓 NGSS Connections

\- \[\[NGSS:DCI:3-ESS2.A\]\]: Weathering breaks down rocks and shapes Earth's surface over time.  
\- \[\[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect\]\]: Moss growing on a rock causes it to break down, changing its appearance and structure.  
\- \*\*Performance Expectation (PE)\*\*:  
  \- 3-ESS2-1: Represent data in tables or graphical displays to show patterns of weathering over time.

\#\# 💬 Discussion Questions

1\. How does the moss help break down the rock? (Bloom's: Analyze) (DOK: 2\)  
2\. What other living things might contribute to weathering rocks, and how? (Bloom's: Evaluate) (DOK: 3\)  
3\. Why is it important for scientists to study how rocks change over time? (Bloom's: Create) (DOK: 4\)  
4\. How does the color of the moss help it survive on the rock? (Bloom's: Apply) (DOK: 2\)

\#\# 📖 Vocabulary

\- \*\*Weathering\*\*: The process where rocks break down into smaller pieces.  
\- \*\*Symbiosis\*\*: A close relationship between two species where both benefit.  
\- \*\*Erosion\*\*: The movement of weathered material by wind, water, or ice.  
\- \*\*Minerals\*\*: Natural substances that make up rocks and have a definite chemical composition.

\#\# 🌡️ Extension Activities

\- \*\*For Students Needing Support\*\*:  
  \- Provide pre-labeled diagrams of rocks and moss to help students identify key features.  
  \- Use simpler language and sentence stems for discussions, such as "Moss grows on rocks because..."

\- \*\*For Advanced Learners\*\*:  
  \- Research how different types of lichens or mosses contribute to weathering in various climates.  
  \- Investigate the role of acids produced by plants in breaking down rocks.

\#\# 🌍 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts

1\. \*\*Zoom In\*\*: At a microscopic level, observe how moss cells absorb water and nutrients from the rock surface. Discuss how root hairs and hyphae (in fungi) work together to break down minerals.  
2\. \*\*Zoom Out\*\*: Explore how weathering contributes to the formation of soil and shapes entire landscapes, such as valleys or canyons over millions of years.

\#\# 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions

1\. \*\*Misconception\*\*: Moss only grows on wet rocks.  
   \- \*\*Clarification\*\*: While moss needs moisture to grow, it can also absorb water from the air, allowing it to survive in drier conditions for short periods.

2\. \*\*Misconception\*\*: Weathering happens too slowly to be observed in a lifetime.  
   \- \*\*Clarification\*\*: Although weathering is slow, students can observe changes over weeks or months in classroom experiments using moss and rocks.

3\. \*\*Misconception\*\*: Moss harms the rock by "eating" it away.  
   \- \*\*Clarification\*\*: Moss does not eat the rock; instead, it benefits from the minerals in the rock while contributing to its breakdown through physical and chemical processes.
