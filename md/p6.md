\#\# 📸 Photo Description

This photo shows a weathered wooden surface covered with a dense collection of nails and other metal objects. The nails are of various types, including common nails, brads, and screw heads. Many of the nails appear to be rusted, showing reddish-brown and grayish textures. The metal objects are embedded in the wood, some with their heads exposed, others partially embedded. The wood itself shows visible grain and signs of weathering, such as cracks and splinters. The overall scene suggests a long-term interaction between the metal and the organic wood material.

\#\# 🔬 Scientific Phenomena

The image demonstrates the scientific phenomenon of \*\*chemical change due to corrosion\*\*. The metal nails are undergoing a chemical reaction with oxygen and water in the environment. This reaction, known as oxidation, results in the formation of iron oxide (rust). The visible changes in color and texture of the metal are evidence of this chemical transformation. The wood provides a surface that can trap moisture, creating the ideal conditions for this reaction to occur over time.

\#\# 📚 Core Concepts

1\.  \*\*Chemical Change\*\*: A process where one or more substances are transformed into different substances. In this case, iron metal reacts with oxygen and water to form rust (iron oxide), which is a different substance with different properties.  
2\.  \*\*Corrosion\*\*: A specific type of chemical change where a metal is deteriorated by a chemical reaction with its environment. This is often an oxidation reaction.  
3\.  \*\*Properties of Materials\*\*: The physical and chemical properties of a substance (like the color and texture of the nails) can change over time due to interactions with other materials or environmental factors.  
4\.  \*\*Environmental Influences\*\*: The conditions of the environment (like the presence of water and oxygen) can affect how quickly materials change. The wood's ability to absorb water contributes to the corrosion process.

\<pedagogical-tip\>  
Incorporate a hands-on investigation with "rusting" nails. Provide students with a jar of water, a nail, and a paper towel. Have them observe the nail in water over several days. Discuss changes in color and texture. To extend, have them place a second nail in a dry jar and a third in a jar with a desiccant. Compare results after a week. This makes the abstract concept of chemical change tangible and observable.

\<udl-suggestions\>  
\- \*\*Multiple Means of Representation\*\*: Show a time-lapse video of a nail rusting or use a simulation to visualize the molecular changes.  
\- \*\*Multiple Means of Engagement\*\*: Connect to students' experiences by asking them to bring in objects from home that might rust or have changed over time.  
\- \*\*Multiple Means of Expression\*\*: Have students create a "Rust Report" describing the changes they observed, including a drawing of the final state.

\#\# 🎓 Zoom In / Zoom Out Concepts

1\.  \*\*Zoom In\*\*: At the microscopic level, the iron atoms in the nail are reacting with oxygen atoms from the air and water molecules. This breaks the metallic bonds and forms new chemical bonds, creating iron oxide (Fe₂O₃). The process involves electrons being transferred from the iron atoms to the oxygen atoms.  
2\.  \*\*Zoom Out\*\*: This scene is an example of how materials interact with their environment over time. It connects to broader concepts like weathering, the natural cycle of materials, and how human-made objects (like buildings or bridges) are affected by environmental conditions. It also relates to the conservation of matter, as the iron atoms are not destroyed but are rearranged into a different compound.

\#\# 🤔 Potential Student Misconceptions

1\.  \*\*Misconception:\*\* Students might think the rust is just dirt or a coating that can be easily washed off.    
    \*\*Clarification:\*\* Rust is a new substance formed through a chemical reaction. It is not dirt and cannot be easily washed away; it is part of the nail itself.  
2\.  \*\*Misconception:\*\* Students might believe that only iron rusts.    
    \*\*Clarification:\*\* While iron is a common example, other metals like aluminum and copper also undergo corrosion, though the products are different (e.g., aluminum oxide, patina on copper).  
3\.  \*\*Misconception:\*\* Students might think the rust is only caused by water.    
    \*\*Clarification:\*\* Rust requires both water and oxygen. This is why a nail in a dry environment does not rust.

\- \[\[NGSS:DCI:5-PS1-1\]\]: Develop a model to describe that matter is made of atoms and molecules.  
\- \[\[NGSS:DCI:5-PS1-2\]\]: Measure and graph quantities to provide evidence that regardless of the changes that occur when materials are mixed, heated, cooled, or broken, the total mass is conserved.  
\- \[\[NGSS:DCI:5-PS1-3\]\]: Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties.  
\- \[\[NGSS:CCC:Energy\]\]: Matter has properties such as mass, weight, and volume. Matter can be changed by heating or cooling.  
\- \[\[NGSS:CCC:Patterns\]\]: Observe and predict changes in matter based on patterns of interaction.

\#\# 💬 Discussion Questions

1\.  What might have caused the metal objects to change color and look so different from when they were new? (Bloom's: Analyze) (DOK: 2\)  
2\.  Why do you think the wood is covered with so many different types of metal objects? (Bloom's: Evaluate) (DOK: 3\)  
3\.  How is the change happening to the nails different from a physical change, like breaking a stick? (Bloom's: Analyze) (DOK: 3\)  
4\.  Can you think of another example of a material changing because of something in its environment? (Bloom's: Apply) (DOK: 2\)
