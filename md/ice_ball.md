\#\# 📸 Photo Description

The image shows a large ice sphere placed on a blue tray. The ice appears to be clear with visible impurities or bubbles trapped inside, giving it a slightly cloudy texture. Water droplets are visible around the edges of the tray, suggesting melting. The background includes a workspace with tools like a ruler and a flashlight, indicating this may be part of an experiment or investigation.

\#\# 🔬 Scientific Phenomena

This image represents the phenomenon of \*\*melting ice\*\* and the related concept of \*\*phase change\*\*. The ice is transitioning from a solid to a liquid state due to the absorption of thermal energy (heat) from its surroundings. This process occurs because the molecules in the ice gain enough energy to break free from their fixed positions, allowing them to flow as water. The visible droplets on the tray confirm that melting has occurred.

\#\# 📚 Core Science Concepts

1\. \*\*Phase Change\*\*: The transition of matter from one state (solid, liquid, gas) to another due to changes in temperature or pressure.  
2\. \*\*Thermal Energy\*\*: The energy an object possesses due to the motion of its molecules; higher temperatures mean faster-moving molecules.  
3\. \*\*Melting\*\*: The process where a solid turns into a liquid when it absorbs heat.

\<pedagogical-tip\>  
Engage students with a hands-on activity: Provide small ice cubes and warm water in separate containers. Ask students to observe what happens over time. Introduce the concept of thermal energy by discussing why ice melts faster in warm water than in cool water. Use a thermometer to measure temperature changes and reinforce the idea that heat causes molecules to move faster.

\<udl-suggestions\>  
\- \*\*Visual Representation\*\*: Use diagrams or animations to show molecular movement during melting.  
\- \*\*Hands-on Experimentation\*\*: Allow students to touch ice cubes and warm water (safely) to experience temperature differences.  
\- \*\*Real-world Connections\*\*: Discuss real-life applications, such as how ice melts in nature or how refrigerators work.

\#\# 🎓 NGSS Connections

\- \[\[NGSS:DCI:2-PS1.A\]\]: Matter can be measured and is composed of particles too small to see.  
\- \[\[NGSS:DCI:3-PS2.B\]\]: Forces acting on an object can change its motion or cause it to accelerate.  
\- \[\[NGSS:CCC:Cause and Effect\]\]: Cause and effect relationships are routinely identified, tested, and used to explain phenomena.

\*\*Performance Expectations:\*\*  
\- 2-PS1.A: Matter of everyday objects is composed of particles too small to see.  
\- 3-PS2.B: Pushes and pulls can change the motion of an object.

\#\# 🌡️ Extension Activities

\- \*\*For Students Needing Support:\*\*  
  \- Provide pre-measured ice cubes and warm water in separate containers. Guide students through simple observations, such as noting the time it takes for ice to melt.  
\- \*\*For Advanced Learners:\*\*  
  \- Introduce variables like salt or different temperatures (e.g., room temperature vs. warm water) and ask students to predict how these will affect melting rates.
